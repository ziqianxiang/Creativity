        "comment": "This paper studies the effectiveness of self-supervised approaches by characterising how much information they can extract from a given dataset of images on a per-layer basis. Based on an empirical evaluation of RotNet, BiGAN, and DeepCluster, the authors argue that the early layers of CNNs can be effectively learned from a single image coupled with strong data augmentation. Secondly, the authors also provide some empirical evidence that supervision might still necessary to learn the deeper layers (even in the presence of millions of images for self-supervision). \nOverall, the reviews agree that the paper is well written and timely given the growing popularity of self-supervised methods. Given that most of the issues raised by the reviewers were adequately addressed in the rebuttal, I will recommend acceptance. We ask the authors to include additional experiments requested by the reviewers (they are valuable even if the conclusions are not perfectly aligned with the main message).\n",

            "review": "Update 11/21\nWith the additional experiments (testing a new image, testing fine-tuning of hand-crafted features), additions to related work, and clarifications, I am happy to raise my score to accept. Overall, I think this paper is a nice sanity check on recent self-supervision methods. In the future, I am quite curious about how these mono-image learned features would fare on more complex downstream tasks (e.g., segmentation, keypoint detection) which necessarily rely less on texture.\n\nSummary\nThis paper seeks to understand the role of the *number of training examples* in self-supervised learning with images. The usefulness of the learned features is evaluated with linear probes at each layer for either ImageNet or CiFAR image classification. Empirically, they find that a single image along with heavy data augmentation suffices for learning the first 2-3 layers of convolutional weights, while later layers improve with more self-supervised training images. The result holds for three state-of-the-art self-supervised methods, tested with two single-image training examples.\n\nIn my view, learning without labels is an important problem, and it is interesting what can be learned from a single image and simple data augmentation strategies. \n\nComments / Questions\nIt seems to me that for completeness, Table 4 should include the result of training a supervised network on top of random conv1/2 and Scattering network features, because this experiment is actually testing what we want - performance of the features when fine-tuned for a downstream task. So for example, even if a linear classifier on top of Scattering features does poorly, if downstream fine-tuning results in the same performance as another pre-training method, then Scattering is a perfectly fine approach for initial features. Could the authors please either correct this logic or provide the experiments?\nFurther, it seems that the results in Table 4 might be a bit obscured by the size of the downstream task dataset. I wonder if the learned features require fewer fully supervised images to obtain the same performance on the downstream task?\nCan the authors clarify how the neural style transfer experiment is performed? The method from Gatys et al. requires features from different layers of the feature hierarchy, including deeper layers. Are all these features taken directly from the self-supervised network or is it fine-tuned in some way?\nWhile I appreciate the computational burden of testing more images, it does feel that Image A and B are quite cherry-picked in being very visually diverse. Because of this, it seems like a precise answer to what makes a good single training image remains unknown. I wonder how feasible it is to find a proxy metric that corresponds to the performance on downstream tasks which is expensive to compute. It might be interesting to try to generate synthetic images (or modify real ones) that are good for this purpose and observe their properties.\nI disagree with the claim of practicality in the introduction (page 2, top). While training on one image does reduce the burden of number of images, the computational burden remains the same. And as mentioned above, it doesnâ€™t seem likely that *any* image would work for this method. Finally, more images are needed to learn the deeper layers for the downstream task anyway. \n\nThe paper is well-written and clear. \n",

            "review": "This paper explores self-supervised learning in the low-data regime, comparing results to self-supervised learning on larger datasets.  BiGAN, RotNet, and DeepCluster serve as the reference self-supervised methods.  It argues that early layers of a convolutional neural network can be effectively learned from a single source image, with data augmentation.  A performance gap exists for deeper layers, suggesting that larger datasets are required for self-supervised learning of useful filters in deeper network layers.\n\nI believe the primary claim of this paper is neither surprising nor novel.  The long history of successful hand-designed descriptors in computer vision, such as SIFT [Lowe, 1999] and HOG [Dalal and Triggs, 2005], suggest that one can design (with no data at all) features reminiscent of those learned in the first couple layers of a convolutional neural network (local image gradients, followed by characterization of those gradients over larger local windows).\n\nMore importantly, it is already well established that it is possible to learn, from only a few images, filter sets that resemble the early layers of filters learned by CNNs.  This paper fails to account for a vast amount of literature on modeling natural images that predates the post-AlexNet deep-learning era.\n\nFor example, see the following paper (over 5600 citations according to Google scholar):\n\n[1] Bruno A. Olshausen and David J. Field.  Emergence of simple-cell receptive field properties by learning a sparse code for natural images.  Nature, 1996.\n\nFigure 4 of [1] shows results for learning 16x16 filters using \"ten 512x512 images of natural scenes\".  Compare to the conv1 filters in Figure 2 of the paper under review.  This 1996 paper clearly established that it is possible to learn such filters from a small number of images.  There is long history of sparse coding and dictionary learning techniques, including multilayer representations, that follows from the early work of [1].  The paper should at minimum engage with this extensive history, and, in light of it, explain whether its claims are actually novel."

            "review": "The paper studies self-supervised learning from very few unlabeled images, down to the extreme case where only a single image is used for training. From the few/single image(s) available for training, a data set of the same size as some unmodified reference data set (ImageNet, Cifar-10/100) is generated through heavy data augmentation (cropping, scaling, rotation, contrast changes, adding noise). Three popular self-supervised learning algorithms are then trained on this data sets, namely (Bi)GAN, RotNet, and DeepCluster, and the linear probing accuracy on different blocks is compared to that obtained by training the same methods on the reference data sets. The linear probing accuracy from the first few conv layers of the network trained on the single/few image data set is found to be comparable to or better than that of the same model trained on the full reference data set.\n\nI enjoyed the paper; it addresses the interesting setting of an extremely small data set which complements the large number of studies on scaling up self-supervised learning algorithms. I think it is not extremely surprising that using the proposed strategy allows to learn low level features as captured by the first few layers, but I think it is worth studying and quantifying. The experiments are carefully described and presented, and the paper is well-written.\n\nHere are a few questions and concerns:\n\n- How much does the image matter for the single-image data set? The selected images A and B are of very high entropy and show a lot of different objects (image A) and animals (image B). How do the results change if e.g. a landscape image or an abstract architecture photo is used?\n\n- How general is the proposed approach? How likely is it to generalize to other approaches such as Jigsaw (Doersch et al., 2015) and Exemplar (Dosovitskiy et al., 2016)? It would be good to comment on this.\n\n- [1] found that the network architecture for self-supervised learning can matter a lot, and that by using a ResNet architecture, performance of SSL methods can be significantly improved. In particular, the linear probing accuracy appears to be often monotonic as a function of the depth of the layer it is computed from. This is in contrast to what is observed for AlexNet in Tables 2 and 3, where the conv5 accuracy is lower than the conv4. It would therefore be instructive to add experiments for ResNet to see how well the results generalize to other network architectures.\n\n- Does the MonoGAN exhibit stable training dynamics comparable to training WGAN on CIFAR-10, or do the training dynamics change on the single-image data set?\n\n\nOverall, Iâ€™m leaning towards accepting the paper, but it would be important to see how well the experiments generalize to i) ResNet and ii) other (lower entropy) input images.\n\n[1] Kolesnikov, A., Zhai, X. and Beyer, L., 2019.

I appreciate the efforts of the authors into investigating the issues raised, the described experiments sound promising. Unfortunately, the new results are not presented in the revision.
