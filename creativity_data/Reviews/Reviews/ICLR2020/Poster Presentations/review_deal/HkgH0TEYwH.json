The paper is well written and contains a thorough experimental evaluation (even disregarding the supplementary material). As far as I know, the proposed method is new and improve anomaly detection. The modification of Deep SVDD are in a way minimalistic, but they do the job.\n\nThe only negative aspects, in my opinion, is the \"information-theoretic view\" which is close to hand waving. The authors are indeed 1) disregarding the regularization term 2) considering an upper bound of the entropy 3) pretending the results on the pre-trained NN hold after post training. Putting everything together, I do not see how this reasoning could accepted. In fact, its extension to Deep SVDD is even more problematic as the discussion in the paper contradicts the reasoning. The authors emphasize the fact that anomalies should not fulfill the clustering assumption (which is indeed an important remark). But then the distribution of phi(x,W) cannot be approximated by a Gaussian for anomalies and thus the bound on the entropy is not valid. \n\nI strongly recommend to remove this part of the paper and to derive Deep SAD from Deep SVDD from heuristics consideration (which is fine!). This will provide an opportunity to remove the cute sentence \"We are happy to now introduce Deep SAD\"."

            "review": "[Summary]\nThe paper proposes an abnormal detection (AD) framework under general settings where 1) unlabeled data, 2) labeled positive (normal) data, and 3) labeled negative (abnormal) data are available (with the last two optional), denoted as semi-supervised AD. Starting from the assumption that abnormal data are sampled from background unpredicted distribution, rather than “cluster” assumption, it is argued that conventional discriminative formulation is not applicable. Motivated by the recent deep AD methods (e.g., deep SVDD), the paper proposes to approach semi-supervised AD from the information theoretic perspective where 1) mutual information between raw data and learnt representation should be maximized (infomax principle), 2) entropy of labeled positive data should be minimized (“compactness” constraint), and 3) enrtropy of labeled negative data should be maximized to reflect the uncertainty assumption of anomaly. The solution is implemented by the encoder of a pre-trained autoencoder that is further fine tuned to enforce entropy assumption on all types of training data. Extensive experiments on benchmarks suggests promising results on the proposed framework versus other state-of-the-arts.\n\n[Comments]\nThe paper is well written and easy to follow (the presentation is especially pleasant to read). The problem is well defined and of interest to the community under fairly general and practical conditions. Despite the fact that the implementation is only marginally tweaked from previous work (deep SVDD), the theoretical motivation, nevertheless, is sound and well justified, and the empirical evaluation is extensive to reveal the behaviors of the proposed method. It would be better if complexity analysis can also be provided for all concerning methods. Overall, the value of the paper is worth circulation in the community. \n\n[Area to improve]\nThe manuscript could be further improved by exploring the training process more. In the current format, the solution follows the strategy of deep SVDD that learns the model in two separate stages: pre-training the autoencoder, and then fitting the encoder to enforce compactness and entropy minimization/maximization. What if these are implemented in an end-to-end fashion? Will this help to achieve a better result?   \n"

Unfortunately, this field is not overlapped to my research field, and it is hard for me to judge this paper."
