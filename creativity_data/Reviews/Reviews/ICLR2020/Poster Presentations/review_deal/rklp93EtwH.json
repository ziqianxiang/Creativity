        "comment": "This paper proposes to deal with task heterogeneity in meta-learning by extracting cross-task relations and constructing a meta-knowledge graph, which can then quickly adapt to new tasks. The authors present a comprehensive set of experiments, which show consistent performance gains over baseline methods, on a 2D regression task and a series of few-shot classification tasks. They further conducted some ablation studies and additional analyses/visualization to aid interpretation.\n\nTwo of the reviewers were very positive, indicating that they found the paper well-written, motivated, novel, and thorough, assessments that I also share. The authors were very responsive to reviewer comments and implemented all actionable revisions, as far as I can see. The paper looks to be in great shape. I’m therefore recommending acceptance.  ",

            "review": "This paper mainly tackles the problem of heterogeneous tasks in meta-learning by proposing a new meta-learning framework ARML, which contains a module extracting relations across classes and a module representing meta-knowledge. When processing a new task, a graphical task representation is firstly constructed based on class prototypes, and then information propagation is conducted on a super-graph to find the most relevant meta-knowledge in the meta-knowledge graph. Ideally, the higher similarity between a prototype and a meta-knowledge node means the higher the correlation between a class and a specific type of meta-knowledge. In order to construct task-specific meta-learners, the authors utilize two auto-encoders to encode task representations with and without meta-knowledge graph. After that, a modulating function is applied to a set of shared parameters, which finishes the calculation of task-specific parameters. The authors empirically evaluated the proposed method on several datasets and it seems that ARML outperforms some compared methods.\n\nThis paper should be rejected. Firstly, the proposed method is not well motivated. It’s true that tasks in meta-learning may be sampled from a complex (or multi-modal) task distribution, but why to represent a task as a graph? I think the relation between tasks can be simply obtained from instances (CNN embeddings). Secondly, it’s hard to say the meta-knowledge graph can really capture knowledge with ‘exact meanings’ even though in some situations, a subset of nodes is activated and others are not.\n\nMain arguments\n1.\tThe whole framework is too complex and it’s hard to say every module in the framework really works even ablation study is done.\n2.\tThe meta-knowledge graph lacks interpretability. From my perspective, it’s just a set of learnable parameters without any exact meanings. Authors tried to analyze the constructed meta-knowledge graph by some experiments, but these discussions are farfetched.\n\nThings to improve the paper\n1.\tSimplify the proposed method.\n2.\tMake it clear why should we represent a task as a graph.\n3.\tSome most widely used benchmark datasets such as mini-imagenet and tiered-imagenet are not used. For a fair and convincing comparison, I suggest the authors test the proposed method on these benchmark datasets. Moreover, more methods should be compared."

            "review": "################################################################################\nSummary:\n\nThe paper provides a interesting direction in the meta-learning filed. In particular, it proposes to enhance meta learning performance by fully exploring relations across multiple tasks. To capture such information, the authors develop a heterogeneity-aware meta-learning framework by introducing a novel architecture--meta-knowledge graph, which can dynamically find the most relevant structure for new tasks.\n\n\n################################################################################\nReasons for score:\n\nOverall, I vote for accepting. I like the idea of mining the relation between tasks and handle it by the proposed meta-knowledge graph. My major concern is about the clarity of the paper and some additional ablation models (see cons below). Hopefully the authors can address my concern in the rebuttal period. \n\n################################################################################\nPros:\n\n1. The paper takes one of the most important issue of meta-learning: task heterogeneity. For me, the problem itself is real and practical.\n\n2. The proposed meta-knowledge graph is novel for capturing the relation between tasks and address the problem of task heterogeneity. \nGraph structure provides a more flexible way of modeling relations.\nThe design for using the prototype-based relational graph to query the meta-knowledge graph is reasonable and interesting.\n\n3. This paper provides comprehensive experiments, including both qualitative analysis and quantitative results,  to show the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The newly constructed Art-Multi dataset further enhances the difficulty of tasks and makes the performance more convincing.\n\n################################################################################\nCons:\n\n1. Although the proposed method provides several ablation studies, I still suggest the authors to conduct the following ablation studies to enhance the quality of the paper:\n(1) It might be valuable to investigate the modulation function. In the paper, the authors compare sigmoid, tanh, and Film layer. Can the authors analyze the results by reducing the number of gating parameters in Eq. 10 by sharing the gate value of each filter in Conv layers?\n\n(2) What is the performance of the proposed model by changing the type of aggregators?\n\n2. For the autoencoder aggregator, it would be better to provide more details about it, which seems not very clear to me. \n\n3. In the qualitative analysis (i.e., Figure 2 and Figure 3), the authors provide one visualization for each task. It would be more convincing if the authors can provide more cases in the rebuttal period.\n\n\n################################################################################\nQuestions during rebuttal period:\n\nPlease address and clarify the cons above\n\n################################################################################\nSome typos:\n(1) Table 7: I. no sample-level graph -> I. no prototype-based graph\n(2) 5.1 Hyperparameter Settings: we try both sigmoid, tanh Film -> we try both sigmoid, tanh, \nFilm.\n(3) parameteric -> parametric\n(4) Table 2: Origninal -> original\n(5) Section 4 first paragraph:  The enhanced prototype representation -> The enhanced prototype representations\n\n\nUpdates: Thanks for the authors' response. The newly added experimental results address my concerns. I believe this paper will provide new insights for this field and I recommend this paper to be accepted.\n",

            "review": "This paper proposed a knowledge-based meta-learning framework, called ARML(Automated Relational Metal-Learning) that automatically extracts cross-task relations and constructs a meta-knowledge graph. ARML wanted to solve the task heterogeneity problem in meta-learning through knowledge graph learning using graph neural networks. To do this, the authors introduced a framework consisting of (1) finding a prototype-based relational structure, (2) constructing a meta-knowledge graph, and (3) adapting the task-specific knowledge. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms other competitive algorithms in few-shot learning tasks, which is justified by experimentally showing that the learned meta-knowledge graph has a meaningful interpretation.\n\nThe paper was well-motivated and well-written, which made it very interesting to read. Looking at the task heterogeneity problem of meta-learning as a knowledge graph learning problem is the most important contribution of this paper. Since then, the framework's proposal to learn it as a graph neural network is a very natural extension, which can greatly increase the performance of existing few-shot learning tasks.\n\nThe question here is whether the meta-learning method for finding relational structures through knowledge graphs is the first one proposed in this paper. The paper \"Few-shot learning with graph neural networks, ICLR-2018\" performed the few-shot learning task with very similar motivation. What is the difference compared to this paper?\n\nAnd as mentioned in the paper, HSML is the closest study to ARML in that it considers high-level relations between cross-tasks. The reviewer is very curious about the qualitative comparison of the high-level structures found by the two algorithms, and I confident that this comparison will enrich the paper."
