To address intrinsic protein structural heterogeneity, they explicitly model the imaging operation to disentangle the orientation of the molecule by formulating decoder as a function of Cartesian coordinates.\n\n- The problem and the approach are well motivated. \n\n- This reviewer has the following comments:\n1) VAE is known to generate blurred images. Thus, based on this approach, the reconstruction image may not be optimal with respect to the resolution which might be critical for cryo-EM reconstruction. What's your opinion?\n2) What's the relationship between reconstructed performance, heterogeneity of the sample and dimensions of latent space?\n3) It would be interesting to show any relationship, reconstruction error with respect to the number of discrete multiclass.  \n4) How is the proposed method generalizable?"

Differentiable probabilistic models of scientific imaging with the Fourier slice theorem. arXiv preprint arXiv:1906.07582.\n\nHow does your method compare to this paper? In Ullrich et al., they report â€œTime until convergence, MSE [10^-3/voxel], and Resolution [Angstrom]). I think these statistics would be useful to report in your work, as they are more familiar with folks in the cryoEM field.\n\nIn Equation 3, how does one calculate Z, the normalization constant?\n\nFor the decoder, how large of the 3D space are you generating? What are the units? Are you using voxels to represent atomic density? What is the voxel size? Is it the same as on Page 11?\n\nI think more description of the neural network architecture would be useful (more than what is reported on page 12).\n"
