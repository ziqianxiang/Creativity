R2 expert on this topic, R1 and R3 less so. AC has carefully read the reviews/rebuttal/comments and looked closely at the paper. AC feels that R2's review is spot on and that the contribution does not quite reach ICLR acceptance level, despite it being interesting work. So the AC feels the paper cannot be accepted at this time. But the work is definitely interesting -- the authors should improve their paper using R2's comments and resubmit.  ",

            "review": "Review of “Deep Innovation Protection”\n\nThis paper builds on top of the World Models line of work that explores in more detail the role of evolutionary computing (as opposed to latent-modeling and planning direction like in Hafner2018) for such model-based architectures. Risi2019 is the first work that is able to train the millions of weights of the architecture proposed in Ha2018 end-to-end using modular-form of genetic algorithm (GA) to maximize the terminal cumulative reward.\n\nThis work expands on Risi2019, and proposes the use of multi-objective optimization (NSGA-II) to allow a world model to learn several subsystems by the fact that the GA optimizer is not only targeting the reward function of the environment, but it is also optimizing for diversity, similar to MAP-Elites line of literature (i.e. Cully2015, Mouret2015, and other more recent cited in this paper).\n\nThey demonstrate that end-to-end multi-objective optimization is not only able to solve both CarRacing and VizDoom tasks, but the world models learned have interesting features, i.e. the emerged world models can predict important survival events even though they were not trained explicitly for forward prediction.\n\nWhile the paper is interesting, I feel in its current state, it is not the level of an ICLR conference paper. Below is some feedback I want to give the authors to help them improve the work, so hopefully it can be improved either for this conference or the next. For the record, the score I wanted to give is a 4, but since I can only choose 3, or 6, I will assign a score of 3 for this review (although should really be a 4). I will breakdown the feedback into minor and major:\n\nMinor feedback:\n\n- Figure 3 does not indicate which task it is solving. Is it CarRacing or VizDoom?\n\n- What's the motivation for optimizing for both \"age\" and reward? Why not other multi-objectives?\n\nMedium Feedback:\n\nAs the authors are learning world models that can predict some form of a future, can they train agents inside an open-loop environment generated by such a world model (perhaps even with some hacks), and transfer such a policy back to the real env, as done in Ha2018 for VizDoom?\n\nMajor feedback:\n\nThe contribution of this paper isn't there, compared to Risi2019 which I feel has a much larger contribution to the line of work. I'm not convinced that the approach (multi-obj + end-to-end) which solves VizDoom cannot be solved using Risi2019. Authors mentioned this in the intro, but perhaps show some convincing experiments to make sure Risi2019 will definitely fail VizDoom? I'm not really convinced that an end-to-end algorithm will fail to find a solution for a poilcy (with our without a world model component in the architecture) for VizDoom Take Cover. Honestly I don't think VizDoom Take Cover is that hard of a task, and my intuition tells me that the method outlined in Risi2019, if carefully tuned properly, will be able to solve VizDoom Take Cover (but happy to be proven wrong if there is a strong experimental argument suggesting otherwise).\n\nI think for this paper to be convincing, the authors actually need to go beyond the CarRacing and VizDoom tasks and show the real power of multi-objective optimization for solving difficult problems that require model-based architectures. For instance, in Cully2015, the learning of several diverse sub-systems on the Pareto front allowed a robot to still be able to accomplish the walking task when the legs are disabled. I would advise the authors to look for a third task where they can clearly show that their approach can solve problems that current approaches (Ha2018, Risi2019, and possibly even DeepRL) cannot solve. Being able to do this has the potential to make this paper into an important work for the field. I can also recommend trying out some environments in the Animal Olympics (see refs) that will be very much suited for multi-obj optimization for animal-like survival environments where input space are pixels.\n\n[Ha2018] Recurrent World Models Facilitate Policy Evolution (NeurIPS2018)\n\n[Risi2019] Deep neuroevolution of recurrent and discrete world models (GECCO2019)\n\n[Hafner2018] Learning latent dynamics for planning from pixels (PlaNet)\n\n[Cully2015] “Robots that can adapt like animals” https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14422\n\n[Mouret2015] Illuminating search spaces by mapping elites\n\n[Animal Olympics] http://animalaiolympics.com/\n\n*** REVISED SCORE ***\n\nUpon looking at the revision, and the author response, I decided to increase the score of the paper (for the record: originally from a 4, which is rounded to a 4, to a 5, which is rounded to a 6).\n\nThe authors explained why Risi2019's approach cannot work on VizDoom with sufficient effort, and I buy their explanation. At the same time I feel this work is can benefit from addition, convincing tasks that highlight the full power of multi objective optimization, for this work to warrant a strong accept. Regardless of the final decision, I'm looking forward to see development of this interesting approach.",

The idea of using the concept of age is not new. There are many studies that have been conducted using the concept of aging in the literature of evolutionary algorithms.\n2. Multi-objective optimizations involve finding a set of optimal solutions for different and often competing objectives. However, the authors did not provide the analysis that the age and the accumulated task reward are conflicting with each other.\n3. It would be better the average survival time of the individuals is presented in this paper."

            "review": "This work improves upon the current state of applying neuroevolution to solve RL tasks, by using a modular \"world models\" architecture. While the original work used backpropagation to train the three different components on different tasks, later work used neuroevolution to train the entire architecture for final performance; however, the latter work was unable to demonstrate success on the more challenging task used in the original work. Given that the architecture has a heterogenous pipeline, the authors propose, and empirically show (over a set of seeds), that allowing extra time for components to adapt to other, more recently-changed components, enables neuroevolution to solve the second task. I would give this paper an accept, as this insight, along with a novel algorithm, could aid further work in neuroevolution but also more generally the optimisation of modular NNs.\n\nThe ablations are an important part of this work, and it would be good to study these further. The random age objective performing well does indeed indicate that diversity preservation plays a role in the better performance in DIP, but the fact that protecting the upstream controller does improve performance slightly makes me question if this effect has been properly decoupled. This ablation will reset the age 1/2 the time DIP does, reducing diversity/increasing selection pressure, and so another appropriate ablation is to see the effects of protecting MDN-RNN and controller innovations (with the VAE being the most downstream component)."
