In order to make the paper more accessible to a general audience, the authors should:\n1) follow the 1st sentence in the abstract by a new sentence that provides an intuitive example the idea of domain shift from labeled source to unlabeled target domain  \n2)  re-organize the current intro, which reads more like related work, into a more traditional format\n     - one intuitive paragraph about domain adaptation, source/target domain, and domain shift; provide at least one compelling  illustrative example from a real-world application\n     - one intuitive paragraph with an illustrative example on how the proposed approach will help solve a problem; at the same intuitive level, compare-and-contrast it with existing approaches\n     - one intuitive, in-detail paragraph on how the proposed approach works\n     - one paragraph summarizing the main findings/results \n3) ideally, add a section with an illustrative running example, which would have a huge impact on the paper's readability "

            "review": "In this paper, the authors studied a so-called source-free domain adaptation problem. They aimed to propose a universal DA method for different relationships between the target label set and the source label set, without accessing the source domain data in the adaptation phase.\n\nThe problem studied is an interesting and practical problem for domain adaptation. The proposed solution looks promising at the high level. However, there are some major concerns.\n\n1. The term \"source-free\" is misleading. Indeed, a \"source domain\" is needed in the procurement stage. Based on the the proposed method, there is still an assumption on the source domain, i.e., there is an overlapping label set between the source domain and the target domain. Given a target domain, if there are not overlapping labels between the target domain and the source domain, the proposed method will fail to work. In this sense, the term \"universal\" is also misleading.\n\n2. In the proposed procurement stage, a key step is to generate the so-called \"negative\" source instances. The authors proposed two heuristic approaches, one for image data, and the other for non-image data. These two approaches looks okay, but not convincing as no deeper analysis is provided. Moreover, in experiments, only the image domain is used. The effectiveness of the approach for non-image negative instances generation is not verified.\n\n3. In prediction, for the case where the target domain has a set of private labels, the proposed method can only predict all instances of private labels as \"unknown\" if successful. This may not be useful in practice. \n\nHere are the minor concerns:\n1. Authors attempted to compress much content into 9 pages, which makes to the paper a little difficult to follow.\n\n2. In the literature of transfer learning or domain adaptation, a similar problem setup was studied around 10 years ago, which was focused on the application of web text mining. \n\"Xiang et al., Source-Selection-Free Transfer Learning, IJCAI-11\""

            "review": "The paper proposes a domain adaptation problem with the source domain not available in addition to previous universal domain adaptation. The paper employs a two-stage training procedure to solve the problem.\n\nIn the first procurement stage, the paper aims to extend the source classification boundary to out-of-domain data and improve the ability of the source classifier to reject out-of-distribution samples. The proposed method generates negative data lying between clusters and far from the cluster centers and uses them to train the feature extractor, the classifier, and the backbone network. The idea of exploiting generated data has been used by previous works [1], but the paper proposes a novel generation method, which is new and useful for universal domain adaptation.\n\nHowever, the generation process has some problems. First, the paper only considers the samples between two clusters. What if considering the samples between several clusters? For data in D_{n}^{(b)}, when the probability of the data is similar among three or more classes, labeling it as the largest two probability classes is sub-optimal. \n\nSecondly, when the target domain is far from the source domain, target data belonging to the shared classes will be in the area of D_{n}^{(b)}. The classifier will classify these target data as the classes in C_n, which will assign high w'(x_t) in the second deployment stage and degrade the performance.\n\nThirdly, there is no theoretical guarantee of how many samples are enough or how to sample a complete set to cover all out-of-distribution areas.\n\nIn the second deployment stage, the paper uses the sum of the exponential probability of shared and private classes. As stated above, with the first stage, the target shared data are not necessary to have a low probability in the private classes. The performance can be degraded.\n\nThe loss for the second stage is more like a pseudo-labeling method to use the binary pseudo-label of 'shared' or 'private' obtained from the model in the first stage. The paper needs to provide an error bound on the final classification result with respect to the error in pseudo-labeling.\n\nThe paper fails to report the influence of the number of samples on the final performance, which is essential to the generative model based methods.\n\n\n\nMinor points: \nThe notation is a little messy, such as what is the relation between D_{n} and D_{n}^{(a)}, D_{n}^{(b)}.\n\n[1] Hoffman, Judy, et al. \"Cycada: Cycle-consistent adversarial domain adaptation.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1711.03213 (2017)."
