        "comment": "This paper focuses on finding universal adversarial perturbations, that is, a single noise pattern that can be applied to any input to fool the network in many cases. Further more, it focuses on the data-free setting, where such a perturbation is found without having access to data (images) from the distribution that train- and test data comes from. \n\nThe reviewers were very conflicted about this paper. Among others, the strong experimental results and the clarity of writing and analysis were praised. However, there was also criticism of the amount of novelty compared to GDUAP, on the strong assumptions needed (potentially limiting the applicability), and on some weakness in the theoretical analysis. \n\nIn the end, the paper seems in current form not convincing enough for me to recommend acceptance for ICLR.

            "review": "Summary:\nThis paper proposed a method to generate universal adversarial perturbations without training data. This task is timely and practical. The proposed method maximizes the norm of the output before nonlinearity at any layer to craft the universal perturbation. A sequential dilation algorithm is designed to calculate UAPs. The experiments show that the proposed method outperforms GDUAP.\n\nMy major concern is that there is not much novelty in the proposed method compared with GDUAP. The dilate loss function (4) is similar to the objective function (3) in the GDUAP paper. This paper provides a theoretical explanation of the dilate loss function and an improvement on the non-linearity function, which, however, is not convincing. Equation 10 is derived based on many strong assumptions. See the comments below.\n\nPros:\n-\tThe theoretical analysis is clear.\n-\tThe proposed method performs better than GDUAP in the data-free and black-box setting.\n-\tThe writing is good. The paper is easy to follow.\n\nCons:\n-\tThe theoretical analysis is based on many strong assumptions/criteria. For example:\no\tTo derive equation (5), W1X and W1p must be in the same orthant. It is unclear how to satisfy the criteria In the algorithm. \no\tIn Lemma 1, problem (5) approximates problem (6) only if x has a very large projection on the first singular vector of W. However, x and W are fixed and independent of p. This assumption largely depends on the dataset and the weights of the model.\no\tIt would be better if the authors show that in what cases these assumptions can be satisfied.\n-\tOther factors such as batch normalization and max pooling used in Inception v3, may also affect the linearity of the model. It would be better if the authors provide theoretical analysis or an ablation study on these factors. \n-\tWhat’s the design principle behind Algorithm 1? Why can this algorithm solve the sub-optimal problem? The weights of different layers are not closely related. In the initialization part, why can we start learning p from the result of the previous layer? Would it be possible that the performance is improved due to the algorithm instead of the dilate loss?\n-\tThe proposed method performs worse than GDUAP does in some less data settings.\n-\tThe results in Table 4 and 5 are inconsistent. These two experiments use the same dataset (Imagenet) and the same number of images (D=64).\n\n"

            "review": "The paper proposes a data free method for generating universal adversarial examples. Their method finds an input that maximizes the output of each layer by maximizing the dilation loss. They gave a well motivated derivation going from the data matrix, the data mean and to data free. The experiments results seems solid as the numbers show that their method is much better in many cases.\n\nI have 2 main issues:\n\n* The fooling rate experiments does not seem to control for how much distortion there really is. How do you make sure that different methods have similar level of distortion and not just similar l_\\inf.  Given that the authors says most of their method saturates all values, it is not clear that the baselines and competition really has a similar level of distortion. The fooling rate for random seems rather high. Why is random noise not mostly ignored by the model?\n\n* while the method is data free. It needs complete access to the model and relies on properties of ReLu. I am not sure how realistic this setting is, and how this compares to methods that has black box access to the model. While it is interesting, the paper did not establish that universal adversarial perturbation is well-motivated and why data free is more important that model free or targeted perturbations.  An attacker probably always see the input and probably wants to make it misclassified into a particular class, instead of just making the model wrong. \n\n "

            "review": "This paper proposed a white-box (known network architecture, known network weight) data free (without need to access the data) adversarial attacking method. The main idea is to find a perturbation that maximizes the activations at different layers jointly. But the optimization is done sequentially, treating each layer’s activation (before ReLU) as a linear transformation output.\n\nThe method is compared with existing methods (only one existing approach for the problem, GDUAP by Mopuri et al. 2018) in terms of the fool rate. It shows significant improvement. Ablation study is carried out to compare with baselines like perturbation maximizing only first layer activation, only last layer activation, etc. Also on some other settings (black-box testing, less data) the proposed method outperforms GDUAP. \n\nThe problem of data-free white-box attack is very interesting and does make sense. The proposed method achieve significant improvement over the previous one (GDUAP). I do have the following concerns though.\n\n1), the novelty of the proposed idea seems relatively limited. The proposed idea seeks perturbation maximizing activations over all layers. It incur perturbation before ReLU. But overall, the flavor of the idea is not significantly different from GDUAP, despite the significant performance boost. \n\n2), it was mentioned that compare with GDUAP, this paper has more theoretical analysis. But this is not very convincing to me. There are many steps of approximation/relaxation from the original problem (Equation (1)) to the final formula (Equation (10)). Many assumptions are made over the steps. It is OK to use these steps to derive a heuristic. But these steps can hardly be called \"theoretical analysis\".\n\nI am particularly uncomfortable with Equation (5), which is the basis of the main idea. It assumes that all data in $W_1X$ are in the same orthant as $W_1p$. But this is unrealistic as different data in X will for sure incur different activation patterns. Did I misunderstand anything?\n\n3) I do like the experimental results. It looks impressive. But the baselines are really limited (granted, there are not many existing approaches). There is only one task (image classification). How about other tasks like segmentation etc shown in Mopuri et al. 2018? Also it would be nice to also show the results of other UAP methods, as it gives us a better sense of the gap between with and without data.\n\n4) I wonder how will the attack affect some model which has been trained with some defense mechanism, e.g., adversarial training.\n\nTypo:\nEquation (5), RHS missing a max\n\n"

Meanwhile, they optimize the perturbations in each layer in a sequential manner instead of joint optimization to avoid chances of reaching local minima solutions.\n\nThe authors provide a detailed theoretical analysis and systematic experimental results to demonstrate their arguments, which is convincing. What’s more, the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art data-free fooling rates on the large-scale dataset, which strongly demonstrates the effectiveness of their method.\n\nIn section 3.2, (the top of page 4) “which becomes additive if column vectors in W1X are in the same orthant as W1p.
