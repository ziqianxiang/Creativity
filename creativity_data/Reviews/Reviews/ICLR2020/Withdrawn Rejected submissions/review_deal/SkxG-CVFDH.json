            "review": "Summary:\nThis paper presents a data augmentation procedure for semi-supervised learning on graph structured data. In general it is not clear how augmented observations can be incorporated into an existing graph while still preserving the graph structure. Instead of trying to incorporate an augmented dataset into the graph, this paper uses a seperate fully-connected network (FCN) that shares weights with a graph neural net (GNN). The final method also incorporates various components from the literature, such as Mixup and Sharpening. While the literature appears to have been adequately cited, the position of GraphMix relative to previous work could be better dilineated. In my opinion, the main contribution of this paper is the suggestion of using weight-sharing to sidestep the issue of incorporating augmented datapoints into graph-structured data. I am not sufficiently versed in the literature to assess whether the idea is sufficiently novel to warrant acceptance. The idea is simple and appears to improve the performance of Graph Convolutional Nets (GCNs), so I am leaning towards acceptance.\n\nRating Justification:\nEfficient data-augmentation procedures are an important area of research. The relative simplicity and generality of GraphMix is appealing. I would give the paper a higher score if the authors showed that GraphMix(Graph U-net) was an improvement over Graph U-net, or if it was made more clear that some substantial benefit is derived from using Mixup features.\n\nAdditional Comments:\n1. Based on the ablation study it seems that Mixup actually plays a very minor role in the overall success of the procedure. I would be curious to see the t-SNE visualization of the GraphMix(GCN) \\ Mixup features in order to determine how much of the cluster separation is due to Mixup specifically. I understand that previous work has suggested that Mixup features are superior for discrimination than normal features, but in this work specifically the evidence for this assertion is fairly weak. \n\n2. A clearer distinction between GraphMix(GCN) and GCN (with predicted targets) would be very helpful, especially since GCN (with predicted targets) actually performs the best on the standard PubMed splits. Why were the results for GCN (with predicted targets) not included in Table 2?"

            "review": "This paper introduces a regularization method for graph neural networks that exploit unlabeled examples. The authors claim that the proposed method for semi-supervised graph learning is based on data augmentation which is efficient and can be applied to different graph neural architectures, that is an architecture-agnostic regularization technique is considered in the paper.\n\nStrength\n•\tSimple yet effective regularization technique to neural networks for graph-structured data\n\nWeaknesses\n•\tWeak technical contribution to the problem\n•\tThe performance gain is from mostly the use of a semi-supervised learning approach based on entropy minimization, which has been developed without consideration of graph-structured data.\n\n\nThe paper does not compare the computational complexity of the proposed approach to the baseline approaches. Although it seems the additional computation cost for the proposed approach compared to the baseline such as GCN does not increase dramatically, it would be better if the authors could provide its computational cost as well as performance given the number of perturbed samples.\n\nAccording to Table 1, self-learning approaches, i.e., GCN (with predicted targets), works comparable to GraphMix. I do not find the benefit of using such a more complicated approach other than simple approaches such as self-learning in the experiment section.\n\nManifold Mixup is not explained properly. For example, the authors may need to explain two random samples, i.e., (x, y) and (x’, y’) are drawn from the data distribution D, and how it is used in GraphMix more clearly.\n\nAdjacency matrix A is used without its definition."

            "review": "In this paper, the authors developed GNN by integrating an interpolation based regularization. In particular, the proposed GraphMix model has two components, one GNN and one MLP. For the MLP, the manifold mixup loss is used for training. The two components share parameters so that the GCN training can be regularized by the manifold mixup loss. Moreover, the predicted samples of GCN are used to augment the data of MLP for training in a self-supervised manner. In the experiments, GraphMix was compared with several recent GNN models on several benchmark datasets and demonstrates effectiveness for node classification and link classification.\n\nThere are several concerns on this paper.\n1. The motivation to integrate interpolation based regularization for GNN is not intuitively clear. The authors may want to further clarify on how can Eq. (2) help improve the classification power of GNN in an intuitive manner.\n2. Some algorithm design choices, such as sharpening for entropy minimization, are not well justified. It is not clear why sharpening is selected over psudolabels.\n3. The overall technical contribution is somewhat incremental based on previous work on GNN and manifold mixup based regularizations. The model design is heuristic, and lack theoretic analysis, for example, on the parameter sharing based regularization over other choices of regularizations, if any.\n4. From the experimental results, the proposed model improves GCN and GAT, but the improvements on other baseline methods are a little bit subtle. The authors may want to further evaluate their framework on those GNNs such as GMNN and Graph U-Net to make the experiments more comprehensive, or justify on why they cannot be implemented using the proposed framework.\n5. In Table 2, 3, and 4, it is not clear on why GAT and GraphMix (GAT) are missing. This inconsistency with regard to Table 1 should be justified.\n6. In the ablation analysis, if the reason for the suboptimal performance when using EMA is the lack of hyperparameter search, then it is suggested to perform comprehensive hyperparameter search so that the results are more solid. Otherwise, the design choice cannot be well justified.\n"
