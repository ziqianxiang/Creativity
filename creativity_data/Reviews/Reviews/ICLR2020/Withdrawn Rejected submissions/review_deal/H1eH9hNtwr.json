While the applicability of this model may represent an advance in the particular field of the authors, the technical contribution of this paper is far from the level expected in this conference. \n\n- As the paper reads, the main contribution of the paper is the modified version of UNet 'proposed' by the authors, which major modification consists on replacing SGD by Adam. Nevertheless, this cannot be considered a contribution, as changing the optimizer in a deep model is a marginal change, from a methodological point of view. \n\n- Overall, the quality of the paper is below the standards of ICLR (content, technical contribution, length).\n\n- The submission is not anonymized (authors included their names and affiliations).
