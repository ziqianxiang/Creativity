        "comment": "This submission addresses the problem of detecting malicious PDF files. The proposed solution trains existing CNN architectures on a collected dataset and verifies improved performance over available antivirus software. \n\nThere were a number of concerns raised about this work. The main concern the reviewers had with this submission is lack of novelty. The issue is that the paper tackles a standard supervised classification problem which has been extensively explored in the literature and applies an off-the-shelf classification model. Though the particular application has seen less attention in the ICLR community, the problem setting and solution are well known. Thus, the contribution of the work is not sufficient for acceptance.

The generated features of CNN achieves good clustering results that are consistent with the ground-truth labels.\n\nThis paper applies an existing CNN architecture. I do not observe any novelty in terms of modeling. I suspect this paper is not interesting to most members of the ICLR community. Therefore, I do not suggest the acceptance of this paper."

            "review": "The paper proposes to use CNN to detect malicious PDFs. The paper uses two simple CNN models and train them on a collected dataset, compare with other antivirus software, and conclude that CNN performs better. But I have serious concerns about the experiments.\n\n1. The major concern is with the dataset. The dataset used by this work are collected by authors themselves, and I see a serious problem in this process. The malicious and benign ones are not collected from the same distribution: \"The malicious samples are taken from VirusTotal (3). They were uploaded on the website between the 5/5/2018 and the 11/14/2018\"; \"The benign files were obtained using collaboration with a private company\". Thus, the model may not be actually learning what's malicious and what's benign, but only learning whether the pdf comes from that private company or VirusTotal. It's enough since the test set is also collected this way. It can be fairly easy to distinguish between two different datasets, and the same reasoning applies here. Also, the authors are not making the dataset available due to privacy reasons, which further make the dataset's validity a question. \n\n2. Also, antivirus softwares are applicable on any pdf files, but the model trained with the dataset collected may not be useful in other circumstances. The comparison between them are not fair. It should compare the same model/software but on multiple different datasets to demonstrate the model's general applicability.\n\n3. The experiments done in this work is also not of a satisfactory level. For example, there are some missing blanks in Table 1. Why is that? The figures (e.g., Fig 1/2) can be improved a lot. It did not include baseline and provide little information. The fonts are too small.\n\n4. No major novelty is introduced. The work is an application paper using very simple CNNs on the malicious PDF detection problem. This itself does not make the paper bad but combined with the unconvincing experiments it's a serious weakness.\n\nIn summary, the paper lacks solid experimental results to make its conclusion convincing and its model generalizable. I vote for rejection of the paper.\n"
