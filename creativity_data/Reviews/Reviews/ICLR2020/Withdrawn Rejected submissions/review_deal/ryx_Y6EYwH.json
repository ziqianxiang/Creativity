            "review": "The authors present a method that guarantees differential privacy for survival function estimates using Kaplan-Meier. They show their results in nine different datasets, and their survival curves are similar to the original survival curves while protecting patient privacy.\n\nThere have been a number of survival functions with differential privacy discussion since Nguyen and Hui. Please check other papers that cite it.\n\nOverall, the writing is choppy, where ideas that should be a single sentence is separated into multiple sentences. For example, in the first few sentences of the Introduction, we have \"An adversary, with only access to the published estimates... Effectively leading to the disclosure of sensitive information\", which should just be a single sentence. There are many instances of this throughout the paper, and they should be edited prior to re-submission.\n\nThe authors claim that GANs do not work well for their application, but it would be more convincing if there are citations or experiments tha t can back this up.\n\nThe authors write that their method \"provides good utility\". They should explicitly state the metric of evaluation, as well as the increase in performance clearly in both the abstract and the introduction.\n\nSection 2.1 introducing the survival function is not necessary. Maybe just 2-3 sentences on the K-M estimator."

            "review": "The authors propose a differentially private estimator for survival functions, their confidence intervals and test statistics. An Extension for the competing risk cumulative incidence function is also presented. Experiments on nine datasets are presented.\n\nThe algorithm is simple, readily extends to KM's confidence interval, the logrank test statistic and the competing risk cumulative function. Theoretical results follow from the count nature of the data (number of events and risk set size).\n\nFrom the experiments it is noticeable that the the differentially private estimator consistently overestimates risk (see Figure 1 nad Table 2, left) and the logrank test statistic (table 2, right). This is not addressed in the paper.\n\nThe work, although interesting, is of very limited value to the ICLR community."

            "review": "The paper proposes a differentially private estimation of survival function via the Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimator. The paper further extends their results to the estimation of confidence intervals and test statistics as well as scenarios with competing risks. Differential privacy is an important aspect when dealing with sensitive data such as data generated in healthcare and clinical settings. The authors seek to provide a differentially private procedure in the setting of survival analysis.\n\nOverall, the reviewer finds that the authors ineffectively deliver the promise of the paper in various aspects, ranging from theories to experiments, and to the clarity of the paper. The paper, in its current form, is too preliminary to publish. Specific comments follow. \n\n1. equation (1) the notation is not explained at all. \n2. While the definition of the KM estimator is given in equation (2), no explanation is provided regarding how the estimator corresponds to an estimation of the survival function.  The authors may consider providing a running example for a better explanation with a visualization of the resultant step function.\n3. Despite being the key definition of the paper,  definition 1 of differential privacy is not clearly stated. Some symbols in the definition remained unexplained.  e.g. what is $\\mathcal{X}$. What is the  \"Range()\" of a randomized algorithm $\\mathcal{M}$? The concept of differential privacy also requires further intuition and explanation. Such as why smaller $\\epsilon$ corresponds to stronger privacy guarantees. What does privacy guarantees itself mean? \n4. In section 3, the term of privacy budget is also mentioned but not explained.\n5. Page 5, Algorithm 6 is referenced but nowhere to find.\n6. In the experiments, the authors choose $\\epsilon=2$ and $\\epsilon=1$. However,  it is unclear why these parameters are chosen. It is also unclear what these choice imply in terms of the privacy that can be preserved in practice, and whether such preservation suffices."
