            "review": "The paper proposed a model to simultaneously embedding and clustering nodes in an attributed network. This is achieved by designing an objective function that involves matrices with different meanings. The optimization problem is then solved in an alternating direction way, which only optimizes one variable, while having the others fixed. The optimization algorithm is intuitive and involves matrix factorization heavily.\n\n\nThe objective function is not explained well. I cannot see why you design it in this way and is not convinced that it is better than the others. The proposed algorithm to solve the optimization algorithm is very intuitive and is computationally expensive, involving many SVD operations in each step. Its scalability is in doubt. \n\nThe motivation to combine the two tasks of embedding and clustering is not clear. I cannot see why combining the two task is important.\n\nThe paper is organized and written very poorly. It is difficult to follow.\n\nMore relevant baseline models of attitude network embedding using deep learning methods should be taken into account.\n\n"

            "review": "This paper develops a matrix factorization based framework to perform attributed network embedding and node clustering simultaneously. Specifically, it adopts the idea of collective matrix factorization to factorize the data representation matrix and the node similarity matrix into a common space. Experiments on real-world datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed method. \n\nIn general, the studied problem of simultaneous embedding and clustering is interesting and is seldom studied in literature. However, the technical contributions of the paper is rather limited. Please see the detailed comments below:\n1. The node proximity w.r.t. network topology and attributes may not align with each other, thus simply adding their similarity together (Eq.(1)) is a very rudimentary way to combine these two data sources.\n2. The idea of collective factorization (Eq.(3)) is not novel and lacks detailed justification.\n3. The time complexity of the matrix factorization based framework is very high, making it difficult to be scaled to large-scale networks. And also, the used datasets in the experiments are very small, making the derived conclusions not convincing. "

            "review": "This paper proposes an algorithm to perform jointly attribute network embedding and clustering together. Some tricks about how to make use of the node attributes have been explored and put into an overall optimisation criterion. Performance evaluation has been carried out based on three benchmarking data sets.\n\nI will argue for rejecting this paper because of the following two main reasons:\n\n1. Novelty is limited.\n2. Writing quality is not satisfactory. \n\n\n1. Joint learning of embedding and clustering for attribute networks has been studied in recent years. Other than those mentioned in the paper, there are also some others more recent ones:\n- Attributed Graph Clustering: A Deep Attentional Embedding Approach (IJCAI’19)\n- Community Detection in Attributed Graphs: An Embedding Approach (AAAI’18)\n- Attributed Graph Clustering: an Attribute-aware Graph Embedding Approach (ASONAM’17)\nSome seem to give better results than those achieved in this paper. More importantly, while the formulation presented in this paper looks reasonable to me, it is not clear to me which part brings the novelty making new contribution.\n\n2. While the overall structure of the paper is fine, the detailed organization and presentations should be improved. The following gives some examples. Asterisks indicate the potentially problematic parts.\n\n“**Frequently**, embedding and clustering are used to better understand the content and structure information from the clusters.”\n“Many approaches have been proposed for the learning representation and clustering tasks (Bock, 1987; De Soete & Carroll, 1994; Vichi & Kiers, 2001; Yamamoto & Hwang, 2014) **without available information** from a network.”\n“High risk of severe deviation of approximate continuous embedding solution from the good discrete clustering. …” - related background is not provided before to understand this sentence.\n“These problems result from the **sequential way** where the learned representation is obtained before obtaining clusters using a **technical** clustering.” - there are inappropriate use of words.\n\nThe Introduction section can be improved by compressing the current version and then develop the logics which is leading to what being proposed in this paper as well as the explanation regarding why the proposed method is good and significant.\n\nAccording to Table 2, the use of S or W makes a significant different. There could be a possibility that the other methods if using S instead of W will also have significant improvement. If yes, it seems to be the use of S which gives the improvement.\n"
