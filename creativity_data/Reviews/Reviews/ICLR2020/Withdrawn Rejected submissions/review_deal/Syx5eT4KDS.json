I liked the motivation and presentation of the paper but see some critical shortcomings:\n\n- In Theorem 1, shouldn't there be a term that accounts for the complexity of the hypothesis class (VC-dim, Rademacher complexity etc.). Can we actually verify Theorem 1 in practice on synthetic distributions to get a sense of the constant terms?\n- The experiments do not compare with any mutual information related baselines. Eg, VIB [Alemi et al.]. This comparison is critical to stress the importance of discrete codes as opposed to continuous. \n- Can the authors shed more light on the tradeoffs between p and d? Empirical insights would lend more intuition and understanding.\n- Discreteness in activations is one form of regularization to reduce |tilde(x)|. Would regularizing the weights of the stochastic encoder (say by variational inference or minimizing say l2 norm) have the same/better/worse regularization effect (as done in Bayes by Backprop)?\n- There are a few missing references on stochastic encoders trained based on variational information maximization [1, 2]. \n\nReferences:\n[1] Uncertainty Autoencoders: Learning Compressed Representations via Variational Information Maximization.

            "review": "This paper proposes a method to learn classifier outputs for meta learning in the form of factorized discrete codes by maximizing the mutual information between the model's outputs and the ground truth labels. The authors further present an information theoretic generalization bound for meta learning in terms of the number of tasks, number of training samples per task and the expressively of the model. They further show empirically that their approach does not need a separate query set during meta-training and can generalize better than a few of the other metric-learning based meta-learning approaches specifically at lower shot values. They show that their method requires less memory than the N-pair meta-learning method.\n\nThe paper addresses an important problem of generalization with very low shot values and proposes an interesting theoretical treatment of the problem in terms of deriving an information theoretic lower bound for it. I liked the authors' theoretical treatment of relating various metrics to the mutual information between the models' outputs and their labels. \n\nHowever, there have been many recent works attempting to address the problem of better generalization of meta learning models. Most notable among them is the work of Kim et al. \"Bayesian Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning\" (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03836.pdf), which is not referenced or compared against in this paper at all.\n\nThe proposed method is also limited in its scope to classification tasks only and the authors make no attempt to address regression or reinforcement learning problem, which limits is widespread applicability.\n\nWhile the authors address the generalization of meta-learning methods for small values of M, they do not address how their model behaves viz-a-viz others when the number of tasks N available for training is small. Theoretically having more compact representations should also help in situations where the number of tasks available for training are small. I would like to see an empirical analysis of that as well.\n\n"

            "review": "This paper presents DIMCO, a meta-learner that is trained by maximizing mutual information between a discrete data representation and class labels across tasks. DIMCO is inspired by an information theoretic lower bound on the generalisation gap for meta-learning, which the authors argue identifies overfitting in the task learner as the bottleneck. \n\nThis work proposes to constrain a learner to output discrete codes that are learned to capture the mutual information with class labels. While the idea of using discrete codes is interesting, its presentation in the manuscript is not well motivated and at times hard to follow. This makes it challenging to evaluate the novelty, validity, and generality of the proposed approach. Meanwhile, the empirical evaluation is somewhat lacking. Thus, I do not believe this work is ready for publication in its current form.\n\nDetailed comments\n\nMy main concern is with respect to the primary contribution of this paper, a generalisation bound on meta-learning. The bound appears to be on a multi-task loss without task adaptation, and thus the claims made with respect to the theorem seem somewhat over-reaching. I also believe the VC-dimensionality of the encoder is missing in Eq. 4? If so, this changes the interpretation since the length of the code and the expressivity of the encoder are interrelated. Further, I would welcome a deeper analysis of the theorem and its implications. The current interpretation states that the number of tasks is independent of the size of each task, hence given many tasks, using minimal representations is an effective approach to meta-generalisation. Yet minimal representations is a well-known idea and has features in several works that use mutual information as a regularizer, most notably works on the Information Bottleneck. \n\nAnother reservation I have is the use of mutual information between encoder representations and class labels as a loss function (Eq. 1). It lacks context and a proper motivation, especially since the analysis of [1] shows that the loss function in Eq. 1 is the cross-entropy objective. The authors make a similar analysis in Appendix A and argue that Eq. 1 differs in that cross-entropy is an approximation because it adds a parametrized linear layer on top of \\tilde{X}. Thus, in the absence of that layer they collapse to the same objective. As DIMCO itself directly extract class label predictions from \\tilde{X}, I fail to see a difference between the loss in Eq. 1 and a cross-entropy objective. \n\nThe main motivation behind their loss objective is that it does not require a support / query set. This does not seem to be a feature of the mutual information objective itself, but rather a choice made by the authors. I would have liked a deeper discussion of this seeing as the authors make it a central tenet of DIMCO. Prior works use a support set as a principled means of doing meta-learning: meta-training explicitly takes into account that at test time, the learner will be given a small support set from which to learn how to query points. As far as I understand, DIMCO does not take this into account during meta-training.  At meta-test time however, DIMCO does use a support set to map query points (Eqs. 10 and 11). Why should we break protocols between meta training and testing? Are there any downsides to doing so?  \n\nEmpirically, I find the CUB experiment compelling but would welcome some ablations. What are the trade-offs between p and d? Can DIMCO outperform N-pair when number of bits are unconstrained?\n\nminiImagenet is a standard benchmark in few-shot learning, but I am unable to find a results table - could the authors please provide results on the standard setup so that the method can be compared against known baselines? Further, would the results currently presented hold in a N-way-5-shot setup?\n\nAs for the constrained version of miniImagenet that the authors propose, I am not convinced this is an interesting protocol. In general, the miniImagenet task distribution is created by N-way permutations of the classes in the meta-set (e.g. meta-training tasks are combinations of the 64 classes in the meta-training set). By keeping the number of classes constant but reducing the number of images per class, this protocol is not reducing samples per task: a task is always defined as 5/20-way-1-shot (Fig. 4). Instead, the effect should be that tasks are in (greater) violation of the task i.i.d. assumption. Thus, I question whether this setup demonstrates the trade-offs the authors present in Theorem 1 and whether the results can be interpreted in light of it. \n\nFinally, that both experiments are image-based raises questions as to the generality of the method. The paper could be considerably strengthened by evaluating DIMCO on a non-image task, or if not discuss the method’s limitations.  \n\nThe idea of discrete codes for few-shot classification is interesting and sufficiently novel, I am likely to increase my score if my concerns are addressed and the experimental section is strengthened.\n\nFurther questions and comments:\n\n- I am unable to parse Eq. 11 - what does the notation \\prod_i p_{\\tilde{x}_i, i} mean? \n- It is unnecessarily hard to follow the proof of theorem 1. It would help the reader if you restated relevant definitions, such as Eq. 1, since the difference with Eq. 23 is very subtle. It would also be helpful to explain how the summand in Eq. 25 differs from either, and Eq. 26 could be expanded or briefly explained after the derivation. \n-  Because DIMCO is trained with backpropagation, the interpretation of Eq. 5 as d independent events seems invalid. How does it affect the method if they are not independent?\n- Overloading X and Y as both random variables and mini-batch samples creates unnecessary confusion. I believe the objective in Eq. 1 is approximated, not calculated exactly? For instance, the mutual information in Eq. 8 is with respect to a mini-batch, so should it not be \\hat{I}? \n- p^j_{ik} in Eq. 9 is undefined.\n- Eq. 9 is interpreted as an exact entropy, however it appears to be a mini-batch approximation to the true entropy? \n\nReferences \n[1] Achille and Soatto.
