I appreciate the authors' response that there are cases where gradients are not easily available, especially for black-box attacks.\n\nHowever, I find the limited applicability an issue for ICLR and I encourage the authors to find a conference that is more suited to that work.",

            "review": "This paper considers zeroth-order method for min-max optimization (ZO-MIN-MAX) in two cases: one-sided black box (for outer minimization) and two-sided black box (for both inner maximization and outer minimization). Convergence analysis is carefully provided to show that ZO-MIN-MAX converges to a neighborhood of stationary points. Then, the authors empirically compare several methods on \n1) adversarial attack on ImageNet with deep networks, and \n2) black-box poisoning attack on logistic regression. The results show that ZO-MIN-MAX can provide satisfactory performance on these tasks.\n\nIn general a good paper with dense content, clear organization and writing. However, the experiment part does not seem truly convincing. \n1.\tWhat is the relationship between Eqn.(13) and the proposed ZO-MIN-MAX? It seem that in the experiment you compare using this loss ( Eqn.(13) ) against finite-sum loss, but both with ZO-MIN-MAX algorithm? In figure 1 and 2, I donâ€™t see a competing method. So the point here is that the loss Eqn.(13)  is better, but not the proposed algorithm? I think you should compare different optimization algorithm under same loss, e.g. something like Eqn.(13)+ZO-MIN-MAX vs. Eqn.(13)+FO-MIN-MAX. This is not evident to show that ZO-MIN-MAX is better than other zero-th order methods.\n2.\tI would suggest comparing to more zeroth-order methods in the experiment.\n\nFrom the experiments I cannot tell whether ZO-MIN-MAX is good enough compared with other methods"

            "review": "The paper presents an algorithm for performing min-max optimisation without gradients and analyses its convergence. The algorithm is evaluated for the min-max problems that arise in the context of adversarial attacks. The presented algorithm is a natural application of a zeroth-order gradient estimator and the authors also prove that the algorithm has a sublinear convergence rate (in a specific sense). \n\nConsidering that the algorithm merely applies the zeroth-order gradient estimator to min-max problems, the algorithm itself only makes up a somewhat novel contribution. However, to the best of my knowledge, it has not been used in this context before and personally I find the algorithm quite appealing. In fact, due to its simplicity it is essentially something that anyone could implement from scratch. \n\nPerhaps a more important contribution is that the authors provide a fairly extensive convergence analysis, which is an important tool in analysing the algorithm and its properties. Unfortunately, it is not trivial to understand the presented convergence results and their practical implications (if any). For instance, equation (10), which is arguably one of the key equations in the paper, contains variables zeta, nu and P1, all of which depend on a number of other variables in a fairly complicated manner. The expression in (10) also contains terms that do not depend on T and it is not obvious how large these terms might be in practice (in the event that the assumptions are at least approximately true in a local region). Even though I am somewhat sceptical to the practical relevance of this convergence analysis, I recognise that it is an interesting and fascinating achievement that the authors have managed to provide a convergence analysis of an algorithm which is based on black-box min-max optimisation. \n"

I don't think this paper can be accepted for ICLR for the following reasons:\n\n1. For Setting (a) (One-sided black-box), the theory can be established by the same analysis for ZO optimization by optimizing y. Even by a proximal step for y, the analysis is essentially the same as ZO where an estimation of the gradient for x is conducted. \n\n2. The assumptions A1 and A2 are hardly satisfied in ML applications, where the objective is essentially smooth. The authors should at least analyze the case where a sub/super-gradients is available.\n\n3. Also, for most ML problems we have today, I don't find many applications where the gradients are not available, and I thus feel that it is not interesting to consider ZO optimizations."
