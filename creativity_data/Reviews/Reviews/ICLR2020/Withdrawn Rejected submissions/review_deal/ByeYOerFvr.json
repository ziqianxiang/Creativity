            "review": "This paper proposed to use a well-known technique namely mixture density networks (MDN) for offset regression tasks. The goal is to improve the localization accuracy on 2D human pose estimation.\n\nFirst of all, incorrect writing even exists in the title: \"... find viewpoint the dominant factor for\". I guess it is missing an \"as\".\n\nSecond, although the proposed method is technically sound, it lacks contributions that are significant enough to support a top machine learning conference such as ICLR. Basically, the proposed method proposes to add a loss term, derived from the well-known density estimation method (MDN), to solve a well-studied offset regression task. It is hard to identify significant contributions in terms of novelty.\n\nThird, the much-highlighted (even in the title) discovery, i.e. viewpoint is the dominant factor in offset regression, is trivial since it is not only an intuitively correct fact but also a conclusion that has been thoughtfully investigated in numerous previous publications."

            "review": "This paper proposes to apply mixture density estimation model on the offset regression problem in human pose estimation. The main motivation is to model the multi-modal nature of human pose and improve spatial accuracy. So the mixture density network proposed in this paper tries to first extract the viewpoint, which is the dominant multi-modal factor, and then any spatial regression problem can use the viewpoints to obtain higher accuracy.\n\nI am not quite in this field, but I have the following concerns of this paper:\n\n1. The objective (6) is a combination of 6 loss, which includes a binary classification, keypoint heatmap, offset regression, and so on. However, when these small problems are trained together (with even different weights), I was wondering how the importance is determined and how the performance was a tradeoff between the small losses. I know this is from the previous paper, but the intuition is not very clear. Moreover, things may need to be changed after the components get changed.\n\n2. Density estimation is considered as a difficult problem in high dimensional data, even using deep neural networks. This paper focuses on using it to model the conditional probability of a pose (offset vector) given an image, which can still be high (input is an image and output is 2K dimension vector). So I was wondering how the performance varies with the dimension of input and output data.\n\n3. I cannot find any comparison of the proposed method with the original L1 loss. The paper claims it’s in Table 3, but it’s not. \n\n4. The writing of the paper could be significantly improved.\n"

            "review": "Contribution\nIncorporates a mixture model on top of CenterNet for offset regression, and demonstrates improvements over the baseline (without refinement).\n \nOverall\nThe approach is well-motivated and the contribution is focused. The improvements on the test set seem significant but vanish after performing refinement. This is not a bad thing, as progress towards replacing the ad-hoc refinement procedure is valuable. However, I have questions about the conclusion of the paper: namely, whether viewpoint is actually the dominant mode.\n \nDecision\nMy current decision is weak reject. The work improved upon a baseline model of interest, and provided sufficient experimental analysis to demonstrate this. However, further analysis is warranted. I would be willing to improve this decision if further modeling extensions are implemented and analyzed.\n \nComments / Questions\nThe writing of most of the paper is clear, however I found section 4.1 confusing. Is the experiment here comparing whether conditioning on the input is better than using only the marginal distribution of mixture components (over all images)? Is a trained MDN model frozen, then you approximate the marginal distribution of mixture components via variational inference? Given that in the second model the mixture weights remain constant across images, it is surprising that this model does not do worse. I am also not sure what this experiment demonstrates beyond the importance of conditioning on given information.\n \nI would like to see experiments incorporating more structure. In the current model, each centerpoint is assigned a single mixture component. I am convinced by the current experiments that there are only marginal benefits to including more components in the given model. However, what if each offset was given its own latent variable, possibly with some interaction between nodes?\n \nI would like to see a fine-grained analysis of the differences between the means and variances of the mixture components. My hypothesis is that the mixture components are determined by “viewpoint” only because that determines whether the face is occluded by the back of the head. One could also check by sharing the means between mixture components. If this is true, then the means between the mixture components should be very similar, and only the variances would differ. This would also provide support for a more structured model, since various keypoints may be occluded independently.\n \nThe mixture model helps recover some of the gap between the baseline model and the post-refinement performance. What is needed to bridge the rest of the gap? Is the biggest problem dealing with occlusion?\n"
