        "comment": "This paper addresses the problem of estimating treatment responses involving a continuous dosage parameter.  The basic idea is to learn a GAN model capable of generating synthetic dose-response curves for each training sample, which then facilitates the supervised training of an inference model that estimates these curves for new cases.  For this purpose, specialized architectures are also proposed for the GAN, which involves a multi-task generator network and a hierarchical discriminator network.  Empirical results demonstrate improvement over existing methods.\n\nWhile there is always a chance that reviewers may underappreciate certain aspects of a submission, the fact that there was a unanimous decision to reject this work indicates that the contribution must be better marketed to the ML community.  For example, after the rebuttal one reviewer remained unconvinced regarding explanations for why the proposed method is likely to learn the full potential outcome distribution.  Among other things, another reviewer felt that both the proposed DRGAN model, and the GANITE framework upon which it is based, were not necessarily working as advertised in the present context.",

            "review": "Summary:\nTreatment Response Estimation \nDifferent from Average treatment effect because of multiple treatment and dosage parameters the problem gets complicated \nPreviously, other papers had tried to estimate ITE using distribution matching, propensity dropout  and matching on balancing scores.\nMost relevant benchmark DrNet(https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.00981.pdf)\nHere, authors use GANs to perform the task of Dose-response estimation instead of traditional methods. They use a counterfactual generator and counterfactual discriminator for the task. Generator is modeled as a multitask neural network and the discriminator is modeled as hierarchical network consisting of treatment and dosage discriminator.\nOverall, the model outperforms other baselines such as DRNet and GPS indicating improved dose-response estimation capabilities.\nPros:\nSignificant empirical advance? Did they solve a standing open problem?\nSignificant performance improvement   in defined metrics compared to previous methods such DrNet. This indicates the proposed methods are better for dose-response estimation.\nAny good practical outcome (code, algorithm, etc)?\nNovel neural network architectures used with counterfactual generator and counterfactual discriminator are interesting and these can be extended to other tasks.\nAre the experiments well executed?\nGood experiments in general. Source of gain experiment(section 6.2) provides deeper insight into why the model might perform better compared to other baselines.\n\nUseful for the community in general?\nYes it’s useful for the community as this is a challenging problem and estimating dose-response from observational data(EHR) is tricky.\n\nCons:\nAny missing baselines? Missing datasets?\nMissing baselines: TARNET, MLP, GANITE, kNN, BART. These baselines were evaluated in DrNet paper.\nAny odd design choices in the algorithm not explained well?\nWhy did authors use GAN with Vanilla loss function while it has been shown that there are other loss functions which can help in improving the performance? Perhaps evaluating the GAN with other loss function can provide further insight to the stability of the model\n\nQuality of writing?\nThe overall flow of the paper is a little hard to follow. \n\nIs the model better in terms of stability?\nCompared to DrNet Paper, is the model easy to train? Since the model uses a GAN loss function which are known for being hard to train, it would be good to evaluate the model in terms of difficulty of training.\n\nIs there sufficient novelty in what they propose? Minor variation of previous work?\nWhile this is a very interesting task, this paper falls under incremental improvement as it improves GANITE framework to solve dose-response estimation. As authors use GAN for counterfactual estimation which is not novel(GANITE) and estimating dose-response estimation is not novel(DrNet). \nSpecific Points\nIn comparison to DrNet Paper(Learning Counterfactual Representations for Estimating Individual Dose-Response Curves)\nSquare root of MISE is different for the datasets. \nIs it because of different hyperparameters?"

            "review": "The paper proposes a generative adversarial net model for heterogeneous dose-response causal effect estimation. The idea is to generate counterfactual dose-response curves using the generator that can fool the discriminator that tries to distinguish between factual data and counterfactual data. Factual data along with counterfactual data generated by the GAN can then be used for heterogeneous causal effect estimation. \n\nTo tailor to this specific heterogeneous dose-response curve estimation problem, the paper makes various architectural design modification from a regular GAN, such as using factual predictive performance as regularization, multitask for treatment option and dosage in the generator, hierarchical decomposition of the dose and response prediction in the discriminator, and permutation invariance when predicting the dosage-response curves for various treatment in the discriminator. These design choices are reasonably explained and the empirical gains due to these design choices are well documented (Table 2).\n\nA few concerns:\n\n1. It is unclear why using a GAN that seeks to produce samples that are indistinguishable from the factual ones will be the right way to synthesize counterfactual samples. Intuition and further justification need to be provided. Related to this concern, do the authors also implicitly reason under the consistency assumption (the observed/factual samples are the realizations potential outcomes of the corresponding treatment-dosage pairs in the potential outcome framework) ? If so, the authors should also reflect that in their list of assumptions.\n\n2. It is also unclear what kind of theoretical guarantees the proposed method could deliver. Since the setting considered by the paper is to formally estimate the dosage-response effect, such guarantees, while potentially challenging to derive, are nonetheless crucial to better understand the circumstances under which the proposed method is reliable/unreliable.  This is especially the case given the elusive use of GAN to generate counterfactual outcomes as mentioned in the previous concern.\n\n3. It will also be interesting to see whether the proposed method can be degenerated to handle simpler cases such as heterogeneous treatment effect estimation of binary treatment.  Or alternatively, when there is only one treatment option, where when treated there is a dosage-response curve while when not treated the dosage is zero. Related to this question, is this also the way to parameterize whether a subject receives a treatment or not in the model?\n\n"

            "review": "The paper introduces Dose Response Generative Adversarial Network (DRGAN) that is aimed at generating entire dose-response curve from observational data with single dose treatments. This work is an extension of GANITE (Yoon et al., 2018) for the case of real-valued treatments (i.e., dosage). The proposed model consists of 3 blocks: (1) a generator, (2) a discriminator, and (3) an inference block. In this paper, GANITE’s generator and discriminator architectures are modified to be able to handle real-valued treatments.\n\nThis paper should be rejected due to the following arguments:\n\t- Since the paper is based on GANITE, I’m going to start my review by pointing out the problems/questions I have about GANITE. First, let me briefly summarize my understanding of this method: \n\t\t+ Given (x, t, yf), the generator G tries to estimate counterfactual outcomes (ycf). \n\t\t+ Given (x, (yf, ycf)), the discriminator D tries to figure out which outcome was factual.\n\t\t+ Yoon et al. (2018) claims that optimizing a GAN with this G and D, the generator will become better and better at estimating accurate counterfactual outcomes.\nLooking at the objective function in Eq. (4), it is not clear why D should learn to distinguish factual from counterfactual outcome as opposed to learning the treatment selection bias as t.log(D(x ,y))+... would suggest. Yoon et al. (2018) assume the former while the latter seems more plausible. Of course, a by-product of learning the treatment selection bias is distinguishing yf from ycf, however, this doesn’t mean that G did a good job at generating an accurate estimation of ycf. \nIn summary, it seems that the adversarial training designed in GANITE and consequently DRGAN provide no advantage in terms of accurate estimation of counterfactuals, which in turn, nullifies the entire claimed contribution of these two works. I will, however, read the rebuttal carefully and am willing to modify the score if the authors address this major concern.\n\nReferences:\n\t- Yoon, J., Jordon, J., & van der Schaar, M. (2018). GANITE: Estimation of individualized treatment effects using generative adversarial nets.\n\n\n********UPDATE after reading the rebuttal********\nThank you for your response. \nStill, there are multiple issues with this reasoning that you need to address.\n\n$X$ is way more expressive than the added binary input that you described in the example. While the binary input is sampled from a Uniform distribution (either ½ or ⅔), $Pr(X|t=1)$ and $Pr(X|t=1)$ distributions are often Gaussian (certainly not Uniform) and therefore, embed a lot more information about which instances should receive which treatment. Therefore, $X$ is way more informative about selection bias than your binary input is about the image being fake/real. Do not underestimate this!! \n\nIt is true that the discriminator reaches its maximum loss when the generator’s estimation of the counterfactual is spot on. That is, it simply predicts the administered treatment according to the treatment selection bias. You need to show, however, that this maxima is global. Otherwise, there could be infinite maximas with the same loss; e.g., why not simply $Y^{factual} = Y^{counterfactual}$ does not reach this maxima? \n\nYou also need to show that the added information to $X$ by concatenating it with the factual outcome plus the generator’s estimation of the counterfactual outcome do improve prediction of the administered treatment -- i.e., minimizing the discriminator loss.\n\nTo summarize, I am not yet convinced that either GANITE or DRGAN do what they claim.\n\n",
