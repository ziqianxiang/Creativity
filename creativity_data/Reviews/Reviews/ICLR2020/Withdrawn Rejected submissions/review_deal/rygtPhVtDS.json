        "comment": "This paper has a mixture of weak reviews, the majority of which lean towards reject. All reviews mention a lack of novelty, and 2 of 3 a lack of support in experiments. While the authors argue, perhaps legitimately, for the novelty of the paper with respect to current literature, this is not convincing in the exposition. I recommend that the authors improve the justification for the novelty of their methodology, and strengthen the experiments to convince reviewers. As it stands, this paper is not quite ready for publication.",

The paper also further gives an interpretation of the method, as a form of smoothing the curvature of the density function. It further proves the consistency of the method.\n\nPros:\n(i) The paper is well written.\n(ii) The method is simple to implement.\n(iii) The authors demonstrate a clear intuition of what the method does, i.e., as a form of smoothing.\n\nCons:\n(i)  The method itself is not novel. Adding noise to for regularization is a quite common technique used in many different applications.\n(ii) The experiments performed in the paper are all very small scaled. Not very convincing.\n(iii) Continuing the last point, it is unclear whether such technique can be scaled up. The method in another view is to replace the empirical distribution with a kernel density estimate. We know kernel methods don't scale. It's hence questionable whether the method can give any benefits in large scale dataset.\n(iv) If the use of noise regularization is to smooth the density function, how does it compare to methods that enforces Lipschitz continuity? e.g., gradient penalty, or construct a lipschtz constrained network such as in [1].\n\n[1] Sorting out lipschitz function approximation.

Adding noise on x (e.g., [1]), y (e.g., [2]) is not new. Though it is claimed that this paper extends previous results on classification/regression to conditional density estimation which is a more general case. This claim is not well supported. Experiments are still evaluated in classification/regression tasks.\n\n2.

            "review": "The paper considers the problem of parametric conditional density estimation, i.e. given a set of points {(x_n, y_n)} drawn from a distribution $p(x,y)$, the task is to estimate the conditional distribution p(x|y). The paper considers parametric estimation where in given a parametrized family of distributions f_{theta} we wish to minimize the likelihood of seeing the given data over theta. The parametric family in a lot of applications consists of highly expressive families like neural networks, which leads to the issue of overfitting in small data regimes. This has been tackled via regularization over the parameter space which might be hard to interpret as the associated inductive bias is not well understood and depends on the parametric family under consideration. On the other hand the paper proposes to add explicit noise in the examples used during training, i.e. irrespective of the optimization procedure (which could be mini-bath sgd) the paper proposes to draw examples from the data set, explicitly add noise onto the examples and create a proxy objective over the augmented data set. \n\nThe paper establishes two theoretical results. First is a simple taylor approximation based analysis to highlight the effect of the variance of noise. The conclusion is that higher variance penalizes the high curvature areas of the resultant density and hence this kind of noise addition could be seen as making resulting density smoother. The second contribution is to show that this procedure is asymptotically consistent, i.e. as n goes to infinity and the number of augmented data points go to infinity, the resulting density converges to the target density. This of course requires the noise variance to follow a decreasing schedule to 0. \n\nThe main merit of the idea is in its agnostic nature, as it can be applied to any parametric family and the experiements show that it seems to uniform improvement across models,  The basic idea proposed by the error, has existed in the space of deep learning based methods forever. This is the same idea behind image augmentation which forms a crucial part of training supervised models in vision. The authors claim that this idea is novel in the space of parametric density estimation, however I do not know enough about the area to verify the claim. It would surprise that this very natural idea has not been tried before. \n\nI have gone through the theoretical derivations in the paper and they look sound to me. However the results are all asymptotic in nature without establishing explicit rates which is a little bit of disappointment. Since I am not completely familiar in nature, but I guess such asymptotic consistency might be achievable using other forms of regularization under suitable assumptions. In that light, the theoretical contributions while being sound did not lend much intuition about why such a method might outperform others. Intuition does arise from the derivation for the effect of noise on the objective which helps understand the nature of the noise, but one wonders if similar intuitions could be derived for other forms of regularization as well. It would be great to see this derivation being extended to some concrete scenarios under well understood parametric families and seeing the effect explicitly. \n\nRegarding the experiments - The experiments definitely look promising as the improvments seem uniformly good across the cases considered. I am not an expert however in this setting so it is hard for me to judge the quality and significance of the benchmarks. The experiment methodology nevertheless looks sound. \n"
