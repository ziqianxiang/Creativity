I thought their proposed solution was innovative, and I enjoyed the paper. The presentation is clear and it has nice experiments. \n\nComments/questions:\n1) What is the dimensionality of the feature embeddings? \n2) SNPtoVec still requires training a very fat autoencoder network on X --- I suppose this doesn't contribute to the size of the final run-time model and overfitting is avoided because the parameters are fit in an unsupervised manner?\n\n",

            "title": "Interesting but somewhat early work on deep learning with very high dimensional genomic data",
            "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold",
            "review": "The paper presents an application of deep learning to genomic SNP data\nwith a comparison of possible approaches for dealing with the very\nhigh data dimensionality. The approach looks very interesting but the\nexperiments are too limited to draw firm conclusions about the\nstrengths of different approaches. The presentation would benefit from\nmore precise math.\n\n\nQuality:\n\nThe basic idea of the paper is interesting and the applied deep\nlearning methodology appears reasonable. The experimental evaluation\nis rather weak as it only covers a single data set and a very limited\nnumber of cross validation folds. Given the significant variation in\nthe performances of all the methods, it seems the differences between\nthe better-performing methods are probably not statistically\nsignificant. More comprehensive empirical validation could clearly\nstrengthen the paper.\n\n\nClarity:\n\nThe writing is generally good both in terms of the biology and ML, but\nmore mathematical rigour would make it easier to understand precisely\nwhat was done. The different architectures are explained on an\nintuitive level and might benefit from a clear mathematical\ndefinition. I was ultimately left unsure of what the \"raw end2end\"\nmodel is - given so few parameters it cannot work on raw 300k\ndimensional input but I could not figure out what kind of embedding\nwas used.\n\nThe results in Fig. 3 might be clearer if scaled so that maximum for\neach class is 1 to avoid confounding from different numbers of\nsubjects in different classes. In the text, please use the standard\nitalics math font for all symbols such as N, N_d, ...\n\n\nOriginality:\n\nThe application and the approach appear quite novel.\n\n\nSignificance:\n\nThere is clearly strong interest for deep learning in the genomics\narea and the paper seeks to address some of the major bottlenecks\nhere. It is too early to tell whether the specific techniques proposed\nin the paper will be the ultimate solution, but at the very least the\npaper provides interesting new ideas for others to work on.\n\n\nOther comments:\n\nI think releasing the code as promised would be a must.\n",
