The main idea and results are presented clearly, along with illustrative side-experiments showing the properties of this method in practice. Also, the method is illustrated on non-toy problems.",

            "review": "This paper proposes to use an empirical Bayesian approach to learn the parameters of a neural network, and their priors.\nA mixture model prior over the weights leads to a clustering effect in the weight posterior distributions (which are approximated with delta peaks). \nThis clustering effect can exploited for parameter quantisation and compression of the network parameters.\nThe authors show that this leads to compression rates and predictive accuracy comparable to related approaches. \n\nEarlier work [Han et al. 2015] is based on a three-stage process of pruning small magnitude weights, clustering the remaining ones, and updating the cluster centres to optimise performance. The current work provides a more principled approach that does not have such an ad-hoc multi-stage structure, but a single iterative optimisation process.\n\nA first experiment, described in section 6.1 shows that an empirical Bayesâ€™ approach, without the use of hyper priors, already leads to a pronounced clustering effect and to setting many weights to zero. \nIn particular a compression rate of 64.2 is obtained on the LeNet300-100 model.\nIn section 6.1 the text refers to figure C, I suppose this should be figure 1.\n\nSection 6.2 describes an experiment where hyper-priors are used, and the parameters of these distributions, as well as other hyper-parameters such as the learning rates, are being optimised using Spearmint (Snoek et al., 2012). Figure 2 shows the performance of the  different points in the hyper-parameter space that have been evaluated (each trained network gives an accuracy-compressionrate point in the graph). The text claims that best results lie on a line, this seems a little opportunistic interpretation given the limited data. Moreover, it would be useful to add a small discussion on whether such a linear relationship would be expected or not. Currently the results of this experiment lack interpretation.\n\nSection 6.3 describes results obtained for both CNN models and compares results to the recent results of (Han et al., 2015) and (Guo et al., 2016).\nComparable results are obtained in terms of compression rate and accuracy. \nThe authors state that their current algorithm is too slow to be useful for larger models such as VGG-19, but they do briefly report some results obtained for this model (but do not compare to related work). It would be useful here to explain what slows the training down with respect to standard training without the weight clustering approach, and how the proposed algorithm scales in terms of the relevant quantities of the data and the model.\n\nThe contribution of this paper is mostly experimental, leveraging fairly standard ideas from empirical Bayesian learning to introduce weight clustering effects in CNN training.\nThis being said, it is an interesting result that such a relatively straightforward approach leads to results that are on par with state-of-the-art, but more ad-hoc, network compression techniques.\nThe paper could be improved by clearly describing the algorithm used for training, and how it scales to large networks and datasets.\nAnother point that would deserve further discussion is how the hyper-parameter search is performed ( not using test data I assume), and how the compared methods dealt with the search over hyper-parameters to determine the accuracy-compression tradeoff. Ideally, I think, methods should be evaluated across different points on this trade-off.\n\n",

            "rating": "7: Good paper, accept",
            "review": "The authors propose a method to compress neural networks by retraining them while putting a mixture of Gaussians prior on the weights with learned means and variances which then can be used to compress the neural network by first setting all weights to the mean of their infered mixture component (resulting in a possible loss of precision) and storing the network in a format which saves only the fixture index and exploits the sparseness of the weights that was enforced in training.\n\nQuality:\nOf course it is a serious drawback that the method doesn't seem to work on VGG which would render the method unusable for production (as it is right now, maybe this can be improved). I guess AlexNet takes too long to process, too, otherwise this might be a very valuable addition.\nIn Figure 2 I am noticing two things: On the left, there is a large number of points with improved accuracy which is not the case for LeNet5-Caffe. Is there any intuition for why that's the case? Additionally regarding the spearmint optimization: Do they authors have found any clues about which hyperparameter settings worked well? This might be helpful for other people trying to apply this method.\nI really like Figure 7 in it's latest version.\n\nClarity:\nEspecially section 2 on MDL is written very well and gives a nice theoretic introduction. Sections 4, 5 and 6 are very short but seem to contain most relevant information. It might be helpful to have at least some more details about the used models in the paper (maybe the number of layers and the number of parameters).\nIn 6.1 the authors claim \"Even though most variances seem to be reasonable small there are some that are large\". From figure 1 this is very hard to assess, especially as the vertical histogram essentially shows only the zero component. It might be helpful to have either a log histogram or separate histograms for each componenent. What are the large points in Figure 2 as opposed to the smaller ones? They seem to have a very good compression/accuracy loss ratio, is that it?\nSome other points are listed below\n\noriginality: While there has been some work on compressing neural networks by using a reduced number of bits to store the parameters and exploiting sparsity structure, I like the idea to directly learn the quantization by means of a gaussian mixture prior in retraining which seems to be more principled than other approaches\n\nsignificance: The method achievs state-of-the-art performance on the two shown examples on MNIST, however these networks are far from the deep networks used in state-of-the-art models. This obviously is a drawback for the practical usability of the methods and therefor it's significance. If the method could be made to work on more state-of-the-art networks like VGG or ResNet, I would consider this a contribution of high significance.\n\nMinor issues:\n\npage 1: There seems to be a space in front of the first author's name\npage 3: \"in this scenario, pi_0 may be fixed...\". Missing backslash in TeX?\npage 6: 6.2: two wrong blanks in \"the number of components_, \\tau_.\"\npage 6, 6.3: \"in experiences with VGG\": In experiments?\npage 12: \"Figure C\": Figure 7?\n",
