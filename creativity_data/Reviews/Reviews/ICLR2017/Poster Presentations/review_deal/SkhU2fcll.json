        "comment": "The reviews for this paper were quite mixed, with one strong accept and a marginal reject. A fourth reviewer with strong expertise in multi-task learning and deep learning was brought in to read the latest manuscript. Due to time constraints, this fourth review was not entered in the system but communicated through personal communication. \n \n Pros:\n - Reviewers in general found the paper clear and well written.\n - Multi-task learning in deep models is of interest to the community\n - The approach is sensible and the experiments show that it seems to work\n \n Cons:\n - Factorization methods have been used extensively in deep learning, so the reviewers may have found the approach incremental\n - One reviewer was not convinced that the proposed method would work better than existing multi-task learning methods\n - Not all reviewers were convinced by the experiments\n - The fourth reviewer found the approach very sensible but was not excited enough to champion the paper\n \n The paper was highly regarded by at least one reviewer and two thought it should be accepted. The PCs also agree that this paper deserves to appear at the conference.",

The presentation is clean and clear and experimental justification is convincing. \n\nAs mentioned, including discussions on the effect of model size vs. performance would be useful in the final version and also work in other fields related to this. \n\nOne question on Sec. 3.3, to build the DMTRL, one DNN per-task is trained with the same architecture. How important is this pretraining? Would random initialization also work here? If the data is unbalanced, namely, some classes have very few examples, how would that affect the model?\n\n\n\n",

            "review": "The paper proposed a nice framework leveraging Tucker and Tensor train low-rank tensor factorization to induce parameter sharing for multi-task learning.\n\nThe framework is nice and appealing. \n\nHowever, MTL is a very well studied problem and the paper considers simple task for different classification, and it is not clear if we really need ``Deep Learning\" for these simple datasets. A comparison with existing shallow MTL is necessary to show the benefits of the proposed methods (and in particular being deep) on the dataset. The authors ignore them on the basis of speculation and it is not clear if the proposed framework is really superior to simple regularizations like the nuclear norm. The idea of nuclear norm regularization can also be extended to deep learning as gradient descent are popular in all methods. ",

            "review": "This paper proposed a deep multi-task representation learning framework that learns cross-task sharing structure at every layer in a deep network with tensor factorization and end-to-end knowledge sharing. This approach removed the requirement of a user-deÔ¨Åned multi-task sharing strategy in conventional approach. Their experimental results indicate that their approach can achieve higher accuracy with fewer design choices.\n\nAlthough factorization ideas have been exploited in the past for other tasks I think applying it to MTL is interesting. The only thing I want to point out is that the saving of parameter is from the low-rank factorization. In the conventional MTL each layer's weight size can also be reduced if SVD is used. \n\nBTW, recent neural network MTL was explored first (earlier than 2014, 2015 work cited) in speech recognition community. see, e.g., \n\nHuang, J.T., Li, J., Yu, D., Deng, L. and Gong, Y., 2013, May.
