        "comment": "This paper received borderline reviews. All reviewers as well as AC agree that the authors pursue a very interesting and less explored direction. The paper essentially addresses the problem of double grounding; visual information helping to group acoustic signal into words, and words helping to localize object-like regions in images. While somewhat hidden under the rug, this is what makes the paper different from the authors' previous work. The reviewers mentioned this to be a minor contribution. The AC agrees with the authors that this is an interesting and novel problem worth studying. However, the AC also agrees with the reviewers that this major novelty over the previous work is missing technical depth. The AC strongly encourages the authors to improve on this aspect of the paper. A simple intuition would be to look at https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.01704 in order to discover words, and use something along the lines of attention (eg https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03044) to link with image regions."

            "review": "CONTRIBUTIONS \nThis paper introduces a method for learning semantic \"word-like\" units jointly from audio and visual data. The authors use a multimodal neural network architecture which accepts both image and audio (as spectrograms) inputs. Joint training allows one to embed both image and spoken language captions into a shared representation space. Audio-visual groundings are generated by measuring affinity between image patches and audio clips. This allows the model to relate specific visual regions to specific audio segments. Experiments cover image search (audio to image) and annotation (image to audio) tasks and acoustic word discovery.\n\n\nNOVELTY+SIGNIFICANCE\nAs correctly mentioned in Section 1.2, the computer vision and natural language communities have studied multimodal learning for use in image captioning and retrieval. With regards to multimodal learning, this paper offers incremental advancements since it primarily uses a novel combination of input modalities (audio and images).\n\nHowever, bidirectional image/audio retrieval has already been explored by the authors in prior work (Harwath et al, NIPS 2016). Apart from minor differences in data and CNN architecture, the training procedure in this submission is identical to this prior work. The novelty in this submission is therefore the procedure for using the trained model for associating image regions with audio subsequences.\n\nThe methods employed for this association are relatively straightforward combination of standard techniques with limited novelty. The trained model is used to compute alignment scores between densely sampled image regions and audio subsequences; from these alignment scores a number of heuristics are applied to associate clusters of image regions with clusters of audio subsequences.\n\n\nMISSING CITATION\nThere is a lot of work in this area spanning computer vision, natural language, and speech recognition. One key missing reference:\n\nNgiam, et al. \"Multimodal deep learning.\" ICML 2011\n\n\nPOSITIVE POINTS\n- Using more data and an improved CNN architecture, this paper improves on prior work for bidirectional image/audio retrieval\n- The presented method performs efficient acoustic pattern discovery\n- The audio-visual grounding combined with the image and acoustic cluster analysis is successful at discovering audio-visual cluster pairs\n\nNEGATIVE POINTS\n- Limited novelty, especially compared with Harwath et al, NIPS 2016\n- Although it gives good results, the clustering method has limited novelty and feels heuristic\n- The proposed method includes many hyperparameters (patch size, acoustic duration, VAD threshold, IoU threshold, number of k-means clusters, etc) and there is no discussion of how these were set or the sensitivity of the method to these choices\n",

            "review": "This paper is a follow-up on the NIPS 2016 paper \"Unsupervised learning of spoken language with visual context\", and does exactly what that paper proposes in its future work section: \"to perform acoustic segmentation and clustering, effectively learning a lexicon of word-like units\" using the embeddings that their system learns. The analysis is very interesting and I really like where the authors are going with this.\n\nMy main concern is novelty. It feels like this work is a rather trivial follow-up on an existing model, which is fine, but then the analysis should be more satisfying: currently, it feels like the authors are just illustrating some of the things that the NIPS model (with some minor improvements) learns. For a more interesting analysis, I would have liked things like a comparison of different segmentation approaches (both in audio and in images), i.e., suppose we have access to the perfect segmentation in both modalities, what happens? It would also be interesting to look at what is learned with the grounded representation, and evaluate e.g. on multi-modal semantics tasks.\n\nApart from that, the paper is well written and I really like this research direction. It is very important to analyze what models learn, and this is a good example of the types of questions one should ask. I am afraid, however, that the model is not novel enough, nor the questions deep enough, to make this paper better than borderline for ICLR.",

            "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold",
            "review": "This work proposes a joint classification of images and audio captions for the task of word like discovery of acoustic units that correlate to semantically visual objects. The general this is a very interesting direction of research as it allows for a richer representation of data: regularizing visual signal with audio and visa versa. This allows for training of visual models from video, etc. \n\nA major concern is the amount of novelty between this work and the author's previous publication at NIPs 2016. The authors claim a more sophisticated architecture and indeed show an improvement in recall. However, the improvements are marginal, and the added complexity to the architecture is a bit ad hoc. Clustering and grouping in section 4, is hacky. Instead of gridding the image, the authors could actually use an object detector (SSD, Yolo, FasterRCNN, etc.) to estimate accurate object proposals; rather than using k-means, a spectral clustering approach would alleviate the gaussian assumption of the distributions. In assigning visual hypotheses with acoustic segments, some form of bi-partite matching should be used.\n\nOverall, I really like this direction of research, and encourage the authors to continue developing algorithms that can train from such multimodal datasets. However, the work isn't quite novel enough from NIPs 2016.",
