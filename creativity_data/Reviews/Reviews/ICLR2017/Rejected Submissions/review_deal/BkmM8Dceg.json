        "comment": "The reviewers found the idea interesting and practical but had concerns about the novelty of the approach and the claims and theory presented in the paper. In particular, it seems that the reviewers feel that the authors' claim to present novel theory is unjustified (i.e. the theorems presented are not novel). Also claims regarding the advantages of this approach relative to related literature (in particular Dieleman et al. and Cohen & Welling) seem to be unsubstantiated. This work would likely be more well received just through rewriting the manuscript with, as stated by AnonReviewer3, \"a more thorough and balanced appraisal of the merits and demerits, as well as the novelty, relative to each of the previous works\" and weakening the claims of novel theory."

However, if the authors require it, I can be more specific. I think the writing should be improved a bit.",

            "review": "The paper shows how group convolutions (for two dimensional commutative groups) can be performed by standard CNNs if the input is warped using a fixed warp. The idea is practical and seems to work well. The paper is well written.\n\nI agree with reviewer 1 that the ‘theorems’ do not deserve to be labelled as such. Theorem 1 is equivalent to the second equation from this section of the wikipedia page on convolution: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution#Convolutions_on_groups. The existence of Haar measure (from which commutation of Lg and convolution follows immediately) is a well known and elementary theorem in harmonic analysis, which would be treated in the first few pages of any textbook on the subject. It also immediately clear that any commutative group has an additive parameterization (theorem 2). The fact that the paper does not present new deep mathematical results is not a significant weakness in my opinion, but the derivations should not be camouflaged as such.\n\nThe claim that previous methods that use group convolutions are slow and that the presented approach has better computational complexity is not supported by empirical evidence, and the theoretical analysis is still a bit misleading. For example, the authors write “Unfortunately these approaches do not possess the same memory and speed benefits that CNNs enjoy. The reason is that, ultimately, they have to enumerate all possible transformations”. The presented method also has to enumerate all transformations (in a limited range, on a discretized grid), and this is feasible only because the group is only 2 dimensional (and indeed this is also true for standard CNNs which enumerate translations). \n\nAs noted in my pre-review question, I believe the computational complexity analysis is not entirely correct, and assume the authors will correct this.\n\nEquation 4 is presented as a new invention, but this has been used in previous works and is well known in mathematics, so a citation should be added.\n\nThe main advantage of the presented method over several earlier methods is that it is very simple to implement, and can re-use highly optimized convolution routines. As I understand it, Dieleman et al. and Cohen & Welling also use standard convolutions (after a fixed filter / feature map warp), but these papers only consider discrete groups. So it seems like this paper occupies a unique place in the space of equivariant convolutional networks: non-commutative (-), low-dimensional (-), continuous (+) groups, simple (+) and efficient (+) algorithm. Given the proximity though, a more thorough and balanced appraisal of the merits and demerits, as well as the novelty, relative to each of the previous works would be useful. \n\nProvided that these issues are cleared up, I would recommend the paper for publication.",
