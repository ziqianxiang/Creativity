        "comment": "The reviewers agree that the work presents interesting, but incremental, results. They are also unconvinced that this is the right direction for research on dialogue systems to go in or that the methods presented will appeal to a broader audience. It seems the authors have some work to do on the larger argument, before this work can be accepted."

            "review": "The paper is clearly interesting in that it does address important problems (length and diversity of responses) in sequence-to-sequence models. The two ideas put forward (glimpse model and segment-based stochastic decoding) both seem ideas in the right direction. I was however not so sold on the argument that these are particularly suitable for conversations.\n\nThe results indicate that the ideas do indeed generate longer and also somewhat more sensible target sequences and as such the paper makes progress w.r.t these important problems. So overall I would suggest accepting the paper even though the flavor of the proposed ideas are somewhat \"small steps\". ",

            "review": "This paper considers the problem of generating long and diverse responses in dialog systems. Two techniques are proposed to the seq-to-seq framework: (1) glimpse model that trains on fixed-length segments of the target side at a time, and (2) a segment-based stochastic decoding technique which injects diversity earlier in the generated responses. The large scale experiments on 2.3B conversation messages are quite impressive.  Experiments on human evaluation should also be encouraged. \n\nWith all these said, I am still not 100% convinced that machine generated long sequence is the right direction for dialog systems. As shown in Figure 3 (a), human evaluation shows that the proposed system is not significantly better than the baselines. I think more analysis and user preference mining should be done in the future to help us understand the nature of this problem. ",

Essentially we try to generate long responses that sound ``nice\" yet are not grounded to any reality, they just need to be related to the question and not suffers from obvious mistakes. Yet, the architectural innovations proposed may be of merit.",
