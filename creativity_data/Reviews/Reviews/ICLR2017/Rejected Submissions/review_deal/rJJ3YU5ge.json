This seems to be a better fit for venues that focus more on production systems, and seems to be a bad fit for ICLR where the focus is more on research of novel algorithms and theories. ",

            "review": "This paper introduces a large-scale multi-model product classification system. The model consists of three modules, Image CNN (VGG 16 architecture), text CNN (Kim 2014) and decision-level fusion policies. The authors have tried several fusion methods: including policies taking inputs from text and image CNN probabilities; choose either CNN; average the predictions; end-to-end training. Experimental results show that text CNN alone works better than image CNN and multi-model fusion can improve the accuracy by a small margin. It is a little bit surprising that end-to-end feature level fusion works worse than text CNN alone. The writing is clear and there are a lot of useful practical experiences of learning large-scale model. However, I lean toward rejecting the paper because the following:\n\n1) No other dataset reported. The authors haven't mentioned releasing the walmart dataset and it is going to be really hard to reproduce the results without the dataset. \n2) Technical novelty is limited. All the decision-level fusion policies have been investigated by some previous methods before. \n3) Performance gain is also limited. ",

But perhaps some insights as to whether the incorrect decisions are humanly possible would help with significance of the results.\n- Could have explored some intermediate architectures such as feature fusion + class probabilities with/without finetuning. There are no feature fusion results reported.\n- No evaluation on standard datasets or comparison to previous works.\n\nWhat is the policy learnt for CP-1? Given 2 input class probabilities, how does the network perform better than max or mean?\n",
