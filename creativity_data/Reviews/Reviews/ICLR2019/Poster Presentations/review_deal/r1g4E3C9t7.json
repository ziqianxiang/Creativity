            "review": "This paper proposed a study on audio adversarial examples and conclude the input transformation-based defenses do not work very well on the audio domain, especially for adaptive attacks. They also point out the importance of temporal dependency in designing defenses which is specific for the audio domain. This observation is very interesting and inspiring as temporal dependency is an important character that should be paid attention to in the field of audio adversarial examples. They also design some adaptive attacks to the defense based on temporal dependency but either fail to attack the system or can be detected by the defense.\n\nBased on the results in Table S7, it seems like being aware of the parameter k when designing attacks are very helpful for reducing the AUC score. My question is if the attacker uses the random sample K_A to generate the adversarial examples, then how the performance would be. Another limitation of this work is that the proposed defense can differentiate the adversarial examples to some extent, but the ASR is not able to make a right prediction for adversarial examples. In addition, the writing of Section 4 is not very clear and easy to follow.\n\nIn all, this paper proposed some interesting findings and point out a very important direction for audio adversarial examples. If the author can improve the writing in experiments and answer the above questions, I would support for the acceptance.\n\n\n",

            "review": "This paper presents a study of the problem of generating adversarial examples for speech processing systems. Two versions of this problem are considered: attacks against audio classification and against text to speech. The authors first study a the practice of input transformations as means of defense against adversarial examples. To do so, they evaluate three recent adversarial attacks on audio classification and TTS models trained on several datasets. It is found that input transformations have limited utility against adaptive attacks. Moreover, a novel type of defense is developed in which the prefix (of some fixed length) of the audio input is converted to text and compared with the prefix of the text output of the entire input, flagging the input as adversarial if sufficient mismatch is detected. It is found that this method is robust against a number of attacks.\n\nThis paper tackles a relevant problem and presents some surprising (the robustness of the prefix method) as well as some not surprising results. The evaluation has reasonable enough breadth to give the conclusions credibility. \n\nMy main complaint is that the exposition is somewhat hard to follow at places, especially in section 4. It is hard to keep track of which attack is applied to which scenario and what the conclusions were. Perhaps this could be summarized in some kind of high-level table. It would also be greatly beneficial if the attacks are briefly summarized somewhere. E.g., without following the references, it is completely unclear what is the \"Commander Song\" setting and what is it important. \nFinally, I would advise the authors to not use the term \"first k portion\". This made understanding their proposed defense much harder than it needed to be. Perhaps \"prefix of length k\" or something along these lines would be easier to follow. \n\nIn summary, if the authors commit to improving the clarity of the paper,  I would be willing to support its acceptance by virtue of the breadth of the investigation and the importance of the problem.",

            "review": "This paper investigates adversarial examples for audio data. The standard defense techniques proposed for images are studied in the context of audio. It is shown that these techniques are somewhat robust to adversarial attacks, but fail against adaptive attacks. A method exploiting the temporal dependencies of the data is then presented and shown to be robust to adversarial examples and to adaptive attacks.\n\nThe paper addresses an important issue, and the two main findings of the paper, the transformation methods used in computer vision are not useful against audio adversarial example and using temporal dependencies improves the defense capability are significant. The proposed TD method is novel.\n\nThe first part of the paper is easy to read (Section 1-3), but Section 4 is hard to follow, for the following reasons:\n* Section 4.1 presents the metrics used in the evaluation, which is nice. But in the following subsections, other metrics are used: effectiveness ratio, detection rate and relative perturbation. They should be clearly defined in 4.1, and the authors should discuss why they used these metrics.\n* Section 4.2 should be reorganized as it is hard to follow: there are three types of attack, so one subsection per attack should make the section clearer.\n* It's not always clear what each attack is doing and why it is used. I suggest the authors to have a separate subsection with the description of each attack and the motivation of why it is used.\n\nBecause of the above, it's hard to clearly assess the performance of each method for each attack, it would be better to have a Table that summarizes the results for the transformation methods. Also, I don't understand the statement in 4.2: \"We report that the autoencoder works fine for transforming benign instances (57.6% WER in Common Voice compared to 27.5%)\": given that it's not an attack, the PER should be the same with and without transform, as we don't want the transform to affect non-adversarial examples ? Please clarify that.\nThe experiments on the proposed TD method are clear enough to show the viability of the approach.\n\nOverall, the findings of this paper are significant and it is good step towards audio adversarial examples defense. But the experimental part is hard to follow and does not bring a clear picture. I am still willing to accept the paper if the authors improve and clarify Section 4.\n\nRevision after rebuttal:\nThe new version is definitely clearer and easier to read, hence I support the paper for acceptance and change my rating to 7. \nThere are still minor improvements that can be done in Section 4 to improve the overall clarity:\n* About the metrics, the \"Average attack success rate\" and the \"Target command recognition rate\" should be clearly defined, probably under the description of the attack methods.\n* The Adaptive attack approach could be introduced unter \"Attack methods\" in 4.1.\n* Table 4 is not easy to read, the authors should improve it.\n* The first paragraph in Section 4 (\"The presentation flows ...\") is very interesting, but almost reads like a conclusion, so maybe the authors could move that to the end of Section 4 or to Section 5.",
