They start from a linear network to derive the theory, identifying phases in the learning, and relating learning rates to task structure and SNR. The theory is thorough and backed up by numerical simulations, including qualitative comparisons to nonlinear networks. \n\nThe intuition behind alignment of tasks \n\nCons: Most of the theory is developed on a linear network in an abstracted teacher/student/TA framework, where the analysis revolves around the the SVD of the weights. It's unclear to what extent the theory would generalize not only to deep, nonlinear networks (which the paper addresses empirically) but also different structures in the task that are not well approximated by the SVD.",

            "review": "Most theoretical work on understanding generalization in deep learning provides very loose bounds and does not adequately explain this phenomena. Moreover, their is also a gap in our understanding of knowledge transfer across tasks. \n\nThe authors study a simple model of linear networks. They give analytic bounds on train/test error of linear networks as a function of training time, number of examples, network size, initialization, task structure and SNR. They argue that their results indicate that deep networks progressively learn the most important task structure first, so the generalization at the early stopping primarily depends on task structure and is independent of network size. This explains previous observations about real data being learned faster than random data. Interestingly, they show a learning algorithm that provably out-performs gradient-descent training. They show that how knowledge transfer in their model depends on SNRs and input feature alignments of task-pairs.\n\nThe theoretical framework of low-rank noisy teachers using a more complex (e.g., wider or deeper) student network is simple and allows them to use random matrix theory to understand and interpret  interesting scenarios such as random initialization vs. training-aligned initialization. Fig. 5 shows that even though the theoretical framework is for linear networks, many of the observations hold even for non-linear (leaky ReLU) networks. They also offer a reasonable explanation for learning random vs. real data in terms of how the signal singular values get diluted or spread over many modes.\n\nI do not think that the generalization bounds given by the authors are any tighter than previous attempts. However, I think their theoretical and experimental contributions to provide quantitative and qualitative explainations of various interesting phenomena in deep learning are both solid enough to merit acceptance.",

            "title": "Interesting analysis of deep linear networks and task structure",
            "review": "This paper builds on the long recent tradition of analyzing deep linear neural networks. In addition to an ample appendix bringing the page total to 20, the authors went over the recommended eight pages, hitting the hard limit of 10 and thus per reviewing directions will be held to a higher standard than the other (mostly 8-page) papers. \n\nThe recent literature on deep linear networks has explored many paths with the hope of producing insights that might help explain the performance of deep neural networks. A recent line of papers by Soudry and Srebro among others focuses on the behavior of stochastic gradient descent. This paper’s analysis comes from a different angle, following the work by Saxe et al (2013) whose analysis considers a (classic one hidden layer) linear teacher network that generates labels and a corresponding student trained to match those labels. The analysis hinges on the singular value decomposition of the composite weight matrix USV^T = W = W^{32} W^{21}.\n\nOne aim of the present work, that appears to be a unique contribution above the prior work is to focus on the role played by task structure, suggesting that certain notions of task structure may play a more significant role than architecture and that any bounds which consider architecture but not task structure are doomed to be excessively loose. \n\nTo facilitate their analysis, the authors consider an artificial setup that requires some specific properties. For example, the number of inputs are equal to the input dimension of the network, with the inputs themselves being orthonormal. The labeling function includes a noise term and the singular values of the teacher model admit an interpretation as signal to noise ratios. Given their setup, the authors can express the train and test errors analytically in terms of the weight matrices of the teacher and student and the input-output covariance matrix. The authors then analyze the gradient descent dynamics in what appears to follow the work of Saxe 2013 although I am not an expert on that paper. The analysis focuses on the time dependent evolution of the singular values of the student model, characterized via a set of differential equations.\n\nThe next analysis explores a condition that the authors dub “training aligned” initial conditions. This involves initializing the student weights to have the same singular vectors as the training data input-output covariance but with all singular values equal to some amount epsilon. The authors show that the learning dynamics give rise to what they characterize as a singular value “detection wave”. Detecting the modes in descending order by their corresponding singular values.\n\nA set of synthetic experiments show close alignment between theory and experiment.\n\nSection 3.5 offers just one paragraph on a “qualitative comparison to nonlinear networks”. A few issues here are that aesthetically, one-paragraph subsections are not ideal. More problematic is that this theory presumably is building towards insights that might actually be useful towards understanding deep non-linear networks. Since the present material is only interesting as an analytic instrument, I would have hoped for greater emphasis on these connections, with perhaps some hypotheses about the behavior of nonlinear nets driven by this analysis that might subsequently be confirmed or refuted. \n\nThe paper concludes with two sections discussing what happens when nets are trained on randomly labeled data and knowledge transfer across related tasks respectively. \n\nOverall I think the paper is well-written and interesting, and while I haven’t independently verified every proof, the technical analysis appears to be interesting and sound. The biggest weaknesses of this paper---for this audience, which skews empirical---concern the extent to which the work addresses or provides insight about real neural networks. One potential weakness in this line of work may be that it appears to rely heavily on the linearity of the deep net. While some other recent theories seem more plausibly generalized to more general architectures, it’s not clear to me how this analysis, which hinges so crucially on the entire mapping being expressible as a linear operator, can generalize. \n\nOn the other hand, I am personally of the opinion that the field is in the unusual position of possessing too many tools that “work” and too few new ideas. So I’m inclined to give the authors some license, even if I’m unsure of the eventual utility of the work. \n\nOne challenge in reviewing this paper is that it builds tightly on a number of recent papers and without being an authority on the other works, while it’s possible to assess the insights in this paper, it’s difficult to say conclusively which among them can rightly be considered the present paper’s contributions (vs those of the prior work).\n",
