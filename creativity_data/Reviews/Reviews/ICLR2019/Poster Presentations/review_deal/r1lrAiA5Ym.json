        "metareview": "The authors consider the problem of active plasticity in the mammalian brain, seen as being a means to enable lifelong learning. Building on the recent paper on differentiable plasticity, the authors propose a learnt, neuro-modulated differentiable plasticity that can be trained with gradient descent but is more flexible than fixed plasticity. The paper is clearly motivated and written, and the tasks are constructed to validate the method by demonstrating clear cases where non-modulated plasticity fails completely but where the proposed approach succeeds. On a large, general language modeling task (PTB) there is a small but consistent improvement over LSTMS. The reviewers were very split on this submission, with two reviewers focusing on the lack of large improvements on large benchmarks, and the other reviewer focusing on the novelty and success of the method on simple tasks. The AC tends to side with the positive review because of the following observations: the method is novel and potentially will have long term impact on the field, the language modeling task seems like a poor fit to demonstrate the advantages of the dynamic plasticity, so focusing on that benchmark overly much is misleading, and the paper is high-quality and interesting to the community.

            "review": "This work presents Backpropamine, a neuromodulated plastic LSTM training regime. It extends previous research on differentiable Hebbian plasticity by introducing a neuromodulatory term to help gate information into the Hebbian synapse. The neuromodulatory term is placed under network control, allowing it to be time varying (and hence to be sensitive to the input, for example). Another variant proposes updating the Hebbian synapse with modulated exponential average of the Hebbian product. This average is linked to the notion of an eligibility trace, and ties into some recent biological work that shows the role of dopamine in retroactively modulating synaptic plasticity.\n\nOverall the work is nicely motivated and clearly presented. There are some interesting ties to biological work -- in particular, to retroactive plasticity phenomena. There should be sufficient details for a reader to implement this model, thought there are some minor details missing regarding the experimental setup, which will be addressed below.\n\nThe authors test their model on three tasks: cue-award association, maze learning, and Penn Treebank (PTB). In the cue-award association task the retroactive and simple modulation networks perform well, while the non-modulated and non-plastics fail. For the maze navigation task the modulated networks perform better than the non-modulated networks, though the effect is less pronounced. Finally, on PTB the authors report improvements over baseline LSTMs. \n\nOne of the main claims of this paper is that neuromodulated plastic LSTMs...outperform standard LSTMs on a benchmark language modeling task”, and that therefore “differentiable neuromodulation of plasticity offers a powerful new framework for training neural networks”. This claim is unfortunately unfounded for a very important reason: the LSTM performance is not at all close to that which can be achieved by LSTMs in general. The authors cite such models in the appendix (Melor et al), but claim that “much larger models” are needed, potentially with other mechanisms, such as dropout. Though this may be true, these models still undermine the claim that “neuromodulated plastic LSTMs...outperform standard LSTMs on a benchmark language modeling task”. This claim is simply not true, and more care is needed in reporting the results here in the wider context of the literature. Also, I am left wondering what are considered the parameters of the models -- are only the neuromodulatory terms considered as the additional trainable parameters compared to baseline LSTMs? How are the Hebbian synapses themselves considered in this calculation? If the Hebbian synapses are not considered, then the authors need a control with matched memory-capacities to account for the extra capacity afforded by the Hebbian synapses. Given the ties between Hebbian synapses and attention (see Ba et al), an important control here could be an LSTM with Bahdanau (2014) style attention. \n\nFinally, the style (font) of the paper does not adhere to the ICLR style template, and must be changed.\n\nOverall, the ideas presented in the paper are intriguing, and further research down this line is encouraged. However, in its current state the work lacks sufficiently strong baselines to support the paper’s claims; thus, the merits of this approach cannot yet be properly assessed.\n",

            "review": "Paper summary - This paper extends the differentiable plasticity framework of Miconi et al. (2018) by dynamically modulating the plasticity learning rate. This is accomplished via an output unit of the network which defines the plasticity learning rate for the next timestep. A variation on this dynamic learning rate related to eligibility traces is also proposed.\n\nBoth dynamic modulation variations strikingly outperform non-plastic and plastic non-modulated recurrent networks on a cue-reward association task with high-dimensional cues. The methods marginally outperform plastic non-modulated recurrent networks on a 9x9 water maze task. Finally, the authors show that adding dynamic plasticity to a small LSTM without dropout improves performance on Penn Treebank.\n\nThe paper motivates dynamic plasticity by analogy to the hypothesized role of dopamine in reward-driven learning in humans and animals.\n\nClarity -  The paper is very clear and well written. The introduction provides useful insights, motivates the work convincingly, and provides interesting connections to past work.\n\nOriginality - I don't know of any other work that models the role of dopamine in quite this way, or that applies dynamic plasticity modulation in settings like these.\n\nQuality - The experiments are well chosen and seem technically sound.\n\nSignificance - The results show that meta-learning by gradient descent to modulate the plasticity learning rate is a promising direction -- a significant contribution in my view.\n\nOther Comments - The citation to Zaremba et al. in Table 1 made it seem like the perplexity result on that line of the table was directly from Zaremba et al's paper. I'd recommend removing the citation from that line to avoid confusion.\n\nOne thing I would have loved to see from this paper is a comparison of modulated-plasticity LSTMs with the sota from Melis et al., 2017. I gather that Experiment 3 presents small LSTMs without recurrent dropout instead because combining plasticity and dropout proved challenging (or at least the authors haven't tried it yet). I think the paper is solid as-is; positive results in this comparison would take it to the next level.\n\nQuestions:\nWhy were zero-sequences necessary in Experiment 1? This aspect of the task seems somewhat contrived, and it makes me wonder whether the striking failure of the non-modulated RNNs depends on this detail. Perhaps the authors could clarify on what a confounding \"time-locked scheduling strategy\" would look like in this task?\nWhy does Experiment 1 present pairs of stimuli, rather than high-dimensional individual stimuli?\nWhy is non-plastic rnn left out of Figure 2b?\n\nTypos\n\"However, in Nature,\" -- no caps\nin appendix: \"(see Figure A.4)\" -- the figure is labeled \"Figure 3\"\n",

            "title": "Interesting extension of differentiable plasticity with evaluation that falls too short ",
            "review": "The paper extends previous work on differentiable placticity to include neuro modulation by parameterizing the learning rate of Hebbs update rule. In addition, the authors introduce retroactive modulation that basically allows the system to delay incorporation of plasticity updates via so eligibility traces. Experiments are performaed on 2 simple toy datasets and a simple language modeling task. A newly developed cue-reward association task shows the clear limitations of basic plasticity and how modulation can resolve this. Slight improvements can also be seen on a simple maze navigation task as well as on a basic language modeling dataset.\n\nOverall I like the motivation, provided background information and simplicity of the approach. Furthermore, the cue-reward experiment seems to be a well designed show case for neuro-modulation. However, as the authors acknowledge the overall simplicity of the tasks being evaluated with mostly marginal improvements makes the overall evaluation fall short. Unfortunately the paper doesn't provide any qualitative analysis on how modulation is employed by the models after training. Therefore, although I would like to see an extended version of this paper at the conference, without further experiments and analysis I see the current version rather as an interesting workshop contribution.\n\n\nStrengths:\n- motivation: the natural extension of previous work on differentiable plasticity based on existing knowledge from neuro science is an important next step\n- cue reward experiment exemplifies limitations of current plasticity approaches and clearly shows the potential benefits of neuro modulation\n- maze navigation shows incremental benefits over non-modulated plasticity\n- thorough experimentation\n- clipping-trick is a neat observation \n\n\nWeaknesses:\n- evaluation: only on toy tasks (which includes PTB), no real world tasks\n- very incremental improvements on PTB over a very simple baseline (far from SotA)\n- evaluated models (feed-forward NNs and LSTMs) are very basic and far from current SotA architectures\n- no qualitative analysis on how modulation is actually use by the systems. E.g., when is modulation strong and when is it not used \n\n\nComments:\n- perplexity improvements of less than 1.3 points over plasticity alone (which is the actual baseline for this paper) can hardy be called \"significant\". Even though they might be statistically significant (meaning nothing more than the two models being statistically different), minor architectural changes can lead to such improvements. Furthermore PTB is not a \"challenging\" LM benchmark.\n\n",
