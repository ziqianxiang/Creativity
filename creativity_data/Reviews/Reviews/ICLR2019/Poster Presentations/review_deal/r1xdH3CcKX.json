The method relies on a graph-structured recurrent neural network trained on temporal and visual (pixel) information. \n\nThe paper is well-written, with a convincing motivation and a set of novel ideas. \n\nThe reviewers pointed to a few caveats in the methodology, such as quality of trajectories (AnonReviewer2) and expensive learning of states (AnonReviewer3). However, these issues do not discount much of the papers' quality. Besides, the authors have rebutted satisfactorily some of those comments.\n\nMore importantly, all three reviewers were not convinced by the experimental evaluation. AnonReviewer1 believes that the idea has a lot of potential, but is hindered by the insufficient exposition of the experiments. AnonReviewer3 similarly asks for more consistency in the experiments.\n\nOverall, all reviewers agree on a score \"marginally above the threshold\". While this is not a particularly strong score, the AC weighted all opinions that, despite some caveats, indicate that the developed model and considered application fit nicely in a coherent and convincing story. The authors are strongly advised to work further on the experimental section (which they already started doing as is evident from the rebuttal) to further improve their paper.",

            "review": "The authors propose Graph VRNN. The proposed method models the interaction of multiple agents by deploying a VRNN for each agent. The interaction among the agents is modeled by the graph interaction update on the hidden states of the VRNNs. The model predicts the true state (e.g., location) of the agent via supervised auto-regressive learning. The proposed model can improve this estimation from partially-observed visual observations. In the experiment, the authors apply the proposed method to Basketball and Soccer data to model the positions of the players. \n\nThe paper is clearly written. However, Section 3.2 needs to be elaborated more because using graph interaction update in VRNN is one of the main contributions. \n\nI see two main weaknesses. The first is that the states are learned by supervised learning where obtaining the state label (i.e., the agent locations) is very expensive. Indeed, the authors had to develop their own soccer game to obtain these labels. The second weakness is the weak/inconsistent experiment results. It seems not clear whether having the graph structure or stochastic modeling is really helping or not. For example, for basketball experiment, Graph-RNN works poorly. And, for soccer, Graph-VRNN works just as good as Graph-RNN. The authors explained that this is due to the simplicity of the player behavior (not much stochastic), but the result in Table 2 shows good performance for Graph-VRNN for future prediction task. All these make it difficult to buy the claimed argument. It is also a limitation that the model requires to know and fix the number of agents.\n\nAs minor comments, \n\n- in Table 1. Graph-RNN works better for soccer t=4, but not indicated in bold. \n- Having a single RNN baseline will be helpful to compare with Graph-RNN.\n- It is confusing to call s_t a belief state because it is observed not latent.\n- In the qualitative results, I think it can be compared to the heatmap of true distribution.\n\nI think the following papers needs to be discussed as related works.\n- https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01242.pdf \n- https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.03006.pdf\n\n",

            "review": "Summary: The paper proposes a method to predict the future state-spaces in a multi-agent system by combing the visual and temporal information using a mixed blend of Graph-Networks+VAE+RNN (G-VRNN) formulation. The proposed approach is evaluated on two sports datasets: (1). basketball sequences; (2). soccer sequences. The authors show how the overall formulation is better than each of individual components.\n\nPros: \n\n1. the multi-agent setting is interesting, very natural, and has potential for many applications.\n\n2. formulation encodes information about different aspects: agents, location, temporal activities, and each agent's relation to other.\n\nCons: \n\n1. The current evaluation is contrived. \n\n(a). the task for future state prediction in current basket-ball and soccer sequence is not very clear. A gaussian distribution defined with 'time' as standard deviation could give similar results? \n\n(b). no comparison with the existing approaches? I think the work of Felson et al. ICCV'17 is relevant for the given paper, and so it would be ideal to do evaluation on the datasets used in their work, and if possible compare the different baselines that they have used. \n\n(c). the goal is to predict the future state of an agent in a multi-agent setting, but it is not clear from the evaluation as how the presence of multiple agents influence the behavior of an individual. \n\n(d). a better way to demonstrate the future state-spaces could be through trajectory of ball or players (similar to ones shown by Walker et al ECCV'16, CVPR'14). The current qualitative analysis is not sufficient to understand what is happening in the proposed pipeline.\n\n(e). more challenging cases to demonstrate the proposed approach  -- consider any multi-person tracking dataset, and use the proposed formulation to predict multiple trajectories (and hence state-spaces at varying time) for the people. An amazing result could be shown as how a person changes trajectory as a group of people pass by.\n\n2. The running example of 'location of goalie' is ambiguous. By design, goalie has to be near the goal post. Even if there is no visual information or any other information, one can safely say this thing?\n\nOverall I think the work has the potential to be on something really interesting. However, I think it needs solid experiments and is not yet ready for publication.",

            "review": "1) Summary\nThis paper presents a graph neural network based architecture that is trained to locate and model the interactions of agents in an environment directly from pixels. They propose an architecture that is a composition of recurrent neural networks where each models a single object independently and communicate with other for the overall environment modeling. The model is trained with a variational recurrent neural network objective that allows for stochasticity in the predictions while at the same time allows to model the current and future steps simultaneously. In experiments, they show the advantage of using the proposed model for tasks of tracking as well as forecasting of agents locations.\n\n\n\n2) Pros:\n+ Novel recurrent neural network architecture to model structured dynamics of agents in an environment.\n+ Outperforms baseline methods.\n+ New dataset for partially observable prediction research.\n\n3) Cons:\n\nForecasting task:\n- The authors argue that a discretization needs to be performed because of the many possible futures given the past, and also provide an error measure based on likelihood. However, if trajectories are actually generated from these distributions, I suspect the many possible futures generated will be very shaky. Can the authors provide trajectories sampled from this? If sampling trajectories does not make sense somehow, can the authors comment on how we can sample multiple trajectories?\n\nLack of baselines:\n- The authors mention social LSTM and social GAN in the related work, however, no comparison is provided. From a quick glance, the authors of these papers work on trajectories. However, the “social” principle in those papers is general since it’s done from the computed feature vector. Could it have not been used on top of one of the baselines? If not, could the authors provide a reason why this is not the case?\n\n\nAdditional comments:\nAs the authors mention, it would be nice to extend this paper to an unsupervised or semi-supervised task. Here are a couple of papers that may interest you:\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1804.04412\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02193\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07823\n\n4) Conclusion\nOverall, the paper is well written, easy to understand, and seems to be simple enough to quickly reproduce. Additionally, the proposed dataset may be of use for the community. If the authors are able to successfully address the issues mentioned, I am willing to improve my score.",
