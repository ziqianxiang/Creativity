However, they also would have liked to get better insights on the place of AggMo in the existing optimization literature. Given that the related work section is quite small, I encourage you to expand it based on the works mentioned in the reviews.",

            "review": "The paper introduces a variant of momentum that aggregates several velocities with different dampening coefficients. The proposed optimization algorithm can significantly decrease oscillation thus one can use much larger dampening coefficient to achieve faster convergence.\n\nThe paper does a good job of motivating the algorithm, both in terms of intuitive reasoning from physics, and some demonstrative examples. The paper also has nice analysis in the simple quadratic case where it tries to make equivalence to the Nesterov's accelerated gradients.\n\nThe experiments are also thorough and convincing since it contains various network architectures and different datasets. From the comparison, it seems AggMo consistently achieves the best or comparable performance even in test error/accuracies.\n\nThe connection to Nesterov's accelerated gradient and extragradient methods can be discussed in more details. It'll be nice to put the theoretical results in the main text as well.",

The basic idea is instead of using a single velocity vector, multiple velocity vectors with different damping factors are used in order to improve the stability.\n\nIn term of novelty, the proposed method seems quite incremental. Using multiple velocity vectors seems interesting but not surprising, There is no theoretical guideline how to determine the number of velocity vectors and how to choose the damping factors. \n\nI would also suggest that authors should put some main theoretical results like the convergence analysis to the main paper instead of the appendix. \n\nIn terms of the clarity, I think the paper is well written and the experiments are sufficient and convincing.\n\nOne minor question is: what is \\lambda in Fig. 1?\n\n ",

For example, it said in the default setting (CM \\beta=0.9), ResNet34 on CIFAR-10 has accuracy 90.22\\%. However, it should be around 93\\%.\n\n(+)  This method is similar to multi-step gradient methods.\n\n\n\nComments:\n(+) This is no “introduction” in the paper. \n\n(+) There should be “,” after mathematical equations. \n",
