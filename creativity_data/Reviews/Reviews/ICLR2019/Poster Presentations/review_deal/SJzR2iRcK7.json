            "review": "In this paper the authors revisit the problem of multi-class classification and propose to use pairwise similarities (more accurately, what they use is the co-occurrence pattern of labels) instead of node labels. Thus, having less stringent requirements for supervision, their framework has broader applicability: in supervised and semi-supervised classification and in unsupervised cross-task transfer learning, among others.\n\nPros: The idea of using pairwise similarities to enable a binary classifier encapsulate a multi-class classifier is neat.\n\nCons: My main gripe is with the conditional independence assumption on pairwise similarities, which the author use to simplify the likelihood down to a cross-entropy. Such an assumption seems too simple to be useful in problems with complicated dependence structure. Yes, the authors conduct some experiments to show that their algorithms achieve good performance in some benchmark datasets, but a careful discussion (if possible, theoretical) of when such an assumption is viable and when it is an oversimplification is necessary (analogous assumptions are used in naive Bayes or variational Bayes for simplifying the likelihood, but those are much more flexible, and we know when they are useful and when not). \n\nSecondly, by using co-occurrence patterns, one throws away identifiability---the (latent) labels are only learnable up to a permutation unless external information is available. This point is not made clear in the paper, and the authors should describe how they overcome this in their supervised classification experiments.\n",

            "review": "This paper proposed how to learn multi-class classifiers without multi-class labels. The main idea is shown in Figure 2, to regard the multi-class labels as hidden variables and optimize the likelihood of the input variables and the binary similarity labels. The difference from existing approaches is also illustrated in Figure 1, namely existing methods have binary classifiers inside multi-class classifiers while the proposed method has multi-class classifiers inside binary classifiers. The application of this technique to three general problem settings is discussed, see Figure 3.\n\nClarity: Overall, it is very well written. I just have two concerns.\n\nFirst, the authors didn't discuss the underlying assumption of the proposed method except the additional independence assumption. I think there should be more underlying assumptions. For example, by the definition P(S_{i,j}=0 or 1|Y_i,Y_j) and the optimization of L(theta;X,S), does the \"cluster assumption\" play a role in it? The cluster assumption is popular in unsupervised/semi-supervised learning and metric learning where the X part of training data is in a form of pairs or triples. However, there is no such an assumption in the original supervised multi-class learning. Without figuring out the underlying assumptions, it is difficult to get why the proposed method works and when it may fail.\n\nSecond, there are too many abbreviations without full names, and some of them seem rather important such as KLD and KCL. I think full names of them should be given for the first time they appear. This good habit can make your audience more broad in the long run.\n\nNovelty: As far as I know, the proposed approach is novel. It is clear that Section 3 is original. However, due to the writing style, it is hard to analyze which part in Section 4 is novel and which part is already known. This should be carefully revised in the final version. Moreover, there was a paper in ICML 2018 entitled \"classification from pairwise similarity and unlabeled data\", in which binary classifiers can be trained strictly following ERM without introducing the cluster assumption. The same technique can be used for learning from pairwise dissimilarity and unlabeled data as well as from pairwise similarity and dissimilarity data. I think this paper should be included in Section 2, the related work. \n\nSignificance: I didn't carefully check all experimental details but the experimental results look quite nice and promising. Given the fact that the technique used in this paper can be applied to many different tasks in machine learning ranging from supervised learning to unsupervised learning, I think this paper should be considered significant.\n\nNevertheless, I have a major concern as follows. In order to derive Eq. (2), the authors imposed an additional independence assumption: given X_i and X_j, S_{i,j} is independent of all other S_{i',j'}. Hence, Eqs. (2) and (3) approximately hold instead of exactly hold. Some comments should be given on how realistic this assumption is, or equivalently, how close (1) and (3) are. One more minor concern: why P(X) appears in (1) and then disappears in (2) and (3) when Y is marginalized?  ",

While the work appears to be impressive, such ideas have typically been used in Statistics and machine learning very widely over the years(Belief Propagation,  Topic modeling with anchor words assumptions etc...). This work could be easily extended to multi-class classifications where each node belongs to multiple classes. It would be interesting to know the authors' thoughts on that. The hard classification rule in the paper seems to be too restrictive to be of use in practical scenarios, and soft classification would be a useful pragmatic alternative. \n",
