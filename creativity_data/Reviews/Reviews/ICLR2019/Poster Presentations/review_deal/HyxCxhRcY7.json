As authors mentioned, the extension to density estimators is an original novelty of this paper, but I still have some concern that OE loss for classification is basically the same as [2]. I think it is better to clarify this in the draft. \n\nSummary===\n\nThis paper proposes a new fine-tuning method for improving the performance of existing anomaly detectors. The main idea is additionally optimizing the “Outlier Exposure (OE)” loss on outlier dataset. Specifically, for softmax classifier, the authors set the OE loss to the KL divergence loss between posterior distribution and uniform distribution. For density estimator, they set the OE loss to a margin ranking loss. The proposed method improves the detection performance of baseline methods on various vision and NLP datasets. While the research topic of this paper is interesting, I recommend rejections because I have concerns about novelty and the experimental results.\n\nDetailed comments ===\n\n1. OE loss for softmax classifier\n\nFor softmax classifier, the OE loss forces the posterior distribution to become uniform distribution on outlier dataset. I think this loss function is very similar to a confidence loss (equation 2) proposed in [2]: Lee et al., 2017 [2] also proposed the loss function minimizing the KL divergence between posterior distribution and uniform distribution on out-of-distribution, and evaluated the effects of it on \"unseen\" out-of-distribution (see Table 1 of [2]). Could the authors clarify the difference with the confidence loss in [2], and compare the performance with it? Without that, I feel that the novelty of this paper is not significant.\n\n2. More comparison with baselines\n\nThe authors said that they didn’t compare the performance with simple inference methods like ODIN [3] since ODIN tunes the hyper-parameters using data from (tested) out-of-distribution. However, I think that the authors can compare the performance with ODIN by tuning the hyper-parameters of it on outlier dataset which is used for training OE loss. Could the authors provide more experimental results by comparing the performance with ODIN? \n\n3. Related work\n\nI would appreciate if the authors can survey and compare more baselines such as [4] and [5]. \n\n[1] Dan Hendrycks and Kevin Gimpel.

            "title": "An outlier detection method that assumes access to the outlier distribution?",
            "review": "This paper describes how a deep neural network can be fine-tuned to perform outlier detection in addition to its primary objective. For classification, the fine-tuning objective encourages out-of-distribution samples to have a uniform distribution over all class labels. For density estimation, the objective encourages out-of-distribution samples to be ranked as less probability than in-distribution samples. On a variety of image and text datasets, this additional fine-tuning step results in a network that does much better at outlier detection than a naive baseline, sometimes approaching perfect AUROC.\n\nThe biggest weakness in this paper is the assumption that we have access to out-of-distribution data, and that we will encounter data from that same distribution in the future. For the typical anomaly detection setting, we expect that anomalies could look like almost anything. For example, in network intrusion detection (a common application of anomaly detection), future attacks are likely to have different characteristics than past attacks, but will still look unusual in some way. The challenge is to define \"normal\" behavior in a way that captures the full range of normal while excluding \"unusual\" examples. This topic has been studied for decades.\n\nThus, I would not classify this paper as an anomaly detection paper. Instead, it's defining a new task and evaluating performance on that task. The empirical results demonstrate that the optimization succeeds in optimizing the objective it was given. What's missing is the justification for this problem setting -- when is it the case that we need to detect outliers *and* have access to the distribution over outliers?\n\n--------\n\nUPDATE AFTER RESPONSE PERIOD:\n\nMy initial read of this paper was incorrect -- the authors do indeed separate the outlier distribution used to train the detector from the outlier distribution used for evaluation. Much of these details are in Appendix A; I suggest that the authors move some of this earlier or more heavily reference Appendix A when describing the methods and introducing the results. I am not well-read in the other work in this area, but this looks like a nice advance.\n\nBased on my read of the related work section (again, having not studied the other papers), it looks like this work fills a slightly different niche from some previous work. In particular, OE is unlikely to be adversarially robust. So this might be a poor choice for finding anomalies that represent malicious behavior (e.g., network intrusion detection, adversarial examples, etc.), but good for finding natural examples from a different distribution (e.g., data entry errors).\n\nMy main remaining reservation is that this work is still at the stage of empirical observation -- I hope that future work (by these authors or others) can investigate the assumptions necessary for this method to work, and even characterize how well we should expect it to work. Without a framework for understanding generalization in this context, we may see a proliferation of heuristics that succeed on benchmarks without developing the underlying principles.",

            "review": "This paper proposes fine-tuning an out-of-distribution detector using an Outlier Exposure (OE) dataset. The novelty is in proposing a model-specific rather than dataset-specific fine-tuning. Their modifications are referred to as Outlier Exposure. OE includes the choice of an OE dataset for fine-tuning and a regularization term evaluated on the OE dataset. It is a comprehensive study that explores multiple datasets and improves dataset-specific baselines.\n\nSuggestions and clarification requests:\n- The structure of the writing does not clearly present the novel aspects of the paper as opposed to the previous works. I suggest moving the details of model-specific OE regularization terms to section 3 and review the details of the baseline models. Then present the other set of novelties in proposing OE datasets in a new section before presenting the results. Clearly presenting two sets of novelties in this work and then the results. If constrained in space, I suggest squeezing the discussion, conclusion, and 4.1.\n- In the related work section Radford et al., 2016 is references when mentioning GAN. Why not the original reference for GAN?\n- Maybe define BPP, BPC, and BPW in the paragraphs on PixelCNN++ and language modeling or add a reference.\n- Numbers in Table 3 column MSP should match the numbers in Table 1, right? Or am I missing something?",
