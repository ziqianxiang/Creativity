While it is useful, more work is probably needed to strengthen the contribution.  A few directions have been suggested by reviewers, including theoretical guarantees and stronger empirical support.",

            "review": "The paper claims that a combination of policy gradients calculate by different RL algorithms would provide better objective values. Main focus of the work is to devise and adaptive combination scheme for policy gradient estimators. Authors claim that by using the statistical shrinkage estimators combining different gradients that have different bias-variance trade-off would provide better mean-square error than each of those individual gradient estimators. The key observations made by the authors are that gradients computed by on-policy methods would provide nearly unbiased estimators with very high variance while the gradients obtained by the off-policy methods in particular model based approaches would provide highly biased estimators with low variance. Proposed statistical tool to combine gradients is James-Steim shrinkage estimator. JS estimator provides strong theoretical guarantees for Gaussian cases but some practical  heuristics tor more complex non-Gaussian cases. Authors do not discuss  whether the JS estimator actually suitable for this task given the fact that strong assumptions of the underlying statistical approach is violated. They also do not go into any discussion about theoretical guarantees nor they provide any exposures or intuitions about that. The scope of the experiments is very limited. Given the fact that there is no theory behind the claims and the lack of strong evidence I believe this paper does not cut the requirements for publication.\n\nTo improve please add significantly more empirical evidence, provide more discussion about theoretical ground work and discussion about the suitability of the JS estimators when its required assumptions are not satisfied.",

            "review": "This paper presents two algorithms that improve on PPO by using James-Stein (JS) shrinkage estimator. The first algorithm, PPO-MBS, combines low bias of on-policy methods with low variance of model-based RL algorithms. The second, PPO-STS, uses JS to create a statistical momentum and reduce variance of the PPO algorithm. Both algorithms are evaluated on Mujoco environments aiming to show improvements in average cumulative reward, reduced bias and variance.\n\nThe paperâ€™s topic is highly relevant, as the authors point out, the current state of the art in RL is largely divided between model-based and model-free methods. This paper aims at bridging the gap, and taking advantage of both sides. The writing is clear and concise, with all the math properly introduced. The proposed methods are interesting and novel. As far as I am aware, this is solid and unexplored approach with potentially significant impact.\n\nThere are two concerns with this paper. First, the evaluation results are promising, yet not fully convincing. It appears that 5 million steps is not sufficient for the policy convergence for any of the tasks (average reward keeps increasing). At the same time the variance gap (Figure 1) is reducing. \n- As the training continues, does the variance for PPO-MBS become larger?\n- Similar question for the average reward - the advantage of the PPO-MBS vs. comparison methods seems to be reducing. What happens with the additional training?\n- How do the trajectories and behavior of the Walker2D (and other) look with PPO-MBS vs. others - is the higher average reward indicative of the qualitatively better behavior?\n- Why do Walker2D and Hopper increase \\alpha over time, while Swimmer and Reacher lean more towards mode model based policy over time?\n- Is there something significant about the structure of the problems?\n- Similar questions arise from the evaluation of the PPO-STS - it appears that the training is even less complete in this case, rendering the conclusions about the quality of the learned policy at convergence invalid.\n- Why are Humanoid and Ant not evaluated on PPO-MBS? The authors should extend the training to convergence on all problems, and present the results including movies of example trajectories of all environments for both algorithms in the supplementary material.\n\nSecond, the paper introduces two competing methods.  While, the authors compare them directly,  they do not discuss how the two methods relate to each other. In the Reacher and Hopper task seems like all three methods perform about the same, and in the Hopper PPO-STS even performs worse than the baseline. This makes it difficult to assess the significance of the exposition. When should one be used, and when the other one is better?\n\nThe authors should consider either a) splitting the paper into two focusing each paper on a single algorithm with more in-depth evaluations and discussions, or b) combining the two algorithms into ones. In any case, further analysis that illuminates when the methods should be used, and how they improve the training are needed.\n",

            "title": "Well motivated use of James-Stein estimator to RL problems",
            "review": "The paper suggest a shrinkage-based estimator (James-Stein estimator) to compute policy gradients in reinforcement learning to reduce the variance by trading some bias. Two versions are suggested: The on-policy gradients is shrinked either towards (i) model based gradient, or towards (ii) a delayed average of previous on-policy gradients. Empirically, both methods have better performance than the baseline.\n\nThe paper is clearly written and well motivated. Some details are lacking that would be of interest to the reader and to make the results reproducible. For example how is \\hat Q estimated? The trick that is referred to in the end of page about only simulating short horizon trajectories deserves more detail. I would suggest providing more details, in the text and/or in the two algorithms.\n\nThe authors claim that JS estimator for gradient estimation in RL has not been used before. I am also not aware of any other work, but have also not been looking after that line of work. The paper seems to be a good contribution to the ever increasing literature of how to improve deep RL.\n\nMinors:\n\\hat \\theta on RHS in eq (7) should be \\bar \\theta ? Otherwise, what is \\hat \\theta?\nsection 4.2 Ww -> We\n\n======= After revision =========\n\nI still think this is a very interesting, novel and relevant idea that desires attention. However, on the same time, I agree with the points raised by the other two reviewers which are all well-motivated and relevant concerns. Therefore, I join the view that the paper is not yet ready for publication but I do encourage the authors to improve their work and resubmit to another venue.",
