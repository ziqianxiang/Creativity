This model can be potentially used for improving GANs training and for generating synthetic datasets for evaluating continual learning methods. All the reviewers and AC agree that showing how continual learning techniques applied to the discriminator can alleviate mode collapse in GANs training is an important direction to study.\n\nThere is reviewer disagreement on this paper. AC can confirm that all three reviewers have read the author responses and have contributed to the final discussion.\n\nWhile acknowledging that continual learning setting is potentially useful, the reviewers have raised several important concerns: (1) low technical novelty in light of EWC++ and online EWC methods (R1 and R3) -- methodological and empirical comparison to these baselines is required to assess the difference and benefits of the proposed approach; the authors response to these concerns (and also R2’s comments in the discussion) were insufficient to assess the scope of the contribution. (2) More diverse/convincing empirical findings would strengthen the evaluation (e.g. assessing whether or not generator could help to overcome forgetting; showing that memory replay strategy by storing sufficient fake examples from previously generated samples cannot prevent mode collapse in GANs training – see the R3’s comment; showing the benefits of the generated samples for evaluating continual learning methods). (3) R1 left unconvinced that GAN training can be improved via continual learning training, as the relation between the proposed view and the minimax optimization difficulties in GANs is not addressed – see R1’s comment about this. The authors briefly discussed in their response to the review that the proposed approach is orthogonal to these works. However, a better (possibly theoretical) analysis of GANs training and continual learning would indeed help to evaluate the scope of the contribution of this work.\n\nRegarding the available datasets that exhibit a coherent time evolution -- see the Continuous Manifold Based Adaptation for Evolving Visual Domains by Hoffman et al, CVPR 2014. \n\nAmong (1)-(3):  (2) and (3) did not have a substantial impact on the decision, but would be helpful to address in a subsequent revision. However, (1) makes it very difficult to assess the benefits of the proposed approach, and was viewed by AC as a critical issue. \n\nAC suggests that in this current state the paper can be considered for a workshop and recommend to prepare a major revision before resubmitting it for the second round of reviews. \n\n\n",

            "review": "Summary:\nThis paper proposes the use of GANs as a realistic benchmark for continual learning, and shows how continual learning techniques applied to the discriminator can alleviate mode collapse. Existing continual learning approaches for discrete task structure (EWC and IS) are adapted to the continually shifting domain of GANs, and evaluated on a toy mixture of Gaussians, CelebA and CIFAR-10 image generation as well as textGANs.\n\nThis is a clearly written paper that nicely addresses some of the challenges of bridging the toy problems of continual learning with a real world problem of GAN training. The experiments and ablations are thorough, but the empirical gains in terms of improving GAN metrics are relatively minor. It's also not obvious that GAN training is really a continual learning problem, as every time the generator distribution shifts, the discriminator has to shift as well. Thus progress on stabilizing and improving GANs might not transfer back to domains that truly represent continual learning where the goal is to build a single network that perform well at all points in time. In terms of more realistic benchmarks for continual learning, I believe a controlled synthetic dataset would be more practical than the sequence of GAN checkpoints proposed here.\n\nStrengths:\n+ Clearly written, with good background discussion of continual learning approaches and challenges.\n+ Interesting adaptation of EWC and IS to the continual setting with task rates, online memory (sum of quadratics is quadratic), and controlled forgetting with a time decay.\n+ Thorough experiments and ablations on toy tasks, CelebA and CIFAR-10, and textGANs. Nicely includes error bars and compares computation time for each approach.\n\nWeaknesses:\n- The paper could benefit from more discussion on the goals of continual learning, and what is wrong with existing toy benchmarks. Why not come up with a tractable toy problem that addresses these difficulties directly?\n- I remain unconvinced that GANs as a good benchmark for continual learning. For example, it has been argued that many of the problems with GANs arise from dynamics of minimax optimization difficulties, and there are many recent approaches that were not compared to that focus on this optimization aspect of GAN training (Metz et al., Roth et al., Mescheder et al.). How would you relate these theoretical ideas to continual learning?\n- Most the experimental improvements are incremental. How did you choose or tune hyperparameters of your approach? ",

            "review": "This paper connects continual learning and GAN training together, and propose to use standard continual learning schemes (EWC etc) to improve GAN training.\n\nContinual learning for GANs is certainly an important problem to look at. Even though I like the problem, I'm not convinced with the solution provided by the paper. \n\nThe paper in it's current form, in terms of technical contributions and experimental analyses presented to support the hypotheses it started with, is not good enough to be accepted in ICLR. My comments:\n\n1) Catastrophic forgetting of discriminator: Interesting view about mode collapse. I have following concerns:\n(a) I like the view in which the training is shown as a sequential process. I wonder if we could solve the issue of catastrophic forgetting of discriminator by storing sufficient fake examples from previously generated samples from the generator. Storing previous generations has already been explored, however, just to prove the point that forgetting is an issue, it would be interesting to store enough samples for the mixture of Gaussian setting and analyse.\n\n(b) Why not thinking of catastrophic forgetting of generator? What if we constrain the generator to not-to-forget about previously generated samples by Fisher or something similar? In this case, every new task in the training process will have sufficient fake samples from all the modes.\n\n2) Lack of technical contributions: The approach, in which EWC or IS is being used to regulate the discriminator's parameters, seems to be straightforward. The issue of multiple parameters is being resolved by storing one Fisher/Score vector using moving average type scheme. This, to me, is almost same as Online EWC or EWC++. Both these papers have already addressed this issue and discussed them in great detail. How is this approach different?\n\n3) Not sure what exactly Fig 2 is conveying as D_1^{gen}, \\cdots, D_T^{gen} should almost be the same, so training on one and testing forgetting on other doesn't actually say much. I think we can't conclude anything from this figure, at least using MNIST experiments.\n\nMinor:\n4) I'm assuming that you call your method EWC/IS GAN (I think it wasn't explicitly mentioned in the paper). Why don't you call Seff et al. 2018 (they used EWC with GAN for the first time) work EWC-GAN? I personally feel that it's important to give acronyms so that it doesn't undermine previous works. Just to clarify, I'm not advocating the work by Seff et al..\n\n5) Please provide citations for mode collapse\n\nOnline EWC: Progress & compress: A scalable framework for continual learnin, ICML 2018.\nEWC++: Riemannian Walk for Incremental Learning: Understanding Forgetting and Intransigence, ECCV 2018.\n",

            "title": "A novel and probably effective plug-and-play regularizer for GANs",
            "review": "The authors argue that catastrophic forgetting may cause mode collapse and oscillation, and propose a novel plug-and-play  regularizer that can be applied to a variety of GANs' training process to counter catastrophic forgetting of the discriminator. The regularizer is a clever adaption of EWC and IS into the context of GAN training. With the authors' formulation, this regularizer will account for the discriminator's parameter from all previous \"tasks\" (snapshots taken at certain iterations) with extra memory budget of only one set of parameters, while assigning higher regularization strengths to parameters learned from recent tasks. Experiments demonstrate such regularizer improves GAN models including DCGAN, SN-DCGAN, WGAN-GP on image generation tasks and textGAN on text generation tasks.\n\nPros:\nThe paper is well-written. The formulation of online memory and controlled forgetting are clever, giving rise to the adaption of EWC and IS as a practical regularizer to overcome the problem of catastrophic forgetting in GANs. The experiments also demonstrate the regularizer is superior than historical averaging and SN on the synthetic dataset, and it is able to improve multiple GAN models in both image and text generation tasks.\n\nCons/Suggestions:\n1. Although I can see the method is working, the empirical evidence to support \"mode oscillation\" is not strong enough for me. I think in order for continual learning to make perfect sense, mode oscillation should be an obvious issue for GANs; otherwise, we probably don't need remembering the history, as the generator is probably evolving towards the right direction even in the vanilla approach. Still, since there have been several papers showing history is important, it should be helpful in some sense. In Figure 1, I cannot tell whether in (d), the generator returned to the previous space (probably refers to (a)). Even the centers of mass of (a) and (d) look different for me. Figure 2 (left) only shows the distribution of generated data is changing as the training proceeds in vanilla GANs, since few of them (some shallow blue lines) have low peaks in previous datasets. If the mode oscillates and the generator returns to previous state, there should at least be another peak along the line, which is missing in curves on later datasets (darker blue ones). (I guess I have understood this figure correctly, but Figure 2 seems horizontally flipped to me. Since you are testing on previous fake datasets, and the accuracy should drop on previous datasets; however, the accuracy drops on later datasets in the figure.)\n\n2. I doubt the authors may not have tried enough sets of hyper parameters for baseline models. In table 1, the variance of GAN, GAN + l2 weight and GAN + SN are significantly higher than the others. I don't think with l2 weight regularizer, the model will be much more unstable than the authors' approach.\n\n3. The authors didn't give the results of their regularizer with LeakGAN on text generation. Currently their model has lower test BLEU than LeakGAN, which indicates lower fluency, but its self BLEU is lower than LeakGAN, which indicates higher diversity. It would be much better if the proposed method can surpass LeakGAN on both metrics.\n\n4. Using inception score on mixture of eight Gaussians may not make much sense, if they are using the ImageNet pre-trained model, since such a model is not trained to fit this distribution. Still, the author has reported symmetric KL. \n\n5. The authors did not specify their inception score on real Celeb-A and CIFAR10 images. \n\n\nOverall, I tend to accept this paper for its contribution on methods. It would be even better if my concerns could be addressed.\n\nEdit: after seeing the review of Reviewer 3, I find the proposed method seems to be the same as Online EWC and I have downgraded the rating. The authors should address these concerns.",
