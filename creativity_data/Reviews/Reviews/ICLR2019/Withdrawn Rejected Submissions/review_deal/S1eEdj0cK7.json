            "review": "This paper empirically evaluates whether NMT can predict word alignment. This is done by measuring the alignment error rate between silver-data generated from FastAlign and various methods to extract alignment from NMT. The conclusions are that NMT attention does not predict alignment well, and the proposed method of training an additional alignment extraction model performs better. \n\nUnfortunately, I do not appreciate the motivation of the work. Attention is not alignment. Yes, we can try to extract alignment from attention or other parts of the model. But we should really not expect attention to do alignment, because it was simply not designed to do so. \n\nSo I am not surprised by the first result that AER for attention-based alignment is bad. I am also not suprised by the second result where training an explicit word alignment model (Eq 6) gets better AER, because that is what the model is designed for. \n\nI do understand that probing alignments might increase our ability to understand and interpret these NMT models. I also thought the CFS and CFT analysis was interesting. But unfortunately I don't think the overall problem attacked by this paper is sufficiently well-motivated for a full paper at ICLR. I do think this will be suitable at, for example, a workshop on visualizing/interpreting neural networks in applications. \n\nAdditional note: Please be more specific whether the AER results in Sec 4.2-4.4 are based on scoring on gold alignments in the NIST2015 data, or silver alignments from FastAlign. The former is fine, but the latter might make the results biased for the explicit alignment model trained on the same alignments. ",

            "title": "Need more convincing",
            "review": "The authors study various NMT models and show that most of them do not learn a good alignment model but still achieve good translation. They suggest that the translated output contains two types of words (i) contributed from source (CFS) and (ii) contributed from target (CFT) and hypothesize that even if the alignment is not good the CFT words contribute to the the better quality of translation (as these are not dependent on alignment).\n\nI have a few questions for the authors:\n\n1) Section 3 is titled \"Proposed Methods for Inducing Word Alignment\". This gives an impression that you are proposing some methods. However, the methods listed in  section 3.2 is from existing work (as you have already acknowledged by citing them correctly). I request you to rename the section or make this more explicit.\n\n2) I am not very convinced about the idea of using a 0 vector to dropout a particular word. Did you try any other options for this ?\n\n3) R_0 and R depend on the model. I mean these scores are as good as the model itself. Therefore I am not sure if it is correct to use these scores to determine CFT and CFS words. Ideally, CFT and CFS words should be a global phenomenon irrespective of the model being used. For example, while translating from a language which does not use articles (a, an, the) to a language which uses such articles, all articles in the target language would be CFT words, irrespective of the model being used. However, this is not the case in your definitions (the definitions are tied to the model scores).\n\n4) Shouldn't you also consider a certain margin  in Equation 11. I mean shouldn't the LHS be greater than the RHS by a certain margin for the word to be classified as CFS. \n\n5) Conceptually, I don't agree with the idea that a word is either CFS or CFT. What about words which require both source and target information? Equation 11 does not completely account for it because the quantity on the LHS does depend on the target words and the quantity on the RHS does dependent on the source words. It is difficult to isolate of effect on source/target.\n\n6) Can you comment on the quality of the silver alignments as the analysis presented in the paper will depend on the quality of these alignments.  \n",

            "title": "Interesting interpretability work cast as bilingual word alignment.",
            "review": "This paper sets out to build good bilingual word alignments from the information in an NMT system (both Transformer and RNN), where the goal is to match human-generated word-alignments as measured by AER. At least that’s how it starts. They contribute two aligners: one supervised aligner that uses NMT source and target representations as features and is trained on silver data generated by FastAlign, and one interpretability-based aligner that scores the affinity of a source-target word-pair by deleting the source word (replacing its embedding with a 0-vector) and measuring the impact on the probability of the target word. These are both shown to outperform directly extracting alignments from attention matrices by large margins. Despite the supervised aligner getting better AER, the authors proceed to quickly discard it as they dive deep on the interpretability approach, applying it also to target-target word pairs, and drawing somewhat interesting conclusions about two classes of target words: those that depend most of source context and those that depend most on target context.\n\nUltimately, this paper’s main contribution is its subtraction-based method for doing model interpretation. Its secondary contributions are the idea of evaluating this interpretation method empirically using human-aligned sentence pairs, and the idea of using the subtraction method on target-target pairs. The conclusion does a good job of emphasizing these contributions, but the abstract and front-matter do not. Much of the rest of the paper feels like a distraction. Overall, I believe the contributions listed above are valuable, novel and worth publishing. I can imagine using this paper’s techniques and ideas in my own research.\n\nSpecific concerns:\n\nThe front-matter mentions ‘multiple attention layers’. It would probably be a good idea to define this term carefully, as there are lots of things that could fit: multiple decoder layers with distinct attentions, multi-headed attention, etc.\n\nIn contrast to what is said in the introduction, GNMT as described in the Wu et al. 2016 paper only calculates attention once, based on the top encoder layer and the bottom decoder layer, so it doesn’t fit any definition of multiple attention layers.\n\nEquation (1) and the following text use the variable L without defining it.\n\n‘dominative’ -> ‘dominant’\n\nIs there any way to generate a null alignment with Equation 3? That is, a target word that has no aligned source words? If not, that is a major advantage for FastAlign.\n\nSimilarly, what exactly are you evaluating when you evaluate FastAlign? Are you doing the standard tricks from the phrase-based days, and generating source->target and target->source models, and combining their alignments with grow-diag-final? If so, you could apply the same tricks to the NMT system to help even the playing field. Maybe this isn’t that important since the paper didn’t win up being about how to build the best possible word aligner from NMT (which I think is for the best).\n\nI found Equations (7) and (8) to be confusing and distracting. I understand that you were inspired by Zintgraf’s method, but the subtraction-based method you landed on doesn’t seem to have much to do with the original Zintgraf et al. approach (and your method is much easier to the understand in the context of NMT than theirs). Likewise, I do not understand why you state, “we take the uniform distribution as P(x) regarding equation 8 for simplicity” - equation 9 completely redefines the LHS of equation 8, with no sum over x and no uniform distribution in sight.\n\nThe Data section of 4.1 never describes the NIST 2005 hand-aligned dataset.\n\nThe conclusions drawn at the end of 4.4 based on ‘translation recall’ are too strong. What we see is that the Transformer outperforms Moses by 2.8 onCFS, and by 3.7 on CFT. This hardly seems to support a claim that CFT words are the reason why Transformer yields better translation.\n\n4.5 paragraph 1: there is no way to sample 12000 datasets without replacement from NIST 2005 and have the samples be the same size as NIST 2005. You must mean “with replacement”?",
