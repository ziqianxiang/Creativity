Although they did exhaustive experiments to show this, it is not clear to the reviewer. \n\n- Also, it is more interesting if the authors can show how we use IFS in real applications.\n",

The authors go through previous work, provide definitions and attempt to answer questions that are relevant to this task.  The authors provide several experiments in order to empirically evaluate which of the two feature selection approaches is better suited for feature attibution.  Although this is a good review, and the motivation is sound, I think that much more ellaboration, and experiments on more than 200 images, would be required to reach definitive conclusions.",

IFS and EFS are just Forward and Backward stepwise feature selection, which are classic feature selection schemes. Applying them to feature attribution/saliency map does not seem to have much technical contribution.\n    2) One claimed contribution of this paper is that existing feature attribution methods can be viewed as approximation of IFS and EFS. However, this contribution also seems to be minor. As many feature selection methods are known to be approximation of backward or forward stepwise feature selection, it is straightforward to show the connection between other feature attribution methods and IFS/EFS.\n\nIn conclusion, I would recommend to reject this paper due to the limited novelty and technical contribution.\n",
