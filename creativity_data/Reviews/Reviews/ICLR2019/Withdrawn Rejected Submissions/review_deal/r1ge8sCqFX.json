The dataset they use to train their model is fairly small (around 4K transactions). In addition to using house specific features the authors use other macro features, such as, walk score etc. Using this the authors compare a set of machine learning models and report their findings. \n\nWhile the work presented in the paper is informative, I feel there are a number of issues with the paper, making it unsuitable for publication in ICLR. Some of them include: \n- There is no new novel model or technique proposed in the paper. It is essentially a collection of experiments run on some dataset with reported findings. \n- The dataset used is really small. Making the generalizability of the results somewhat questionable. \n- Lastly, even though there is nothing technically wrong with the presented work, I feel that ICLR is not the best venue for such works. Perhaps a data science conference, such as, KDD/WSDM might be much better suited.",

            "review": "Quality: your paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of a number of methods. However, I am not convinced by the choice of methods or the need for them to be compared as such.\n\nClarity: the paper is unclear in a number of places.\n\nOriginality: as far as I am aware, the paper is novel.\n\nSignificance: As stated above, I do not believe you have made the case that we need a comparison of these methods on this dataset.\n\nMore detailed comments:\n\n1. The distinction between lazy and eager learning is not one that I find particularly helpful. Perhaps this is my own ignorance. I checked two standard ML textbooks (Bishop, Murphy) and neither mentions this distinction. As the crux of your paper is a comparison between these methods, you need to be very upfront about why this dichotomy is a useful one. And as your paper is very application-oriented, the justification needs to be related to that application.\n\n2. Your data is, fundamentally, spatial (actually spatiotemporal). Thus it would be appropriate to consider models that specifically account for spatial structure, e.g.  Gaussian processes.\n\n3. Do you have a novel methodological or theoretical contribution? A comparison of methods on an important dataset is no doubt useful, but I don't think ICLR is the right venue.",

            "review": "The paper investigates different machine learning approaches to model and\npredict the return on property investments, in particular with respect to eager\nand lazy learning techniques. The authors evaluate those different techniques on\na dataset of properties in Virginia. They conclude that lazy techniques provide\nbetter performance than eager ones.\n\nThe paper is a purely empirical study that does not introduce any novel\nmachine learning or evaluation techniques. The authors use the off-the-shelf\nWEKA toolbox. The results are not clear, given that only a single data set was\nused to evaluate the different approaches, and general recommendations cannot be\nmade.\n\nThe paper is not well written and the descriptions do not convey what the\nauthors have done very well. An example of this is Figure 3, which purports to\nshow the average rent (or rent distribution?) for different housing types. There\nare multiple categories in there that are not valid housing types (\"Make Me\nMove\") and the rents shown are incorrect (e.g. more than a million for a town\nhouse). It is also unclear why the average rent for a single family house is\napproximately 4 times as much as for a town house.\n\nThe problems with Figure 3 are exemplary of the paper; the other issues are too\nnumerous to list.\n\nIn summary, this paper should be rejected.",
