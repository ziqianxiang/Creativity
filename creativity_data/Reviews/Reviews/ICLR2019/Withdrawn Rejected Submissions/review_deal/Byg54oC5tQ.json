            "review": "This is an application paper making use of GANs to generate images based on an experimental setup in material sciences.\n\nThere is very little methodological novelty and the key contribution seems to be the application-specific formulation of the generative process, which I believe might be of limited interest to the ICLR community.\n\nOverall, the presentation of the paper could be improved. The shown images are too small, low resolution and visually it is hard to see any difference between the different models (Fig 8). The writing also needs to be improved as there are quite a few mistakes.\n\nMy impression is that the authors have not sufficiently covered prior work on image generation in experimental settings. There is a plethora of work on using GANs for image synthesis in computer vision and biological and medical imaging. The claim that \"none of these researchs have built a data-to-image model\" seems odd.\n\nI am also a bit confused about this introduced terminology of the image-to-data and data-to-image models which doesn't seem to be very meaningful.\n\nIn summary, I believe the paper could be of interest to the material sciences community but is not adequate for ICLR.",

            "review": "This paper focuses on introducing an application of generative adversarial model in generating irradiated material images, where alloy material features are extracted as vector to serve as prior information for the generation. Along with this paper, the authors also introduced a dataset of 22000 irradiated images with 22,143 sets of corresponding parameters.\nHere are the evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work.\n\nQuality: \n1) this paper is poorly written, with typos and errors here and there, e.g., \"some researchs\", \"methods... which has replaced\", \"Attn(\\cdot)\" vs \"Att(\\cdot)\", etc. \n2) Most variables are mentioned in the introduction section but not defined. Some of them are defined in later section but some are never defined.  The shape of these variables also need to be defined.\n3) The author should explain many concepts that are only familiar to some domain, e.g., \"cavity\", \"swelling cavities distribution\". Although they were mentioned in introduction and highlighted as important concepts, I am still confused what \"cavity\" refers to even finish reading this paper.\n4) The quality of all figures are extremely low! Especially Fig 3 which suppose to show performance comparison! I am shocked to see these figures in an ICLR submission.\n\nClarity:\nThe paper is not clearly structured and presented. Also the formulations are not fully motivated. For example, why the latent variables follow this prior distribution? Any explanation for the choice? \n\nOriginality:\ngenerative models for image, material, molecule generation has been studied for years. The model is not novel. The data is new, but less interesting than the publicly available molecular data repo, such as ZINC. \n\n \n",
