This is for use in massively multi-label situations where the class outputs are connected to some ontology. By using the ontology, the performance on long-tail classes with few examples should be improved.\nI like the method. It is intuitive and easy to implement. The only issue I have with the features and model is when in 3.1.2 the weights for the medical labels as input to the encoder are said to be 'tied' to the output label embeddings. I would like to have seem more justification for this (perhaps just the keeping number of parameters down?) or evaluation as to whether it helped - I think it may have hindered because of how the output label is used in the dot product.\nThe stated difference between this work and previous hierarchical softmax models is that they use DAG structures, not just tree structures. However, of the two datasets they try, only one (proteins) has a DAG structure to the ontology, and they do not have a baseline comparison with a hierarchical softmax model.\nThe method does show improvements at low number of examples against a flat sigmoid model in the small disease prediction and protein function prediction, but other results are mixed, especially for the proteins with the DAG ontology, which is where one would have liked to see an advantage.\nI would like to have seen performance against a hierarchical soft max framework, or on some openly available or benchmark datasets, otherwise it is hard to judge the utility of the method.\n",

            "review": "The authors propose a new training scheme for training neural networks for multi-label prediction tasks by introducing ontology relationships between labels.\nThe paper motivates very well by the observations that some labels include very small amount of data points.\nHowever, the authors don’t really investigate why such labels are rarely observed and the experiments don’t include any significance.\nThus overall I don’t think the paper is ready for publishing for ICLR yet.\n\nBelow are some more detailed comments:\n1) The authors discuss nicely about the intuition to introduce the Bayesian networks in the tasks of disease prediction. Essentially, the probability of assigning the label (leaf node) should be account for the probability of it being observed, namely the prior. Thus it is not surprising that for the rare labels, the proposed method would yield higher precision. However, the experiments don’t really include any significance measurement; especially for such tasks where the number of testing examples with rare labels is small (5~10 positive examples), significance measurement or some forms of hypothesis testing is a must-have in order to draw conclusion about the performance comparison. Answering such significance issue with tests for overfitting would be nice.\n\n2) My other major concern is for the protein function prediction task, the reason of why for certain labels, the number of instances is small, could be due to that a) there don’t exist much biological web-lab evidence, or b) among the population, there indeed only exist small number of proteins associated with such labels. The proposed method can address b) but not necessarily address a).\n\n3) The paper discusses the other results very briefly in Section 5 but doesn’t include any experiment comparison. Thus it is not convincing that the proposed method is making contribution to the field of disease prediction, protein function prediction or even general multi-label prediction. I would suggest to include the comparison with the state of the art methods for each application.\n\n4) Particularly for protein function prediction, another line of studies is to use protein protein interaction networks or other sources such as functional pathways rather than using sequence information alone (ref below). Some discussion would be nice.\n\nSchwikowski, Benno, Peter Uetz, and Stanley Fields. \"A network of protein–protein interactions in yeast.\" Nature biotechnology 18.12 (2000): 1257.\nCao, Mengfei, et al. \"New directions for diffusion-based network prediction of protein function: incorporating pathways with confidence.\" Bioinformatics 30.12 (2014): i219-i227.\n\n",

            "review": "This is a clear and well written paper that attempts to improve our ability to predict in the setting of massive multi-label data which, as the authors highlight, is an increasingly import problem in biology and healthcare. \n\nStrengths:\nThe idea of using the hierarchical structure of the labels is innovative and well-motivated. The experimental design and description of the methods is excellent. \n\nWeaknesses:\nOverall the results are not consistently strong and there is a key baseline missing. The approach only seems help in the \"rare label, small data\" regime, which limits the applicability of the method but is still worthy of consideration. \n\nMy biggest reservation is that the authors did not include a baseline where the classes are reweighted according to their frequency. Multilabel binary cross-entropy is very easy to modify to incorporate class weights (e.g. upweight the minority class for each label) and without this baseline I am unable to discern how well the method works relative to this simple baseline.\n\nOne more dataset would also strengthen the results, and since I am suggesting more work I will also try to be helpful and be specific. Predicting mesh terms from abstracts would qualify as a massive multilabel task and there is plenty of public data available here: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/databases/download/pubmed_medline.html \n\nFinally, there is one relevant paper that the authors may wish to consider in their review section: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/07/10/365965",
