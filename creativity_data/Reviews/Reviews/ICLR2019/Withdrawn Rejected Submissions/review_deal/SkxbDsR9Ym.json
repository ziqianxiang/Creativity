        "metareview": "This paper proposes a new scoring function for link prediction model that is based on a generative model for the knowledge graph, based on a random-walk model previously used for word embeddings. The new scoring function, as it is accompanied by the generative model, provides interesting theoretical results that the reviewers also appreciate. Finally, the results are quite strong, as they obtain state-of-art on the primary benchmarks for the task.\n\nBased on the submitted version, the reviewers and AC note the following potential weaknesses: (1) the reviewers felt that the proposed work is a direct application of the random-walk model from Arora et al. and thus limited in novelty, (2) given the generative model, the reviewers felt that the paper would benefit from an analysis of the learned embeddings, and their difference from ones from existing approaches, (3) The reviewers noted that the authors were using an incorrect version of FB15k and WN18, (4) the authors were not providing results for all the metrics, (5) the coverage of related work is quite limited.\n\nThe authors addressed many of the concerns raised by the reviewers in their comments and revision, in particular, they obtained state-of-art results for the corrected versions of the benchmarks. Further, they clarified the assumptions made in their modeling and revised the related work to include the papers that the reviewers mentioned. However, the concerns regarding the lack of novelty of the proposed approach, w.r.t Arora et al 2016 and the need for further analysis of the learned embeddings, still remain.\n\nThis paper comes really close to getting accepted, but ultimately the reviewers agree that the remaining concerns need to be addressed.",

            "review": "This paper proposes to perform the link prediction in knowledge bases by introducing a new scoring function and theoretically motivating their method. The authors validate their proposed approach through several experiments. \n\nThis paper reads well and the results appear sound. I personally find the theoretical argument behind the proposed scoring function very interesting. Unfortunately, the contribution seems rather small to be accepted for ICLR. This is a straight application and combination of existing pieces with not much originality and without being backed up by very strong experimental results. My concerns are as follows:\n\n   - Having only results on two flawed datasets (considering the inverse relations in them) makes it hard to evaluate the quality of the method. I suggest conducting the experiments on the FB15K-237 and WN18RR from [1] instead. \n   - You only evaluate on MR and Hits@10, but it is standard to include metrics like MRR and Hits@1 and 3 also, since no metric is perfect for this task.\n   - Since the goal of the work is not providing a state of the art method, and focus on the theoretical understanding of their scoring function, it is of high importance to assess the characteristics of their embeddings and scoring function through designing other experiments. As a result, I suggest to study the geometric behavior of their embeddings and compare it to the other methods. Further, investigating the semantic purity of the embeddings by calculating the entropy of the type distribution of the entities, similar as [2], can shed more light on the significance of their method.\n\nOn overall, although the proposed method seems a direct application of Arora et al.,2016a, I find their extension novel and quite interesting, But the paper needs more experimental results to validate the idea.  \n\n\n[1] Dettmers, Tim, et al. \"Convolutional 2d knowledge graph embeddings.\", AAAI-18.\n[2] Ding, Boyang, et al. \"Improving Knowledge Graph Embedding Using Simple Constraints.\", ACL-18.\n",

More specifically, the authors try to extend the random walk model (Arora et al., 2016a) of word embeddings to KGE.\n\nSome of my detailed comments and questions below.\n\n1. To me, this paper sounds like a direct application of the method of Arora et al., 2016a to KGE. Therefore, this does look like a very obvious application, and it is not clear to me if this paper presents any new methods or if you have obtained any new insights.\n\n2. The paper claims that all prior work use some sort of heuristics in the KGE task, and their approach is a generative account that might deal with this issue? But I personally found that by using random walk and the exp function, you are also making some very strong assumptions that are similar to heuristics? How do you know it is exp function but not other function? \n\n3. I am not sure what the purpose for the evaluation section is. You mention that this paper is not about state-of-the-art results, but if you theory really works, your scoring function should beat SOTA results. \n\nOverall, I have to say that I am very disappointed with this paper, because there are no new theoretical tools being introduced, and the authors seem to be applying Arora et al., 2016a from word embedding to KGE only.

By using the flawed FB15k and WN18 datasets, the evaluation is biased towards the usage of inverse relations which should not exist in a link prediction evaluation dataset.\n- The authors are not mentioning and comparing to walk based approaches like node2vec [2], Deepwalk [3], and rdf2vec [4]. \n\n\nDue to the missing comparisons to the mentioned references above and the possible bias in the evaluation, I am leaning towards rejecting the paper.\n\n\nMinor comments:\n\n.
