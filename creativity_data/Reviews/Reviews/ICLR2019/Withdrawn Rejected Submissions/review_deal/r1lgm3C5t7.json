This is an important topic but the paper is ok and I think the test case is a bit lacking.\n\nThe theory  is sound and the math is good. The only question I have is how does this hold on a real quantum computer such as IBMQ/rigetti quantum computing etc.. or even under a noisy simulator \n\nAlthough the paper is sounds and it is a good idea, the presentation is a bit lacking. There are several typos and formatting problems, such as excess spaces and some sort of hex code (9b8d) in the abstract which I am guessing is left over from the NIPS template.\nTwo other things is that usually in double blind review one should not leave the emails with affiliation and one should anonymize the Acknowledgements as well.",

            "review": "Summary of paper:\nThe authors partially integrate a neural network into classical approaches to classify the state of a quantum circuit. The model is not actually clear in what it is doing, but there are some trained weights somewhere. They allow for an \"uncertainty\" prediction by giving one more node than there are classification targets, corresponding to a less-penalized uncertain prediction. They evaluate their model on numerical simulations.\n\nStrengths:\n-\nWeaknesses:\n- The neural network architecture is entirely standard with nothing new.\n- The paper is poorly written and very hard to follow.\n- The focus is almost exclusively on the application, and yet the application is not explained effectively.\n- The implication of the results and usefulness is not elaborated.\n- The particular contributions are not clear.\n\nSuggested Revisions:\n- What is the 9b8d in the first sentence of the abstract?\n- \"...been developed to address the question [of] whether quantum mechanics...\"\n- \"...for all the dataset[s] in Table 1...\"",

I am a big fan of Google, UCL, and the Royal Society, and this strongly biases my view of the work. \n\nMy biased review:\n\n- the paper is interesting, and should go to another venue. I do not think the authors will get benefit from presenting this work at ICLR (there is a tiny quantum focus).\n\n- how is the cost function justified? I'd be curious to see how the authors derived it. Right now above Eq 2.4 it seems like it is heuristic to balance successful/erroneous/inconclusive rates. If it is a heuristic, the paper should clearly state this. \n\n- using simple examples of quantum data and quantum states would go a long way towards helping me understand the problem setup (Eq 2.1). It took me a while to grok this.\n\n- The acronym POVM is never defined. ",
