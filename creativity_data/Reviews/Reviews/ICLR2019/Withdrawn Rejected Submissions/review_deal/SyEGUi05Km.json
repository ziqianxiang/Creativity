            "review": "The authors propose a generative adversarial network (GAN) to tackle the task of generating new chemically stable crystallographic structures with increased domain complexity. The proposed architecture, named CrystalGAN, consists of two steps where in each step a CycleGAN network is employed. \nThe application seems novel and the use of CycleGAN seems to be an interesting direction. However, the paper contains major problems which makes it unsuitable for publication at ICLR 2019.\n\nMajor problems:\n-\tThe clarity of the text needs to be improved a lot. Many important parts are obscure and difficult to interpret. \n-\tThe “feature transfer” step seems to be the most important trick in the proposed architecture, however, the “feature transfer” section is rather superficial and do not even detail what exactly the authors mean by “feature”. It is not clear how the ternary compositions are created using the generated binary compositions.\n-\tI have had a hard time trying to understand the reason for using the two proposed steps:\no\tIt is not clear why Step 1 is necessary. As far as I understand, one could do “feature transfer” directly on the input data (AH, BH) and then feed it to the “Step 2”.\no\tLooks like the main reason for using Step 2 is to enforce the geometric constraints. If that is the case, why not just directly apply the geometric constraints on data generated in “Step 1 + Feature Transfer” and then use the resulting data as the final output? (This should be at least a baseline)\no\tAdditionally, there is no guarantee that the data generated in Step 1 is of good quality. Training a generator (Step 2) using bad data, will result in bad data. \n-\tThe type of input/output data should be more clearly detailed.\n-\tThe experimental section is very limited, and it is difficult to draw concrete conclusions from it. As a paper that is focused on a new application, the experimental section should be far more extensive. \n-\tThe comparison with a standard GAN and DiscoGAN do not make sense. Of course these two types of GANs will not be able to generate ternary compositions if they are trained with binary compositions only. A more reasonable comparison would be with GAN /  DiscoGAN trained using the dataset generated by “Step 1 + Feature Transfer” or by Feature Transfer applied to the raw data.\n\nSome additional questions/comments:\n-\tEqs. (3) and (4) are not regular reconstruction loss functions, they are cycle consistency losses.  \n-\tEqs. (12) and (13) do not look correct. The “sum” and the “min” (inside the sum) use the same variable index “i”. I do not understand these equations.\n",

            "review": "I have not worked in the material science field and I am not familiar with the crystallographic structures, nor the GAN. Below is my best try. \n\nThis work proposed a GAN based method to generate crystallographic structures with 3 chemical elements from samples with two chemical elements. What I liked the most about this paper is that they work closely with the material science researcher to define the problem, the experiments and analyzing the results. I believe this is the very important for application papers comparing to just inventing ideas.\n\nThe paper is very well structured and clearly written. The code will be published online after the reviewing phase. Some detailed comments following:\n\n1. To demonstrate the general applicability of the method, could you give more examples with increasing complexity that can use your method?\n2. The author write the aim for e.q. (5) is “to control the original observations are reconstructed as accurate as possible”. Isn’t this already defined in the reconstruction loss? Could you elaborate more on this?\n3. In the experiments, you compared your method with a classical Gan. Is it possible to incorporate the distance constraints e.q. (12) into the classical GAN? Will this be a more fair comparison?\n4. In the Section 4.3, the author mentioned verifying the composition needs DFT, which is computationally expensive. How about just verifying the successful ones generated by CrystalGAN with constraints?\n",

            "review": "As a reviewer I am expert in learning in structured data domains. I am not an expert in chemistry or related areas.\nThe paper proposes a GAN-based system for the generation of ternary compounds of interest starting from observations on binary compounds. \nTo me the paper is not providing sufficient details and explanations/justifications to allow a full comprehension of the relevance and validity of the proposed approach.  For example, it is not clear to me what is the aim of the first step of the approach. The author(s) claim it is needed to generate \"...new data with increased complexity\".  How is complexity defined ? Why this is needed to reach the final goal ? How can the proposed approach guarantee that it will lead to a \"good\" increase in complexity ? \nI am not stating that  the proposed model for the first step is not achieving the intended purpose, but that from the current presentation in the text I was not able to understand that. \nSince I am not an expert in chemistry, I was not able to grasp what are the properties from A and B which are merged. In general, I found presentation to assume specific domain background knowledge that probably is not known by most of the ICLR attendees.\nSince I was not able to understand the first step, I had difficulty also to follow the second step.\nIn addition to the presentation issue, I think that the experimental part needs to be improved by enlarging the set of used data. The current assessment involves a single dataset of a relatively small size. Moreover, the number of returned valid ternary compounds is, in proportion to the size of the dataset, very small. \nOverall I see the paper as a preliminary report of a preliminary work, which potentially could contribute in a novel way to a relevant problem in the design of advanced materials.\nAs already said before, I think that the paper could be understood and of interest for only  a small fraction of ICLR attendees.\n",
