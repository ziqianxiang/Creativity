It proposes a general framework to few from the very few sample, extract a latent representation z, and apply it to do segmentation on a query. Cases of semantic, interactive and video segmentation are applied. Experiments are very thorough.\n\nWe see too many variants of few-shot learning papers on mini-imagenet or omniglot. For the reason of applying to high-level segmentation, the paper already deserves an acceptance for the first work. I believe this work would inspire many follow-ups in related domain (especially for high-level vision tasks)\n\nComments:\n\n- what is interactive segmentation? I looked through the related work, it just mentioned some previous work without defining or describing it.\n\n- z is the network output of g? is there any constraint on z? Like Gaussian distributions like what z is like in VAE models. \n\n",

            "review": "Summary:\nThis paper proposed a few-shot learning approach for interactive segmentation. Given a set of user-annotated points, the proposed model learns to generate dense segmentation masks of objects. To incorporate the point-wise annotation, the guidance network is introduced. The proposed idea is applied to guided image segmentation, semantic segmentation, and video segmentation.\n\nClarity:\nOverall, the presentation of the paper can be significantly improved. First of all, it is not clear what the problem setting of this paper is, as it seems to have two sets of training data of fully-annotated images (for training) and the combined set of point-wise annotated images and unannotated images (guidance images T in the first equation); It is not clear whether authors generate the second dataset out of the first one, or they have separate datasets for these two. Also, it is not clear how the authors incorporate the unannotated images for training. \n\nThe descriptions on model architecture are also not quite clear, as it involves two components (g and f) but start discussing with g without providing a clear overview of the combined model (I would suggest changing the order of Section 4.1 and Section 4.2 to make it clearer). The loss functions are introduced in the last part of the method, which makes it also very difficult to understand. \n\nOriginality and significance:\nThe technical contribution of the paper is very limited. I do not see many novel contributions in terms of both network architecture and learning perspective.\n\nExperiment:\nOverall, I am not quite convinced with the experiment results. The method is compared against only a few (not popular) interactive segmentation methods, although there exist many recent works addressing the same task (e.g. Xu et al. 2016). \n\nThe experiment settings are also not clearly presented. For instance, what is the dataset used for the evaluation of the first paragraph in section 5.1? How do you split the Pascal VOC data to exclusive sets? How do you sample point-wise annotation from dense mask labels? How does the sampling procedure affect the performance? \n\nThe performance of the guided semantic segmentation is also quite low, limiting the practical usefulness of the method. Finally, the paper does not present qualitative results, which are essential to understanding the performance of the segmentation system. \n\nMinor comments:\n1. There are a lot of grammar issues. Please revise your draft.\n2. Please revise the notations in equations. For instance, \n    T = {{(x_1, L_1),...} \\cup {\\bar{x}_1,...}\n    L_s = {(p_j,l_j):j\\in{1,...,P}, l\\in{1,...,K}\\cup{\\emptyset}}\n    Also, in the next equation, j\\in\\bar{x}_q} -> p_ j\\in\\bar{x}_q} (j is an index of pixel)\n",

            "review": "Summary\nThis paper proposes to formulate diverse segmentation problems as a guided segmentation, whose task is defined by the guiding annotations.\nThe main idea of this paper is using meta-learning to train a single neural network performing guidance segmentation.\nSpecifically, they encode S annotated support image into a task representation and use it to perform binary segmentation.\nBy performing episodic optimisation, the model's guidance to segmentation output is defined by the task distribution.\n\nStrength\nLearning a single segmentation algorithm to solve various segmentation problem is an interesting problem that worth exploring.\nThis paper tackles this problem and showed results on various segmentation problems.\n\nWeakness\nThe proposed method, including the architecture and training strategy, is relatively simple and very closely related to existing approach. Especially, the only differences with the referenced paper (Shaban et al., 2017) is how the support is fused and how multiple guidance could be handled, which can be done by averaging. These differences are relatively minor, so I question the novelty of this paper.\n\nThis paper performs experiments on diverse tasks but the method is compared with relatively weak baselines absolute performance looks bad compared to existing algorithms exploiting prior knowledge for each of the tasks.\nFor example, the oracle performance in semantic segmentation (fully supervised method) is 0.45 IOU in PASCAL VOC dataset, while many existing algorithms could achieve more than 0.8 mean IOU in this dataset. \nIn addition, I question whether foreground / background baseline is reasonable baseline for all these tasks, because a little domain knowledge might already give very strong result on various segmentation tasks.\nFor example, in terms of video segmentation, one trivial baseline might include propagating ground truth labels in the first frame with color and spatial location similarity, which might be already stronger than the foreground / background baseline.\n\nThere are some strong arguments that require further justification. \n- In 4.3, authors argue that the model is trained with S=1, but could operate with different (S, P).\nHowever, it's suspicious whether this would be really true, because it requires generalisation to out-of-distribution examples, which is very difficult machine learning problem. The performance in Figure 5 (right) might support the difficulty of this generalisation, because increasing S does not necessarily increase the performance.\n- In 5.3, this paper investigated whether the model trained with instances could be used for semantic segmentation. I think performing semantic segmentation with model trained for instance segmentation in the same dataset might show reasonable performance, but this might be just because there are many images with single instance in each image and because instance annotations in this dataset are based on semantic classes. So the argument that training with instance segmentation lead to semantic segmentation should be more carefully made.\n\nOverall comment\nI believe the method proposed in this paper is rather incremental and analysis is not supporting the main arguments of this paper and strength of the proposed method. \nEspecially, simple performance comparison with weak baselines give no clues about the property of the method and advantage of using this method compared to other existing approaches.\n",
