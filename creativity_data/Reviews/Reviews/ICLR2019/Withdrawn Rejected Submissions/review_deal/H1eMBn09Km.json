            "review": "The authors propose an interesting idea of generating synthetic data sets for ride sharing. In particular, they split the space/time into small spatial/temporal cells (50mx50m and 5min) each containing number of requests (or a scaled version of it), and train a conditional GAN to output these cell values given an input 5-min time label. They validate the results using metrics from graph and fractals theory.\nWhile the idea is interesting, the execution of the paper is lacking. Some details are missing and especially key things such as metrics should be explained better.\n- How is the data represented? It says that pixel represents the number of ride requests, how exactly? Then, in the next paragraph it is said that pixel represents presence/absence of ride requests, so which one is it. This is a critical part of the proposal and is not well explained.\n- y-axis in Figure 2 is not explained.\n- Metrics should be better explained. How are edges defined, when you only model requests, not destinations? This is far from being clear.\n- In addition, how is D2 defined? Do we compute one for each time, or how? What exactly is \"side e\", what is a \"side\" here? Basically both metrics are not well defined.\n- \"We can claim strong similarity ...\", what is this justified by?\n- Second paragraph in Section 3.1 is not clear, reads very strangely.\n-  Labels are being mentioned before being defined, adding to confusion.\n- It is clear from Figure 2 that workdays and weekends are very different, yet the authors chose to ignore that fact during modeling. They do mention that we can choose any labeling we want, but still strange that for the experiments this was not taken into account.\n- The authors mention that cells as 1.2km x 1.2km, but Figure 3 shows much different resolution. Seems that the figure is just given as an example, but reading the text one gets an impression that the figure was actually used in the paper. This needs to be clarified.\n- For the classifier, it says that \"time sequence of the data\" is a label, what does this mean? You mean the actual label, or some time sequence? This is confusing, although it seems that simply the 5-min label was used.\n- Could we add the metrics to the loss, to enforce them as the authors say that that would result in strong similarity?\n- One of the major flaws of the paper is missing baseline. It is very difficult to appreciate the results without any reference result.\n- Again, I am not sure how results in Section 5.2 are computed when only requests are modeled.\n- Footnote 2 in the conclusion mentions baselines, yet there are none mentioned in the paper.",

            "review": "The paper works on a very interesting problem: generating ride hailing demand map using deep learning technique. The idea is novel and interesting. The paper adopts two metric to evaluate the performance of the algorithm and shows that the performance is good. However, the problem is a little far from real world cases, which limits the contribution of the paper.\n\nThe title of the paper is very attractive. Before reading the paper, I was very excited and wanted to see the algorithm could generate the driving trajectory by using GAN. However, it can only generate the pickup location, which makes me a little disappointed. In real world applications, in riding hailing industry, the demand/supply estimation have been wide investigated. And it can be very accurate. It is not clear why we need to generate it. On the other hand, the paper only adopts conventional GAN to this application. Technically the contribution is not significant. The paper only considers time slot for generating the new data. In this area, much more information has been used. The authors are suggested to survey the smart transportation or riding sharing research area. The training solution is not satisfied. The model is only trained for each small area in the city. The training set is very limited, which may make the model overfit. Thus the experiments and the results are not convincing. In current GIS or transportation area, usually we would use a unique model for the whole city. At least the authors should discuss their algorithm for the scale issue.\n\nOverall, the paper works on a very interesting problem. However, the current solution should be improved.\n",

            "review": "The paper produces a heat-map of ride-share requests in four cities in the USA. For each city 'block' they produce a time-sequence of 2016 images representing a week-long run from combining each 5-minute interval. This is used with a GAN to produce new data. The techniques applied, although not commonly used in the context of ride sharing / hailing, have been used extensively in other literature.\n\nSome major points on the paper:\n1) A GAN approach is normally used to generate more data when enough real data is not obtainable. However, here you only use one week of data from a much larger set. Surely, it would be better to make use of all the weeks available?\n\n2) It is not clear how the heat-maps once produced could be used in the future. There is a hint in the results section about how they can be converted back to ride requests, but this is not clearly defined.\n\n3) There are a number of cases where you state that some approach has been found to be better. However, no evidence is presented for how you determined this to be true.\n\n4) The conversion of data to heat-maps has been used extensively in prior research. Although I'm not directly aware of the use in machine learning I am aware of the use in transport - \"Interactive, graphical processing unit- based evaluation of evacuation scenarios at the state scale\". The novelty here seems to be the application to this specific problem.\n\nMore specific points:\n- \"Our real ride request data sets consist of all the ride requests for an entire week for the four cities.\" - it's not clear - are all four cities used to train one model?\n\n- \"Hence the week-long data should be quite representative.\" - This fails to take into account such things as national holidays or other major events such as sports. Did your chosen week contain one of these?\n\n- \"Hence we believe the ride request data sets also reflect the overall urban mobility patterns for these cities.\" - This is a huge assumption, which would seem to need evidence to back it up.\n\n- \"and lump together all the ride requests within each interval.\" - Presumably you mean that all time values are to the granularity of 5 minutes? \n\n- \"We arbitrarily sized each block to represent an image of 24\u000224 pixels\" - this seems particularly small.\n\n- \"Each image of that block is labeled with a time interval (for our experiments, the hour in a day).\" - Can the variability within an hour not make this more difficult? \n\n- \"We find that small networks are appropriate for the training data\" - evidence to support this.\n\n- \"This network is pre-trained on the training data\" - which training data are you referring to?\n\n- \"This is found to increase the efficiency of the training process\" - evidence?\n\n- \"In this work we set the block size for each of the four cities to be\n1200 \u0002 1200 meters\" - how was this value arrived at?\n\n- You state that GPUs were no more efficient, it would be good to see more analysis of this.\n\n- \"To help enhancing the scalability\" -> \"To help enhance the scalability\"\n\n- \"and other useful functions\" - such as?\n\n- Figure 4 would probably work better as a speedup graph.\n\n- \"Running times for sampling ride requests from the trained models and stitching the images of all the blocks together are significantly less than the training times, and are not included in these results.\" - at least some figures to give an idea of scale should be provided.",
