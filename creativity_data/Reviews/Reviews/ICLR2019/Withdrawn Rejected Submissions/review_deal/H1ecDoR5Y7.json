            "review": "Based on a dynamic system perspective, this paper characterizes the convergence of gradient penalized Wasserstein GAN. The analytic framework is similar to the one used in Nagarajan & Kolter but requires very heavy machinery to handle measure valued differentiation. Overall the math seems solid but I have a few questions about the motivation and assumption. \n\n1. To my limited knowledge, it seems that the two-time-scale framework [1] handles both batch and stochastic settings well also from a dynamic system perspective. I am wondering why not follow their path since under their framework adding a gradient penalty does not introduce all the technical difficulty in this paper. \n\n2. The main theorem characterizes the stability or convergence but does not characterize the advantage of gradient penalty. Does it make the system more stable? At least more technical discussion around the theorem is needed. \n\n3. Besides the technicality of handling the support of the measure, what is new beyond the analysis of Nagarajan & Kolter?\n\n[1] GANs Trained by a Two Time-Scale Update Rule Converge to a Local Nash Equilibrium\nby Martin Heusel, Hubert Ramsauer, Thomas Unterthiner, Bernhard Nessler, Sepp Hochreiter\n\nI may be missing something and would like to see the author's response. \n\n=== after rebuttal ===\n\nI have carefully read the authors' response. I appreciate the explanation. After reading [1] in detail, my conclusion is still that [1] seems to be a stronger framework than the current one and easily extends to the setting with gradient penalty. Compared with Nagarajan and Kolter, the contribution of this paper seems to be minor, although technically involved. I have checked the updated pdf but haven't found the authors' rigorous \"more stable\" argument.",

            "title": "assumptions need better justification",
            "review": "This paper shows that an ideal equilibrium point of a SGP-WGAN is stable. It makes several assumptions that, while clear why they are needed in the proof, is unjustified in practice. The authors should elaborate on these assumptions and comment on why they are reasonable. \n\nAssumptions 1 and 3 essentially say that there is a tube (both in sample space and in parameter space) around the true data generating distribution in which the discriminator cannot distinguish. This seems a strong restriction to the effect of the discriminator is weak. For example, Assumption 1 says if given a sample slightly off the data manifold, it still cannot distinguish at all. A more reasonable assumption is the ability of the discriminator decays gracefully as samples approach the data manifold.\n\nAssumption 2 is also unjustified. Its main effect seems to be to eliminate a few terms in the projected Jacobian in the proof, but its relevance and whether it is reasonable in practice is entirely unmentioned.\n\nFinally, it is unclear why this notion of ``measure valued differentiation'' is needed. First, differentiation in measure spaces is no different from differentiation in other infinite dimensional functions spaces: the usual notions of Gateaux and Frechet differentiability apply. Second, the derivatives in questions are not true ``measure-derivatives'' in the sense that the argument to the function being differentiated is not a measure, it is a finite dimensional parameter. In the end, this seems essentially a derivative of a multi-variate function.",

            "title": "Implications of local stability of dynamical system to \"real world\" setting not clear",
            "review": "In the paper, WGAN with a squared zero centered gradient penalty term w.r.t. to a general measure is studied. Under strong assumptions, local stability of a time-continuous gradient ascent/descent dynamical system near an equilibrium point are proven for the new GP term. Experiments show comparable results to the original WGAN-GP formulation w.r.t. FID and inception score.\n\nOverall, I vote for rejecting the paper due to the following reasons:\n- The proven convergence theorem is for a time-continuous \"full-batch\" dynamical system, which is very far from what happens in practice (stochastic + time discrete optimization with momentum etc). I don't believe that one can make any conclusions about what is actually happening for GANs from such an idealized setting. Overall, I don't understand why I should care about local stability of that dynamical system.\n- Given the previous point I feel the authors draw too strong conclusions from their results. I don't think Theorem 1 gives too many insights about the success of gradient penalty terms.\n- There are only marginal improvements in practice over WGAN-GP when using other penalty measures. \n\nFurther remarks:\n- In the introduction it is claimed that mode collapse is due to JS divergence and \"low-dimensionality of the data manifold\". This is just a conjecture and the statement should be made more weak.\n\n- The preliminaries on measure theory are unnecessarily complicated (e.g. partly developed in general metric spaces). I suggest that the authors try to simplify the presentation for the considered case of R^n and avoid unnecessarily complicated (\"mathy\") definitions as they distract from the actual results. \n\n==after rebuttal==\nAfter reading the authors rebuttal I increased the my rating to 6 as they addressed some of my doubts. I still think that the studied setting is too idealized, but it is a first step towards an analysis.",
