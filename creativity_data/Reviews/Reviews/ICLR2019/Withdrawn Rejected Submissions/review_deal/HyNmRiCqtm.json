            "review": "The paper proposes an approach to provide contrastive visual explanations for deep neural networks -- why the network assigned more confidence to some class A as opposed to some other class B. As opposed to the applicability of previous approaches to this problem -- the approach is designed to directly answer the contrastive explanations question rather adapting other visual saliency techniques for the same. Overall, while I find the proposed approach simple -- the paper needs to address some issues regarding the claims made and should provide more quantitative experimental results justifying the same.\n\n- Apart from some flaws in the claims made in the paper, the paper is easy to follow and understand.\n- Assuming the availability of a latent model over the images of the input distribution, the proposed approach is directly applicable and faster.\n- The authors clearly highlight the problems associated with existing explanation modalities and approaches; ranging from ones applicable to only specific deep architectures to ones using backpropagation based heuristics.\n- The proposed approach to generate contrastive explanations is simple and is structured along the lines of methods utilizing probe images to explain decisions -- except for the added advantage that the provided explanations are instance-agnostic due to the assumption of a latent model over the input distribution.\n\nComments:\n- One of the problems highlighted in the paper regarding existing explanation modalities is the use of another black-box to explain the decisions of an existing deep network (also somewhat of a black-box) which the authors claim their model does not suffer from. The proposed approach provides explanations by operating in the latent space of a learned generative model of the input distribution. The learned generator in itself is somewhat of a black-box itself -- there has been prior work indicating how much of the input distribution are GANs able to capture. As such, conditioning on a generative model to propose such contrastive explanations is to some extent using another black-box (generator) to explain the decisions of an existing one. Thus, the above claim made in the paper does not seem well-founded. Furthermore, in experiments, the paper does not provide any quantitatively convincing results to suggest the generator in use is a good one.\n- While the authors suggest that a latent model over the input distribution needs to be trained only once and is applicable off-the-shelf for any further contrastive explanations regarding any network operating on the same dataset -- learning such a model of the input space is an overhead in itself. In this light, experiments demonstrating comparisons between GANs and VAEs as the reference generative model for explanations would have made the paper stronger (as the proposed approach relies explicitly on how good the generative model is). \n- The paper proposes an interesting experiment to show that the proposed approach is somewhat capable of capturing slightly adversarial biases in the input domain (adding square to the top-left of images of class ‘8’). While I like this experiment, I feel this has not been explored to completion in the sense of experimenting with robustness with respect to structured as well as unstructured perturbations.\n- Typographical Errors: Section 3.1 repeats the use of D for a discriminator as well as the input distribution. Procedure 1 and Procedure 2 share the same titles -- which is slightly misleading. In addition, Procedure 1 is not referenced in the text which makes is hard to understand the utility of the same. In Section 4.1, the use of Gradcam and Lime to generate counterfactual explanations is not very clear and makes it slightly hard to follow. Citations used for Gradcam are wrong -- Sundarajan et al., 2016 should be changed to Selvaraju et al., 2017.\n\nExperimental Issues:\n- Experimental results are provided only on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST. Since the paper focuses explicitly on providing contrastive explanations for choosing a class A over another class B -- experiments on datasets which do not have real-images seem insufficient. Additional experiments on at least ImageNet would have made the paper stronger.\nRegarding contrastive explanations, experiments on datasets where distractor classes (y_probe) are present in addition to the class interest (y_true) seem important -- PASCAL VOC, COCO, etc. Specifically, since the explanations provided are visual saliency maps the paper would have been stronger if there were experiments suggesting -- what needs to change in a region of an image classified as a ‘cat’ to be classified as a ‘dog’ while there is an instance of the class - ‘dog’ present in the image itself. Also, section 7 in Gradcam (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.02391.pdf) provides a procedure to generate counter-factual explanations using Gradcam. Is there a particular reason the authors did not choose to adopt the above technique as a baseline?\n- Experimental results provided in the paper are only qualitative -- as such, I do not find the comparisons (and improvements) over the existing approaches convincing enough. Since, there is no clear metric to evaluate contrastive explanations -- human studies to judge the class-discriminativeness (or trust) of the proposed approach would have made the paper stronger.\n\nThe authors adressed the issues raised/comments made in the review. In light of my comments below to the author responses -- I am not inclined towards increasing my rating and will stick to my original rating for the paper.",

            "review": "\nThe paper addresses the problem of providing saliency-based visual explanations of deep models tasked at image classification. More specifically, instead of generating visualizations directly highlighting the image pixels that support the the decision of an image belonging to class A, it generates \"contrastive\" visualizations indicating the pixels that should be added or suppressed in order to support the decision of a image belonging to class A and not to class B.\n\nThe method formulates the generation of these contrastive explanations through a generative adversarial network (GAN), where the discriminator D is the image classification model to be explained and the generator G is a generative model trained to produce images from the dataset used to train D.\n\nExperiments on the MNIST and fashion-MNIST datasets compares the performance of the proposed method w.r.t. some methods from the literature.\n\n\nOverall the manuscript is well written and its content is relatively easy to follow. The idea of generating contrastive explanations through a GAN-based formulation is well motivated and seems novel to me.\n\nMy main concern with the manuscript are the following:\n\ni) The proposed method seems to be specifically designed for the generation of contrastive explanations, i.e. why the model predicted class A and not class B. While the generation of this type of explanations is somewhat novel, from the text it seems that the proposed method may not be able to indicate what part of the image content drove the model to predict class A. Is this indeed the case?\n\nii) Although the idea of generating contrastive explanations is quite interesting, it is not that novel. See Kim et al., NIPS'16, Dhurandhar et al., arXiv:1802.07623. Moreover, regarding the presented results on the MNIST dataset (Sec 4.1) where some of the generated explanations highlight gaps to point differences between digit classes. The work from Samek et al., TNNLS'17 and  Oramas et al., arXiv:1712.06302 seem to display similar properties in their explanations without the need of explicit constractive pair-wise training/testing. The manuscript would benefit from positioning the proposed method w.r.t. these works.\n\niii) Very related to the first point, in the evaluation section (Sec.4.1) the proposed method is compared against other methods in the literature. Three of these methods, i.e. Lime, GradCam, PDA, are not designed for producing contrastive explanations, so I am not sure to what extend this comparison is appropriate.\n\niv) Finally, the reported results are mostly qualitative. I find the set of provided qualitative examples quite reduced. In this regard, I encourage the authors to update the supplementary material in order to show extended qualitative results of the explanations produced by their method.\nIn addition, I recommend complementing the presented qualitative comparisons with quantitative evaluations following protocols proposed in existing work, e.g. a) occlusion analysis (Zeiler et al., ECCV 2014, Samek et al.,2017), a pointing experiment (Zhang et al., ECCV 2016), or c) a measurement of explanation accuracy by feature coverage (Oramas et al. arXiv:1712.06302).\n\n",

            "review": "The idea proposed in this paper is to aid in understanding networks by showing why a network chose class A over class B.  To do so, the goal is to find an example that is close to the original sample, but belongs to the other class. As is mentioned in the paper, it is crucial to stay on the data manifold for this to be meaningful. In the paper, an approach using a GAN to traverse the manifold is proposed and the experimental evaluation is done on MNIST.\n\nIf my understanding is correct the proposed approach requires:\nFinding a noise code z_0 such that the GAN generates an image G(z_0) close to the original input x. As a metric L2 distance is proposed.\nFind a point close to z_b that is close z_0  s.t. Class B is the most likely class and class A is the second most likely prediction. Specifically it is required that\nThe log likelihood of but classified as class B with the same log likelihood of class B for G(z_b) is the same as the log likelihood of class A for the input x.\nSuch that all other classes have a log likelihood that is at least epsilon lower than both the one of class A and class B.\n\nThe proposed approach is compared to a set of other interpretability methods, which were \nGrad-Cam, lime, PDA, xGEM on MNIST AND Fashion MNIST data. The proposed evaluation is all qualitative, i.e. subjective. It must also be noted that in the methods used for comparison are not used as originally intended.\n\n\nCurrently, I do not recommend this paper to be accepted for the following reasons.\nThe idea of using a GAN is to generate images in input space is not novel by itself. Although the application for interpretability by counterfactuals is. It is unclear to me how much of the appealing results come from the GAN model and how much come from truly interpreting the network. I have detailed this below by proposing a very simplistic baseline which could get similar results.\nThe experimental approach is subjective and I am not convinced by the experimental setup.\nOn the other hand, I do really appreciate the ideas of traversing the manifold. \n\nRemarks \nRelated work and limitations of existing interpretability methods are discussed properly. Of course, the list of discussed methods is not exhaustive. The work on the PPGAN and the “Synthesizing the preferred inputs for neurons in neural networks via deep generator networks” is not mentioned although it seems very related to the proposed approach to traverse the manifold. What that work sets apart from the proposed approach is that is could be applied to imaganet and not just MNIST. \n\nTraversing the manifold to generate explanations is certainly a good idea and one that I completely support. One limitation of the proposed approach is that it is unclear to me whether a point on the decision boundary is desirable or that a point that is equally likely is desirable. My reasoning is that the point on the decision boundary is the minimal change and therefore the best explanation. In such a setup, the GAN is still crucial to make sure the sample remains on the data manifold and is not caused by adverarial effects.\n\nThe exact GAN structure and training approach should be detailed in this paper. Now only a reference is provided. \n\nCan you clarify how the constraints are encoded in the optimization problem?\n\nThe grad cam reference has the wrong citation\n\nI do not understand the second paragraph of section 4.1. As mentioned in the paper, these other methods were not designed to generate this type of application. Therefore the comparison could be considered unfair. \n\nI would propose the following baseline. For image x from class A, find image y from class B such that x-y has minimal L2 norm and is correctly classified. Use y instead of the GAN generated image. Is the result much less compelling? Is it actually less efficient that the entire GAN optimization procedure on these relatively small datasets? \n\n\nI do have to say that I like the experiment with the square in the upper corner. It does show that the procedure does not necesarrily exploits adversarial effects. However, the baseline proposed above would also highlight that specific square?\n\n\nFigure 5 shows that multiple descision boundaries are crossed. Is this behaviour desired? It seems very likely to me that it should be possible to move from 9 to 8 while staying on the manifold without passing through 5? Since the method takes a detour through 5’s is this common behaviour?\n\n\nFINAL UPDATE\n--------------------\nUnfortunately, I am not entirely convinced by the additional experiments that we are truly looking into the classifier instead of analyzing the generative model. \nI believe this to be currently the key issue that, even after the revision, needs to be addressed more thoroughly before it can be accepted for publication.
