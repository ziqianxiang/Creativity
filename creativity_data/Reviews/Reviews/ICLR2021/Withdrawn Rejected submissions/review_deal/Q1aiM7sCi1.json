In particular, datasets are limited and (Lacombe et al. 2018) is not included as a comparison partner, although the authors had a chance to include it in the author response phase. Since this point is crucial, I will reject the paper.\n\nAddressing these points will largely improve the paper, and also reviewers put a great effort to give detailed reviews for the paper. So I hope the authors take the reviews into consideration for further revision of the paper."

            "review": "The paper proposes a new clustering algorithm for persistence diagrams. They use fuzzy c means clustering. The motivation for fuzzy clustering is that it allows each datum (persistence diagram) to have weighted (soft) membership in different clusters. The partial membership value is the ratio of the distance to that cluster center to sum of all memberships to other clusters. Empirical results on synthetic and real data shows that clustering of persistence diagrams outperforms others that depends on geometry. A convergence theorem is provided, based on previous fuzzy k-means convergence proof.\n\nThis paper is well written. The clustering of persistence diagrams is an important practical problem and the proposed algorithm does seem to work.\n\nHowever, overall the benefit of the new soft-membership clustering is not clear. The authors claim that (Lacombe et al. NeurIPS 2018) is hard clustering. But indeed (Lacombe et al. 18) relaxed the diagram to a continuous function. So it is unclear why it cannot have some of the benefits of the proposed method. Also the following paper needs to be discussed.\n\nPersistence Bag-of-Words for Topological Data Analysis - IJCAI'19\n\nEmpirically, some important tables should be included in the main paper. It is difficult to find the results in the supplemental material. The comparison to hard membership is hard to find. Also maybe Lacombe et al should be compared with? \n\nFurthermore, the real world data experiments is very specially chosen to show that when geometric transformation is involved, topology-based method is better than geometry-dependent baselines. But this is kind of obvious. And there are definitely better adaptations of these baselines to be more robust to these geometric transformations (e.g., using ICP algorithm to compute distance for WBC). I suggest the authors look for better dataset (ideally datasets used by supervised methods) and show that PH based clustering algorithm is useful in these datasets.\n\nI think the bottomline to me is that the key ideas are really not quite surprising. \n\n------------\n\nI have read the authors' response. I do not think the answers addressed my concerns.\n\nOn the positive side, I do think the paper is written well and the idea is clear. It is true that a soft-clustering of PDs on the true Wasserstein distance has not been done. The paper also provided proof of the convergence of the algorithm.\n\nMy main concerns are the following:\n\nFirst and most importantly, the method is not particularly surprising. It basically combines the most classic soft-clustering algorithm and the Frechet mean computation algorithm of Turner et al. Theoretically, the proof is extending the convergence result of the soft-clustering algorithm to the Wasserstein distance of PDs. I would not say the proof is trivial. But it is not that surprising, as we already knew that the Frechet mean of PDs is computable. I would be much more excited if the theoretical result is about the optimality rather than just convergence.\n\nEmpirically, the paper did not provide comparison with (Latombe et al. 18). Just saying that they did not do it exactly in the PD space is not good enough. A lot of practically powerful methods (persistence image, various kernels, etc) are approximations/relaxations outside the PD space. These approximations/relaxations can bring computational advantage, and sometimes better learning efficiency. Therefore, we need to know how this method is compared with (Latombe et al. 18) in efficiency and clustering performance. (Latombe et al. 18) can naturally have both hard- and soft-clustering versions. A thorough comparison with the different versions can show how important it is to stick with the PD space rather than the relaxation. My guess is that in practice sticking with PD space is not that important, or maybe even worse due to bad local optima of the Frechet mean. But I would be very happy to be proven wrong.\n\nAnother issue is the limited experiments. The material data does seem to be a good fit. But the authors could use some of the classic topology-friendly data (shape, dynamic data, graph) from existing supervised methods. Any labeled binary/multiclass data can be used to evaluate clustering. An even more ambitious goal is to prove the usefulness of clustering in the supervised task. For example, the authors can show that a bag-of-words approach (using the clustering result) can improve classification performance.\n\nOverall, I feel that the methodology is not very exciting to me, and the experiments are insufficient. If the main argument is the algorithm computes on the PD space and the proof of convergence, this paper may better fit a theoretical conference.\n\n\n",

            "review": "This paper aims to apply Fuzzy c-Means (FCM) clustering to persistence diagrams and prove convergent subsequence of iterates tends to a local minimum or saddle point. The motivation of the work is direct and clear. This paper addresses the problem of persistence diagram clustering via using  weighted Frechet mean . \n\nThis is a incremental work though replacing Euclidean distance in FCM by Wasserstein distance. The contributions in this work are not quite promising. For instance, the weighted Frechet mean in Sec3.2 is the well-known Wasserstein Barycenter whose behavior is well studied in optimal transport works. Thus Theorem2 can be not be considered as the contribution of this work. \n\nAnother drawback is that experiment in this work is very weak. There are only three dataset tested in this work. It's not quite convincing. It would be promising if the proposed work valid in other shape datasets such as SHREC2010 or SHREC2014. These datasets were frequently used for testing algorithms of topological data analysis .\n\nI cannot recognize the merits of this work compared with previous papers, such as: Large Scale computation of Means and Clusters for Persistence Diagrams using Optimal Transport.\n\n",

            "review": "# Synopsis of the paper\n\nThis paper develops a novel algorithm for performing fuzzy clustering\n(i.e. non-hard assignment of points to cluster centres) on persistence\ndiagrams, i.e. topological data descriptors. This is a highly relevant\ncontribution because persistence diagrams 'live' in a space that makes\nmetric analyses somewhat cumbersome. By contrast, the proposed method,\neven though this is not strictly highlighted in the paper, can be used\nas a principled way to obtain 'representatives' of a data set.\n\nThe critical algorithmic insight of the paper lies in developing a new\nway to calculate Fr√©chet means; this makes it possible to adapt FCM to\nthis domain.\n\nA set of experiments demonstrates the utility of the proposed approach.\n\n# Summary of the review\n\nThis is a well-written paper with a highly relevant contribution for\nthe TDA community. I am excited to see such a clustering algorithm\nfinally emerge for persistence diagrams, and I envision that this paper\nwill be a very useful contribution to the field.\n\nThat being said, there are some issues in the current write-up that\nprevent me from fully endorsing this work for now, namely:\n\n1. Presentation: the paper will be somewhat confusing for non-experts in\n   TDA. While this is to be expected to some extent, there are several\n   places in which the paper could be improved to provide some more\n   intuition, making it possible that even non-experts can appreciate\n   the contribution.\n\n2. The experiments appear to be somewhat preliminary. The experiment\n   with synthetic data, for example, only comprises few samples that\n   are clustered; a large portion of this section is spent on discussing\n   an application in materials science instead (which is of course\n   important, but I feel that it is hard to both appreciate the\n   application domain and the algorithm at the same time). In addition,\n   some details about the empirical behaviour of the method are not\n   discussed.\n\nIf these two points were to be rectified in a revision of the paper,\nit would help the contribution to shine more. Please see below for more\ndetailed comments.\n\n# Detailed comments\n\n- In terms of exposition, I would suggest to cite the Vietoris--Rips\n  complex construction (and also refer to the complex by this\n  alternative name; I think VR is much more common that just 'Rips')\n\n- Would it not be easier to show a Vietoris--Rips filtration instead of\n  the ƒåech one? I would suggest updating Figure 1 to account for this.\n  To provide a more intuitive view to TDA, the caption of the figure\n  could also be extended to describe the creation of cycles in the\n  point cloud, for example. This is the first figure that readers will\n  see, so any updates are well worth the effort, in my opinion. \n\n- Footnote 2 needs some clarification: is the paper suggesting to\n  compute the full VR complex (until the full simplex of $n$ vertices\n  has been reached)? If not, there *will* be multiple points at\n  infinity.\n\n- Would it not be possible to sidestep the issue of infinite points\n  entirely by using, say, extended persistence? It is my understanding\n  that the method does not 'care' about the way the persistence diagrams\n  are calculated, right? Hence, there are no structural assumptions\n  being made here.\n\n- The Fr√©chet mean is not necessary unique. Does this pose any problems\n  for the algorithm? I would assume that the calculated clustering might\n  also not be unique (or one of multiple equivalent solutions), but\n  I lack the intuition here. This should be briefly discussed.\n\n- Before equation 2, it should be 'Fr√©chet mean $\\widehat{\\mathbb{D}}$',\n  i.e. the variable indicating the mean should be used here. \n\n- How is the convergence behaviour of the algorithm? How many\n  iterations does it usually take until clusters start to stabilise? \n\n- The section on 'Computing the Fr√©chet mean' could be improved in terms\n  of the flow. Would it be possible to provide an overview algorithm as\n  well?\n\n- In terms of the limitations of the method, it is my understanding that\n  it heavily depends on the Wasserstein distance. Is this correct? I am\n  asking because this distance is known to be computationally\n  challenging to compute, so I was wondering while reading the paper\n  whether a similar algorithm could be derived for *kernels* between\n  persistence diagrams. While the experiments discuss runtime already in\n  the supplements, I am not convinced about the overall scalability of\n  the algorithm. (this is not a fault of the paper, I merely want the\n  limitations to be discussed in more details)\n\n- As already mentioned above, I would suggest updating the discussion of\n  the lattice structure data if possible. I feel that this is an\n  interesting topic, but I would rather see more experiments in the\n  paper and a shortened description of the background (it could be put\n  into the supplemental section).\n\n- As an additional suggestion for improving the experiments, I would\n  suggest running the synthetic test data experiments with more\n  diagrams. This *can* be an excellent introductory experiment to\n  showcase the capabilities of the algorithm, but at present, it falls\n  slightly short of that.\n\n- To me, the 'decision boundaries' section could be extended. This is\n  a really exciting application; the ability to find representatives \n  of diagrams opens up all kinds of new avenues! Is it possible to link\n  this more to previous results, i.e. Ramamurthy et al.?\n\n- As for the discussion on generalisation capabilities, I would suggest\n  citing prior work (Rieck et al., 'Neural Persistence: A Complexity\n  Measure for Deep Neural Networks Using Algebraic Topology'), which\n  mentions relationships between topology-based measures and\n  generalisation capabilities.\n\nAll in all, I am convinced that this has the potential to be a strong\naddition to the TDA community!\n\n# Style & clarity\n\nThe paper is well-written; there are a few sentences that I failed to\nparse correctly, though:\n\n- 'invariance to the basis symmetries': should this be 'basic\n  symmetries' instead? Moreover, why is there an ellipsis (...) after\n  'physics'? Should this be '[...]' to indicate that parts of the\n  quotation were left out?\n\n- As a matter of personal style preference, I would prefer to say 'The\n  algorithm by Turner et al.' rather than \"Turner et al.'s algorithm\".\n  The latter strikes me as somewhat confusing.\n\n- I would suggest to use no contractions in formal writing, hence\n  \"cannot\" instead of \"can't\" etc.; this is a minor point, but it since\n  the remainder of the paper is written so neatly, I cannot help but\n  point out ways to improve it even more.\n\n- 'so does not' --> 'so it does not'\n\n# Update after rebuttal & discussions\n\nI thank the authors for their thorough rebuttal. While the technical details are acknowledged and addressed for the most part, the experimental setup could still be improved. R1 mentioned that the work by Lacombe et al. might also be applicable as a comparison partner. Investing in a more thorough scenario would strengthen the paper by a lot.\n\n# Further update after discussions\n\nThe primary subject of our discussions concerned the experimental setup. While I still see this paper favourably, it would be strengthened by a more in-depth comparison with the work by Lacombe et al. The core of the paper would be more convincing if the utility of the fuzzy clustering could be highlighted better in a set of scenarios that are more comparable with existing TDA literature.",

            "review": "The authors propose a novel algorithm for the fuzzy clustering of persistence diagrams. To determine cluster centroids, the Wasserstein-2 distance is used to minimize the weighted Fr\\‚Äôechet mean between a potential cluster center and all PDs considered for clustering. The authors proof convergence of the clustering algorithm and conduct experiments on 1) synthetic data, 2) lattice structures, and 3) decision boundaries of neural networks. In the last experiment is was shown that models whose PDs cluster close to the PDs of a given task lead to higher classification performance than random classifiers, demonstrating the merit of PDs as a useful tool for model selection. \n\nThe paper is very well written and clearly presented. Even though I did not check all proofs in the appendix, it seems like a mathematically sound approach that leads to good clustering results. The contributions and the relevance of the topic are apparent; however, I think the experimental section is weaker than it could be. While I like the experiments on the synthetic data set and the decision boundaries, I think the weakest part of the paper are the experiments on the lattice structures. Respective paragraphs are packed with technical details which are not crucial to understand the problem at hand. The results are very qualitative and outsourced to the appendix. Furthermore, Figure 3 is interesting to look at and to get a better understand of the structural differences of the data; however, it would be nice to have visual representations of the results of 4.2. For example, would it be possible to choose $c=4$ and find the four different categories that you show in Figure 3 (by selecting 10-20 structures from each category and run your algorithm on them)? You could visualize a representative of each category (like in the current figure) and their respective PDs (just plotted on top of each other for each category). In a third panel, it would be interesting to see a representation of the centroids and all PDs using Multidimensional Scaling based on the W2 distance. I would also recommend using a more quantitative way of evaluating cluster quality (e.g. [1]).\nA second weakness I see in the experiments is that in the introduction, you mention previous work on fuzzy discrete distribution clustering (by de Carvalho et al.). Still, you do not compare your results to their method (does adding the diagonal make such a big difference?).  \n\nMinor comments and questions:\n\n‚Ä¢\tRelated work: When you mention the correlation of topological complexity with generalization ability, you miss the work by Rieck et al. [2].\n\n‚Ä¢\tI am a fan of citing software libraries when they provide how to in their website. Hence I would recommend citing Ripser [3] (see https://github.com/Ripser/ripser for BibTeX entry) and potentially other Software you used in the main paper.\n\n‚Ä¢\tYou say ‚Äú[‚Ä¶] the vectorization [‚Ä¶] required by Lacombe et al.‚Äôs algorithm makes it unsuitable for integration into our work‚Äù. Could you elaborate on this? Can you not even choose this as a comparison partner?\n\n‚Ä¢\tWhat do you mean when you say other persistence-based learning strategies required prior knowledge of a ‚Äòcorrect‚Äô target topology which can‚Äôt plausibly be known? The work by Moor et al. for example, extracts persistence directly from the input, which is ‚Äútrivial‚Äù to know since you can compute it. \n\n‚Ä¢\tTopological Preliminaries: Why do you introduce the \\v{C}ech complex when you use Vietoris-Rips for your experiments? \n\n‚Ä¢\tOne feat of your approach is that you add tuples on the diagonal to make the cardinality of all compared PDs match. I wonder how susceptible your approach is to increasingly different cardinality (that has to be filled). Maybe you can conduct a small ablation study on your synthetic data set and evaluate how ‚Äúgood‚Äù your mean PDs are when cardinalities are increasingly different.\n \n[1]: RJGB Campello, ER Hruschka.
