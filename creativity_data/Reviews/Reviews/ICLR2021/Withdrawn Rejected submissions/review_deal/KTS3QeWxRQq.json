        "comment": "This submission analyses the VAE objective from the perspective of non-linearly scaled isometric embeddings, with the aim of improving our information-theoretic understanding of the variational objective. \n\nReviewers are in consensus that this submission in its current form is very difficult to read, even after revisions by the authors. The metareviewer, who is highly familiar with information-theoretic and even information-geometric interpretations of VAEs, similarly struggled to understand this paper. Many concepts (e.g. KLT transforms) are not introduced in a self-contained manner, nor are related works like RaDOGAGA. Moreover the exposition introduces lots of notation (often somewhat implicitly) and requires more  high-level plain-English statements that signal the structure of the overall narrative to the reader. As a result, it is hard to understand the paper, even at the level of the contributions that are claimed by the authors. It appears that Section 3.4 should be read as culminating in a \"correction\" of the rate-distortion view of VAEs proposed by Alemi et al. Unfortunately the metareviewer is not able to understand from the writing what fault the authors find with the proposed interpretation, and how their view informs a better perspective.\n\nIt is difficult to provide the authors with concrete addressable suggestions at this stage of revision of their manuscript. The metareviewer's advice would be to attempt to focus on defining a narrative structure that clearly explains what insights this perspective of VAEs contributes, what misconception it corrects, and how it corrects it –– and then focus on streamlining notation in a manner that makes it possible to follow along with the exposition more easily.

            "review": "The paper builds on a branch of recent works that consider and analyse Variational autoencoders (VAE) from the view point of data compression. This started from Alemi et al. 2018, where the authors consider and analyse the mutual information between data and latent codes and culminates in Kato et al. 2020, where the authors consider models in which both the encoder and the decoder are assumed as deterministic (isometric) mappings. The submitted paper aims at reconciling this type of models with standard VAEs by claiming to prove that VAEs can be obtained from the former by an non-linear component-wise scaling of the latent space. The authors claim among others that this approach allows to estimate the data probability density from the learned VAE model.\n\nUnfortunately, the paper is not well written. This begins with sloppy wording and imprecise notations. Moreover the authors do not explain precisely enough the concepts used in the main building blocks of their proof and their final composition. Altogether, this makes it impossible (at least for me) to follow the steps of the construction and the related proof. In my opinion, the paper in its present state is not publishable at ICLR because it requires a major revision.\n\nI have tried to read the revised version submitted by the authors. Unfortunately, it is still very hard for me to fully grasp the proposed concept and to follow the derivation steps and the proofs. In my opinion, the paper is not publishable in its present state.",

            "review": "Based mainly on the rate-distortion theory, the authors propose to interpret VAE as a non-linearly scaled isometric embedding. That interpretation brings several advantages, for example, enabling the estimation of the data probabilities in the input space. \n\nOverall, the paper is well written. However, I find it challenging to fully understand the main contributions of the paper, even though I use VAE a lot.\n\nThe current manuscript might not be self-contained. It relies heavily on the prior work RaDOGAGA (Kato et al., 2020), with which I am not familiar. I would suggest the authors elaborate on that. \n\nThe main interpretation/discussions are proposed for the classical VAE with a (conditional) isometric Gaussian variational arm, whose model capacity may be limited in practice. So, is it possible that the proposed interpretation/discussions also generalize to other VAE variants (like one exploiting a flow on top of the variational arm)?\n\nIn Section 3.2, many approximations are employed; what’s the influence of those approximations? Discussions are necessary.\n\nIn Eq (8) as well as several other equations, implicit assumptions have been made, that is, the Jacobian determinant is always positive; however, those assumptions might not be true in practice. How to address related concerns in practice?\n",

            "review": "This paper analyses the theoretical properties of the VAE, showing that under some assumptions the VAE can be interpreted as an implicit isometric embedding of the data manifold. The authors show that with this analogy one can make inferences about the data distribution and the latent dimensions from the components of the VAE.\n\nIt seems to me on the whole that the theoretical analysis and contribution is correct and solid, and the work does give a valuable insight into the theoretical properties of the VAE as interpreted as a isometric embedding of the data space into the latent space. The empirical results given demonstrate that the quantitative measures the authors describe give a way to understand the importance of the latents and the properties of the learned approximate data distribution. These are things that I believe the community would find useful.\n\nMy main negative impression of this paper is that it is hard to read. The paper is written in a way which is hard to understand. It is information-dense, with a lack of intuitive explanation for many of the statements. For example, the introduction of the rate-distortion theory is not motivated at all. Clearly, the reason it has been introduced is to draw the parallel to lossy data compression via mapping to a low dimensional latent space. This parallel allows one to use knowledge from the compression literature to aid our understanding of these autoencoder-like models. However, this is not mentioned anywhere in the text, which makes it difficult for the reader to follow the narrative of the paper. Note that the rate-distortion is just one example. I will say that I am not very familiar with the literature on isometric embeddings, which has made it harder for me to understand.\n\nOne other negative point I would raise is that the paper is similar in nature to the RaDOGAGA work by Kato et al. Their method also establishes that a VAE-like architecture can isometrically embed the data into the latent space, which allows them to draw strong inferences about the data distribution, given the isometric properties. At a high level, this is very similar to the contribution of this paper. There are certainly differences, primarily in the theoretical analysis given to the VAE here, and the focus on examining the contributions of each latent dimension through the variances, in a PCA-like fashion. Still, I think perhaps the novelty is lacking.\n\nOverall, I think the paper should be rejected, but I do not feel strongly given that I am not an expert in the subject matter that much of the paper pertains to. If the differences between this work and RaDOGAGA were made, and the paper itself was made more clear then I would be willing to upgrade my score.\n",

            "review": "Summary: The paper proposes a methodology to understand quantitively the VAE model, based on the Rate-distortion theory.\n\nComments: I think that the writing of the paper is rather confusing. Unfortunately, I am not able to judge the proposed idea (which might be interesting) and provide a reasonable review, because I could not understand it after trying to read the paper couple of times. In general, I find the clarity and coherence of the paper lacking. In my opinion, the paper should be improved significantly along these lines, such that to be accessible from the reader. \n​\nSome examples of the problems I think that should be fixed:\n​\n- The text is super \"wordy\". There is too much compact information, but with low clarity. In general, I could not understand the main story of the paper.\n- Many terms are used without a definition e.g. what is the definition of isometric embedding? what is the definition of rate-distortion?\n- In general, the mathematical notation that is used is a bit unclear.\n- There are many places where the authors say: \"We (will) show later ...\". I believe that this causes a confusion. I think is better to avoid this tactic and directly show the result in place.\n- How the VAE model is perceived? In particular, I cannot understand what it means to \"map the VAE\"?\n- In my opinion the Figure 1 is hard to understand.\n- There is a lot of context and connections to related works, which the authors presume is already known from the reader. However, I think that this is not the case for a general reader.\n​\nOverall: Unfortunately, I am not able to provide a constructive feedback. The main idea of the paper might be interesting, but the writing style does not help. Therefore, I believe that the paper needs to be improved significantly, such that to be accessible.\n\n===== After rebuttal =====\n\nI appreciate the fact that the authors update their manuscript, taking into account some of our comments (+1 for this). However, I still feel that the content is quite hard to follow. In general, I believe that the motivation is still unclear and the clarity low. Even Fig. 1 (that potentially should help the understanding) is so complicated without any explanation in the caption. Maybe the technical content is interesting, but I think that the paper is not accessible.\n",
