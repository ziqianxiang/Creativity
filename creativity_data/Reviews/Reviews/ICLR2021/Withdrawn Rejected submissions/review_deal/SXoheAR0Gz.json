        "comment": "The major complaint about this paper was the lack of a proper comparison to previous work, both theoretically and empirically. Also, a study of the tradeoff between the accuracy and running time would significantly help this paper. Ultimately these were the main reasons for deciding to not accept the paper. The reviewers did think the algorithm was new and interesting, and so hopefully by addressing the complaints above, a future version of the paper could be more influential."

            "title": "Interesting paper, but out of scope",
            "review": "Overall this is an interesting paper. The paper proposes a few approximations in the computation of the DFT that enable to compute the DTFT of a signal at uniform grid of 2M+1 frequency points around a certain midpoint $\\mu$. While this is easy and straightforward using the direct computation or Goertzel's algorithm, these have complexity O(NM). While I did not check the math fully for correctness, the development appears correct. \n\nHaving said that, the paper completely discounts fair comparisons with the Goertzel algorithm. When M is small compared to N ($o(\\log N)$), complexity of O(NM) is not much of a problem, and Goertzel's algorithm has very favorable hidden constants and is exact. If M is $O(N)$ then the proposed approach has the same complexity with the FFT, which is also exact and has favorable constants. A discussion and an experimental study of the performance of the method compared to the Goertzel algorithm or the direct implementation would demonstrate the benefits of the algorithm.\n\nMy main objection to this paper is one of scope. I do not see how the paper fits in learning conference. It would be a much better fit in a signal processing conference/journal or in a theoretical computer science one. ",

            "title": "An algorithm for quickly approximating partial Fourier transforms",
            "review": "The paper suggests a method for quickly computing a \"partial Fourier transform\", which basically means that we want only a small range of output frequencies.  The main technique is an approximation of so called \"twiddle functions\" (which are basically trigonometric functions, or, exponents of complex units if viewed in the complex plane) using polynomials.   The resulting algorithms run in time O(N + M log M) where M is the size of the required frequency range, and N is the input.  This should be compared with Cooley and Tukey's FFT, which is O(N log N).  In fact, the main idea in the paper uses Cooley and Tukey's decomposition of the expression for Fourier transform.\n\nThe first thing I must note is, that the authors seem not to be aware of existing literature on partial Fourier transforms.  For example, Ailon and Liberty show in their paper [1] that whenever you are only interested in M Fourier frequencies then you can do exact FFT in time O(N log M).  This is done by pruning Cooley Tukey's FFT.  It is not as good as O(N + M log M), but it is EXACT, and it doesn't require the M frequencies to be in a single consecutive range.  (In fact, [1] does this for the Hadamard transform, but I am quite certain that it works for the DFT as well because the argument depends on the computational graph only, which is identical for both cases).  \n\nAdditionally, Indyk et al have written many papers on fast computation of Fourier when you know a priori that only M frequencies are nonzeros (and the rest are 0).  This setting is different from the one in this paper, but it is definitely relevant.\n\nFinally, I am inclined to say that the subject of this paper is only loosely related to the scope if ICLR.  I mean, computing Fourier coefficients is definitely a way to get a useful representation of the data, but I don't know if ICLR is the correct venue for this kind of paper.\n\nOtherwise, the paper is well written, and I assume it is correct.\n\n[1] Ailon, Liberty, \"Fast Dimension Reduction Using Rademacher Series on Dual BCH Codes. \" (Discrete and Computational Geometry, 2009)\n\n",

            "title": "Neat algorithm, but comparison to prior work highly incomplete",
            "review": "The paper presents a fast approximate algorithm for partial discrete Fourier transform. Given the input signal $a_0...a_N$ in the time domain the algorithm approximately computes the first $O(M)$ frequencies. The running time is $O(r (N + M \\log M))$, where $r$ a parameter that controls the accuracy of the output. The algorithm itself proceeds by applying polynomial approximation to the twiddle coefficients in FFT, which makes it possible to reduce the running time.\n\nPros:\n+ Well-motivated problem: in many applications, most of the signal energy is present in the first few coefficients  and this algorithm computes them faster (albeit approximately)\n+ To the best of my knowledge the algorithm is new, although cannot tell for sure given a large body of prior work on this topic (see below)\n+ Experimental evaluation shows one order of magnitude improvement in the running time, while keeping the relative error to $10^{-6}$.\n\nCons:\n- The papers omits a significant body of prior work on computing the first few DFT coefficients faster. For example:\n  * Pruned FFT: the algorithm evaluates the first M coefficients in O(N log M) time; here, the results are *exact*. See e.g., http://www.fftw.org/pruned.html\n  * Subband FFT: this method is approximate; see e.g., these papers:\nSubband DFT—part II: accuracy, complexity and applications, AN Hossen, U Heute, OV Shentov, SK Mitra - Signal Processing, 1995 - Elsevier\n Subband DFT—Part I: Definition, interpretation and extensions, OV Shentov, SK Mitra, U Heute, AN Hossen - Signal Processing, 1995 - Elsevier\n Subband DFT-interpretation, accuracy, and computational complexity, OV Shentov, AN Hossen, SK Mitra… - Conference Record of the …, 1991 - computer.org\n\n  There are also other methods cited in those articles. \n\n- I could not find any analysis of the trade-off between the accuracy and the values of parameters r and p. As a result, it is not clear what the runtime dependence on those parameters is. \n\nThe above two points make it impossible to compare the proposed algorithm relative to what was known before, either in theory or in practice. \n\nAdditional comments:\n- One can  assume (essentially) without loss of generality that the target frequencies lie in the interval centered at zero (i.e., that $\\mu$ is zero), as otherwise one can use Shift Theorem to shift the frequencies by multiplying each coefficient of the time signal by a phase term. This should simplify the presentation.\n\n\nOverall: the paper has interesting (and potentially very useful) ideas. However, it needs a very substantial rewrite, as per the comments above. \n",
