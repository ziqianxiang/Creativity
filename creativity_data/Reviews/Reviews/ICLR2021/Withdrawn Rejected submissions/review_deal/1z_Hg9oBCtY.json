        "comment": "This paper tackles an important problem of generating a synthetic data for stock market agents behavior. In particular, GAN is trained to distinguish stock market time series from synthetic ones. Then market agent parameters can be scored by running time series generated using these parameters through a GAN. This way one can optimize the parameters to find realistic ones.\n\nThe reviewers appreciate authors response, however, they found that their concerns has not been fully addressed:\n\n1. Clarity. The reviewers believe that the presentation need to be significantly improved and clarified before the paper is ready for acceptance (see reviewers comments for details).\n2. The metrics used to evaluate the performance are not sufficient. While \"stylized facts\" statistics can be a good sanity check it does not mean that the agents that have been produced are useful in any way. Presumably, the goal of calibration such agents is to use them in simulation to generate synthetic trading for the purpose of building a predictive model. If so then it seems that the best way to judge the success of the calibration by the success of downstream task.\n\nGiven this, the paper can not be accepted for the presentation in its current form."

            "review": "This paper proposes using a GAN to learn a discriminator and then use the discriminator to tune a non-differentiable simulator. The authors use this idea in the context of stock market simulation.\n\nPros:\nThe idea of using the discriminator of a GAN to tune parameters of a simulator is interesting.\n\nCons:\nThe experiments appear weak to me because of the following reasons:\n-- The goal stated upfront is \"we need to calibrate parametrized multiagent limit order book market simulator to be as close as possible to real market data\". Why is realism measured only as mid-price return every minute? The price changes every second. Shouldn't there be richer statistics - for example as in [Li. et al. 2020]? Moreover, the only aspect that is calibrated is the number of type of agents N,M. There are so many parameters in the simulator that can be configured (trader arrival rate, params in the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process). Why not calibrate these?\n-- The simulator used appears to be rich, but clearly still an approximation of real behavior in the market. The simulator uses well-known trader models but these are after all approximations of behavior. Plus there are other well-known models other than the 3 types such as heuristic belief learning model of traders [Steven Gjerstad. The competitive market paradox, 2007]. This makes me more uncomfortable with just calibrating N,M - this is possibly a forced fitting that matches mid-prices relying on assumptions that may not hold in real stock markets.\n--- Are there quantitative numbers for comparing 5(c) and 2(a)?\n\nPresentation cons:\nPlot the distributions to compare in one graph, not possible to visually compare across two graphs. I cannot compare 5(c) and 2(a) - 5(c) is also just too small to read. The images are also spilling over the column width. SimGAN is a name already used by another well-known paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.07828v1.pdf), please consider another name.\n\n--------------Post response-------------------\nStock market is complex and the evaluation with few statistics is unrealistic and too simple. At least the evaluation should be more fine grained than prior work. The goal of interpretability is nice, but not sure the paper gets there by only tuning few parameters.\nOverall, I like the idea but needs better execution of those ideas.",

            "review": "- The authors have presented a new technique to create multi-agent market simulation using GANs. It is a good step forward in applying GANs as a tool for simulation engineering. As there is already quite a bit of research done in the same domain, so distilling the paper shows that there are two novelties\n    1 - A two step method is used with the help of GANs to train a time series generator and discriminator.\n    2 - Sefl attention is used in the design of generator and discriminator. \n    3 -  A relatively new trend of using GANs for parameter optimization is followed.\n- There are some problems with the presentation of the article. Section 1.1 and 1.2 contain too much information that is not directly related to the contribution.  Sometimes it seems that a sentence is added in section 1.2 to cite an article. For example \"From a game-theoretic perspective, a simulated environment is more realistic when it reaches a Nash equilibrium, where every player’s parameters are configured so that each can do no better by unilaterally changing its strategy. Agents that learn to maximize their long term rewards by reinforcement from empirical equilibrium environments have been discussed in Schvartzman & Wellman (2009).\" Nash's equilibrium has profound impact on the market research, but here in this article it seems spurious to mention it, as that is not the focus of the research. Similarly, few other sentences can be omitted from section 1.1 and 1.2 to improve focus and clarity.\n- The statement does not seem to be right, \"Because SIM-GAN only uses historical, and not simulated data for training, once the discriminator is trained – it can be used to calibrate any time series model (not necessarily multi-agent) that represents a given historical dataset\". If this is true, then where does the fake time series data come from? If this is wrong, then the claim that discriminator is unbiased is also wrong. Also it is safe to say that the generator and discriminator are biased towards the specific portion of the historical data selected for training. For example, it would have been interesting to see how the simulator would predict a shock like COVID-19 on the market. That would be a good test of its (un)bias. Apparently, the end of section 3.1 is pointing towards the same fact. \n-  Mistake in the sentence \"We then perform grid-based optimization with respect to the discriminator-defined objective to find\nmost realistic simulation parameters out of the . \"\n",

If the novel contents are written in another section, then it should be rearranged so that the readers would easily catch them.\n- Cons: Hard to find out due to unclearly written paper. I see no comparison to conventional works.\n- Layout: I see many inappropriate layouts. I recommend the authors to fix it.\n  - I recommend that every figure has a title even if there are subtitles (Fig. 1 and 4)\n  - Fig. 1(a) and Fig. 1(b) are independent contents. I recommend that the subfigures be separated. (I guess that that's why the authors didn't write the title of Fig. 1). Also, the two figures in Fig. 1(b) can be shown as two subfigure.\n  - Please modify the figure layout properly (size, location, width, etc).\n  - I see the bad layout in Figure 3.\n  - The contents of Figure 4(c) would better be shown in Table not figure.\n  - When I print the paper, some part of Figure 5 (c) is not printed since it is outside of the page. The size of the figure should be adjusted.\n- Typo: I also see some grammar errors. Any grammar checking program would find those errors. I recommend the authors check the grammar of the whole text again.\n  - In the first paragraph of Sec. 1.3, please add space in front of \"Both\".\n  - What is the blank in the last paragraph of Sec. 2?
