Cellular Automata was studied many years ago. Nerual Celluar Automata is an interesting name. But what problem it will solve? What is the contribution of the paper? I do not find the description.\n2.  The paper writting is not good enough. It describes the model and the structure of the network, but it does not tell why the model is designed as Figure 2. \n3.  Why the DNA-encoder is needed? Why do we need to transform the coding from continuous space to a discrete space? \n4.  And Encoder-Decoder can get better results for Figure 5.\n\nI think the paper is not solid enough. ",

            "review": "This paper proposes a neural network architecture of the Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) that is able to encode the manifold of NCA. The goal is to effectively learn a representation space of CA. Each representation is used to generate a distinct image. To this end, dynamic convolutions inside an Auto-Encoder architecture is introduced. The process simulates the mapping of genes into specific proteins that drive cellular differentiation.  The authors perform empirical studies in a dataset of synthetic emojis and also in real images of CIFAR-10 to evaluate the approach. \n\nStrength.\n+ Demonstrate the successful reconstruction for  synthetic emojis and real images \n+ The paper is well written and easy to follow. \n+ It’s interesting to see the application of neural networks in the biological area. \n\nWeakness.\n- Although the authors claim the approach simulates the generating process of the image, no experiment results show the whole generating process.  Qualitative examples should be provided.\n- The usage of the approach is doubted. Some other approaches can also show the generating process, for example, the progress training strategy in styleGAN could show the generated results of different resolutions. \n- In the conclusion, the authors claim the approach can predict the future process, such as disease spreading. However, they only show the ability to reconstruct simple and low-resolution images based on a code, which can easily be done with AE or VAE.\n\n\nOverall, the NCAM seems to be able to simulate the generating process of an image. However, the simulation also could be done by other approaches, like styleGAN.  The reconstruction of an image can also be easily done by AE. And the authors didn’t show any other potential usage of the approach. \n\nQuestions:\n In section 2.1,  instead of just using the spatial mean of the convolutional output tensor to feed FC layers, we use 3 additional slices.  What is the motivation?  Is this trick general and can it be used for other tasks?\n",

            "review": "This paper presents an interesting extension to a neural cellular automata, in which the output of the self-organizational process can be conditioned on a particular target image. Thus the same neural network is able to learn a pattern manifold and generate \"grow\" a variety of different images.\n\nThe main novel innovation of the paper is a decoder/encoder component that is conditioned on a target image and then generates part of the weights for the neural cellular automata network. Novelty of the approach is thus slightly limited and mainly consists of combining two existing techniques (auto-encoders and NCA), albeit in an interesting way. \n\nThe \"genetic engineering\" experiments are also very interesting but should be further extended. For example, is it possible to somehow correlate the latent codes with different learned image features? Additionally, DNA in nature shows remarkable compression abilities (i.e. generating a complex phenotype from a small number of genes). Can the level of compression in the proposed somehow be measured?\n\nMinor issues:\n- Neural cellular automata were in fact not introduced by Mordvintsev et al. See \"A Taxonomy for Artificial Embryogeny\" by Stanley et al. for a review of the area.\n- Details on the exact training procedure should be given (learning rates, optimizer, ...)",
