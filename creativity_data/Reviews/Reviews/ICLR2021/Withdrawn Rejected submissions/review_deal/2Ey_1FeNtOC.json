        "comment": "Rather than using backprop to train RNNs, this paper explores instead using GA's to train them along with an extra Minimal Description Length objective to search in the space of the simplest possible networks that can perform the task at hand. They demonstrate that the method can indeed find minimal RNNs that, when trained even on small corpus dataset of formal languages can generalize beyond the training data.\n\nMost reviewers and myself agree that this work is really interesting, and also refreshing to see a new approach compared to the typical way of doing things. However, as we can see in the reviews, the work is not at the level of an ICLR conference submission at this point. R1, R3, and R4's reviews breaks down the points of the papers into strengths and weaknesses, and I am inclined to believe that if the authors spend more time to try to address the weakness and improve the work, this can be a great paper in the future. Although R3 gave a score of clear reject (which is too low IMO), and the authors responded to their points, I'm inclined to believe that this work warrants another revision.\n\nSpecifically, reviewers (and myself) believe that the baseline methods can indeed perform better than reported. And while, for a novel method, we don't expect the approach to scale to SOTA approaches for sequence modeling, it would improve the work vastly if there is evidence to show that it can scale to larger tasks, and give an impression that there can be a roadmap of attacking larger problems that standard methods can currently handle.\n\nCurrently, I would say the work is a great workshop paper, but would encourage the authors to continue to consider the feedback given here to work on a future revision."

They decide to use GA in order to find such a representation. \n\nMy main reservation is that the paper is a vanilla application of GA without any enhancements or tailored aspects. In other words, I can't find methodological or algorithmic contributions. The experimental results also don't stand out. The tasks selected are all artificial (learning mathematical operations). To this end it would be great to include some practical cases. ",

            "review": "This paper describes a method for training neural network based on\ngenetic algorithms that minimizes the minimum description length\n(MDL). The aim of the study is to obtain smaller, explainable networks\nthat learn generalizations from sequences. The paper shows that the\nprocedure, indeed, learns compact and interpretable networks\nrecognizing a number of (artificial) formal languages, as well as\naddition. The networks are also compared to common RNN models\ntuned/trained on the same task, indicating that the networks\ndiscovered by MDL outperforms RNNs in majority of the experiments.\n\n\nAlthough study uses well-known methods (MDL, genetic algorithms), the\napplication and premise is interesting. Without doubt, both smaller\nand explainable models are good, and the paper demonstrates this\nnicely with the included experiments. It is not specific to the\nparticular study, but strengths of the method also include learning\nstructure of the network as well as its weights and possibility of\nlearning a larger class of network architectures.\n\nMy main criticism likes within two aspects of the paper/study:\n\n- Although the authors touch upon this in the concluding remarks, I'd\n  be interested to see a more through proof or demonstration of\n  scalability of the method. All the experiments provided can be\n  solved by relatively simple networks. With increasing problem\n  complexity, the networks size (as a result its encoding) and the\n  number of alternative networks to test before finding a solution is\n  expected to increase as well. In short: the usability of the method\n  would be more convincing if one of the problems had a larger\n  alphabet, and less well-defined solutions (e.g., a linguistic\n  problem as elaborated by the authors).\n\n- I was very surprised to find the description of the proposed\n  method/model in an appendix. Although the method is relatively\n  straightforward for most ICLR audience, I thin the paper needs a\n  reasonably detailed description of the method in the main text. If\n  the space is the issue here, one can shorten the descriptions of the\n  artificial language experiments, or even push part of them to an\n  appendix.\n\nI also have some minor remarks/suggestions:\n\n- From the description in the paper, I am not sure if the baseline\n  RNNs got the same care and love as the proposed system. If not tuned\n  properly, it would not be surprising that they do not necessarily\n  perform well. For example, for these simple problems there is a fair\n  chance that at 1000 epochs some of the networks badly overfit. Hence\n  while comparing the method with RNNs the study may be basing the\n  conclusions on weak baselines.\n\n- Similar to some of the points noted above, I'd be also interested to\n  see more discussion/comparison with (L1) regularized learning.\n\n- Some readers may benefit from a better description of the network\n  representation in the figures. For example, it is not clear to me\n  what an output unit with no input produces (assuming that there is\n  an intercept/bias term, but an explicit remark would be useful).\n\n- A few typographic/language suggestions/issues:\n\n    - Footnote marks should go after punctuation (e.g., footnote mark\n      2).\n    - The fonts on figures are sometimes unreadably small, and\n      resolution is not optimal (especially fig. 6 in the appendix,\n      but others may also benefit from high-resolution or vector\n      graphics).\n    - Aligning numbers in table 1 properly would increase their\n      readability.\n    - The color choice on figures (although it did not seem\n      significant) was not kind to this color blind reader.\n",

            "review": "\nThe authors proposed a new training framework for recurrent neural networks that involves updating the weights with genetic algorithm under a minimum description length principle. They evaluated it on a syntheic mini task of languange modeling and showed a better performance over classical RNNs trained by backpropagation.\n\n\nStrength\n\n+ it is a good thing to read about alternative approach to backpropagation in training deep networks.\n+ tackling the interpretablity issue of deep networks with symbolic knowledge is a great approach. \n+ the problem of generalization in recurrent networks is an important topic to study.\n+ As in the discussion section, this line of research has great potential in future extensions if implemented and understood well.\n\nWeakness\n\n- the previous work offers an intriguing task on the historical attempts in applying genetic algorithms and MDL principles in neural networks. However, it would be better if what works are done in these related work. For instance, the authors wrote \"These challenges were already taken up by early work on XXX\", but failed to say how they tackled these challenges. \n- the technical sections are very hard to follow. It is hard to decode in section 3 how the algorithm work. Although mentioned some details on the genetic algorithm in the Appendix, the main text should be self-contained. \n- Following the previous point, how is the MDL metric computed exactly? Is it a bitwise estimation? If so, is the RNN here merely a boolean network?\n- Why is the task descriptions in section 3.5 placed in the \"Learner\" section? And why are some results also included here in the method section? The writing needs some improvement to increase clarity and structure.\n- Still this section, \"Again, this network is transparent, the task is learned perfectly well, and no RNNs would do as well.\" Would the author mind explaining where this is coming from?\n- The result section is also lack of important details on the tasks and evaluations. Unlike section 4.3 where the experiments are adequately introduced, the setup in section 4.1 is far too brief for the authors to grasp the task (especially if it is not usually used in the field). \n- table 4.4. the cross entropy of MDL model is quite close with the best RNN in all tasks except addition (where MDL model kills) and a^nb^nc^n (where MDL model sucks). This could indicates an coincidence -- did the authors run multiple runs with different random seeds? (the plots in the appendix suggests that they only ran once).\n\n\nSummary\n\nOverall, the project introduced an interesting approach with great potential, but the results and writing appear to be preliminary. We suggest the authors to add more evaluations and improve the writing.\n",

            "title": "Interesting direction, but the experimental setup needs to be corrected",
            "review": "This paper presents an approach to training recurrent neural networks with the mix objective of minimizing cross entropy (or something similar, which is not clearly defined) and minimizing minimum description length (MDL) by using a binary representation of the network which is optimized with a genetic algorithm. The model is evaluated in contrast to RNN, GRU and LSTM  baselines on modelling a number of formal languages.\n\n- (+) MDL is a powerful inductive bias which has been explored extensively in Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition, and it is interesting to see it revisited in the context of neural networks and in contrast to deep learning models.\n\n- (+) The paper exhibits numerous examples in which the presented system produces simple hypothesis to model (also relatively simple) data.\n\n- (-) Nonetheless, the studied tasks are good for a start, but insufficient to motivate the approach because actually neural networks can deal with them quite well [e.g., 1]. Moreover, the claims about the binary addition experiments are notably flawed. In particular, the task that is considered in this paper involves two bit sequences that are fed *bit by bit* in parallel to the system. This poses no serious challenge to no RNN, and in fact you can find example code directed at students that solves this task: https://github.com/mineshmathew/pyTorch_RNN_Examples. (I have personally tried this code on the same setup of using sequences of up to 20 bits and evaluating on a test set of up to 250 bits with 100% accuracy -- It only required updating a few lines to more modern versions of python/pytorch and changing the loss to BCE). The version of binary addition which is actually more challenging for RNNs is when the output is produced _after_ all operands are given [2]. Nonetheless, other neural network architectures deal with this task effectively [3].\n\n I can see two directions in which this work could be improved moving forward:\n\n   - If the goal is to improve interpretability of models, the authors could aim at tackling problems in gradient-based neural network remain obscure (e.g. see https://blackboxnlp.github.io/)\n   - If on the other hand the goal is improving generalization, the authors could consider tackling tasks in which neural networks have been shown to be deficient in their generalization skills [2].\n\n- (-) Furthermore, RNN baselines might not be properly trained across the paper. First, as mentioned in the previous point, RNNs can in fact learn the binary addition task, and thus it is unclear why the authors report that they fail. Second, the authors report that the RNNs perform worse than chance on some other tasks, which could be explained by divergent training. Since no code was provided it is not possible to assess how the models were trained.\n\n- (-) The authors enumerate some works related to theirs, but they do not comment in which ways they are similar or different from theirs.  Also, given that whole books have been written on the MDL principle, the related work section could be considerably more detailed. The relation to neural architecture search (NAS) is missing too.\n\n- (-) It is also unclear how the training objective is quantified. It is only mentioned that |G : D| relates to cross-entropy, but no precise definition is given, nor it is detailed in which ways it differs from the former.\n\n**Questions for the authors**\n\n1) Do the addition RNN models reach 100% accuracy on the training data?\n\n2) The cross-entropy numbers are quite high for binary classification problems. Could you report how you computed them?\n\n3) For the test data you mention that you test the model on \"an unseen sequence of length X\". By \"an unseen\" you mean 1 sequence?\n\n4) Regarding footnote 7, why not properly quantifying the number of operations needed to train each type of model?\n\n**References**\n\n[1] Weiss, Gail, Yoav Goldberg, and Eran Yahav. \"On the practical computational power of finite precision RNNs for language recognition.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1805.04908 (2018).\n\n[2] Joulin, Armand, and Tomas Mikolov. \"Inferring algorithmic patterns with stack-augmented recurrent nets.\" Advances in neural information processing systems. 2015.\n\n[3] Kaiser, Łukasz, and Ilya Sutskever. \"Neural gpus learn algorithms.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1511.08228 (2015).\n\n[4] Lake, Brenden, and Marco Baroni. \"Generalization without systematicity: On the compositional skills of sequence-to-sequence recurrent networks.\" International Conference on Machine Learning.
