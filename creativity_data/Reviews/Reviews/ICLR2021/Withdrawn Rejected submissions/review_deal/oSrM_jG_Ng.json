        "comment": "The paper introduces a procedure that uses low attention areas to de-noise temporal prediction. The paper appears to focus on 'temporal noise' as opposed to constant noise present in the video (it may handle shifting shadows, but not background noise). \n\nThe idea is certainly interesting, however, the experimental protocol suffers from the issues pointed out by reviewer 3:\n- maintaining the same protocol as prior methods to ensure a direct comparison of the results against reported scores by the sota\n- in the context of attention, alignment (or lack or it) is extremely important; assuming perfect alignment is not very realistic\n(if the alignment is perfect, one might try a simple method such as taking all readings at a point over time and considering the mode, then correcting any outliers in the off-attention areas)\n\nThese specific issues were not fully addressed during the review period.\n\nThe questions raised by reviewer 2 were addressed to a satisfactory degree in the rebuttal."

            "review": "This paper presents a new method for the camera based physiological measurement task. The key idea of this work is to use attention mechanism to learn discriminative features from regions of interest, and use the inverse attention mask to select contextual information to learn noise representation for refinement. Experiments on three datasets show state-of-the-art performance.\n\nI have several main concerns.\n\n1. The main idea of using the reverse attention mask to learn noise information is not significant. In fact, using reverse attention to focus on other regions has been studied in other areas (e.g., for saliency detection). The paper applies the idea to a specific task, i.e., the camera based physiological measurement task.\n\n2. The motivation is not well justified. It is not explained the advantages of using reverse attention mask to learn noise representation. Taking Figure 1 for example, it seems that the attention mask focuses on some key facial regions. While these regions of interest also contain noisy informaiton (e.g., motion and lighting change), the reverse attended regions (the textured background) may not necessarily contain. Why not directly learn an attention map for noise estimatation, or why not directly use the original attention map to learn noise representation?\n\n3. The discussion of how existing methods deal with large motion and noise is not given in the related work section. It is then hard to evaluate the significance of proposed method.\n\n4. The computation of noise (Eq.1) is a multiplication of the reverse attention mask and the original input. However, I do not understand how this operation can be interpreted as noise estimation, as it seems to be a region selection process. Given that, the denoising model seems to be a refinemet model that considers reverse attended regions and the output of the first model. It is hard for me to understand the second model as a denoising model. \n\nMinor issues.\n\n1. The description of Fig.1 can be improved with more details.\n\n2. It is better to provide more details of how errors are corrected in the MMSE-HR dataset (Last sentence of the first paragraph in page 6).\n\n3. Section 5 talks about the training details. It would be better to directly use \"Training Details\" instead of \"Experiments\".\n\n4. In the first paragraph of section 6, four variants are given. However, it is not easy to understand the last two, i.e., how the noise subtraction is performed in frequency or time domain. \n\n5. Tables 3 -> Table 3 (page 8).\n\n6. The abstract mentions two datasets but there are actually three datasets in the experiments. \n",

            "title": "This paper studied the video based remote physiological signal measurement problem, and proposed a method to modeling the noises w.r.t. the physiological signal using inverse attention mask. The method is evaluated on three dataset, and compared to a few baselines.",
            "review": "1. It is interesting to model the noises mixed with the very weak physiological signal; however, the assumption used in this paper, i.e., most regions outside of the attention masks do not contain the signals of interest and consequently contain noise does not really hold, because, besides the weak physiological signal, the dominant signal inside the face video is the face content, i.e., the texture of the face describing the appearance of a person; these background signal dominant the video but cannot be treated as noises.\n\n2. The novelty of the proposed method is quite limited. The general idea is to use an inverse mask, i.e., {1- attention mask}, to determine the regions less correlated with physiological signal, within which the average intensity is computed and treated as noise. However, as we know that for Gaussian-like noises, averaging the local pixel is to remove the noise instead of obtaining the noise. Therefore, the claimed method to compute noise is not well motivated and explained.\n\n3. The experiments are performed on three datasets; however, the authors seem to not follow the widely used protocols but defined a new protocol instead. As a result, even though there a number of SOTA methods in this topic as listed in the references, they were not used to compare with the proposed approach. So it is not clear how the proposed approach can advance the methodology. In addition, while several large physiological signal datasets are available, e.g., with 100-500 subjects, the authors did not use these datasets for evaluations.\n\n4. It is not clear how the authors can measure an output wavelet match the ground-truth BVP signal? particularly when there is misalignment between the video and the finger pulse oximeter wave.\n",
