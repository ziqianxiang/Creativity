        "comment": "This paper studies extensions of the Scattering Graph Transform to spatio-temporal domains. By exploring several design choices for spatio-temporal wavelet filters, the authors provide a solid and broad study of such predefined represenatations, including stability analysis as well as extensive empirical evaluations. \nReviewers were generally favorable, and highlighted the importance of this method as providing a simple yet powerful baseline for spatio-temporal graph prediction tasks that requires no training. Despite some concerns about lack of analysis of the empirical results, the AC believes this work will provide a valuable baseline for future research and therefore recommends acceptance as a poster.

            "review": "1/ Summary of the paper\n\nThis paper proposes a novel spatio-temporal graph scattering transform (ST-GST) as an intermediate representation of time-varying signals on graphs, which can then be fed into a simple ML model. Building on previously introduced Graph Scattering Transform (GST), the authors investigate the technical question of how to use both the spatial and temporal dimensions, proposing either a joint construction (GST applied on product graph) or a separate one (keeping both dimensions separate conceptually, while mixing). Theoretical results valid in both cases guarantee stability to noise in the input signal or the spatial graph.\nNumerical experiments show that the proposed method outperforms graph convolutional networks in the small data regime, and get a performance close to the state-of-the-art in the large data regime.\n\n2/ Acceptance decision\n\nAccept. This is a very good paper with novel contributions on the algorithmic side, theoretical guarantees and convincing numerical experiments.\n\n3/ Supporting arguments\n\n- In terms of novelty, this paper is the first to tackle the investigate the construction of a fixed representation of spatio-temporal graphs based on priors, using the graph scattering transform approach.\n- In terms of technical contributions, the paper delves into the interesting technical question of how to build such a transform, a proposes convincing arguments to support its final approach, the separable ST-GST. Further, the authors provide theoretical guarantees of the stability of the ST-GST representation with respect to input and spatial graph variations, based on assumptions on the pre-defined filters used in the transform.\n- Experimental results show that in the very low data regime (MSR Action3D dataset with only 288 training samples), the proposed approach improves upon the graph convolutional networks SOTA by ~5% of accuracy (87 vs 82.2). In the large data regime, the proposed method reaches a performance close to SOTA (73.1 vs 75.8% accuracy). The authors also show that the gap between GCN and ST-GST widens as the number of samples decreases.\n- This paper is well motivated and well written. Although it is quite dense and with involved mathematical operations, it is quite easy to follow.\n\n4/ Additional comments\n\n- The authors do a very nice job of putting the joint and separable graph filters under similar notations (Eq. 1 and 2). When it comes to comparing both approaches at the end of Sec 3.2, I am not sure to understand correctly the statement that the separable approach is more « flexible » than the joint one. While I understand that separability brings an easier interpretability of filter responses in the spatial and temporal domain, it seems also that in terms of polynomials with atoms of the form $\\lambda_s^p \\otimes \\Lambda_t^q$ for various $p$, $q$, the family spanned by separable transforms might be smaller than e.g. the strong product (although I’m not sure). Do you have any more insights in this direction?\n- In the numerical results of Table 1, the separable approach gets the better results with much more scales in the temporal dim (20) than in the spatial one (5). In the joint approaches, a single number of scales (15) is used, and it spans both dimensions. Beyond the computational requirements of the joint approach, do you think this forced equality is an issue for the joint approach?\n- In order to compare the significance of results in the low-data regime, standard deviations would have been appreciated, especially to understand the differences between the different joint approaches.\n- Minor details: which graph shift is used in the experiments reported in the last page of the main paper? In Section 3.2, the authors state $S = A$ (for both spatial, temporal and joint cases), but appendix A defines $S$ as a lazy random walk for geometric graph wavelets and Appendix C states that geometric graph wavelets are used in the main paper. Similarly, which non linear activation is used eventually?",
