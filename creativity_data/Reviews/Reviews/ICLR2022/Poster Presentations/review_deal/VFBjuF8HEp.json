            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper aims at reducing the number of discretization steps for the generation process of diffusion-based generative models. To do that, the paper proposes a new probabilistic generative model, which exploits pre-trained denoising diffusion probabilistic models. In particular, similarly to Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM, Song et al. (2020)), the paper proposes a non-markovian hierarchical generative model, whose densities are defined as;\n- $p(x_0, ..., x_T) = \\prod_{t =0}^{T} p(x_{t} | x_{>t})$, where $p(x_T)$ is a prior distribution such as a standard Normal distribution.\n- $p(x_{t} | x_{>t}) = q_{\\mu, \\sigma}(x_{t} |x_{>t}, x_0 = \\hat{x}(x_{t}, t) )$\n- $q_{\\mu, \\sigma}(x_{t} |x_{>t}, x_0) = N(x_t | \\Sigma_{u = t+1}^{T} \\mu_{t, u} x_u, \\sigma_t^2 I_d)$\n- $\\hat{x}(x_t, t)$ is a reconstruction network similar to the one in the DDIM.\n- Note that the proposed method employs $q_{\\mu, \\sigma}(x_{t} |x_{>t}, x_0))$, while DDIM uses conditionally Markov $q_{\\mu, \\sigma}(x_{t} |x_{s}, x_0)$ for any $t < s$.\n\nNoting that the discrete-time diffusion-based generative models are fully differentiable, the paper proposes to train the models while the pre-trained reconstruction network is fixed; here, the authors name this training as Differentiable Diffusion Sampler Search (DDSS). To train the models, the paper first emphasizes that maximizing the ELBO of the proposed method deteriorates the performance wrt FID. Then the authors instead propose to minimize perception scores between models' sample and training data. Here, the perception score is a squared distance between empirical means of two sets of samples on the feature space of a pre-trained classifier.\n\nMoreover, observing that training the entire discrete-time diffusion-based generative models requires huge memory costs, the paper proposes to use gradient rematerialization (Kumar et al., 2019b) methods.\n\nIn the experiments, the paper tests the effectiveness of the proposed method in image generation quality benchmarks, such as CIFAR-10. Specifically, the analysis of the experiments focuses on two perspectives. First, the authors compare the generation qualities of the proposed method and the baseline methods, including denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM), in the few-step regime. Second, the paper compares the generation qualities of the DDIM and the proposed model when both are trained via DDSS. The paper claims that the proposed generative models trained via DDSM outperform the previous methods in the few-step regime.\n\n===== POST-REBUTTAL COMMENTS ========  \nIn the updated version, Theorem 1 shows that under certain choices of model parameterizations, the proposed models' ELBOs will be the same as the DDPMs'. This clarifies that it is valid to plug-in pre-trained DDPM models (or other similar types), potentially without fine-tuning; therefore, it seems valid to treat the proposed method as improving sampling process. ",
            "main_review": "**The strengths of the paper**  \nIn general, I found that the paper provides interesting values to the ML community:\n\n1. It tackles an important problem in diffusion-based generative models, i.e., preserving the qualities of the generated samples with fewer discretization steps.\n2. The paper proposes a new method using non-Markovian hierarchical generative models with the pre-trained diffusion-based generative models.\n3. The paper discusses practical techniques to support the scalability of the proposed method.\n\n\n**The weaknesses of the paper**  \nWhile the novelty of the proposed method, I found that the following aspects can be improved.\n\nFirst of all, the motivation of the proposed model needs to be clarified, meaning the authors need to discuss the optimality of the non-Markovian but simple Gaussian hierarchical generative models and the proposed posteriors. I also consider this issue connects to the insufficient justification of minimizing the conceptual loss instead of maximizing the ELBO.\n    \n- For example, suppose the proposed model performs significantly worse when it is trained via maximizing ELBOs. In that case, it implies that the proposed posteriors are not well suited for the proposed generative models. This means the ELBO can not be tightened regardless of the number of discretization steps. Consequently, the pair of the proposed posterior and the generative model are inevitably suboptimal, similar to simple variational autoencoders. This raises the question of what family of densities the proposed model can model or not.  \n    \n- On the contrary, DDIM is designed under the premise that the DDIM models will follow the same marginal $p(x_t)$ of the DDPM models. This implies that DDPMs' expressivity and tightness of the ELBO indirectly justify DDIMs'. Thus, DDIMs' approach makes much more sense, as we can expect that DDIM will model arbitrary densities by maximizing their ELBOs (or weighted ones). Thus, the tuning weights for DDIMs and DDPMs are valid engineering trade-offs depending on the application scenarios.  \n    \n    - A side note: Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015 and DDPMs are inspired by the fact that the first-order discretization of continuous-time It\\^o diffusion is a Markov chain, each of whose transition probability follows a Normal distribution. Moreover, it has been proven that their reverse-time It\\^ diffusion process exists (under mild conditions), and thus their first-order discretization again is Gaussian Markov chains.  \n    \n- To resolve this, I consider that it is necessary to either provide (1) theoretical proofs that the proposed generative models are arbitrary expressive and the ELBO with the posteriors can be tightened, or (2) empirical analyses that the proposed method can achieve comparable performance when it is trained via maximizing ELBOs. Unless either of them cannot be demonstrated, the significance of the proposed method is doubtful.\n    \nSecond, the introduction of the proposed method can be improved. For instance, the authors briefly mention that the proposed method will use pre-trained reconstruction networks in the abstract and Sec 2. However, I found that clarifying how Equation 7 is used to define generative models will be helpful for readers.\n\nThirds, the descriptions of the proposed method in the context of the previous works seem confusing. For example, the usage of the term \"diffusion process\" sounds confusing. \"Diffusion process\" have commonly referred to as It\\^o diffusion process, which is a solution of specific types of stochastic differential equations; thus, continuous-time models. I found that it is a little problematic to use the \"diffusion process\" for the proposed method.",

Unfortunately, the proposed method is not well-motivated, and the discussion about it is insufficient. Thus, I opt to reject the paper. However, I'm also inclined to improve my evaluation if the aforementioned weak points are well addressed.\n\n===== POST-REBUTTAL COMMENTS ========  \nThe rebuttal had addressed some of my concerns.

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This work examines the problem of the large number of iterations necessary to get high quality samples from denoising diffusion generative models. \nThe paper mostly consists of two new components:\n\n1. A generalized family of probabilistic samplers called Generalized Gaussian Diffusion Processes (GGDP). This construction is similar to the denoising implicit processes found in [1], in the sense that it discards the Markov assumption, and $p(x_{t=i})$ may rely on all $p(x_{t < i})$. The difference is that the Gaussian marginals of the GGPD may not match those of the original process. \n\n2. An optimization procedure for finding the sampler variances. This procedure is general and may be applied to any family of samplers. The idea is to minimize the distance in feature space between a classifier's representation given the real data, and the final generated iterate in the process, optimizing over the parameters of the sampler family. A computationally amenable scheme is proposed to allow for backpropagating through the diffusion process making use of gradient rematerialization (recomputation of intermediate gradients). \n\nThe method is compared against DDPMs [2] and DDIM [1] in CIFAR10 and Imagenet 64x64. \n\n[1] Jiaming Song, Chenlin Meng, and Stefano Ermon.

            "main_review": "I find this paper to be very interesting and its results are quite good. I will address the main points of this paper as outlined above. \n\n1. It appears that the introduction of a more flexible family of samplers is introduced mainly to admit the optimization process for finding the variances of a more efficient sampler (DDSS). As optimizing for $v_1 \\dots v_k, \\sigma$ would be difficult if the corresponding marginals were constrained to be equal. Indeed this is shown in 5.1 where optimizing $\\sigma$ for DDIM does not perform well. This is to say that I am not sure there is any benefit or purpose to GGDP beyond admitting the use of DDSS. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it's worth pointing out that GGPD doesn't look to stand on its own as a better sampler without DDSS. If this is not the case I am happy to be wrong here. \n\n2. I'm not sure about the practicality of DDSS. Given that gradient rematerialization (only feasible in JAX as far as I know) is leveraged to compute the gradient of the objective, I can only assume that the computational cost of a naive implementation is quite high even for CIFAR10. That being said, this work is about efficient (in number of steps) samplers, not scalable ones. I found the results of GGDP+DDSS to be quite impressive. The samples shown in figure 2 are in my opinion strikingly better than the baseline approach. \n\nI found the evaluation to be reasonable if a bit light on the number of datasets. Regardless, the results are compelling, and given that the DDSS objective is quite simple, I am happy with the approach. \n\nAll things considered, I think this optimization approach is a natural direction when considering how to construct more efficient DDPMs, and the results support it. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n### Post Rebuttal Comments. \n\nI appreciate the updates to the submission made by the authors. In particular, the improved motivation of using a perceptual loss instead of maximizing an ELBO. I will retain my score, though I hope that the authors follow through on their claim that they will provide additional results in the camera ready submission. \n",

Although samples from the proposed method have good FID/IS scores, optimizing the model via the perceptual loss could be directly/indirectly overfitting the evaluation metrics.

As mentioned in the paper, GGDP can use pre-trained DDPM models. It would be more convincing to also show results on more challenging high-resolution datasets (e.g. LSUN, ImageNet, CelebA) using pre-trained models since the inference time for high-resolution datasets are often significantly longer, and improving the inference time would be a more crucial task for larger models. Currently, only small-scale datasets are considered.\n5. For theorem 1, there is only \"proof sketch\". Is there a formal proof?\n6.

It seems that the samples of the proposed method in figure 2 look reasonable when using 5 steps on CIFAR-10.

The samples, after optimizing perceptual loss, might not correspond to the samples of the underlying DDPM model. Optimizing via perceptual distance is expected to have better performance under FID/IS scores, but it would also change the statistical property of DDPM.

The paper discusses how to address the engineering challenges in general DDSS search problems (discontinuity of timesteps, memory constraints). Empirically, optimizing perceptual losses benefits sample quality and is better than evaluation likelihoods (especially when most methods need many steps to have marginally better likelihoods).\n\n**Weaknesses**\n\nThe clarity of the paper is a bit on the weaker side, and I think the paper can be significantly improved by having better clarity.\n- It was quite unclear at first glance what the double subscripts mean in Equation (2) and beyond. It should be made explicit that subscript $ts$ means starting from $t$ and ending at $s$. These double subscripts also make it difficult to identify the main idea behind GGDP. Perhaps having a figure illustrating the GGDP idea helps with clarity.\n- It is unclear whether, with the changed GGDP variational distribution, it is still possible to recover the same \"diffusion / score-matching\" solution with a new variational objective (not defined in the paper). I am inclined to believe this is the case, but I think a proof (like the one in DDIM paper) would be warranted.\n- Equation (9) should be written explicitly as the batch version, since the actual algorithm is not an unbiased estimator of (9). Also is there a reason behind only matching the first-order moment, rather than higher-order moments? Is there a possibility that the DDSS sampler collapses to a single point that has the correct mean? This might need a bit of explanation.\n- Minor, it would be helpful to have more details on how the parametrization in DDSS is performed in the appendix. Part of the confusion may be from the fact that we have a lot of notations, such as $\\mu_{tu}$ and $\\sigma_t$, $a$, $v$ etc. It would be great to explicitly explain what these mean (or correspond to in DDPM / DDIM).\n- I have a hard time understanding the code `t = cumsum(softmax([*v, 1.]))[:-1]`. What are the range of v and t? Maybe an example in the appendix can help?\n- I think the proof sketch can be moved into appendix as a more formal proof. At a high-level everything is Gaussian, so the claims themselves are not too hard to understand.\n\n**Comments**\n\n- The GGDP methods seem to be quite related to multistep methods in numerical integration, [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_multistep_method). I wonder what would be the connections to established multistep methods, such as Adam-Bashforth? It would be interesting to see what parameters does DDSS learn to further understand what it does. \n- Is there a reason why datasets with larger images such as LSUN (256x256) are not tested?\n\n\n==== Post rebuttal review ===\nI think the rebuttal addressed most of my concerns.
