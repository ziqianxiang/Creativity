This approach is evaluated on 87 datasets and 99 bit-precision configurations. The result shows that in general 6 bit floats (1,4,1) for activations and weights and 14 bit floats (1,6,7) for optimizer parameters is the best choice in term of memory and accuracy trade-off.  ",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper proposes a two-step methodology for evaluating the error-memory trade-off when employing low-precision training/inference in neural networks. Although low-precision training/inference in deep learning is a widely studied topic, this paper seems to be the first one to study this error-memory tradeoff without exhaustive search. \n\nThe proposed idea is inspired from the multi-objective optimization field. The authors propose to identify the Pareto frontier that would allow a user to identify the optimal precision (lowest error) given a certain memory constraint. The proposed system has two phases: training and testing. \n\nAt training time, given a set of datasets, a network architecture and a set of low-precision configurations, the method samples dataset-configuration pairs to train and computes the misclassification error for each selected pair. Matrix factorization is used to compute low-dimensional embeddings for each configuration. \n\nAt test time, a subset of configurations is chosen for evaluation (using Design Experiments with Matrix Factorization) and the computed errors are used as input together with the configuration embeddings to a linear regression model in order to estimate the errors on the non-evaluated configurations. For both training and testing, the memory matrix is fully computed based on the network architecture and the low-precision format.\n\nThe method is evaluated in terms of convergence and Hypervolume difference of the true and estimated Pareto frontier and it outperforms in most of the cases other methods such a Bayesian Optimization or Random Selection with Matrix Factorization.\n",
            "main_review": "The authors propose an interesting, one-of-a-kind two-step approach for error-memory trade-off in low-precision training/inference of neural networks. I appreciate the design of the method, the utility of the method (I find it very useful for the community working in the field) as well as the extensive set of measurements. The paper however could be improved especially in terms of clarity, especially in the experimental section. Please find below a few questions below:\n\n- Figure 1(b): it is not clear what the numbers in the parenthesis are. Memory requirements?\n- Is the meta-training performed per neural network architecture? This is my understanding, and if this is so, please clearly specify this in the description of the method (e.g., in Figure 2).\n- Was regularization used in the linear regression model? If so, how sensitive is the estimated Pareto frontier to the regularization parameter?\n- Configuration formats A and B (Section 2): the weights should also be mentioned, as you are using one of the two formats for weights as well, not only for the optimizer and activation.\n- How is the memory computed? Maximum memory measured at train/inference time? Or theoretical computation knowing the neural network architecture? My understanding is the latter, as you compute the full memory matrices both at train and test times. It should be clearly mentioned in the paper.\n- Figure 6b deserves more discussion. How it was generated, what it means. This is important as it supports one of the main properties of the method: the rapid decaying of the singular values of the error matrix. On a related note, how to choose the dateset-configuration data-points to guarantee this property?\n- Please define the propensity score.\n- In section 3.2, please define all the notations (e.g., yi).\n- In section 4.2 how was rank 3 chosen?\n- Figure 11: it is not clear what the x axis represents. For setting I, there is no memory cap, thus what does relative memory usage mean?\n- In Section 4, the authors mention different neural network architectures: ResNet-18, ResNet-34 and VGG. For which architecture are the results shown in Section 4? If for all of them, how are the performance metrics aggregated across architectures? Averaged across architectures? This is unfortunately not clear.",
            "summary_of_the_review": "Although there are some items that should be better explained / clarified, overall I enjoyed reading this paper and find the addressed topic of high interest for the community working in the field of low-precision training/inference of neural networks. Although I am not familiar with the prior art, the paper seems to be the first to propose a method for analyzing the error-memory trade-off in a deep learning low-precision training/inference scenario without exhaustive search. \n\nI like the two-step meta-training/meta-test approach, however I am not yet fully convinced about the main property of the meta-training algorithm, namely the rapid decaying of the singular values of the error matrix. In terms of evaluation, I appreciate the authors analyzing the performance of the meta-training approach using multiple metrics and providing recommendations for the optimal sampling conditions. \n\nAlso for the meta-test phase, the authors analyze the performance of the ED-MF approach to other methods such as bayesian optimization, random selection and QR with matrix factorization. ED-MF out-performs these methods in most of the cases. Some results are not clear unfortunately - see my questions in the main review above. Hopefully the results will become more clear during the paper discussion / rebuttal phase.",

Although this paper presents a solution for low-precision training that has recently gained a lot of attention, there are some concerns as a result of my review of this paper.

            "main_review": "1. Incomplete experimental results\n1-1) There is a limitation that most of the experiments were performed on CIFAR-10. Also, experimental results on more networks (e.g., MobileNet, EfficientNet, more ResNets) should be included.\n1-2) Although the proposed method considers both training and inference, performance comparison with existing SOTA studies for each phase should be performed.\n1-3) It is necessary to show whether the proposed method is effective not only for classification but also for more practical detection and segmentation networks.\n\n2. It is difficult to understand the actual use-case of the proposed method. Most of the experimental results also appear to support the feasibility of meta-training. Therefore, it is difficult to be sure how practical the proposed method will be. It would be good to think about this comment in relation to the comments about additional experiments (i.e., Comment 1).\n\n3. It is difficult to agree with the argument of this paper because the motivation of this paper is not sufficiently presented. The motivation of this study needs to be clearly presented at the beginning to secure differentiation from many recently published low-precision training studies.\n\n4. It is necessary not to just consider memory capacity as a resource, but to consider practical indicators such as power consumption or memory R/W portion as the target of trading.\n\n5. Although the proposed method suggests optimization considering the memory budget, it is necessary to consider the computational power together. It is not practical to consider only the memory budget because various designs using memory reuse, etc. are possible depending on the computation method/capability.\n\n6. It would be nice if comparative analysis and comparison results with custom hardware designs are presented.",
