        "comment": "This paper received 4 quality reviews. The reviewers like the problem formulation and various ideas presented to enabling a working pipeline. However, almost all experiments are conducted on synthetic data. Concerns are also raised regarding its usage and application on real-world data. In the updated version, the authors add some results on real-world data, yet without quantitative evaluation. After the rebuttal and discussion, the final rating is 6 from 3 reviewers, and 5 from 1 reviewer (note that reviewer SKNa stated that the rating will be increased to 6 but did not end up changing it in the \"recommendation\" entry). The AC sees both pros and cons of this work. Given that a conference paper does not have to be comprehensive in all frontiers and the novel idea presented in this paper, the AC is leaning toward in favoring of this work and thus recommends acceptance."

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposed a framework to continuously learn object-centric representations and formulate the problem by projecting the object representation space to the hypernetwork parameters for the segmentation task. The data are sampled from marginals where only one instance mask is collected in each scene. The representation learning incorporates the base representation learning, redundancy removal, and forgetting prevention.  The experiments study the impact of \\tau under different metrics.    ",
            "main_review": "This paper is well-organized and tackles the problems that can happen for continuous learning of object representation. They consider how to identify whether an object is seen or unseen, and progressively enrich the base concepts, and introduce redundancy removal, and forgetting prevention. \n\nIt is reasonable for setting a \\tau in the formulation to identify the unseen objects.  Comprehensive studies and explanations over  \\tau are included in the experiment parts. To further elaborate on the impact of \\tau, would it be good to show the re-identification recall and precision of the unseen objects with different \\tau? \n\nAs stated in Table 1, \"if an object is learned and added to the object list, it will be claimed as seen by Eq. 2, and the re-identification\naccuracy is always one.\" However, if the unseen objects are added, the unseen objects might be misclassified to some seen objects, and therefore, the precision can be lower than one. \n\nA separate analysis on the objects added and not added to the base class, and their respective segmentation and re-identification performance could be useful to understand how the system works in actual test cases. \n\nThe idea of representing new concepts with a set of known concepts and incrementally adding new concepts is not new as it has been used in memory mechanisms and other few-shot learning works. \n\nIt is a bit unclear how this can be extended to real-world data where a robot agent needs to obtain the instance segmentation mask through interaction for a large diversity of objects.

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes a framework to continuously learn object representations and has analyzed the framework’s feasibility for segmentation task at a low annotation cost on a synthetic dataset. Experiments were conducted in an attempt to demonstrate its effectiveness in representing objects and its potential for label efficient visual learning.",
            "main_review": "- Strength: The authors conduct many ablation studies to analyze the effects of different components of the proposed framework and discuss the role of many factors in-depth, such as influences of hyperparameters and order of training orders.\n\n-- Weakness: \n\n- Model correctness and effectiveness:\n(1) The solution to equation (3) seems not to exist theoretically. For positive alpha value (see Training details), since the neural network Phi contains linear transformation operation, the L1 norm for mu can be sufficiently large to increase the value of the objective function.\n(2) In my opinion, for positive alpha (see Training details), maximizing the L1 norm of mu would not be a regularizer to encourage sparsity of mu, as mentioned by the authors. \n(3) Since one image usually contains multiple objects types or numbers, will it result in misidentification in the object pursuit process? This influence is not discussed in the manuscript.\n\n- Model evaluation:\n(1) The model is only quantitatively evaluated on a synthetic dataset with a limited number of objects, lacks quantitative evaluation on a real dataset.\n(2) The author argues that the proposed object pursuit framework shows potential for tasks at a low-annotation regime. However, the study lacks comparison with any other models developed for reducing annotation costs. It greatly limits the contribution of the study.\n(3) It is evident that the variation of the order of training objects would result in different trained models. Even though the author presents Table 5 to demonstrate this issue, it lacks statistical testing to conclude that the pursuit process is robust to the training object order.\n\n- Writing issue:\n(1) For equation 1, the symbols for sample and population are not distinguished.\n(2) The meaning of n and m in 3.2 needs to be explained. Do they refer to types of objects and the number of learned objects?\n(3) The meaning of tau2 in the A.1 algorithm is not defined and explained in section 3.2 in the manuscript.\n(4) Does the alpha in equation (3) and equation (4) refer to the same alpha?\n(5) In Section 4.5, (Fig. ??) refers to which figure?\n(6) In section 4.3, table3 should be table5?\n(7) what does the symbol |*| mean in equation (2)? Does it refer to the number of learned objects? as well as the |*| in equation (3)\n\n\n- Other issues:\n(1) Should the mu be replaced by z in equation (2)? It seems that mu does not exist in the objective term. \n(2) For parameters alpha and beta in section 3.2, are they positive or negative numbers? They were set positive in Training details but were claimed to be negative in section 3.2.\n",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper presents a new framework to learn object-centric representations. The model is composed of a segmentation network and a hypernetwork. The hypernetwork takes the latent representation of a certain object as input and predicts the weights for the segmentation network. The latent representation and the hypernetwork are jointly optimized to maximize the discrimination power of the segmentation network. The framework also introduces a sparse representation mechanism so that each object can be represented in some base object representations. ",

In the experiment section, the authors present an extensive study to understand the presented methods. \n\nWeaknesses:\n\n1. The method requires a semantic segmentation mask as input even during testing. This largely limits the application scope as annotating mask even for an image is quite difficult.\n\n2. All experiments in the manuscript are conducted with synthetic data, which is not that convincing. In the supplementary material, the authors have presented some real-world examples.
