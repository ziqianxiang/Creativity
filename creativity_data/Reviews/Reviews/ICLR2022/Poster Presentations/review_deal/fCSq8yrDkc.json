        "comment": "This paper proposes a new algorithm to solve the discrete optimal transport problem, consisting of showing how the well-known Douglas Rachford algorithm can be efficiently applied, and also providing a convergence rate. Secondly, the paper gives an efficient implementation suitable for GPUs.\n\nThe paper would be a bit weak on just the DR contribution alone, so the efficient implementation, and experiments, are significant. However, the reviewers were not consistently happy with the experiments.\n\nTwo big issues raised by reviewers were wanting more experiments (having comparison experiments with real-world data), and wanting to compare with variants of the baseline algorithm (Sinkhorn), such as the log-transformed version which is more stable.  Looking at the revision, I think the reviewers have done a good job adding experiments.  Overall, for a paper with strong theoretical components, I think the computational aspects are strong.\n\nAs for (not) comparing with the log-transformed Sinkhorn and other more robust methods, the authors argue that this implementation would be slower.  I agree with reviewers that it would be nice to have these comparisons, but the authors' argument is plausible and I don't find it grounds to reject the paper.\n\nOverall, it seems there is some evidence that this is a worthwhile method, and there are no theoretical concerns other than presentation issues. Thus I think it would be a benefit to the community to accept this paper."

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes a novel method for solving the discrete optimal transport problem based on the celebrated Douglas-Rachford splitting (DR) method. The core idea is to split the original transportation map into two variables X and Z, where X is simply non-negative and Z is real-valued and obeys the given row and column sums constraints. The Z-update step in DR is then non-trivial, consisting in projecting a given matrix onto the set of all real-valued matrices with such row/column constraints, which has a closed-form solution due to Bauschke et al. (2021). The authors present a detailed discussion on how to implement the resulting algorithms efficiently on GPUs, and provide a theoretical convergence analysis that recovers the known O(1/k) rate of convergence for DR method. Experiments on a synthetic problem show that the proposed method (using the authors' CUDA implementation) is more numerically stable than the standard Sinkhorn method, while being comparably fast.",
            "main_review": "The authors address an important problem and come up with an interesting algorithm. They also provide a rigorous theoretical convergence analysis as well as many insights on their CUDA implementation. The performance of the proposed method is competitive with Sinkhorn.\n\nUnfortunately this paper also has some major limitations. The biggest one lies in its rather modest set of experiments. Some fundamentally important experiments are missing to support the claims of the paper.\n\n1. Implementation is presented as a core contribution of this paper: it is mentioned in the title, and in addition, it is devoted a substantial amount of space for presentation (almost 3 pages, a part of Section 3.1 and especially the whole Section 3.3). Therefore, it would be absolutely necessary to show that the presented materials are important by actually comparing the provided implementation (with highly-optimized CUDA kernels) with a naive implementation, e.g., using GPU linear algebra libraries such as PyTorch or TensorFlow. The proposed method (Algorithm 1) can be easily implemented using these libraries in just a few lines.\n\n2. The color transfer experiment is weird. Why aren't the results of Sinkhorn presented? Moreover, if sparsity is considered as an important objective, then the authors should also compare with Blondel et al. (2018). I would suggest to consider a more diverse set of examples to showcase the performance of DR in comparison with Sinkhorn (see also the next point).\n\n3. Sinkhorn has been highly successful not only because of its efficiency, but also because its updates are differentiable, which makes it suitable for learning with stochastic gradient descent. While the updates of Algorithm 1 are also differentiable almost everywhere, it is unclear how this algorithm performs in learning, compared to Sinkhorn. I would encourage the authors to add some learning experiments to make the paper even more solid.\n\n\nFinally, this paper also has some presentation issues.\n\n1. Major issues:\n\n- I wonder why the authors decided to denote 1_n as \"e\" and 1_m as \"f\". The notation \"f\" is used at multiple locations with different meanings (while the \"e\" can be confused with the Euler's number, though this is less critical than the \"f\"). It would be laborious to change because this is used everywhere, so I would suggest (as an acceptable fix) to replace the other instances of \"f\" with \"h\", e.g., \"h(x) + g(x)\" instead of \"f(x) + g(x)\".\n\n- In Figure 1 and 2, the descriptions of the axes should be clear from the captions (instead of being hidden in the text). Furthermore, the text in the plots (such as axis labels, markers, legends) are unreadable (too small).\n\n- Figure 3b shows that Sinkhorn is actually faster to reach a given accuracy (even though it is less numerically stable). This would deserve some comments (in a fair comparison of two methods, we should present both strengths and weaknesses of both methods).\n\n2. Minor issues:\n\n- Page 2, last paragraph of Section 1.1: \"Liang et al. (2017), derived\" --> \"Liang et al. (2017) derived\"\n\n- Page 2, line -5: \"methods(Rockafellar, 1976)\" --> \"methods (Rockafellar, 1976)\"\n\n- Section 2 2nd paragraph: \n\t- \"computed as Bauschke et al. (2021):\"  --> \"computed as (Bauschke et al., 2021):\"\n\t- \"linear program on the form\" --> \"linear program of the form\"\n\n- Page 3 last paragraph: \"problems on the form\" --> \"problems of the form\"\n\n- Section 3, 2nd paragraph: \"and fact that\" --> \"and the fact that\"\n\n- The notation for indicator function in Eq. (7) should be defined.\n\n- Page 5 first paragraph: \"matrix-vector multiples\" --> \"matrix-vector multiplications\"\n\n- Page 8 last paragraph: \"A algorithm\" --> \"An algorithm\"\n\n---\n**Update on November 10th:**\n\nI would like to have some additional comments/questions. Hopefully the authors could address them as well in their rebuttal:\n\n1. There seems to be a minor (likely fixable) **flaw** in Theorem 1 and the discussion thereafter. The inequality \n\\begin{equation}\n\\langle C,\\bar{X}\\_k \\rangle - \\langle C,X^* \\rangle \\le \\mathcal{O}(\\|Y\\_0-Y^*\\|^2/k)\\qquad (\\star)\n\\end{equation}\n\nis **not sufficient** to yield the convergence of the objective (let alone its rate). Note that **$\\bar{X}_k$ might not be feasible** and thus $\\langle C,\\bar{X}\\_k \\rangle - \\langle C,X^* \\rangle$ might be negative. In order to obtain the convergence of the objective, one would need a lower bound as well:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\alpha_k \\le \\langle C,\\bar{X}\\_k \\rangle - \\langle C,X^* \\rangle \\le \\mathcal{O}(\\|Y\\_0-Y^*\\|^2/k),\\qquad (\\star\\star)\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\alpha_k\\to 0$. Furthermore, in order to obtain the claimed $\\mathcal{O}(1/k)$ rate of convergence, one would also need to show that $(\\alpha_k)$ converges to $0$ at the same rate.\n\n2. The authors mentioned that they use the Sinkhorn implementation from POT. It is important to provide enough details so that the interested reader could reproduce the results. For example, which function of POT did the authors use and with which arguments? (ot.sinkhorn has quite several options for its arguments.)",

Existing results could directly give the linear convergence.\n\nMy main questions are as follows:\n\n* The experiments are mostly conducted compared with the Sinkhorn method. It would be interesting to see the results of other splitting schemes for discrete OT, e.g., the iterative Bregman projection.\n\n* It would be good to also provide empirical objective function value convergence curves.

Some of the subtleties, such as numerical instability of sinkhorn2, is also something that I have observed before, so I consider the experiments quite thorough.\n\nThe algorithms are theoretically well founded, and have convergence guarantees typical of this type of methods. They also have the advantage of working directly with regularized OT instances, which to my understanding are critical for the downstream applications using OT. My main worry about these theoretical guarantees is that they are quite difficult to compare vs. unconditional bounds such as those obtained via combinatorial optimization packages, or the recent (purely theoretical) n^2 type methods (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.05719.pdf).",
