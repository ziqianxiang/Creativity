        "comment": "This paper presents a query embedding approach for answering multi-hop queries over a hyper-relational knowledge graph (KG). The main contributions are a new dataset (WD50K-QE) for this task and a simple but sensible extension to an existing model for query embeddings to also handle relation qualifiers. Reviewers wJVm and Bute note that the reification and StarQE models perform similarly. While this is not a negative result, as the authors note, it does raise the question of the relative pros and cons of the two methods. I hope the authors can add a discussion of when one might prefer StarQE over the conceptually simpler reification method in the final version. The authors addressed Reviewer frRt’s concerns about faithfulness and backwards compatibility (though more evidence on purely triple-based tasks would be nice here). Reviewer GQAR also raised some concerns about writing, but the other reviewers mostly found the paper to be well written and well motivated and I tend to agree. Overall, while there are some very good suggestions on how the paper can be extended and improved, I find the current contributions to be substantial enough to warrant a publication."

            "summary_of_the_paper": "In this paper, the authors propose a framework to learn the query embeddings for hyper-relational KGs, which allows QA over hyper-relational KGs with more complex questions and makes use of the qualifiers. They also introduce a new hyper-relational KG QA dataset, WD50K-QE, for the evaluation of their proposed method. Experiments show that qualifiers help their framework achieve more accurate results in general compared with the baselines that use information from triple-only graphs.\n",
            "main_review": "Strength:\n- The paper is well-motivated, and the authors propose a reasonable solution to the hyper-relational KG QE problem.\n- Experiments show that the proposed problem outperforms most of the previous methods that only use triple-only graphs.\n- The authors prepare a new dataset for the hyper-relational KG QE problem.\n\n\nWeakness:\n- The description of their proposed method is not very clear. For example, \"we use X[y] to indicate the representation of y in X\" in the Qualifier Representation paragraph of Sec 4. Readers may be confused about the meaning of “X”. The authors should explain that “X” can be E, R, etc.\n- In table 1, compared with Reification, the performance improvement of StarQE is not very obvious.\n \n\nQuestions:\n- Could you clarify whether “StarE-like” in table 2 is the same as “StarQE” in table 1? It is better to use a more consistent name or explain their relation more clearly in Table 2 caption.\n",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper presents an approach for embeddings queries over hyper relation graphs. Hyper-relational graphs, specifically those that have context are usually represented and encoded as regular triples by the existing approaches. To do so, the work represent the hyper-relational graphs as FOL with parameterizing the predicate to include context. The model is a combination of three architectures where firstly encodes the query graph using StarE, then CompGCN to aggregate for representing qualifiers, and MPQE for learning the query embeddings. In order to evaluate this approach, the work defines a new dataset on Wikidata because of reified triples/qualifiers. ",
            "main_review": "The paper is well written and is an important step in the direction of handling multiple representations of knowledge graphs. Most existing approaches are focused on triple based techniques, however ignoring complex but more expressive representations such as reification and/or qualifiers. Therefore, in terms of novelty of the problem, this work clearly seems to be taking the next step in query embeddings. The approach is an interesting and valid combination of other approaches to solve the problem. The evaluation of the dataset clearly shows that the approach works.\n\nMy main concerns of this work is as follows:\n1. The aspect of entering a new territory should also be backward compatible with older representations. This raises the question of the performance of the system on Freebase datasets primarily evaluated by other state of the art approaches such as BetaE, Query2Box, EmQL etc. \n2. EmQL evaluates faithfulness of the overall approach. It is also important to measure how well the work performs on complete knowledge graphs and not only incomplete ones. Have the authors tried to do this?\n3. The change from Query2Box, EMQL to Beta Embeddings was its way of handling negation and disjunction operators. How does this work compare in terms of handling the operators of EFOL? \n4. Why does Oracle's performance drop for 3p queries and how does the proposed approach handle them better? If there are qualitative analysis on this it would be great. \n5. Can you please elaborate on StarE-like row in Table 2? I am not convinced that it is an apples to apples comparison to the other rows in the table. \n ",
            "summary_of_the_review": "The paper is well written and addresses an important direction is handling more complex representations of knowledge graphs. The work seems solid however lacks some aspects of evaluation. It is unable to justify that it is backward compatible to the original datasets which would be of great value even though not being at par with the state of the art approaches. In other words, it is ok to show drop in performance on Freebase datasets but claim generalizability over both traditional representations and KGs with reification. ",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper studies the multi-hop logical reasoning problem with hyper-relational knowledge graphs. In hyper relational knowledge graphs, edges are associated with some key-value pairs used for describing the contextual information. The goal of this paper is to incorporate such information in order to provide more fine-grained question answering. Specifically, StarQE, a combination of MPQEand StarE, is proposed to achieve this goal. The authors constructed a new dataset, WD50K-QE, and the experimental results show that StarQE can effectively model the qualifiers in the dataset.",
            "main_review": "This paper proposed StarQE for question answering over hyper-relational knowledge graphs. Overall, the motivation is strong, and the method is technically sound. \n#####Pros#####\n1. The task is well-motivated and interesting. It can deal with the question-answering task with qualifier pairs (Yet, some contextual information is not allowed).\n2. The proposed model is simple but performs well on certain types of queries. And it has a certain generalization capability.\n3. A new dataset is constructed in order to verify the model efficacy. \n4. The paper is well-written and easy to follow.\n\n#####Cons#####\n1. The experiments could be more convincing by using more datasets. Currently, only one dataset is used. It is not sure that if this method can also be used on other datasets or domains. Also, since the model can handle triple-only scenarios, I suggest the authors also consider reporting the performances on Freebase and Nell as done in query2box, as such, we can see whether or not this model can deal with more basic cases. \n2. The novelty is limited. The model is just a combination of two existing approaches. \n3. It cannot handle queries about numbers, text, and time. While some existing methods [a][b][c] can handle such information in knowledge graph embeddings.  Those important references are missing and should be used as baselines especially on 1p queries. \n4. Important reasoning operators such as negation, disjunctions are not considered, making the approach less attractive. I guess we can draw some insights from betaE for this type of operator.\n5. I suggest the authors add some baselines in Table 2 so that we can know the differences between StarQE and baselines in generalization capability.\n\n#####Question#####\nCan the model benefit from nonlinear layers (transformations)?\n\n[a] Knowledge Graph Embedding with Numeric Attributes of Entities, ACL 2018\n[b] Incorporating Literals into Knowledge Graph Embeddings, ISWC 2019\n[c] Beyond Triplets: Hyper-Relational Knowledge Graph Embedding for Link Prediction, WWW 2020\n",

Due to the lack of evaluation datasets, they propose to use a hyper-relational knowledge graph extracted from Wikidata. They also consider three baselines that can show the characteristics of the proposed approach, including reification baseline that transforms qualifiers to nodes. The overall performance shows the proposed approach shows benefit over the baselines, and usefulness when edge qualifiers are available.",

The proposed approach is compared with three baselines including the reification baseline.\n- S3. A new evaluation dataset is proposed.\n\nWeaknesses.\n- W1. Some of important information had to go to Appendix due to space. For example, I think the best hyperparameters used in the experiment can stay in the main paper.\n- W2. The proposed approach performs worse than the reification baseline when the problem is easier and the answer can be narrow down with traditional conjunctions.\n- W3. Another baseline of embedding the entire edge-qualifiers pair as a unit rather than representing the qualifiers as separate nodes is not considered. It can be predicted that this baseline is not suitable for a large number of possible qualifier values, but can be easily applicable to the suggested example by considering three atomic relations instead of qualifiers: educatedAt-BSc, educatedAt-MS, educatedAT-PhD.",

The presentation is mostly solid, and easy to read and understand. There is some very minor presentation issues that can be improved such as adding the best hyperparameters in the main paper, or adding the missing node color in the legend in Figure 4 or maybe using \"Oracle-\" instead of just \"Oracle\" which can be a bit misleading. But otherwise, this paper is well written with a clear goal and contributions, and evaluations. Since in case of limited set of qualifier values, the edge+qualifiers can be easily represented and embedded as altogether, it would be interesting to see the comparison with such a baseline. But I don't think this is necessary to show the value of this paper.",
