They showcase how revisions in past data, quantified as the backfill error, can introduce a considerable error in predictions. Towards that, they propose a novel deep learning approach, the Back2Future, that refines the model predictions using backfill dynamics. They demonstrate its efficiency on a real COVID dataset. \n",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The authors consider the effects of backfill dynamics--the correction of historical data--on time series prediction. They use COVID-19 forecasting as the motivating application. Both the features (ER visits, hospitalization rate, etc.) and the target (deaths) are subject to revision, and the authors collect a data set showing that the backfill error due to revisions can be extremely large. The authors make several other interesting observations regarding backfill error and sequences in their data. A key finding is that real-time forecasts tend to overestimate their accuracy when compared to the stable accuracy after errors are corrected. The authors then propose a Back2Future (B2F) pipeline that can be used to refine predictions from a model when backfill dynamics are present. They demonstrate consistent improvement on stable accuracy for multiple COVID-19 forecasts.",
            "main_review": "Strengths:\n\n- Characteristics of the backfill dynamics problem is very well motivated with observations from COVID-19 data that the authors have collected. While people have long known that corrections to data over time will have effects on forecasts, this paper is the first (to my knowledge) that carefully examines the prevalence and effects of backfill dynamics.\n- Very general B2F pipeline that can be applied to \"post-process\" the predictions of any forecasting model. The wide applicability could lead to high impact.\n- Strong experimental results on real data, showing consistent improvement of COVID-19 death forecasts for 5 different candidate models.\n- Paper is very well organized and written, with only some minor issues that I list below.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n- Fit for ICLR may not be the best. There's not really a contribution towards learning representations, as the B2F pipeline integrates existing neural network architectures. I think this is a better fit for a data mining venue such as KDD.\n- Text in many figures, including Figure 1, 3, and 4, is too small to be readable. I recommend removing some of the results, for example, converting Table 2 to a figure that shows only the ensemble model. A more complete version of Table 2 is available in Table 4 of the appendix anyways.\n\nMinor presentation issues:\n\n- Figure 3 caption: Usually an x-y plot is described as y vs. x, whereas this caption is x vs. y.\n- Obs. 4: non-monotonous $\\rightarrow$ non-monotonic\n- Page 9, 2nd paragraph: \"B2F rectified estimates MAE stable MAE\": Insert \"in\" between \"MAE\" and \"stable\".",
            "summary_of_the_review": "The paper contributes both new data and a new problem setting, motivated by forecasting COVID-19 deaths over time. Due to the high novelty and very general proposed B2F pipeline for refining model predictions, this paper could have high impact, although it may not be the best fit for the ICLR audience.",

I also appreciated the careful preliminary data analysis of the covid data that motivate and back the model proposal.

The problem is well presented, notation is defined carefully, and the model is described with enough detail.\n- A careful COVID data analysis serves to motivate and back the model proposal. \n- The work is very relevant to the current situation and ongoing research\n\nMinor comments:\n- is it possible to give some reasons for the revisions in the case of covid?\n- In section 2.1, clarify what is the spatial analysis unit adopted.\n- What is the model performance when a finer spatial unit is adopted such as counties.\n \n",
