Convergence guarantees proposed were sound and experimental results on generative adversarial networks and adversarial training demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms."

Specifically, the proposed method turns the nonconvex-nonconcave minimax problem to a nonconvex-concave minimax problem by using a toolkit of multiple smooth algorithms to find a solution of the maximization problem given fixed $x$. Moreover, it studies the convergence properties of the proposed algorithms. Some experimental results on generative gdversarial networks and adversarial training demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms. ",

So the authors should detail whether these assumptions are used in the existing methods.\n\n3) Recently many existing methods have studied the nonconvex-concave minimax problems. The authors should point the differences between the nonconvex-concave minimax problem (1) given in the paper and the generic nonconvex-concave minimax problems studied in the existing methods. \n\n4) The authors study the convergence properties of the proposed algorithms to solve the nonconvex-concave minimax problem (1) given in the paper.

More precisely,\nthe paper examine a model where the max-player applied a zero-memory smooth (from differential perspective) algorithm and min-player SGD/SNAG or proximal methods providing results similar with the state of art. The convergence is reassured by \"potential\" arguments but the fixed point is not an equally game-theoretic notion like Nash Equilibrium.",
            "main_review": "Firstly, I would like to mention some technical details in the proofs of the primary appendix sections.\n\nIssue #1.[Lemma 2] In the lemma about the max of L-weak convex functions and its subgradient, the proof shows only the inclusion not the completeness. More precisely, from the proof I can see why the linear combinations of gradients correspond to subgradients of the max-functions. On the other hand, this does not show that all subgradients can be written in this form? \n\nPlease provide a new proof OR correct the statement and explain why a refined statement suffices for our task. A priori, I believe that the result should be correct as a generalization of Danskin's Theorem.\n\nIssue #2.[Lemma 3] The statement of the lemma is correct since they are folklore truths for proximal descent. HOWEVER, the proof that you provide has some mathematical flaws. \nExample: You say that min g(x) = min g_\\ell(x) and then you say that  \" Thus argmin g(x) = argmin g_\\ell(x)\". In general this is not correct for two function f_1,f_2 (i.e f_1(x)=|x|,f_2=|x-1|)\nThe only way that I know to show the result is via the facts that $argmin g(x) = fixpoints(proxGD)$ and \n$argmin g_\\ell(x) = fixpoints(proxGD)$\n\nSimilarly for item (c), I was not able to parse the argument. Could you please explain in a list the statements of the proof \n\nMAIN CONTRIBUTION:\n\nI really like the idea of the \"smoothed adversary\" as a refined benchmark. i agree that a better framework would be if we \"constrain\" the opponent in order to examine if it is possible to find efficiently a good solution. I appreciate the model and the conceptual, \"easily\"-understandable results and the well-written part of main paper. I don't like the fact that authors do not explain(hide) explicitly that the smooth adversaries have not memory in comparison with its opponent. If this is correct, I would appreciate some addition in the text which will explain that. Finally, there are two issues about the results:\n(1) we don't have convergence to a Nash equilibrium or local \\eps-Nash equilibrium but to a point which is biased against the \"inner\" player. (2) The novelty of the results is limited since the algorithmic concepts ,that are used, are somehow blackboxes. On the other hand, I understand that the main idea is to explain why the case of \"smooth adversaries\" is a tractable case.\n\nIn general I would like some answers in my \"complaints\"/ \"issues\" that I raised. I believe strongly that with a satisfying answer I will increase happily my score.",
