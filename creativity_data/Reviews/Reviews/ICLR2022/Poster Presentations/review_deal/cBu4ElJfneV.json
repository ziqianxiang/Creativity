        "comment": "Three experts reviewed the paper. Two reviewers recommended acceptance as they liked that the work identified a legacy design in object detection networks and resolved it by a new module. All reviewers found the empirical results strong. Reviewer MDN5 recommended rejection main for the concern that this newly designed module is a standard exploitation of network architectures. AC sided with the positive reviewers because of the paper's identification of a legacy design in object detection and the strong experimental results. Hence, the decision is to recommend the paper for acceptance. The reviewers did raise some valuable concerns that should be addressed in the final camera-ready version of the paper. The authors are encouraged to make the necessary changes to the best of their ability. We congratulate the authors on the acceptance of their paper!"

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper raises the question of whether it is effective to conventionally use deep (or heavy) networks trained on ImageNet dataset as backbone of a feature encoder for object detection. Instead, it introduces GiraffeDet, which has a deep neck network that processes multi-scale representations with a shallow backbone. Experiments demonstrate that, given the same memory budget, the proposed method outperforms the conventional method, which rely on the heavy backbone, on MS COCO dataset.",
            "main_review": "* Strength\n1. The argument in this paper was interesting and the approach (GiraffeDet) to addressing this argument seems to be effective for object detection.\n2. Designing the proposed architecture was technically sound.\n3. Experiments supports the effectiveness of the proposed method properly.\n\n* Weakness\n1. I do not have a big concern on this paper. I recommend to add an experiment comparing the proposed method to baselines when the neck networks are of equal depth.",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes a new network architecture called GiraffeDet. GiraffeDet consists of a light backbone, a heavy neck and a prediction head. In the backbone, the paper proposes the S2D (spatial to depth) structure, claiming its better efficiency. In the neck, the paper proposes denser connections based on FPN, taking cross-scale information exchange into account. The experimental results show the state-of-the-art accuracy compared with other single stage object detection framework on the same FLOP level.  ",
            "main_review": "strengths: The paper had a good exploitation on the connections in skip-layer and cross-scale. The findings are very helpful for the community. \nweaknesses: 1. The paper in general does not read well, and more careful proofreading is needed.\n                      2. In S2D structure, it is not clear why the number of parameters does not change. If the kernel height/width stay the same, then its depth will increase, resulting in more parameters. I agree the efficiency could be improved since the FLOP is quadratic on activation side length. But in terms of parameters, more details are expected.\n                     ",
            "summary_of_the_review": "This paper gives another insight into the balance of backbone and neck in the particular problem of object detection. It proposes a framework called giraffeDet, which proves very effective from the experimental results. The main contribution, in my opinion, is about the exploitation on the connections in skip-layer and cross-scale. But this contribution is minor. Also FLOPs is an important metric in efficiency, but the more straightforward inference time will add onto the claim about the light backbone + heavy neck.  ",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper works on designing network architecture for object detection. While most existing object detectors adopt image classification backbones with a light-weighted \"neck\" (FPN), this paper proposes the inverse way: using a lightweight backbone and a heavy, dense neck. The proposed network performs ~1 mAP higher than (listed) existing works with similar computations on COCO.",
            "main_review": "### Strengths\n\n - The overall message, an object detector can have a light-weighted bottom-up backbone and a heavy top-down neck is new. \n - The technical contribution of designing the neck in a log-scale connection is neat. It is good to know the log-scale connection performs better than the dense connection.\n - The paper is well written and easy to follow.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n - The comparisons in Table. 2 are not clear. What is the detection head of the GiraffeDet? I didn't find the details in the paper. Are they RetinaNet-style anchor-based or FCOS/ ATSS-style single anchor? Ideally, Table 2 should only compare the same detector with different backbones, as the proposed contribution only changes the backbone. It is unclear what to conclude when comparing FCOS with Res50 to a RetinaNet with a different FPN architecture. If the authors are not using the best detection head (or are using a better head than what is listed in Table. 2), then it is necessary to show the proposed backbone can improve the best detection head.\n\n - At a high level, the paper only shows \"using a light backbone and heavy neck\" is feasible for object detection, but does not show this is better than the conventional architecture. From Table. 2, the proposed GiraffeDet outperforms the better counterpart in the same block by an ~1mAP. However, given the well-established toolboxes of conventional architecture, it is very hard to convince a user to switch to the proposed architecture. For example, conventional backbones can easily get a performance boost with deformable convolutional layers, while it is unclear how deformable convolutional layers can help the proposed backbones. Ideally, the authors should also compare to DCN-based backbones as they are used in most detection papers. Overall, a 54.1 mAP with test-time augmentation is a victory in Nov 2021.\n\n - While Table. 2 reports the FLOPs, it is more important to compare the actual inference time on the same machine. I am not sure if the log-scale connection in the proposed framework will make the runtime slower under the same FLOPs.\n\n - It would be interesting to see how the proposed neck works under a standard backbone. It is fine if the overall FLOPs increase if they significantly outperform BiFPN. Ideally, add the BiFPN entry to Fig 7 (left), with both S2D chain backbone or standard heavy backbone.\n\n - Fig. 8 is too small to note the difference.\n\n",
            "summary_of_the_review": "Overall the paper provides an interesting alternative to object detection architectures. However the current experiments do not directly support this claim (mixed change of network architecture and the detection head), and it is unclear if the proposed architecture is compatible with existing techniques (e.g., DCN). The proposed method is also at risk of low run time. \n\nMy current rating is a weak reject. In the rebuttal, if the authors show solely replacing the backbone (E.g., replacing ResNeXt-101-DCN-FPN (ideally, the largest EfficientDet or Swin-L) with the proposed network) can improve a state-of-the-art detector (e.g., CascadeRCNN, GFLV2 etc.) with acceptable time cost, I will increase my rating.",
