They show how foreground/background semantics learnt in a generative model are useful for tasks like segmentation.\nThis is a general approach that can be applied to other models in the future.\nIt is an accept."

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper describes a simple procedure that allows to train an unsupervised image segmentation model only using a generative model as input. By tricking the generator to predict proxy segmentation masks along with a generated image, the method allows to construct a possibly infinite dataset of images associated with a F/B mask. A segmentation model can then be trained on this dataset to predict foreground.\nThe proposed approach is evaluated across a wide range of small-scale segmentation datasets, and compared with various approaches to the problem (both supervised, handcrafted and unsupervised). An adaptation of this approach to semantic segmentation is proposed and evaluated on Pascal VOC.",
            "main_review": "=== PROS ===\n+ This paper tackles an interesting problem : that of forging an image segmentation model without supervision. It does so in an interesting way, by exploiting a latent structure in image generation models. While the motivation in intro and p4 is a bit handwavy, it seems to be verified by experiments. \n+ The proposed approach is very simple and can be adapted to any generative model. The experiments further show that the performance of the segmentation is correlated with the PID, a proxy measure for the quality of generated images.\n\n=== CONS ===\n- The performance on the Flowers dataset is a bit disappointing w.r.t. to other unsupervised methods. Could it be because of the domain on which the initial generative model was trained on? If the generative model was specialized in flower species, would the results change?",
            "summary_of_the_review": "Overall, I think that this is an interesting paper, showing that generative models contain a lot of information about the structure of images. Being able to build a segmentation model that really works on real data is quite impressive. As stated by the authors, this indeed is an interesting application of generative models that is useful on actual CV tasks. Because of the surprising observation and decent experimental execution, I think this paper deserves to be presented at ICLR. ",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper tackles the problem of image segmentation. It focuses on finding foreground-background image separation cues from a pre-trained GAN and create a synthetic dataset. Once the dataset is created, it trains a segmentation models and test the approach on several benchmarks. The paper is centred around how to extract and detect this foreground-background separation in an unsupervised way. The method works with any GAN architecture and in the end achieves competitive results while being unsupervised.",
            "main_review": "The motivation of the paper and the overall method is very interesting. The authors prove that by using their method, they can leverage and find foreground-background information in virtually any GAN architecture and use those cues to create a synthetic dataset that is then used for image segmentation. I think that this has a lot of applications and is an interesting area of research.\n\nThe paper is fairly well written and the overall message is well understood. I think that the authors demonstrate that their method can be applied to various architectures and that overall it has potential on identifying the foreground-background information.\n\nHowever, I find the rest of the experimental part relatively weak. More exactly, while it is interesting to find that the method works with 12 other GANs, I feel like that for the image segmentation part there are some missing key aspects. The first one, is the comparison with methods that do not use/are not generative. While I understand the motivation and clearly that the goal is to directly compare agains generative methods, I think that a comparison with all methods is needed. This will give a clear indication on how the generative methods compare against other methods. \n\nMoreover, I feel like a lot more details regarding what data they use for training the models is missing. In order to understand the power of this generated data, I feel like the authors should have answered to the following questions, but in the current form of the paper are missing: \n1) How many samples does the final dataset contain?\n2) How does the number of samples affect the performance of the final model?\n3) What happens if you combine data from multiple GANs?\n\nLastly, since the overall performance is relatively on par with other methods, while having some advantages in terms of supervision, I would have wished to see at least one experiment that augments existing datasets with synthetic data. In this form, while I like the idea, the numbers do not seem that convincing to me.",
            "summary_of_the_review": "Overall I think that the paper is well written.

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper proposes an unsupervised approach for instance segmentation that leverages pretrained GANs. The approach is divided into two steps: first, the authors discover a latent direction in the generator that allows them to segment generated images. Then, the resulting image-label pairs are used to train a segmentation network. This network can finally be used to perform inference on unseen images. The approach is evaluated on a variety of GAN architectures. The main contribution claimed by the authors is that their method can be applied to off-the-shelf pretrained GANs, whereas competing approaches require architectural variations and re-training.",
            "main_review": "Strengths:\n- The approach is well-described and the paper is generally easy to follow.\n- The literature review is comprehensive.\n- The approach seems to produce good qualitative results, and quantitative results are slightly better than competing unsupervised approaches.\n- Quantitative results are computed on a variety of tasks, not just instance segmentation.\n\nWeaknesses:\n- In my opinion, there is little novelty. Except for the latent direction discovery step, the overall framework is very similar to existing approaches.\n- The latent direction is found by exploiting the photographer's bias (i.e. objects usually appear at the center of the image). How does the method perform if this condition is not satisfied?\n- There is no discussion of failure cases (I think they would make the paper stronger).",
            "summary_of_the_review": "Although the paper is well-written and its implementation seems to be technically sound, my main concern is the limited novelty of the proposed approach. There are already many existing approaches that leverage GANs in order to segment images, and while this approach presents some useful ideas, I think they are somewhat incremental. Overall, the paper seems to be below the bar, but I would also like to hear the author's opinion and the other reviewers.",

As a result, the directions could be utilized to synthesize image segmentation training samples.\nExperimental results on saliency detection and image segmentation demonstrate the effecteness of the proposed method.

The designed loss functions of edge preserving and image contrast enhancement are reasonable and achieve better image segmentation performance.\n\nHowever, I still have several concerns.\n1. The Sobel Filter is not perfect on extracting the foreground object contour as shown in Fig.2. Therefore, the optimized latent space manipulation direction may not be accurate.\n2. The motivation for the image contrast variation is not very plausible. The area covered by the brighreness mask is darked instead of the foreground object which means the mask generation (Eq. 2) not make sense. \n3. The authors should add more comparisons with similar approaches such as [2]. I suggest the authors follow the evaluation setting in [2]. The proposed method could synthesize face segmentation samples via StyleGAN2 pretrained on FFHQ. Then train a segmentation model and evaluate it on Celeba-HQ. \n4. Most experimental results are based on low resolution images. Could the authors provide more results on high resolutions such as 256x256 or 512x512. \n5. The latent manipulation may not be perfect. Please provide some failure cases for mask generation and further discussion.\n\n[1] Andrey Voynov, Stanislav Morozov, and Artem Babenko.
