        "comment": "This is a borderline paper on the well researched theme of Topic models.\nThe strongest point of the paper is that it proposes a new topic modelling framework where both word and topic embeddings live in the same space.\n It then appeals to optimal transport theory to do the necessary training using SGD. However, this is not the first paper to examine\nTopic models and Optimal Transport theory. Several papers[1,2,3] in the recent past have started investigating this line of research.  In the rebuttal phase, the author(s) justify the choice of state of the art methodologies and also discuss the key conceptual difference between \nexisting literature and the submitted one. The major difference seems to \nthey approach the problem differently leading to better quality topics(as measured by several metrics) and computational efficiency---existing state of the art requires more complicated iterations whereas proposed approach works with SGD. \nThe manuscript, if accepted, needs to be updated considerably to reflect some of these aspects. \n\n\n\n\n[1] Hongteng Xu, Wenlin Wang, Wei Liu, and Lawrence Carin.

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The manuscript proposes a combined topic modeling and word embedding method.  The idea is to define word and topic embeddings in the same space, represent documents based on both of them, and use a transport-based method to train these two representations to be similar to each other.  The final objective function combines a \"conditional transport\" objective with a log-likelihood term, and is optimized via Adam.  Experiments find that the method achieves good topic coherence scores and document clustering metrics compared to baselines.\n",
            "main_review": "Strong points:\n\n- While the combination of topic models and word embeddings has received substantial study, it remains an interesting problem.  An optimal transport (or conditional transport) approach such as the one proposed is a promising direction.\n\n- The ability to initialize with pre-trained word embeddings and fine-tune the model is valuable (though this paper is not the first to do this).\n\n- Experimental results versus a range of baseline methods are encouraging.\n\n- The qualitative results on embeddings of words and topics were nice to see.\n\nWeak points:\n\n- My biggest complaint with this paper is that the necessity and motivation for the proposed method is unclear.  While combining topic models and word embeddings is a worthy problem, and transport methods are an interesting potential solution, this paper is far from the first to study the intersection of topic models and word embeddings.  This is already a crowded space which includes the cited papers, such as the ETM and neural topic models, and several others as well.  The present manuscript doesn't make a compelling argument that the proposed method resolves urgent problems in this area.  Furthermore, the proposed method is stated then studied without a principled justification. It reads like the authors wanted to try this method, so they did, rather than that there was a particular reason or mathematical justification for why the method is designed the way that it is.\n\n- The manuscript was quite hard to follow at times, partly because the lack of clearly stated justification for the proposed approach leads to substantial effort to understand what exactly the authors are doing.  The use of non-standard notation in some instances was a contributing factor in this issue.\n\n- Transformer-based language models such as BERT have become the state of the art for representation learning in natural language processing in recent times.  This work should ideally compare with BERT, etc, or justify why it does not do so.  It also needs to discuss the merits of the proposed approach versus transformer-based language models.\n\n- Since the objective function (Equation 13) combines the conditional transport objective with a likelihood objective, both an approach using conditional transport alone and an approach using likelihood optimization alone should be compared to as baselines.\n\n- Separately encoding transport costs c(w, \\phi) and distances d(w, \\phi), which are \"related but also with differences\" (pg 4), seems inelegant. \n\n- If speed advantages are claimed (cf. pg 6, \"more efficient learning\"), this should be demonstrated with rigorous experiments.\n\n- Hyperparameter tuning could have been done more systematically for the experiments, rather than using fixed values for most experiments, followed by a brief sensitivity test.\n\n- The training algorithm could have been explained more clearly, and in the paper itself instead of in the appendix.\n\n\nAdditional feedback / minor suggestions:\n\nPg 6, Equation 6, it looks like there is an issue in the last step, which doesn't clearly follow from the previous step.  I think there is a missing term on the top and bottom here corresponding to P_j(W_{ji}).  Compare to Equation 9, which has \\theta terms on the top and bottom of the last equation in the line.\n\nPg. 10 (references) - \"Latent dirichlet allocation\" needs a capital \"D.\"\n\nPg. 12 (Appendix), \"the training algorithm of our WeTe is shown in Algorithm 1\" needs a capital T.\n\nA couple of highly relevant missing references:\nK.

            "summary_of_the_paper": "Jointly learning latent topic representations with word embeddings has caught some attention in the past. The reason why researchers choose this route is to exploit the complementary advantage of both these models, for instance, to improve the performance of the model on short texts. In this paper, the authors study a new topic model where topics and words are encoded in the same embedding space. Usually, in the traditional topic modelling literature, the posterior inference is realised using algorithms such as Gibbs sampling or collapsed Gibbs sampling; however, in this paper, since the authors exploit complementary knowledge between the two models, the end-to-end model is jointly trained the document-specific discrete latent topic distribution is made to appear as close as possible to the discrete distribution over words in the document. A probabilistic bidirectional transport model is developed that measures the difference between the discrete distributions in the embedding space. The authors also discuss several key advantages of the model.\n\nExperiments are then followed with topic diversity and coherence measures as evaluation metrics which are widely used in the literature. Qualitatively, the authors show some example results from their dataset in the form of a t-SNE plot.",
            "main_review": "Strengths:\n1. The authors develop a novel model to jointly model latent topics and word embeddings. While the model is novel, there are already existing works that have jointly modelled latent topics and word embeddings exploiting their complementary advantages. The authors also present the derivation of the model and the key equations that demonstrate how the model works.\n2. The authors have also tried to intertwine their model with the experiments. As a result, the authors have conducted some experiments to demonstrate that the model improves upon some existing methods.\n\nThere are several ways in which this paper can be improved:\n1. The authors can strengthen their experiments by experimenting against some downstream applications such as document classification. Unsure of why the authors did not cite this work that has used document classification as one of the experiments (https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3077136.3080806).\n2. Relating to the work cited in (1) above, it would be nice to have some cooperation on how the proposed work differs from the work that is already published by Bei et al. There are some follow-up works too since this work was published and the authors are requested to have a go at them too. Where Bei's work would be crucial is mainly in comparing against the run-time performance of the models where Bei's work is a much simpler version of a model that jointly learns latent topics and embeddings. Besides that, the effectiveness of the model could be compared as a result.\n3. Correcting some grammar issues, e.g., facilitates instead of facilities, latter instead of later; authors can use the PDF search feature to find such words.\n4. The authors could consider theoretically comparing their embeddings with those static embeddings obtained using Skipgram or GloVe. Or, do we expect that the embeddings that the authors learn using their model are different in property from traditional static embeddings such as GloVe or Skipgram.",
