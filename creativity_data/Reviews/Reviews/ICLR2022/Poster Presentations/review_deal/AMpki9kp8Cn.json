        "comment": "This paper proposes an identifiable nonlinear ICA model based on volume-preserving transformations. The overall approach is very similar to the GIN method published @ ICLR 2020. There is a weak consensus among the reviewers that this paper has some merit, although none pushed for acceptance. After reviewing the paper myself, I agree that the contributions here appear to be incremental, but the results do push this growing field of identifiable latent variable models forward."

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper proposes a framework for nonlinear ICA with that restriction that the mixing function is a volume preserving transformation. The authors prove that given this restriction as well as a few other conditions the sources are identifiable. The model set up is very similar to the one used in Sorrenson et al.'s work \"Disentanglement by nonlinear ica with general incompressible-flow networks (gin)\": A real NVP model is made volume preserving by a slight modification of the flow map and this flow is used to learn the mixing function. The sources are assumed conditional independent given an auxiliary variable $u$, which are the labels of classes in their experiments. The mixing function is learned by maximizing the Gaussian likelihood of the reconstruction sources, which is also conditionally independent given $u$.\n\nThe authors demonstrate empirically that some of the conditions of their identifiability proof might not be necessary because the sources can still be reconstructed empirically although the condition is not satisfied. Hence, identifiability might even hold true for an even larger class of problems. They also compare their method to iVAE and show that their framework can identify the true sources of generated data much better than this baseline. Furthermore, they apply the framework to MNIST and can identify a few important source variables explaining most of the variance of the dataset.",
            "main_review": " The framework is mainly reused from Sorrenson et al.'s work. The authors simplify the loss derived by Sorrenson et al.; however, they do not make clear why this is necessary or desirable. Their main contribution are two novel identifiability theorems, which state that under a few more conditions in addition to the volume preserving mixing function the true sources can be identified. Empirically, not all of the conditions seem to be necessary. Even when a non-volume-preserving map is used, the true sources of synthetically generated data can be reconstructed in their ablation study in section 6.2.1. This ablation study raises the question whether the formulation of this framework for nonlinear ICA is to rigid, i.e. model used is too restricted.\n\nThe method outperforms iVAE, which is an important baseline in the field.\n\nAs a minor command, I want to add that there is a typo in the first sentence of section 6.2: it should be \"variables\", not \"variabls\".",
            "summary_of_the_review": "I appreciate the two novel identifiability theorems. However, the ablation study  in the experiments section lets the conditions appear to restrictive. Furthermore, it is not clear what distinguishes this work from Sorrenson et al.'s article apart form the identifiability theorems. Therefore, I tend towards rejecting this article but I am open to enter a discussion with the authors and the other reviewers.\n\nEdit:\nGiven the helpful clarification for the authors to distinguish their work from Sorrenson et al.'s article I will raise my score by one.",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "[Sorrenson et al 2020] proposed to do nonlinear ICA via volume preserving mixing functions, when a variable u is observed that makes the latent variables conditionally independent. Via maximum likelihood optimization, the ICA model uses a volume-preserving encoder and then maximises a latent distribution, which is a factorized Gaussian conditional on the observed variable u.\n\nThe submitted paper does a theoretical identifiability analysis on that procedure. It assumes that the data is generated by an independent distribution, given observed u, then mixed by a volume-preserving mixing function. Furthermore, it assumes that both the mixer and the encoders are twice differentiable, there exist two observed u variables, u^1 and u^2 such that that the two resulting distributions of encoded latent variables have the same mean and that the set of ratios of the two standard deviations for each variable is distinct. If these assumptions hold, the paper proves that the original sources are identifiable up to a permutation and dimension-wise diffeomorphism.\n\nThe authors do three experiments: 2D mixture of Gaussians, triangle images and MNIST. For the first two, the authors quantitatively estimate the source identification and for all datasets, qualitative results on identification are given.",
            "main_review": "Strengths:\n-\tThe authors provide theoretical support for the use of the pre-existing GIN model for ICA. They propose novel assumptions and prove this leads to identifiability.\n-\tThe paper is very clearly written.\n\nWeaknesses:\n-\tThe authors claim that a volume-preserving mixing function is a natural restriction and is easily satisfied. I would like to see a stronger argument why this is true, as it seems easy to think of non-volume-preserving mixing functions. Such an argument should include why the triangle dataset and MNIST would be generated by volume-preserving mixing functions. \n-\tThe experiments find that none of the assumptions in the main theorem are necessary for identifiability to hold. More discussion about what necessary conditions would look like would improve the paper.\n-\tThe experiments are not very strong. Only quantitively analyzes the simple triangle dataset, so does not include a non-trivial dataset with known sources, so that identifiability can be quantified. Also, the experiments show large overlap with the experiments of [Sorrenson et al 2020]. An additional experiment with more complicated images with known sources would improve the paper.\n-\tIt is unclear why the model does not fully succeed in identifying the true sources in the triangle dataset. Is one of the assumptions not satisfied? Are there learning difficulties?\n\nFurther comments:\n-\tIt seems that there is a constraint that q(z|u) must be equal to the push-forward of p(s|u) through $g \\circ f$, in other words, that Figure 1 can be interpreted as a commuting diagram. However, this is never explicitly stated in the definition of the estimating model. Could the authors please clarify this?\n-\tI believe the appendix should be separately provides as supplementary material.\n\nTypos:\n-\tIn (18) in the appendix, z_0 should be s_0?\n-\tAbove (23) in the appendix, should positive-defined be positive definite? Or positive semi-definite?\n",

The authors have explained that in literature that ICA can be expressed as a factorial member of the exponential family, however, this arrives at a solution which is not identifiable. The authors have explained that there are two ways of achieving disentanglement, this could be done by either (1) restricting the sources or (2) restricting the function f.\n\n\nInterestingly that authors have proposed to use a volume-preserving transformation typically found in normalizing flows to be able obtain identifiability. There is a volume preserving transformation from the sources to the mixed signal which represents the generative process. Then there is a volume preserving transformation from the mixed signal to the latent space (which is not the source signal). Then a factorial multivariaate Gaussian is used to identify the conditional independence of each source signal.\n\nIn the classical ICA problem setup, the dataset does not contain any labels. While in this setting the input dataset for ICA appears to contain labels (u?).",
