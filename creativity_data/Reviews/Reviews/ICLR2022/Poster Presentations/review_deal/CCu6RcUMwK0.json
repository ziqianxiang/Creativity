            "main_review": "Strengths:\n(1) The paper is clearly written\n(2) I find the walk based approach to be interesting (with several weaknesses)\n\nWeakness:\nNo conceptual difference with GNN: In my understanding, when we compute $P^{\\tau}$, it combines the $\\tau$ hop information around a node to compute its embedding. In this aspect, I did not understand any conceptual difference with GNN. What aspect of it is making the difference?\n\nLoss function: At the end, LP is a classification task. From this aspect, MSE loss minimization may not be suitable--- a simple classification or ranking loss should be more suitable. Did the authors try them?\n\nAUC: I suspect that for most of the datasets, the difference of WALKPOOL with baselines is not statistically significant. Can the authors clarify about it?\n\n",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes a neural architecture for predicting missing links in a graph by designing a so-called WalkPool scheme. WalkPool exploits node features (from a GNN) to compute the transition probability between the nodes, and then manually design a number of links that are extracted from the oder-k encolosing sub-graphs covering a pair of nodes for link prediction. The authors also defined a delta-graph feature that is the sub-graph level feature difference before and after removing the node pairs with which the link is to be predicted. Experimental results are quite optimistic on about 10 benchmark datasets.",
            "main_review": "Strengths: \n\nThe paper is well-written; the introduction of the previous work is organized. Description of the SEAL algorithm is very insightful and clear.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\nThe attributed network datasets concsidered is a bit limited. Can there be more datasets available for evaluation?\n\nThe final features extracted are mainly specified by human. Though effective, it leaves an open question that whether thses sorts of features can be leared adaptively?\n\nThe proposed method follows the framework of the SEAL algorithm, and the authors should exphasize the differences between the two methods and what makes the propose method more advantageous. ",
            "summary_of_the_review": "\nOverall the paper is nicely written and organized, and provides useful thought in the problem of link prediction with or without node features. Experimental results are also promising. However I have a few technical details I would like to discuss.\n\n(1) The authors used feature-based similarty (like in GAT type of algorithms) to define the transition probbaility matrix, which takes the place of the topology-based transitiona matrix by and large. Is there a way to combine the information from both?\n\n(2) The pooling part is a bit confusing to me, in that it seems that the WALKPOOL indeed does not perform pooling but instead use pre-defined features, while pooling is usually for a set (of objects such as nodes) with varying numbe of elements. Can authors add more details of the pooling used in the SEAL and why WALKPOOL is considered a pooling scheme?\n  ",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper proposes a new link prediction method called WP, based on treating link prediction as a subgraph classification problem, where the link of interest is surrounded by the subgraph. Existing GNN architectures could be used for learning node embeddings. With node embeddings, a latent subgraph could be built using self-attention, where attention scores are used for computing the subgraph edge weights. With the latent subgraph, a set of features could be computed to be used as the features for the link of interest. The features will be used for subsequent link prediction. Essentially, the proposed WP method is a feature extractor for links (or its surrounding subgraph).",

The extract features somehow encodes path information which may be useful for link prediction.\n3. Comprehensive experiments are conducted.\n\nWeaknesses:\n1.

            "summary_of_the_review": "The paper proposes a pooling method (i.e., a latent structure feature extractor) for learning features that describe links (i.e., the surrounding subgraphs of the links). Building the latent subgraph from embeddings turns continuous information back to discrete graph space, which facilitates feature extraction. The framework remains end-to-end learnable. The extracted features summarizes multi-hop path information, which somehow reflect higher order structural information. Experiments on multiple real datasets are conducted.\n\nIn general, the paper proposes a neat idea with good experiment design. The current draft could be further improved by revising its Introduction section, as many claims are not clear and do not seem to motivate the method design. For example, Figure 1 does not provide much information about the idea. Also, I think the word \"topology\" does not well describe the proposed idea.",

The main idea is to jointly encode node representations and graph topology information into node features which could be learned in an end-to-end-manner. The proposed problem formulation is interesting: the transition probabilities to capture proximity among nodes are computed on top of a latent graph which is the outcome of an attention mechanism on node features. The proposed methodology is presented clearly. Besides, the authors have performed experiments on various graphs, and the performance of WalkPool is compared against state-of-the-art baseline models.",
            "main_review": "Strengths:\n- The paper provides an elegant formulation of the link prediction problem. The execution of the proposed methodology is also interesting.\n- The paper is clearly written, presenting the proposed model in a rigorous way but at the same time providing good motivation.\n- The experimental evaluation is quite thorough. \n\nWeaknesses:\n-\tLack experiments on benchmark (artificial) graphs. This could further increase our understanding of the functioning of the model\n-\tThe baseline models could be enhanced. Although the list is quite complete, some of the used models are not tailored for the link prediction task.\n\n**Detailed comments.**\n\nAs I mentioned above, I really enjoyed reading the paper. Despite building upon ideas presented in  SEAL, the formulation is interesting. Besides, the arguments made seem to be valid. Yet, some points are not very clear and need further elaboration. Next, I summarize key points related to the paper.\n\nTo begin with, although the paper uses standard benchmarks for link prediction, I would expect to have some experiments on artificial datasets in order to better understand the functioning of the model. As I can see, most of the networks used have really high clustering coefficient---which is not the case for the majority of real-world graphs. Having artificial networks where one could control ACC would be very helpful.\n\nIn the case of the absence of node attributes, the paper concatenates the outputs of the three-layer to obtain the final node representation. Aren’t the embeddings of the final layer enough for this? Please elaborate more on this aspect.\n\nAlthough spectral clustering has been widely used before, I think it is not an appropriate baseline for link prediction. I would rather be in favor of using other unsupervised feature learning models (e.g., LINE, NetMF).\n\nThe datasets used are quite small in terms of the number of nodes and edges, and there is no discussion about the running time of the proposed model. How does WalkPool’s running time compare against SEAL?\n\n",
