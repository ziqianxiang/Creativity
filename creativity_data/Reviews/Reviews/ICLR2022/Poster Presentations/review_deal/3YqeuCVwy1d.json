        "comment": "This paper proposes to use Anderson Acceleration on min-max problems, provides some theoretical convergence rates and presents numerical results on toy bilinear problems and GANs.\n\nAfter the discussion, the reviewers agreed that this paper makes a nice contribution to ICLR. Some concerns were originally expressed in terms of incrementality of the theoretical results with respect to previous work (KCYs, gBHU), but the authors have well clarified their contributions in the discussion, and have updated their manuscript accordingly. There were also initial concerns about the related work coverage, but this was also properly addressed in the rebuttal, with additional experimental comparisons as well as extended related work section, as well as an additional convergence result for convex-nonconcave problems."

            "main_review": "## Strengths: \n- The method is well motivated and the paper is well written. \n- The theoretical results are sound \n- The method seems to scale to GANs (when combined with Adam)\n\n## Weaknesses: \n- The comparison with the related work could be improved (see my detailed comment)\n\n\n\nI think the authors could discuss more the rates obtained in Thm 4.2 and Thm 4.1 and the standard rates obtained in the literature (e.g. the ones presented in Remark 4.2). For instance, a first step would be to stress that the value of $T_p(1 + x)$ has a closed-form solution (below Equation 21). Also, one could compute the Taylor expansion of $T_p(1 + x)$ when $x\\to 0$ to have an idea of the convergence speed. Looking at the formula below (21) It seems that you get an accelerated convergence rate (i.e. $\\rho(A)^{1/p} = 1 - O(1/\\sqrt{\\kappa})$. However, I am a bit surprised that you get this rate for $p=1$ because in that case, GDA-AM corresponds to Gradient Descent with line-search. Can you comment on the formula for the expression of the Chebyshev polynomial of degree p at the point $1+ \\frac{2}{\\kappa-1}$?\n \nFor the experiments (Fig 4): Azizian et al. 2020 use *positive* momentum + EG. I would be interested to see if SIM-AM still outperforms EG + *positive* momentum. Also, how did you tune the step size and the other hyper-parameters of the methods for the results obtained in figure 5?\nMoreover it seems counter intuitive since EG + positive momentum has a convergence rate of $\\rho(A)^{1/p} = 1 - O(1/\\sqrt{\\kappa})$\n\n## Summary of the Questions asked (by decreasing order of importance):\n1. Can you comment on the formula for the expression of the Chebyshev polynomial of degree p at the point $1+ \\frac{2}{\\kappa-1}$? It seems that your formula gives $\\rho(A)^{1/p} = 1 - O(1/\\sqrt{\\kappa})$ while for $p=1$ it should be $\\rho(A)^{1/p} = 1 - O(1/\\kappa)$ \n2. Can you compare your method with EG + positive momentum? (Empirically)\n3. Theorem 4.2 seems to give a convergence rate of $1 - O(1\\kappa)$  Do you agree with this statement? \n\n## Minor Question\nFrom my understanding, in order to get the theoretical guarantees you do not even need to use Anderson Mixing at each time step but only every p timesteps (and you only need to ensure that linear combination of $x_{t-i}$ can generate any polynomial of degree $p$ with coefficients that sums to 1).\nIs it why you analyze the algorithm every p step?\nWhat is the computational overhead (solving each timestep vs solving each p steps?) \nDo you consider this algorithm because it is more likely that it will extend beyond the least-square case?\n",

I think some more work could be done to compare the obtained rates with the ones already present in the literature but it should be relatively easy to implement.  Also, I have some concerns regarding the theory and the comparison with respect to the baselines.\n\nI will increase or decrease my score depending on how the authors address my comments. (for instance, if everything is clarified I will increase the technical and empirical novelty score as well as the final score) \n\nFor now, I recommend accepting this paper.\n",

The authors present the Anderson mixing technique and its link with GMRES, up to page 4. The claimed novelty begins at section 3: GDA-AM: GDA WITH ANDERSON MIXING. The author claim that  their work \"is the first work to improve the GDA dynamics by tapping into advanced fixed-point algorithms,\" although this idea was explicitly mentioned in a paper they cited: \n\n> ---\n> Recent work in optimization analysed adaptive algorithms, such as Anderson Acceleration (Walker and Ni, 2011), that are adaptive to the problem constants. They can be seen as an automatic way to find the optimal combination of the previous iterates.\n>\n> ---\n> Source: Azizian et al. (2020) , section 6.1.\n> \n\nIn the same paper, the authors refer to Scieur et al. (2016) and Bollapragada (2018) for the theoretical analysis of such a method. In particular, the result presented in Bollapragada et al. (2018) proposes an analysis of Anderson Acceleration for *any* nonsymmetric operator $\\textbf{G}$. They combine Theorem 3.1 (Crouzeix's bound) and Theorem 3.3. (optimal polynomial on ellipses from Fischer and Freund (1991), Th. 2), to obtain a general convergence bound. This result covers all the theoretical work presented in this paper.\n\nMoreover, it is surprising that the author did not use the Crouzeix's bound for their Theorem 4.2. In short, the Crouseix's bound says that when dealing with a nonsymmetric matrix $\\textbf{G}$ and polynomials $P_2$, we have \n\n$$\n|| P(G) ||_2 \\leq c \\max\\_{\\lambda\\in W(\\textbf{G})}  ||P(\\lambda) ||_2,\n$$\nwhere $W(\\textbf{G})$ is the *numerical range* of the matrix $\\textbf{G}$, and $c$ is a constant, bounded by $2$ (Crouzeix's conjecture) and proven to be upper bounded by $1+\\sqrt{2}$. In particular, it is unclear how the authors manage to prove the inequality (last display equation in the proof of Theorem B.2) (I removed the other details to focus on the important part)\n$$\n\\min \\_{f_p\\in\\mathcal{P}_p} ||f_p(\\textbf{G}) || \\leq \\left(\\frac{r}{p}\\right)^p\n$$\nwithout using the Crouseix's bound, as $\\textbf{G}$ is not symmetric.\n\n\nThat said, the numerical experiments are persuasive, but the paper should be presented in a whole other way to include the missing related work. I strongly recommend the author rework the paper and submit it to another venue, as Anderson mixing could positively impact the optimization of min-max problems.",
            "summary_of_the_review": "Because the original idea of the paper was briefly introduced in Azizian et al. (2020), but more importantly, because the theoretical results presented in this paper are already covered in Bollapragada (2018), I am not convinced the paper is novel enough to be published. Moreover, I have a concern about a detail in the proof of Theorem 2.",
