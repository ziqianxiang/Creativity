The extensive evaluation in several environments shows the benefit of the algorithm.\n\nThe consensus among the reviewers, and I concur, that the paper proposes an interesting and novel method. It is cleanly presented, and well-founded. The evaluations across range of environments, including robot manipulation validate the method.\n\nDuring the rebuttal, the authors provided additional evaluation, added a discussion on the latent MDPs, and made numerous clarification, addressing most / all reviewers' questions."

            "main_review": "\nStrengths\n---------\n\n-   An interesting approach to the problem of learning from action-less\n    experience. The three part procedure of estimating latent actions\n    with EM, doing Q-learning with the learned actions and using the\n    value function on downstream tasks is promising and seems new.\n\n-   The theoretical arguments that underpin the proposed method are\n    mostly well thought out. There are some confusing parts, that I\n    detail below, but I do think the overall approach is correct and the\n    theory cleanly motivates the proposed algorithm.\n\nWeaknesses\n----------\n\n-   The significance of the contribution is unclear. This is in part due\n    to the obscure nature of the problem (of learning with action-less\n    experience), partly because the related work is not well\n    contextualized earlier in the paper and partly due to the\n    experimental evaluation.\n\n-   The experiments, while somewhat comprehensive, are not particularly\n    compelling. The results are mostly evaluated using correlation of\n    the learned value function and on downstream tasks, both of which\n    makes assessing the overall effectiveness difficult without\n    extensive ablation. It is not clear to me that correlation is a good\n    performance criterion in this case. Furthermore, the results on\n    downstream tasks are mostly inconclusive with overlapping confidence\n    intervals.\n\nDetailed Comments\n-----------------\n\n-   In Section 1 Paragraph 2, you motivate the method by stating that\n    the learned value function can be helpful in many downstream tasks,\n    including control. This is true, but the state-value function can be\n    learned without actions already. The paragraph does not communicate\n    the advantage of learning the action-value function with imputed\n    actions instead of the state-value function.\n\n-   Section 1, Paragraph 3 \"Thus, the central technical question is how\n    to learn a good value function from undirected observation streams.\"\n\n    Sentences such as the one above should specify \"action-value\"\n    function, because, as I mentioned above, a state-value function can\n    be directly learned. This is partially addressed in the rest of\n    paragraph 3 and in Section 3, but to say that Q-learning without\n    actions is policy evaluation seems incorrect. Q-learning cannot be\n    applied without actions, unless you impute the actions. A\n    state-value function can still be learned using TD learning, which\n    seems like the point that is being made in this paragraph.\n\n-   Section 3, Regarding the choice of 4x - ground truth. Is balancing\n    the actions in the larger set important? If one action is repeated\n    15 times and the other ground truth actions are only repeated 1\n    times, would that make the problem harder? Another more pressing\n    issue is if the actions are not a refinement, such as if only two\n    latent actions are permitted. This is more relevant in practice,\n    where we may not know the right action space apriori.\n\n-   \"For downstream decision making, we only care about\n\nthe relative ordering of state values.\"\n\nI don't understand this statement. For downstream tasks the relative\nordering of the action-values is the pertinent quantity, but I don't\nthink an ordering of state-values is meaningful. Since this is the\nprimary reason for using spearman's rank correlation, I do not see how\nmeasuring correlation would be a useful measure of success.\n\n-   How is correlation being measured exactly? And is this truly the\n    measure of success? If correlation is used to overcome some constant\n    bias in the state-values, then this implicitly assumes that the bias\n    is uniform across states which may not be the case. Learning\n    action-value functions offline leads to many issues in the quality\n    of the value predictor which may not manifest itself in the control\n    policy (such as divergent action-values for out-of-sample or\n    out-of-distribution actions).\n\n-   Ground truth actions are said to be an upper bound on the\n    performance of your method, but in Table 1 for Kitchen manipulation\n    the proposed method outperforms this upper bound. How is this to be\n    interpreted in light of the stability comments in footnote 2? Based\n    on footnote 2, it seems like the value function should be constant\n    and not change between runs (i.e. shouldn't the correlation should\n    be 1?).\n\n-   The results on downstream tasks would benefit from TD0 as a\n    baseline. While the value function learned is the value of the\n    behavior policy (and not the optimal value function), it could still\n    be used for all three settings (densified, embodiment transfer and\n    guiding low level controllers).\n\n-   Figure 4: while this does demonstrate improvement in the grid world\n    setting, there is no significant difference between the methods in\n    the other 2d navigation or freeway. Also, the difference in\n    asymptotic performance in gridworld is strange. Shouldn't all\n    methods eventually reach the optimal policy?\n\n-   Putting the related work at the end of the paper prevents\n    much-needed context for the proposed methods. The introduction does\n    a good job of stating what you are doing, but the question of why is\n    less clear.\n\nMinor Comments\n--------------\n\n-   Page 4 , Line 3: ammounts -\\> amounts",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper focuses on the problem of learning from an offline batch of data containing only states and rewards (no actions). A theoretical result shows when we can expect to recover the true optimal value function when using a different action space. This motivates the algorithm Latent Action Q-learning (LAQ), which first learns a discrete action space by modeling one-step transitions and then applies Q-learning with the learned action space. Experiments in a variety of settings, including reward-shaping and planning with low-level controllers, validate the effectiveness of the approach. ",
            "main_review": "Main points:\n- I find the introduction to be well-written  and the motivation for this problem to be compelling. In particular, the idea that the same collected data could be used for different types of agents/embodiments is appealing to me, with potentially many practical use-cases.\n\n- For the theoretical result, I find that the conditions needed to satisfy theorem 3.1 may be too stringent. If I understand correctly, it amounts to assuming that the new action set $\\hat{A}$ contains all the actions of the original $A$, with possible duplicates. So, it does not allow other actions in $\\hat{A}$ that are different than those already in $A$, which is very restrictive. Essentially, it seems to say that we need to obtain exactly the same actions in $A$.\nI would find the theorem to be more meaningful if it allowed other actions in $\\hat{A}$ at least, with perhaps a different conclusion. Adding new actions to $\\hat{A}$ that are functionally different than those in $A$ may increase the optimal values in the general case, but maybe something more specific can be said under different conditions.\nAnother possible extension to the theorem would be to prove the necessity of the refinement assumption i.e. something like, if the optimal values in the two MDPs match, then one action space is a refinement of the other.\n\n- The experiments were well done with approppriate baselines being chosen and a reasonable choice of environments. The variety of different evaluations to assess the method was welcome. I appreciated the experiments which tried to directly assess the quality of the learned value functions instead of only indirectly doing so with overall performance numbers. \n- I liked the experiments with changing the embodiments of the agent. I haven't exactly this kind of experiment before and it seems to me that it could be applicable to certain practical scenarios. \n- Planning with low-level controllers was also interesting and did a good job showcasing the strengths of the proposed approach.\n\nQuestions and suggestions:\n- One aspect that confuses me is that the proposed algorithm is used to learn an action space but afterwards, this new action space is hardly used except to run Q-learning and obtain state-value functions. It seems like there should be an oppportunity to make more use of the learned action space. From an intuitive standpoint, it's not very clear to me why learning an action space is a good approach for action-less data. \n\n- Following up on the previous point, LAQ obtains a state-value function in the end, which can be used in various ways. LAQ also learns a one-step model as an intermediate step before doing Q-learning with the new actions. Have you considered trying to learn the state-value function directly as an alternate approach? This could be done using value iteration on the state-values with the learned model. \n\n- Did you try to interpret the learned actions at all? Do they seem to match the base actions or are they completely different?\n\n- Can you clarify what the clustering approaches are? I did not see any explanations about how they are used.\n\n- In Freeway, behaviour cloning seems to be performing the best. Why is that? Also, is there missing a green line extending from it for behaviour cloning + RL?\n\n- In table 1, how exactly is the Spearman correlation computed? Is it calculated using state-value functions on a batch of data? Or is it using state-action value functions? How is the batch of data selected?\n\n- Fig 4 plots are not clear. Is there learning in the actual environment? If that is the case, are batch RL methods used then? \nAre they first used to initialize the method and then continue learning?\n\n- In section 5, the term \"state-conditioned purity\" is introduced but then it isn't explained in the later sections (only in the appendix). I suggest clarifying this in the main text or moving that entire discussion to the appendix.\n\n- The (theoretical) limitation of LAQ to deterministic MDPs is quite strong. While there's a small discussion included in the text, have you done any experiments trying it out in stochastic MDPs? Perhaps it can do reasonably well anyway.\n\n- I would clarify that the word \"refinement\" in this paper is defined to be something specific and doesn't have a standard meaning. This isn't clear right now in the abstract or the introduction. I was confused since \"refinement\" is related to a set being a subset of another in mathematics.",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper studies the offline reinforcement learning problem based only on trajectories without actions. That is, given a set of experiences of the form $(s_t, r_t, s_{t+1})$, how might a learning algorithm proceed? The paper takes care in motivating the problem, both from a conceptual perspective (we might not know the action interface of an agent), and technically (there is good reason we might have access to such trajectories of experience, and learning seems feasible). Given this setting, the paper's main focus is twofold: First, to establish a simple variant of Q-learning that is well-behaved under this learning problem. This motivates Theorem 3.1/Lemma 3.2, which in turn inform the design of Latent Action Q-Learning (LAQ). Then, the second focus of the paper is on exploring the behavior of LAQ in a variety of domains and settings. The experiments are spread across five distinct environments of different kinds (gridworlds, Atari's Freeway, and so on), and each experiment examines a different characteristic of learning. ",
            "main_review": "I found the problem setting to be both technically and conceptually interesting. In addition to its motivation, I found the paper well written and easy to read overall. Ideas are introduced carefully (with the small exception of some details in Lemma 3.2), and I believe this paper will be broadly accessible to the RL community. The two presented theoretical results are quite compelling in their own right, if quite natural in hindsight. Some of the claims made (the paragraph headers in the experimental section) seemed too strong given the data. For instance, in the paragraph \"LAQ value functions allow transfer across embodiments\", it is stated that \"LAQ-densified rewards functions, speed-up learning and consistently guide to higher reward solutions than sparse task rewards, or D3G\". Looking at Figure 5, the confidence intervals are large enough that I believe it would be difficult to definitively conclude that orange strictly outperforms purple. I don't believe the overlapping intervals detracts from the paper, but I do believe that the paper would be stronger if such claims were of appropriate strength given the data.\n\nI have no major concerns about the paper, and only one primary question. I include several writing suggestions below. I am not intimately familiar with state-only learning in RL, so unless this idea has already been examined elsewhere in the literature, I believe this paper is ready for publication (pending a few changes suggested below, and any other reservations that other reviewers might have).\n\n**Major Comments/Questions**.\n- [Q.1] In the discrete action case, it was unclear to me whether $n$ is known. That is, the number of actions in the true environmental model. This seems important for determining how to perform the latent action inference.\n- [C.1] Including the pseudocode for LAQ would benefit the paper a lot.\n\n**Minor Questions**\n- Does Lemma 3.2 quantify over stochastic policies, or only deterministic ones? Ah, in looking at the proof in the appendix, it seems that these are necessarily _stochastic policies_. It would be helpful to state this explicitly in the Lemma in the main text.\n\n**Writing Suggestions**\n- An extremely minor point, but I consider $(s,a,r,s')$ to be such a canonical ordering that the initial $(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1}, r_t)$ read oddly to me.\n- \"bellman equation\" --> \"Bellman equation\"\n- It would be helpful to define \"refinement\" formally. So, use a definition block and state it precisely.\n- I found the idea of a \"fundamental action\" to be quite sharp and added a lot of clarity to thinking about the proof. It is not strictly necessary, but if you found a way to make space, it might be nice to include a brief proof sketch for Lemma 3.2 in the main paper that highlights this idea.\n- \"induce same value in every state\" --> \"induce the same value in every state\n- \"in 2 ways.\" --> \"in two ways.\"\n- In the \"Experimental Setup\" paragraph, we move to using $o$ in place of $s$. I did not quite understand this move, and would suggest sticking with $s$.\n- \"in 5 representative environments\" --> \"in five representative environments\"\n\n(Appendix)\n- \"at at most\" --> \"at most\"\n- \"be a functions which\" --> \"be functions which\"\n- I did not quite understand this: \"we know a sum over action in each fundamental action\", but perhaps changing to the following will help: \"we know a sum over fundamental actions\"\n- A minor point, but many equations in the appendix do not have punctuation. I would recommend adding commas and periods to equations where appropriate.\n- In Proof of Theorem 3.1: \"First, is the case where\" --> \"In the first case,\"\n- This is just personal taste, but I prefer $\\neg \\exists$ notation to $\\not \\exists$ (I am referring to Theorem A.1)",

There seem to be two issues: unobserved action, but \"same embodiment\", or unobserved actions and even allowing for different embodiments. It may well be that what is correctly addressed is the second case, but it would be helpful to at least discern the two things in the discussion.\n\nThe defi of \"refinement\" seems central so why put this in inline text, not as a Definition? And the inline formulation itself is very hard to parse, I think the second part of the sentence is somewhat incomplete. When continuing reading, it seems like \"refinement\" is formalized\n\nWhere is the value function V defined? This should be done explicitly in sec2.\n\nRegarding Theorem 1:\n\nIt would also help to motivate this better -- it seems that this theorem should motivate the subsequent algorithm. Personally, I would have expected a more principled result as the basic theorem in the sense of \"to what extent is the true MDP recoverable from just the given data.
