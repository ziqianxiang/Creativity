        "comment": "Realizing the fact that cross-entropy loss and focal loss are widely used for training deep learning models but mathematical understanding and exploration for such losses are lacking, the authors propose a simple framework named PolyLoss to express the loss function as a linear combination of polynomial functions. \n\nIn this framework, the aforementioned cross-entropy loss and focal loss are the special cases of PolyLoss by easily adjusting the importance of different polynomial bases depending on the targeting tasks and datasets. The final version of PolyLoss, Poly-1 formulation, is simple with one line of code and an extra hyperparameter but outperforms the cross-entropy loss and focal loss on 2D image classification, instance segmentation, object detection, and 3D object detection tasks, sometimes by a large margin.\n\nThis paper is well-motivated by a novel perspective of polynomial expansion. The proposed method is novel, simple to implement, and effective in practice. The authors have a deep and thorough discussion with reviewers, and most concerns were well addressed. After rebuttal and discussion, reviewers increased their scores, and all agreed with acceptance. AC checked the paper and all relevant information, and found sufficient ground for acceptance."

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper analyzes the cross-entropy loss and focal loss through the polynomial expansion perspective. Further, this paper proposes a family of loss functions called PloyLoss. Three instances of PloyLoss are analyzed and obtain the final version as ploy-1. Detailed and extensive experiments are provided.",
            "main_review": "## Strengths\n(1) The polynomial expansion perspective is interesting and the PloyLoss makes sense.\n\n(2) Extensive experiments are provided and further produce some findings. \n\n(3) The proposed loss function can improve various tasks: image classification, instance segmentation, and 3D object detection.\n\n## Weaknesses\n(1) surprisingly, the final version of PloyLoss is Ploy-1. I think this final version is trivial. Does this mean the high-order items are useless? I understand the results of $L_{Drop}$ in Figure 2(a), but I still think the poor results of the low-order loss function are because of the bad coefficient tuning. So can you provide the following versions for comparison?\n- L1 loss with hyper-parameter tuning. (Drop the CE part in the Ploy-1.)\n- L1 and L2 loss with the hyper-parameter tuning.\n\n(2) Because this paper proposes a general loss family, the exploration is still insufficient. There are many variables of the PloyLoss family, such as the coefficient (particularly analysis in this paper), the start order ($\\gamma$ in Focal loss), and the coefficient decay strategy.\n- CE and focal loss only provides one kind of coefficient organization strategy as the logarithmic function. What about others? For example, the exponential decay for the coefficients.\n\n(3) The name is misleading for $L_{ploy-1}$ in image classification and $L_{ploy-1}$ in object detection since they use different base loss functions (CE and focal respectively). \n\n(4) It seems like some errors in the label of the y-axis in Figure 2(b).",

Considering both the experiments, motivation, and the final method, I would like to rank this paper as 5. I am positive about this paper, but more experiments and clarification are expected.\n\nAfter rebuttal, most of my concerns are addressed. Thus, I raise the rank to 6.",

Motivated by this insight, the paper expresses the loss function as a linear combination of polynomial functions and shows that cross-entropy loss and focal loss are special cases. \nThen inspired by Taylor expansion, the paper proposes a polynomial loss function, called PolyLoss.\nThe final version $\\text{Poly}-1$ is with first-order. \n\n\n- **Experiments**.

While loss functions could be expressed in the form of Taylor expansions, the fact that the polynomial coefficients would have to be fine-tuned in order to obtain further performance improvements introduces even more hyper-parameters for in model giving even more room for possible overfitting. Moreover, the claimed improvements are only marginally higher than the chosen baselines.
