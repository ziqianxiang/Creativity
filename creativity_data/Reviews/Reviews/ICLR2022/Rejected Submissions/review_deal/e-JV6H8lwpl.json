            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes a new system identification and model predictive control method based on neural networks for non-linear dynamical systems. The basic idea behind the proposed method comes from subspace identification for linear systems. In this sense, the proposed method can be regarded as a non-linear extension of subspace identification by deep neural networks.",
            "main_review": "This paper proposes a non-linear extension of subspace identification and model predictive control. The idea of estimating the latent state vector $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}}_t$ using the bottleneck structure of estimator and predictor networks seems reasonable. The result of the experiment on a toy problem shows the proposed method works.\n\nI have several comments and questions as follows.\n\n1. While this study focuses on the system identification of non-linear systems based on the subspace identification, other recent works on learning non-linear dynamical systems using deep neural networks such as KVAE and Deep State Space Models should be referred as related works.\n\n2. The authors conducted a case study on cascaded tanks system which is a simple low-dimensional non-linear system. It is illustrative, but I think they should start with some linear systems and linear networks and show that the obtained result is equivalent to that of ordinary subspace identification and MPC. That would justify their claim in a straightforward manner.\n\n3. In the training process, the system is provided with random input sequence in Eq.(24). I wonder if it is possible in general. What if the system becomes unstable due to some inadequate inputs ? Is there a way of \"safe\" training ?\n\n4. In the case study, Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is used solve the optimization in MPC. Is LM applicable to other systems in general ?\n\n5. In Figure 2, estimated state vector $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}}_t$ should be also shown and compared with actual state $\\boldsymbol{x}_t$. I am curious how $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}}_t$ looks like and different from $\\boldsymbol{x}_t$ due to the non-linear mapping.\n\n6. Is the proposed method applicable to more high-dimensional non-linear systems ?  For example, can it perform system identification and MPC of a non-linear system using a sequence of images as observation ?\n\n\n",

The  discussion added here about the linear case is trivial, and hardly counts as a theoretical analysis, as the authors are claiming. As for 'Theorems' 1, 2, they are trivial and cannot be claimed as theorem. I mean the statement ' if the system is observable, then an observer exists', is hardly a Theorem !\n\nI keep wondering how a dynamical system, i.e., and observer and predictor, can be approximated by a static mapping ? ! \nIn other words, can you prove that your observer converges asymptotically (over time beyond your training time span) to the true state, for a set of initial conditions ? this is a very basic property of any observer, in the sense on control theory, and if you do not have this 'robustness' w.r.t. state initial conditions, then this is merely and open loop identification problem, or model reduction, or give it any name you want, but do not call it state estimation problem.\n\nI think this is even clear from your toy example, where there are no tests showing that if you start the simulation from several different initial conditions for the states, you still converge to the true state trajectories.",
