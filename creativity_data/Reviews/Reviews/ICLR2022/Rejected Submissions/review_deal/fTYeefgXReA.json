This is not the first work to study equivariant graph neural network, discussion of important related work is missing, such as:\n\nE(n) Equivariant graph neural network, ICML 2021\n\nDespite of the difference in equivariant operation design, I do not think this work is novel and the combination of numerous equivariant operations is not a significant contribution. \n\nIn addition, the experiments should be improved. First, since this model involves different types of equivariant operations, it is necessary to study the impacts of different operations (ablation study). Second, according to Table 2/3, the performance of proposed model is worse than the best baseline methods for many cases, raising the concern of model effectiveness. Third, the authors mentioned hypergraphs in Section 6, while not experiments support this extended model. \n\nMinor issues also exist, such as typo. For example, the first sentence of section 4.2 should be: for the task of link prediction... ",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The focus of this paper is in the design of GNNs that are amenable to operate on heterogeneous graphs --- that is, networks where relationships can be of different types. Current methods do not account for these different types of edges, or reduce everything to the same graph --- thereby loosing valuable information. \n\nIn this case, the heterogeneous graph is modelled as a collection of node-node adjacency matrices, one for each edge type. The additional desiderata that they add here is that  that the GNNs that they seek must be invariant or equivariant to permutations of nodes (depending on whether we're doing node level or graph level predictions). For heterogeneous graphs, this invariance or equivariance constraint is to permutations within each node type (eg, within authors, or venues). To build a repository of linear operations that verify these properties, the authors simply enumerate them.",
            "main_review": "Pros:\n- The performance is impressive for edge prediction. Not that this is not the case for node prediction. Experiments do not show a statistically significant improvement in the node classification task over H-GCN.\n-The authors do a nice job at formalizing the types linear mapping that they allow, and stating the desiderata of GNNs in terms of relative exchangeability of nodes.\nCons:\n- The authors do not test their method fully.  It would have been interesting to test the method a little more through artificial datasets, allowing the authors to control the ground truth --- would they have then been able to state why their method was so much more impressive on PubMed? Does it have to do with the sparsity of the graph? Or the number of different edges as they posit? More insights based on the limitations and ideal use case of this method would be useful. As such, the paper does not address any fundamental questions on the deployability of the method.\n- The results on PubMed do look a little suspicious --- the authors do say so themselves, so this is not necessarily a con, but more of an axis of reflexion: I wonder how this could be explained. Could it be the case that the network is really overfitting? It would have been interesting to list the complexities (in terms of the number of parameters) of the different methods. The splitting of the network in test and training set is completely artificial in the GNN literature ---  it's all on the same network, so as long as we're doing message-passing, this seems really artificial, and not providing what we want to achieve by splitting the data into training and testing. What we need is an estimate of \"out-of-sample\" error or risk. I suppose the method here is not inductive, and cannot be applied to a new node, so we're stuck....Unless we try out methods in the spirit of [1], and we subsample neighborhood or subnetworks within our large graph, fit the Neural Network parameters based on empirical loss functions such as [1]? The authors could also have done ablation studies, and perturbation studies (maybe these could give indications towards overfitting?).\n\n[1] Veitch, Victor, et al. \"Empirical risk minimization and stochastic gradient descent for relational data.\" The 22nd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics.

The paper proposes a model and details the various operations under which it maintains the equivariance property. \n2. It goes on to show that all linear maps that satisfy the invariance property can be made from the given set of operations. \n3. In addition, it also shows that the neural networks are highly expressive.\n4. Results for link prediction tasks (particularly for PubMed is pretty impressive).\n\n## Weaknesses:\n1. Proposed novelty is marginal in the light of existing prior works.\n2. The results are not as impressive for node classification and in link prediction, it falls behind significantly for Last FM.\n3. There is no explanation given for these phenomenon. I would encourage the authors to add explanation as to why an expressive GNN with equivariance property is not able to leverage itself better for node classification and on the Last FM dataset.\n\nIn light of the above, I am inclined to rate this marginally below acceptance threshold.",

Also, most reviewers also have identified that some of the experiment results are very positive and encouraging as well.\n\nHowever, limited novelty is a point that most other reviewers have also raised. I also noticed that they requested for additional baseline comparisons which seems like a fair request. Also, the performance of the model doesn't seem to be stable, sometimes its good and in some cases, it much worse and there doesn't seem to be any reasonable explanation for the same.
