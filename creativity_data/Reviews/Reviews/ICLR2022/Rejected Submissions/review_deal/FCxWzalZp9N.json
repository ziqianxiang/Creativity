The strengths of this paper is that the writing is clear and easy to understand. The structure of this paper is ok. The weakness is that the idea is simple and not novel enough. In addition, the experiments cannot verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.",
            "summary_of_the_review": "The proposed AF2 tries to solve HSR aerial imagery semantic segmentation by making use of multi-scale representations. The whole  Adaptive Focus Framework (AF2) is simple, including Hierarchical features extractor, Preliminary predictor and Adaptive confidence mechanism for prediction selection (ACM).  \nAs the first two modules are popular in semantic segmentation and other related works, the main contribution of this work is the proposed ACM, which judges whether the prediction for each pixel is sufficiently confident or not in each level.  But actually, the proposed ACM is simple lacking novelty. The experiments in this work cannot verify the effectiveness of proposed method solidly. In Table 1, AF2-AFPN brings slightly better performance compared with PointFlow. On Potsdam, its performance is even worse. For general segmentation benchmark, only SFPN method is reported and compared, but in PointFlow, it has mIoU 80.3% on Cityscape. \n\nAll in all, i think this paper is not novel and solid enough to be accepted by ICLR.\n ",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes a hierarchical segmentation procedure for aerial imagery semantic segmentation. The proposed method adaptively filters pixels in each scale representation by dynamically adjusting the filtering confidence to decide pixels will be segmented by the next level. Experiments have shown the proposed method can boost existing model architectures' performance to achieve SotA on several datasets.",
            "main_review": "1. To my understanding, this paper essentially proposes a new strategy to merge multi-scale predictions, by choosing the high-confidence output of earlier levels, and passing low-confidence output to downstream levels. Similar strategy could be seen as early as Viola-Jones cascade classifier, but in the domain of semantic segmentation, I do not remember seeing similar design, so in that sense this paper does have some small novelty, though it's incremental.\n\n2. That said, the ideas of merging multi-scale predictions in semantic segmentation have already been studied in many existing work, from the early FCN [1], to more focused studies on this such as [2] and [3]. The proposed AF2 can be considered a hand-crafted strategy to decide which output scale to take, which could be better than naive method like average-pooling, but I'm not convinced it will work better than learnable attention such as in [2].\n\n   2.1. Even comparing to max-pooling, it's possible that AF2 will settle on one class in early scale after passing the threshold, but later scale may reveal an even higher confidence from a different class.\n\n   2.2. The main problem of the paper is it failed to compare to any of these multi-scale merging strategy. For example, [2] claimed the attention method can boost baseline model result by 6%, which is higher than AF2's boost on AFPN (these are not really comparable due to different settings, but I meant the paper should have a fair comparison on this aspect).\n\n   - [1] Fully Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation, CVPR 2015\n\n   - [2] Attention to Scale: Scale-aware Semantic Image Segmentation, CVPR 2016\n\n   - [3] Hierarchical Multi-Scale Attention for Semantic Segmentation, 2020\n\n3. Besides, a few other issues or questions of the paper:\n\n   3.1. The paper highlights the \"adaptive\" threshold and claims top-k won't be effective on aerial images, but there is no experiment designed specifically to validate how much improvements the adaptive mechanism can bring over baselines like fixed threshold or top-k.\n\n   3.2. How is the \"soft update factor\" in Eq.(3) decided?\n\n   3.3. Is r set to a fixed value for experiments on all datasets?\n\n   3.4. In Sec. 4.3, the paper states \"This hierarchical prediction method is independent to the proportion of foreground and background and thus can effectively solve the problems existed in the previous method.\" - I don't understand the logic here. I agree the hierarchical design is independent to the foreground/background ratio, but then how can it also help solving imbalance issue if they're independent?",
            "summary_of_the_review": "The paper proposed a method to selectively merge multi-scale predictions, but failed to compare to any other methods aiming for similar goal (e.g. max-pooling, attention).
