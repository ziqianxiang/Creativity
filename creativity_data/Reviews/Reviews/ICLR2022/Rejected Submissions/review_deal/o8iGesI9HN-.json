        "comment": "The paper introduces a convolutional-like operator called optimized separable convolution, which scales well in the number of channels, C. The paper studies the classification performance of ResNet with the optimized separable convolution, and with other choices of the convolutional operators. The paper finds the introduced convolutional  operator to be more parameter efficient than competing operators, however only by a relatively small margin, and this also comes at the cost of computational performance. \n\nThe reviewers appreciated that the proposed convolutional operation is more parameter efficient and that any improvement in convolutional networks potentially benefits a large array of methods and tools. The reviewers  criticize that the operation only offers marginal gains at the cost of slower runtimes, and agree that the contribution is only marginally significant and therefore below the acceptance threshold.\n\nI agree with the reasoning of the reviewers that the extra computational cost is not worth the marginal improvement, and therefore recommend to reject the paper. Also, the authors didn't respond to the comments of the reviewers and their reasonable questions."

It would be interesting to see this evaluated.\n- The work shows improvement in common Cifar and ImageNet benchmarks.\n- Satisfying the volumetric receptive field criteria was an interesting addition.\n\nCons:\n- The paper is overall somewhat difficult to follow and could benefit from improved explanations throughout.\n- The paper should have discussed attributes of efficient models beyond just FLOPS and params, such as memory overhead, FLOP vs memory balancing (which seperable convolutions often suffer from), etc.\n- The paper could benefit from more advanced network evaluations.\n\nWhile I found the proposals by the authors to be appealing, I personally found the paper difficult to read, and would encourage the authors to further improve explanations of concepts and overall paper flow, as it was rather difficult to follow at times.",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The convolution operator is the fundamental unit of most modern DNNs. This paper summarizes the existing (efficient) convolution operators and formulates an optimization problem to choose a few important parameters for the convolution. The authors show that their convolution under certain constraints requires fewer parameters and operations compared to the commonly used operators. They evaluate their proposed operator on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and on ImageNet.",
            "main_review": "==== Weaknesses ====\n\nThis work seems more to be a structured analysis for motivating spatial separable and grouped convolutions and a careful way for determining the groups. \n\nIt seems a bit misleading to call this operator optimal, since the problem described is not completely the general case for convolutions. The channels are fixed in the intermediate convolutions and there are many other factors that could be introduced, such as spatial grouping factors or dilation factors in all dimensions. However, analytically and empirically this does seem like a good guide for setting the hyperparameters for spatial, grouped convolutions.\n\nThere are recent related works that should be included in the paper that deal with determining the groups in convolutions. \"Differential Learning to Group Channels ...\" (ICCV19) discusses an end-to-end way to determine these group factor. It would be interesting to compare how an empirical method like this compares with your analytical method. \"Fully Learnable Group Convolution ... \"(CVPR19) proposes a similar fully learnable group convolution. I believe the CondenseNets (CVPR18) may also have a learned group convolution. I understand that your method is more than just determining the number of groups, but especially in the '-o' case, not '-so', it seems the major contribution is the group number.\n\nComputational complexity does not seem to be the most important metric here, since complexity usually deals with limit behavior. Many of these values, especially g and K, and usually small.\n\nIt would be helpful to fill out the curves more on the CIFAR comparisons, either though more layers or wider networks.\n\nSubfigures a and b on Figure 3 and 4 seem mostly redundant since as mentioned in the paper they should be multiples of HW from each other. Also, the saddle point figure does not add much to the paper.\n\nIt seems most results are '-o', not '-so', which I interpret as not having the factored spatial component. I could be wrong on this, so please correct me. In that case, then then both the first and second convolution would have the full spatial components (e.g., 3x3) and this seems fundamentally different than a 'dsep' convolution since the spatial aggregation is much higher. This is like a higher spatial gamma factor (as opposed to the channel gamma introduced in the conditions).\n\nThe evaluation section especially on ImageNet could use more modern efficient architectures, like MobileNetV2 or EfficientNetV2 or others. Also, the experiments are interesting comparing depthwise to optimized, but it seems like all the of architectures are custom.\n\nThe takeaway from Table 4 and the ablation study about channel fusion seems fairly well-documented already in papers like ShuffleNet (CVPR18), Unitary Group Convolutions (CVPR19), and Interleaved Group Convolutions (CVPR17). This last work actually proposes a two-factored convolution that may serve as a reasonable comparison for this optimized convolution.\n\n\n==== Strengths ====\n\nThis paper is very applicable since most efficient models include some grouped or factored or sparse convolutions. \n\nDiscussion of the trivial or degenerate cases help build better understanding of the problem, e.g. degenerate scaling operation.\n\nTable 1 was a useful summary of existing methods.\n\nThe appendix included useful discussions on inference time.\n\n\n==== Questions ====\n\nWhat are the tradeoffs for these factored convolutions? The more factored convolutions (i.e. as N increases) seem to decrease the representational capacity. When would N > 2 be useful?\n\nI'm a little confused when the results including the spatially factored convolutions in the results and when they don't. This confusion comes from the first paragraph of Section 3, when it discusses 'o-' and '-so'. \n\nAutoML was mentioned in the conclusion. How do these operators compare to those returned by a traditional AutoML procedure where the groups and K factors were learnable?\n\nDo any architectures or previous work already combine spatial and group convolutions?\n",
            "summary_of_the_review": "I believe this paper provides an interesting analysis suggesting how to configure the hyperparameters in efficient convolutional operators. The novelty from my reading of the paper was mostly confined to the analysis and conclusions around group number. I thought there were some key areas of related works missing, and the evaluation section was promising but a bit underwhelming relying mostly on CIFAR and custom ResNet models. Overall, I would argue that this paper should be a borderline reject.",

The proposed method extend common separable convolutions to more generalized & improved separable convolution.\n2.\tIt demonstrated that generalized separable methods surpassed previous convolution methods in performance with a small number of parameters compared with existing separable methods.\n3.    They have studied concrete analysis for flop's complexities. This supports that their approach is optimal among group separable convolutions.\n\nCons.\n1.\tThe arguments about ad hoc design are self-contradictory. The introduction section mentioned that \"Instead of setting these hyperparameters in an ad hoc fashion, we design a novel and principled scheme.\" However, in the experiment section, it seems that optimal separable methods also require hyperparameter (namely, overlap coefficient) tuning to obtain the best results.\n2.\tThe authors claimed that by introducing the proposed convolution, the model size could be reduced. However, we can observe from Table 3 that model size is reduced by 0.1M (approximately 3 percent). This is a bit incremental even they achieved 1% accuracy up.\n3.\tIn appendix section E, we can see that the GPU inference time of the proposed method is slower than other methods. To explain such a disadvantage, the authors say that PyTorch's implementation of group convolution is inefficient. However, it is believed that whenever group convolution is implemented in an efficient manner when considering the architecture of GPU, one-by-one convolution is the most memory-efficient design choice compared to other design choices, including group convolution.\n",
