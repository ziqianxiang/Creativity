        "comment": "PAPER: This paper presents analysis of cross-modal interactions in multimodal models and propose a method to help balance the multimodal learning process. The cross-modal analysis is based on measures related to conditional utilization rate and the proposed approach is related to conditional learning speed.\nDISCUSSION: The reviewers showed support for this line of research, as a way to better understand the learning process for multimodal models. The discussion allowed to identify points that needed to be clarify and concerns about the experimental results. The authors addressed many of these issues in their response. All reviewers took the time to read these responses as well as other reviews. There are many reviewers who are still expressing concerns with the experimental results. \nSUMMARY: This is an important line of research, and the authors should continue this research endeavor. While the paper presents some interesting research hypotheses about multimodal learning, it seems that more experiments are needed to properly address these hypotheses. In its current form, the paper may not yet be ready for publication."

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper investigates the modality greediness of learning in multi-modal deep neural networks (DNNs). The authors hypothesize that multi-modal DNNs learn to rely on one of input modalities (it could learn faster), which is expressed as a “greedy\" behavior. \nThe greediness is quantified with the difference between conditional utilization rate between modalities.\nThey claim the followings: (1) conditional utilization rate can be surrogated with conditional learning speed, (2) the strong regularization in the training process encourages the greediness, and (3) the greedy behavior often lowers generalization performances. \nAs a remedy of performance decreasing phenomena, they propose balanced multi-modal learning methods, which control the training speeds of all of modalities to be within certain criterion via giving more steps considering the log-ratio of sum of the magnitudes of gradients of loss functions between of fusion model parameters and of unimodal model parameters.\nThe paper provides experimental results to validate their claims and the effectiveness of the proposed methods.\n",
            "main_review": "* Strengths\n  - The greedy behaviors among modalities are frequently observed in practical learning process of multi-modal DNNs. The research topic of this paper is interesting and worthy of investigation.\n  - The paper is easy to follow.\n\n* Weaknesses\n  - The main claims related to worse generalization performance from the greedy nature is not so clearly validated with experiments. It is critical issue since it is connected with the reasons of necessity of the proposed methods. Table 1 shows that the experimental results between *vanilla* and *guided* are not statistically significantly different in ModelNet40, NVGesture-scratch and NVGesture-pretrained. Even though those of Colored-and-gray-MNIST dataset seem to demonstrate big differences, I think the dataset is intentionally designed to be biased with color and labels and not compatible with standard multi-modal setting. So, only the results with Colored-and-gray-MNIST dataset are not enough to support the main claims.\n   - The other claims on are also not so clear to accept. For Section 5.2, if the values of | d_util | are high, it seems to mean that there are differences of conditional utilization rates, not confirm that the standard multi-modal learning process encourages the model to rely on one modality and ignore the other one. In other words, I think the experimental design and their evidences are weak to validate their claims.\n\n\n* Minors\n  - Section 5.3 in page 8, obverse -> observe\n",
            "summary_of_the_review": "The research topic is interesting and it seems that the main answer points of the research questions are appropriate.\nHowever, main claims in the paper are not so clearly validated with respect to both of theories and experiments.\nI think that the authors should reconsider whether the differences on conditional utilization rate and those of conditional learning speed really affect the generalization performances, or they should try to establish other strategies to find evidences to support main claims.\nFrom the reason, I recommend this paper as reject.",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper talks about efficient multi-modal training. They hypothesize that multi-modal training is greedy and perform experiments to empirically show the same.\nThey propose metrics such as conditional utilization rate and conditional learning speed which serves as a proxy for the former to measure the imbalance in utilization between modalities while training.\nBased on conditional learning speed, they propose a multi-modal training algorithm that mitigates the imbalance in modality utilization.\nThrough experiments, the authors empirically show that it is true and their training paradigm performs better than vanilla multi-modal training.",
            "main_review": "1. The paper focuses on a relevant problem in multi-modal learning on how to utilize information from both modalities efficiently.\nThe strength of the paper is that they follow a structured and scientific way of identifying the problem, proposing a metric to measure the extent of the problem and perform experiments\nto validate their hypothesis. They also show through experiments that the proposed training procedure leads to more efficient modality utilization and shows improved accuracy. The empirical results are strong.\n2. Weakness: In a MTMM architecture, Theta_0 (red blocks in Fig 1) would also be receiving updates based on the modality m1 as information is being passed through the fusion blocks denoted by parameters (theta_0)'(green and red-green blocks).\nIn that case, I am not sure if definition 4.1 is a valid way to define the conditional learning speeds as both theta_0 and theta_0' would see the information flow from modality m1. It would have been valid if theta_0 did not se information from m1 at all (like the way conditional utilization rate was defined in 2.1). So, I am not clearly convinced with the statement in Section 4.1 that \"If the greedy learner hypothesis is true, the conditional learning speed would serve as a proxy for the conditional utilization rate. dspeed(f;t) would predict dutil(f) at the end of training.\" Authors have tried to explain how to derive uni-modal outputs from MTMM in section A1 but it isn't clear to me\n3. Re-balancing step is not clear as explained in Appendix A2. Lets say we want to balance the information flow from modality m0 in a MTMM architecture in Fig 1.\nIn that case, does it mean the top branch takes information from just m0 (i.e. the information flow from green and green-red blocks is stopped) to generate prediction y0_hat, while the bottom branch takes information from both m0 and m1 to generate the prediction y1_hat.",

Authors have done a good job of explaining the problem followed by laying out their hypotheses clearly. They have done experiments which enforces the hypotheses empirically.
