This paper proposes incorporating graph-level labels into graph clustering and formulating the new problem as weakly supervised graph clustering.  The paper further proposes Gaussian Mixture Graph Convolutional Network (GMGCN) framework for the task.  Experimental results on several datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.\n\nThe authors are very active in answering questions by the reviewers.  They have successfully addressed some of the issues. However, there are still questions that remain unaddressed. The submission is not of the quality of ICLR papers.\n\nStrength\n* A new method is proposed.\n* The proposed methods outperform baseline models on the given datasets and synthetic datasets.\n\nWeakness\n* The explanations are not clear enough.  Although the authors provide detailed responses to the reviews,  the problems indicated by the reviewers are still not well addressed.\n* The proposed method seems to be too complicated.\n* It is not clear why the proposed method works.\n* The problem studied might not be realistic.\n\n----\nHere is a summary of the reviewers' final comments.\n\n* Reviewer oDis slightly increased the score。\n\n* Reviewer r2ym says“I read responses to my concerns and others, but except for some clarifying statements and notations, authors' responses are not convincing enough.

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This manuscript proposes a problem defined as weakly supervised graph clustering. Given a set of graphs and node features, the problem is to predict node labels in each of the graphs. Some variations can be made depending on selecting the targets whose labels are supposed to be predicted.",
            "main_review": "Even though this manuscript reads well and tries to define a new problem and a solution for the proposed problem, I have some major concerns described below.\n\nAccording to the definition of the proposed problem, one should have node features, node labels, interactions between the nodes, the graph labels, and possibly the higher-level interactions between the graphs. I wonder if one can grasp all this rich information in practical applications. More importantly, it is not clear how the graph label affects the predictions of node labels. In experiments, the authors consider only one type of real-world data from Twitter, which does not include the interactions between graphs. Without the interactions between graphs (i.e., the hierarchical graph), we can treat each graph as an independent graph and apply well-known graph clustering or node classification methods such as GCN, GraphSAGE or GIN.\n\nFor the examples or applications of the proposed problem, the authors mention detecting frauds or abnormal users. Since there is substantial literature for anomaly detection, the proposed method should have more general applications other than anomaly detection. Unfortunately, it is hard for me to think of realistic scenarios or interesting applications of the proposed method. \n\nOverall, the proposed method seems to make a simple problem more complicated. To make the proposed method convincing, more general practical applications should be shown where all the inputs the problem require are provided. Also, the authors should show whether each of the components plays a critical role in predicting the node labels and analyze how each component affects the results.\n\n* Minor comments: In Section 3.1, $d$ is not defined.",
            "summary_of_the_review": "I reject this paper because (1) it is hard to find practical applications of the proposed method; one can solve the problem more easily in many practical applications, (2) it is not clear how each of the inputs affects the predictions, (3) the experiments do not include diverse real-world datasets.",

In particular, the consensus loss, a new loss function designed by the authors, is used for the entire framework. Authors also address different kinds of weak supervision settings and show the performance of the proposed framework for each case on synthetic datasets. ",
            "main_review": "Strengths\n- The proposed methods outperform baseline models on the given datasets and synthetic datasets.\n- Two levels of graphs (one for graphs of multiple categories and the other for the hypergraph) are used and those levels are connected through Gaussian Mixture embeddings.\n\nWeaknesses\n- Despite the complicated process and a lot of notations, definitions, relationships, and explanations for notations are not sufficient or there exist some typos so that the manuscript is not easy to follow. \n- Not knowing the number of clusters is a common problem, but the guidance to tackle that problem is not suggested.\n- Despite the long and complicated process, the contribution or the necessity of each step is not clear. Ablation study would be helpful.\n- In particular, the contribution of weak supervision is not clear. Without the clear evidence, a weakly supervised method would not be verified over an unsupervised method.\n\nDetails\n- Eq (4) is not well-defined. First of all, the number of clusters should be C_node, not C_graph. Second, the output of w_c seems to be the vector, while Eq (4) does not necessarily indicate the full Gaussian model. Would \\Theta_GLM indicate the inverse of covariance matrix so that Eq. (4) means the entriy-wise Guassian model?\n- Authors describe that Eq. (5) does not have the training parameters, but \\alpha^{heir} itself contains many weight coefficients. The description should be clearer to clarify the distinction between training parameters and the others.\n- Consensus loss is based on the linear sum of the distance to cluster center and the distance to graph center. Then, what is the role of weak supervision if there is no use of true labels?\n- GLM-based clustering methods needs to be also compared as baseline methods.",
            "summary_of_the_review": "While each step of the entire process is fair, the necessity of each step is not sufficiently verified.

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper studies a new problem named weakly supervised graph clustering (WSGC), where the goal is to cluster nodes better with some graph-level side information, i.e., graph labels.\n\nMost previous studies for graph clustering primarily consider node/edge information and their connections, but ignore graph-level side information, which might be easily accessible in real scenarios. Inspired by this observation, this paper proposed to incorporate graph-level labels into graph clustering, and formulate the new problem as weakly supervised graph clustering. Based on the new problem, the authors further proposed a simple yet effective framework based on Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and graph convolutional network (GCN) named Gaussian Mixture Graph Convolutional Network (GMGCN) for learning node representations. Moreover, they also introduced a consensus loss for graph labels and employed Gaussian Mixture  Layer to infer the category of each node.\n\nExperiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed GMGCN approach.\n",
            "main_review": "Pros:\n\n1. The paper is well organized, and generally easy to read.\n2. The idea of incorporating coarse-grained graph label to assist graph clustering is somewhat interesting, and may be useful in some specific scenarios.\n3. Experiments also demonstrating the superiority of the proposed WSGC task over the traditional GC task.\n\n\nCons: \n1. The current title of the submission seems overclaimed. As weakly supervised graph clustering may also include some other settings such as partial supervision, distant supervision, etc, it seems overclaimed to name the paper title as weakly supervised graph clustering. To me, it will be much better to highlight incorporating graph-level side information, which is the key contribution of this paper.\n2. Although the graph labels have been shown to bring significant performance gains in their experiments, it is not clear to me what kind of graph labels are effective for graph clustering? Are they task specific? Do we need to manually design such graph labels?\n3. In Table 3, it is interesting that for most categories the GMGCN approach achieves the best performance, but for the sofa category, its performance is much lower than the baselines. Could you please give some analysis to explain the reasons of the performance difference?\n4. In Figure 1, what does node updating denote?\n",

Do we assume C_node is known? When C_node is unknown, how do we determine it? \n2) Is there a real world example where interconnections among graphs exist and are helpful for graph clustering? Given both real-world datasets are single graph case, I can't think of an example that puts case 4 in use.\n3) It would be more clear to have an algorithm part, where inputs, outputs, and steps of algorithms are presented.\n4) It is not clear to me why we need two datasets of GC4NC2 for experiments and the major difference between them.\n5) Is there a minimum number of graphs that the authors recommend for the proposed algorithm? The authors claim that the sofa example didn't do well (relative to other methods) due to small sample size.\n\nMinor points\n1) typo: page 3, section 3.1, where C_{node} -1 is the expected number of node categories --> where C_{node} is the expected number of node categories\n2) It would be more clear if the authors explain NMI and mIoU in the last paragraph of the introduction section.",
