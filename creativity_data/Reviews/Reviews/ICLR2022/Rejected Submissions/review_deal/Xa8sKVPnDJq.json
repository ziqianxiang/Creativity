        "comment": "This paper proposed a compositional approach to (conditionally) steer pre-trained music transformers to the direction intended by the user.  Overall the scores are mostly negative. The reviewers pointed out some interesting aspects of the paper (e.g., using hard binary constraints as opposed to the soft ones, the contrastive approach). However, one common issue shared by all the reviewers is the clarity of the presentation, which led to many reviewers being confused about various aspects of the paper especially the empirical evaluation. The authors did provide a detailed response to address some of the concerns, but to fully address all the points I anticipate it would require quite substantial change to the paper. A couple reviewers also raised the concerns regarding the limited contribution of the paper. Finally, there appears to be some disagreement between the authors and reviewers regarding how to interpret the listening test results. I hope the authors can take the comments into consideration to further improve this paper for the next submission."

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper presents a model tuning strategy for steering conditional music generation given the pre-trained Music Transformer model. The authors pose the steering as musical feature matching between two sequences from prime and continuation, respectively, and tune the parameters using two methods, prefix tuning and bias-tuning. They show that the latter is more effective for steering conditional music generation. They also present a differentiable proxy of music feature matching considering the positive, negative, and non-adaptive cases. The contrastive loss outperforms the non-contrastive loss and bias-tuning is more effective than prefix tuning in the experiment. ",
            "main_review": "This paper tackles an important topic of music generation in the context of Human-AI co-creation. Steering the generation results to the direction intended by the user has been emphasized as a lesson of recent AI song contest events. The authors address the issue focusing on continued generation given a prime. The proposed contrastive learning is novel and the superiority is explained through the experiment. The demo examples support the effectiveness in musicality. However, the presentation and results are not clear to me in term of validating steerability of the model. \n\n- While the demo examples contrasts the superiority of the proposed approach well, I have a bit doubt about the results. The music transformer model is known to tackle the long-term dependency issues in music generation. Using the transformer architecture and relative positional encoding, the model is known to learn wider music contexts and generate consistent note patterns given a prime. However, the majority of unconditional generation examples from Music Transformer diverge in the continuation. On the other hand, the bias-tuning model sounds very consistent between the primes and the continuations. This is somewhat confusing because I was expecting that Music Transform is good at consistent generation whereas bias-tuning may steer the generation to different textures which could not be consistent with the prime, for example, when block chord is chosen as a musical feature for the continuation and the prime does not have block chords. I think the authors should put \"consistent generation\" in the thread of discussion and clarify how steering is different from it. \n\n- The listening test compares unconditional generation to conditional generation with \"randomly chosen three-feature sets\".  This experiment does not explicitly validate the controllability of the model. That is, it does not test steering the generation by the user. I think, if the purpose was rating the preference,  general music listeners could have done it instead of musicians. The user test should be designed such that the musicians choose one of the musical features that they want to control and then rate if the conditional generation is satisfactory or aligned to their expectation. \n\n- \"Non-contrastive\" loss is compared to the proposed contrastive loss in Figure 4. But, it seems that the non-contrastive loss is not clearly defined in the paper. Is it the loss that does not include the negative case (this is my guessing)? \n \n- 12 absolute musical features and 8 relative musical features are defined in Appendix A. I see that they are defined based on music elements such as dynamics, tonality, polyphony, note density and so on. However, they are mostly low-level attributes and are not a complete list of musical elements. Furthermore, more high-level features are possible, for example, syncopation, chromaticism, more jazz chords (e.g, more 7ths chords) but they are not addressed. Authors should clarify the basis of selecting the music features and the scope of possible musical steering with the features.  \n\n- This motivation and necessity of the research was well addressed in the introduction. However, the author missed the following paper which testifies the labor-intensive rejection sampling in the real-world music generation scenario.\n\n** Human-AI Co-creation in Songwriting, Cheng-Zhi Anna Huang, Hendrik Vincent Koops, Ed Newton-Rex, Monica Dinculescu, Carrie Cai, ISMIR 2020.\n\nThere will be more papers that reported similar issues in the context of computational creativity. \n\n< Minor parts>\n- page 2: \"... for instance, 6, the requested... \" --> \"6\" seems to be an errata. \n- page 3: the green symbols (the check marks) in section 3.1 are not visible when it is printed in black and white.\n- page 4: \"prepreding\" --> This looks like a typo. \"prepending\" might be correct\n",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This work considers how to control sampling from transformer-based autoregressive generative models of music. In particular, it considers constraint satisfaction problems (CSP) given a collection of binary constraints. The technical contributions of this paper are (1) a method for fine-tuning (bias-tuning) a model using a contrastive loss for adaptation to a given CSP (Section 3.1) and (2) an additive approximation to bias-tuning for satisfying combinatorial constraints (Section 3.2).",
            "main_review": "I like the CSP setting proposed in Section 2. Much of the related work on steering focuses on soft, differentiable constraints, for example, generating samples that are likely under a classifier model (Dathathri et al., 2020). This is an interesting alternative perspective.\n\nThe contrastive loss (Section 3.1) and additive model for feature composition (Section 3.2) are clearly described and interesting. However, the paper is missing a discussion of related work on contrastive losses. How does the contrastive loss proposed here compare to other contrastive losses? I am not very familiar with the literature on contrastive losses, and this lack of discussion leaves me unclear about the extent of the novelty/contribution to the contrastive modeling literature.\n\nI am a little confused by Figure 3: it appears from this figure that prefix-tuning and bias-tuning are used together, but later in the paper it seems that these two techniques are analyzed separately?\n\nI found the discussion of the empirical evaluation (Sections 4, 5, and 6) very confusing. Below are some specific questions and concerns.\n\n(1) Section 4.1 discusses fine-tuning the transformer to the MAESTRO dataset. Does this imply that the original transformer is trained on a different dataset? Which one?\n\n(2) Section 5.2 introduces a lot of terminology with in-line definitions that are difficult to follow. I found it difficult to understand what is meant by \"cofactual primes\" and \"counterfactual primes.\" What is the distinction made between the \"maestro validation dataset\" and the \"actual validation dataset\"? Later, terms \"cofactual\"/\"counterfactual\" tuning (Figure 4) and \"cofactual steering\" (Section 6) are introduced without definition and further confuse me.\n\n(3) Also in Section 5.2: does \"efficacy\" mean the probability that a sample satisfies the desired constraints?\n\n(4) In Figure 4, what is the y-axis of the contrastive (right-hand) plot? It seems to carry the same \"MLE Loss\" as the left-hand plot. I'm very unclear what is being shown here (this could be related to my confusion about the meanings of \"cofactual\" and \"counterfactual\" tuning).\n\n(5) How are the error bars (confidence intervals?) in Table 1 and Figure 5 computed? How many samples are used to calculate efficacy?\n\n(6) How should I interpret the results of the listening test in Section 6. The motivation for this work stated in the introduction is that rejection sampling is slow, and we want to fine-tune to get a better proposal distribution that allows us to sample more efficiently. But the listening test finds that fine-tuning produces higher quality samples than rejection sampling. This makes me uncomfortable with the framing in the introduction.\n\nOverall, regarding the experiments. There does appear to be good empirical evidence here to support the advantage of the proposed contrastive loss over MLE. But there does not seem to be an empirical analysis of the additive approximation proposed in Section 3. Nor is there a clear analysis of prefix-tuning versus bias-tuning.\n\nMinor comment: the references section cites many arxiv pre-prints, rather than conference versions of the papers. In many cases these papers have been published for several years, and citing the pre-print versions seems a little sloppy. ",

A may be relevant for composers. \n\nThe bibliography seems a bit shallow regarding the relevant literature on generative models for music with (and without) control.\nOverall, the paper is well written even if the clarity could be improved at some places (notations in Eq 2 and 3 are not particularly useful, in Fig. 2, there must be a \\phi_i as an input in order to compute \\ell_x, notations \\ell_true and \\ell_false are more confusing than helpful as they elude the dependence on \\theta_i and \\theta_j, a small table showing the difference during training between the single-feature and compositional regimes could help).\n\nQuestion:\n- Influence of alpha on the efficacy of rejection sampling?",

The terms \"cofactual\" and \"counterfactual\" are not even introduced until 5.2, but are used in the caption of figure 4 without explanation.  If I understand the plot correctly, it demonstrates that contrastive training eventually assigns high conditional likelihood to \"good\" continuations (blue) and low likelihood to \"bad\" ones (green), and therefore is able to discriminate between them?  \n\n- The term \"efficacy\" is used without an explicit definition, and forms the basis of most of the quantitative evaluations (Table 1, Figure 5).  It was only after looking at the page of example outputs that it is clearly defined as the number of rejected samples prior to generating a positive example.  Please define your terms and metrics!\n\n- Table 1 lists what appears to be mean efficacy scores, as well as some kind of bounds in parentheses?
