More rigorous empirical work should be carried out."

The magnitude of a metric space has been studied in topology, and this paper demonstrates that it can potentially be used in image-related ML problems.\n\nWeakness:\nGiven the results in the current paper, I am not fully convinced that the concept of magnitude vector is really important for learning problems. To better demonstrate its importance, the authors should provide more comprehensive experimental results.\n\nFor edge detection: the authors only provided some visual examples for the Fashion MNIST dataset. From the three images that the authors provided in the paper, the results of magnitude-based edge detection is visually worse than Canny detector. The authors did not provide any quantitative results on the quality of edge detection. I think a more rigorous study and evaluation is needed to show its benefits.\n\nFor adversarial robustness, the authors only provided results on three relatively simple datasets: MNIST, KMNIST, Fashion MNIST, with a relatively weak attack (FGSM). To demonstrate the method of the proposed approach, the authors should provide results on more datasets and more baseline algorithms.\n\n====\nAfter response: the authors did not post specific response so I decided to keep my score.",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper explores the application of the quantity “magnitude of a metric space” for images. Based on prior work, magnitude is a quantity originating from category theory extended to metric spaces with surprising geometric properties (Leinster 2017). This paper defines the magnitude as a vector valued function of a metric space (Def. 3). Through defining an image as a metric space, the magnitude of a single image is defined (Def. 4). Authors then state conditions under which magnitude of an image is known to exist (Prop 5). Then the paper defines a filtration operation that computes the magnitude vector on multiple thresholded projections of the input. Section 2.3 introduces an approximate computation method for the magnitude and Section 3.1 evaluates the efficiency and error of this approximation. Section 3.2 applies the method for edge detection and compares it to Canny detector. Section 3.3 uses the magnitude for adversarial robustness and claims gains.",
            "main_review": "Strengths:\n- The magnitude of a metric space seems to have various interesting properties encoding other quantities of interest.\n- The fast magnitude computation method is interesting and seems to be efficient although the scale of the significance of approximation error needs more discussion.\n\nWeaknesses:\n- There is a lack of motivation for considering the magnitude as a quantity for any purpose. My understanding from prior work is that the magnitude is a rather theoretical curiosity that “turns out to encode many invariants … including, volume, capacity, dimension and intrinsic volume” (Leinster 2017). But after reading this paper as well as prior work, I still do not have an intuition as to what it is expected to encode about an image. I will expand on this issue below under the experimental limitations.\n- Theoretical contributions of the work are not clear. A few definitions, propositions and lemma are restated from prior work. Together they seem to provide expressions for computing the magnitude of a single image. However, all of these come from prior work.\n- My understanding is that the contribution in the Section 2.2 is the particular definition of metric space for an image (Def. 4). The rest of the section applies prior tools to this metric space. There is a lack of justification for this definition. For example, why should one treat individual pixels as a point and why should we use spatial coordinates in the vector representation?\n- The notation is confusing. For example, Def. 3 and Def. 1 use n to denote both the cardinality of B and the dimensionality of elements in B. Eq. 4 and 5 are also using notations with proper definition that comes from Bunch et al 2021.\n- The significance of Section 3.2 is not clear. Are authors claiming “The magnitude of an image is as good as the Canny Edge detector.”? If so, can authors clarify why this is a significant observation? Given Figure 3, I’m not sure I would agree with this claim either, as the magnitude-based approach has mostly failed on the image of the pants.\n- The adversarial robustness results in Section 3.3 need improvement considering major works on attacking discretization layers that achieve spurious robustness through gradient masking / gradient obfuscation. As tested by authors, black-box attacks are one approach, however, FGSM is not a particularly strong attack. Various other guidelines are suggested in [1,2].\n\n[1] Athalye, Anish, Nicholas Carlini, and David Wagner. \"Obfuscated gradients give a false sense of security: Circumventing defenses to adversarial examples.\" International conference on machine learning.

After some theoretical considerations, the paper proposes a divide-and-conquer algorithm to approximate the magnitude vector of an image which is significantly faster than the naive inversion of a $N\\times N$ matrix (where $N$ is the number of pixels in the image). Finally, the magnitude vector is shown to correlate with the result of traditional edge detectors (after hyper-parameter tuning) and an application to adversarial robustness is described.",
            "main_review": "This paper does not provide any theoretically-backed reason why magnitude vectors of images should be considered, and in fact the given definition of a vector space associated with an image appears quite dubious: the existence of the magnitude of an image depends on individual brighness values, which are irrelevant to the actual overall meaning of the image; in addition, the metric mixes the position of the pixels with their brightness, which looks very unnatural.\n\nThe algorithm to speed up the computation of magnitude vectors is also not theoretically backed in any way, and only supported by empirical experiments.\n\nFinally, the two given application of magnitude vectors to computer vision are very weak. In edge detection, it is shown that with appropriate hyperparameter tuning, magnitude vectors can recover a noisy version of the output of the Canny detector. The authors never observe that edge detection is a local problem, whereas the magnitude vector is a global quantity; this appears to me as an intrinsic theoretical limitation to the application of magnitude vectors to edge detection. As for adversarial robustness, it seems quite obvious that generated adversarial examples for a base LeNet are classified more correctly by a modified LeNet (regardless of how the network is actually modified).\n\nHere are some additional minor comments:\n- After Definition 1: a *finite* set of vectors\n- Lemma 6: this is obvious, there is no need to cite a 2009 preprint\n",
