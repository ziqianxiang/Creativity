        "comment": "This paper proposes a theory for double descent phenomena in denoting deep neural networks. There are two major concerns: (1) The assumption that the data lie in a low dimensional subspace is quite strong, and needs to be weaken or better justified. (2) The theory only works for r=1, where the rank is one. For general rank, how to apply the proposed analysis is hand wavy and not convincing. The paper can be significantly strengthen if these two issues could be addressed."

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper investigates a new double-descent in denoising task for linear predictors. As the number of samples increases the denoising loss exhibits a peak in the case of linear predictions, but the peaks are less pronounced in the case of neural networks, except for the case with rank 1 data. The authors calculate an asymptotical formula for their special rank-1 data model in theorem 1 which proves the explosion at (c=1). For the arbitrary rank data, the authors present an approximate formula too. ",
            "main_review": "Strengths: The paper investigates a novel double-descent phenomenon as a function of the number of samples for the denoising task. The authors make a large variety of experiments and investigate the phenomenon from different angles (i.e. neural networks, real-world datasets, etc). \n\nWeaknesses: I found the paper structure confusing. The introduction takes 3.5 pages with many figures already presented before introducing the concepts. I would recommend moving Figure 1 or making it substantially smaller as the comparison between (a) and (b) can be made with such little effort (with some equations or a smaller figure). I was confused by what M is in Figures 3 and 4 which is introduced much later. The paper does not have a conclusion part. \n\nRelevant work:\nOn page 2, I found that the citations are centered around Nakkiran et. al.'s work unfairly. Note that sample-wise double-descent is also studied in d'Ascoli et. al. 2019 (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.03509.pdf), Adlam et. al. 2020 (http://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/adlam20a). I see that these works are cited but I think these should be presented already on page 2 where sample-wise descent is motivated. \n\nMoreover, for the double-descent and asymptotics of random features, the following works should be cited as well in the related works section on page 4: Jacot et. al. (http://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/jacot20a.html), Mel et. al. 2021 (https://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/mel21a.html).  \n\nTypos: \n* page 4: U \\Sigma V^T: T should be removed. also in many other places, there is some confusion on transposes.  \n* Figure 7 caption: for the our formula -> remove the",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper identifies and studies a double descent phenomenon (wrt the training data size) for a denoising problem, where the goal is to recover a low-rank ground truth given a corrupted version of it (with added full-rank noise). The paper considers the linear regression estimator, and gives the exact formula for the test risk in the asymptotic regime for the rank-1 case; for a general rank r, the paper also gives a formula, but it's not entirely rigorous. Furthermore, the paper also studies the role of the training and testing SNRs.",
            "main_review": "Strengths:\n1. Double descent has been observed in various contexts and it's an interesting and important question to understand it thoroughly. While previous work only focused on supervised learning settings, this paper considers a denoising setting instead, which is a reasonable first step to consider in the unsupervised space.\n2. The paper gives an answer in the rank-1 case in terms of the double descent phenomenon wrt the training data size. There is also some interesting characterization of the optimal SNR.\n\nWeaknesses: Overall, this paper is not well written and needs significant improvement. There are a lot of things not explained clearly, and it's very difficult to follow the paper. Below are some major questions/issues.\n1. What are the scales of all the relevant quantities in the main result (Thm. 1)? Which are considered constants and which grow with $N, M$? This needs to be explained clearly.\n2. The data model setup also needs some more explanation. It's assumed that $V$ has orthonormal columns. Why is this a reasonable assumption? This assumption means that the datapoints are not independent, which makes it unrealistic for statistical learning.\n3. The rank-r result is not explained clearly. It is claimed that formulas (5) and (6) are \"approximations.\" In what sense are they approximating the true risk? What does it mean to \"assume that $A_j$ has similar spectral properties to $A_{trn}$\"?\n4. Even the introduction section is quite chaotic. There's first some motivation and an overview of the type of results in the paper (which is itself somewhat confusingly written), and then suddenly at \"contributions\" it goes back to the motivation again...\n5. At the bottom of page 6, it is claimed that picking the optimal training noise would not prevent double descent, in contrast to other results showing that optimal regularization prevents double descent. What about other regularization? This doesn't seem to rule out the possibility that other regularization can eliminate double descent.\n\nMinor points: \n1. It is claimed (page 3) that a 2-layer linear network model is considered. However, the model is just a usual (1-layer) linear model, not a linear network.\n2. In the setup (Section 2 beginning), $V\\in\\mathbb{R}^{r\\times N}$ should be $V\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N\\times r}$?\n3. In \"contributions\" (page 3): \".... focus on representation learning...\" I don't think there's any representation learning aspect here.",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "In this paper, the authors study overparameterization of autoencoders in terms of varying sample size. They derive an analytic expression for the bias-variance decomposition of the loss for a bottleneck of size 1. Furthermore, they approximate the bias-variance decomposition for larger bottleneck sizes. This is done with all linear networks. They experimentally show double descent in nonlinear networks as well.",
            "main_review": "**Writing and flow:**\n\nOverall the writing and flow of the paper are good. What is being done is clear and makes sense. This is great and a strength.\n\n**Assumptions and model:**\n\nThe assumptions (e.g., noise statistics) and model used are all reasonable (strength).\n\n**Introduction:**\n\nThe introduction has good logic flow and is easy to understand the intuition and motivation behind the paper, which is a strength. The authors do a good job explaining their points. I especially found it interesting the idea that, if double descent depends on the number of samples, that datasets may be unfortunately placed at the peak without our knowing.\n\nNow for a few weaknesses. The intuition that noise regularizes is useful but not absolutely accurate. If I am not mistaken, please correct me if I am, additive noise only regularizes in a supervised setting with small noise amplitude (Bishop, 1995). Thus, the claim, which is made in the first paragraph of page 3, that more regularization via adding noise doesn’t remove the double descent shape is a weak claim because adding lots of noise may not actually be equivalent to regularization. \n\nAlso, the figure labels on Figure 3 are extremely confusing and the axis labels are so small that I can’t really make out what Figure 3 is actually saying. Figure 4a is good but Figure 4b is confusing. The caption says that the plot is of training SNR and the axis label says it is a ratio instead. \n\n**Related work:**\n\nThe related work section is very small and needs to be expanded in order put the author’s contribution into context. This is a weakness.\n\n**Theorem 1:**\n\nTheorem 1 is great and the section is well written. The only confusing part for me is how “The $o(1)$ error term goes to $0$ as $N_{trn}, M \\rightarrow \\infty.$”? This mean that the error term depends on $N_{trn}, M$ and hence is not constant, i.e., $o(1)$.\n\n**Section 3.1:**\n\nThe implications of Equation 7 are very interesting to me and I think this is a great contribution because it is non-intuitive. \n\n**Section 3.2:**\n\nAs mentioned above, saying that you have “optimal regularization” because you pick the optimal amount of training noise does not make sense because they are not equivalent if the noise variance is too large. In fact, you can actually see no double descent if you just set the noise variance to 0. This is a weakness of the paper.\n\n**Experiment and conclusion:**\n\nThe experiment section is very short and there is no conclusion, which makes the paper incomplete. The conclusion section is important but most important is the experiment section. The results for MNIST are quite interesting actually but there isn’t much detail in the paper describing them, which is unfortunate. There is some information in the appendix, but it should be described in the original paper. Some of the figures can be removed to make room for it, in my opinion, such as Figure 1 and 6. ",
            "summary_of_the_review": "**Strengths:**\n\nThe paper shows a novel result: the bias-variance decomposition of the rank-1 linear denoising autoencoder. This introduces some interesting new concepts, such as optimal training SNR as compared to test SNR. The paper is clearly written and is easy to understand. In addition, the authors find an approximation to the bias-variance decomposition for bottlenecks of larger size than 1.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\nThe others equate adding noise and regularizing the model, which is not equivalent if the noise variance is too large. If they want to make statements about regularization, then they should explicitly regularize and see what happens. If the results are similar then even that is convincing, even if it is empirical. Moreover, some of their figures are hard to read and interpret. Finally, the authors leave out most of the details regarding the experiments and completely omit the conclusion.\n\nOverall, I based my score on the fact that the paper is incomplete and rough, not because the work has major problems. This is very interesting work and should be polished before next submission.",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper considers a denoising setup for a linear model. Compared with the traditional supervised learning setup where the noise is added to the output, the denoising setup has noise in the input. The authors provide an asymptotically exact formula for the generalization error for rank 1 data and an approximation for higher rank data. Both the theoretical and numerical results validate that the generalization error has a peak when the number of samples is equal to the number of features, which is consistent with existing literature about the double descent phenomenon. Authors also derive a formula for the amount of noise in the training data for the best generalization performance, which leads to a novel conclusion that the optimal noise amount in the training data is not always equal to the noise level in the test data.",
            "main_review": "I think the topic of this paper is interesting. I like the result that the optimal amount of noise in the training data is not equal to the noise level in the test data. The following are some detailed comments.\n\n1. Authors claim that the noise in the training samples can be controlled. That is misleading. Actually, we can enlarge the noise by manually adding more noise into the training data, but we cannot reduce the noise. A related question is whether Eq.(7) suggests that we can actually get a better result by adding more noise to the training data.\n\n2. The explanation of the double descent with respect to the number of training samples is not satisfactory. Eq.(3) and (4) only suggest that the error has a peak when $c=1$, i.e., when $N_{trn}=M$. It only implies that when N_trn increases, the error will increase to the peak in the region $N_{trn}\\in (M-{small\\ value},M)$ and then decrease when $N_{trn}\\in (M, M+{small\\ value})$. Maybe it will be clear to see the monotonicity by doing the derivative of Eq.(3) and (4) with respect to $N_{trn}$.\n\n3. How does Theorem 1 compare with results about double descent in other literature? For example, is the descending speed with respect to the number of training samples characterized by Theorem 1 similar to that in the existing literature?\n\n4. In Eqs. (3)~(7), N_tst, M, and c appear at the same time. Since c=M/N_trn, maybe it is a good idea to replace M with c*N_trn.",
