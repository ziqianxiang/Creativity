        "comment": "This paper propose a novel framework to increase cooperation in second-order social dilemmas. This is based on encouraging homophilic incentives. Reviewers agree that the paper does not meet the standards of publication yet. In particular, they worry that the assumptions made are so restrictive as to make model inapplicable to interesting problems. There is also a concern that the work is simply not novel enough."

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper studies the problem of promoting cooperation among self-interested agents. Inspired by the work which studied homophily in non-sequential social dilemmas, the authors proposed to use homophily, which encourages agents with similar environment behaviors to have similar incentivizing behaviors, to achieve stable cooperation in sequential social dilemmas. Simulation evidence from sequential social dilemmas of public goods and tragedy of the commons was also presented in the paper to support the effectiveness of the proposed method.",
            "main_review": "On the positive side, I found the paper to be well-written, and it gives a fairly satisfying and complete first investigation of using the tendency of homophily in sequential social dilemmas. The idea behind homophily is intuitive, i.e. associate human individuals with similar others, and seems to be quite useful according to the simulation results in both single-stage and sequential social dilemmas. \n\nOn the other hand, a major concern in my view is that the computation of S^{env} and S^{inc} in equation (4) assumes the agent knows all the other agents’ incentivizing and environmental information. This doesn’t seem to be super realistic in practice given that all the agents are self-interested. In addition, the proposed method requires much more information about other agents, so it’s not very surprising that the proposed method can achieve better cooperation between agents compared to other baseline methods, which uses much less information about other agents.  The sharing of this environmental and incentivizing information between all the agents can already be seen as a kind of “cooperation” imposed by the proposed method. Therefore, it is not truly clear to me that the better performance of the proposed method is due to more demanding requests of the agent, or due to a better learning algorithm. This is a major reason for my rating of weak rejection. \n\nIn addition, how to specifically implement the homophily, e.g. to what extent (especially this paper is using a binary instead of a continuous variable to determine the similarity in the sequential social dilemmas setting) can we regard two individuals as similar? In Section 3.D, the authors introduced a concept - degree of homophily, and show the “safer region” increases with the degree of homophily. How is this degree estimated, does this degree exist in practice, and if so what’s a normal value for this? Also, what’s the relationship between the degree and the S^{env} (environment similarity variable) in the sequential social dilemmas setting? There seems not a good guidance for these questions. \n\nAdditionally, the title of the paper emphasizes “sequential social dilemmas”. However, I am not sure if this matches the main concern of the paper. As far as I understand, the main contribution of the paper is using homophily to solve the second-order social dilemmas resulting from the incentive mechanisms other than temporally extended mechanisms. What’s more, the formal analysis of how homophily solves second-order social dilemmas is only proved for single-stage social dilemmas, only simulation results were provided for this paper’s main goal - sequential social dilemmas. Therefore, I think the results from this paper don't solve the problem as completely as proposed.\n\nAbout the simulation results, I like the trajectory figure and gradient field figure plotted by the authors. However, the results there need more explanation. Why does oscillating cooperation mean the distribution of population members converges to Nonparticipants (N)? I think when the distribution of population members converges to Defecting agents, this can also be thought as noncooperation. Similarly, why does the convergence of the distribution to Punishers (P) means stable cooperation?\n\nSome notation issues: \nSection 3 Paragraph 1: no definition about 1st-SDs, is it just the SDs? Or if there are others that the authors have in mind; \nSection 2 Paragraph 1: SDs is defined as the abbreviation of Social dilemmas which is contradicting with the definition of Non-sequential\nSocial Dilemmas from Section 1 Paragraph 2.\n",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "Summary\nThe paper studies the evolution of cooperation in SSDs which are essentially more complex versions of the (repeated) Prisoner’s Dilemma. Whether cooperation in a population evolves (or not) depends on whether there exist individuals who punish non-cooperators. This evolution is now doubly fragile because there is an incentive to free-ride on punishment – that is, not to punish the punishers. The authors introduce a mechanism where agents also try to seek out those who have similar strategies as them, which reduces second order free riding.\n",
            "main_review": "\nI think the extension of what has been studied purely in the PD to more complex games is an interesting idea. The experiments are well done.\n\nHowever, I’m not sure there is enough in this paper to warrant publication at ICLR. \n\nAs the authors point out, the evolution of second order cooperation (i.e. punishing of non-punishers) is heavily studied in the standard evolution of cooperation literature. \n\nAs the authors point out, there is already work in the standard PD space that shows that preferential matching (which is quite similar to what the authors call homophilic matching) can stabilize cooperation in the PD. Note that the authors cite a few of the main papers in this literature but there are many more, as this topic has been done pretty extensively. I would actually remove section 3 from the paper and just state the headers as a sentence as these things have hundreds (thousands?) of pages already written about them.\n\nGiven that this is so well understood in the PD, it seems like the main novelty in this paper is just the extension of the PD to the SSD and the use of RL instead of e.g. Moran processes. I am not sure that’s a sufficient contribution.\n\nPossible Extensions\nI do not want to sound too negative, I think this is an interesting start, so I now discuss some potential extensions to increase the meat in the paper.\n\nI would recommend the addition of theoretical guarantees (fine if they’re just in tabular RL). A paper of just experiments begs the question of how cherry picked the environments are and what the boundary conditions are. This would be a real extension since most of the existing literature only has theoretical results for the PD, which, as the authors point out, is very simple and unclear how much generalizes.\n\nThe homophily loss in the paper is basically just biasing the learning towards strategies which do well when paired with themselves. This actually smells a bit like the concept of evolutionary stability, so I wonder if that is a base for a potential theorem.",

In recent years, this problem has been investigated in multi-agent RL situations. This paper considers the instability of the cooperation in MARL. \nThe paper first illustrates the phenomenon of oscillation-producing second-order social dilemmas within an EGT case study, and shows how a homophily mechanism can resolve them and produce convergence to a socially efficient set of roles. Then they propose a loss function called “homophily loss” that can resolve these second-order dilemmas in MARL. They experiment with this in two SSD's, Harvest and Cleanup, and show that their method outperforms the baselines they investigate.",
            "main_review": "Strengths:\n1. The writing is generally well-organized and of good quality. The detail introduction, related work and motivating example section served nicely to establish the current proposal’s novelty.\n2. This paper, as far as I know, is the first to try to address second-order social dilemmas in MARL, which should be the main reason for the existing baselines requiring 100M to learn cooperative strategies.\n3 This paper makes an adequate comparison with various baselines.\nWeaknesses\n1.\tThe selection of colors in figs 1-3 makes a lot of confusing, sometimes bule means the 2-nd order defecting, sometimes it means one trajectory.  \n2.\tIt is not clear how the authors introducing homophily into the motivating example. What do you mean by “we encourage their incentives to be the same by converting the minority of P and C to the majority with a probability of 0.2.”\n3.\tCould you show more in the motivating example? I mean you can show that the mechanism behind the other baselines, such as Inequity Aversion (Hughes et al., 2018), Social Influence (Jaques et al., 2019) cannot solve 2nd-SDs. It is incredible that the baselines typically need hundreds of millions of steps to learn cooperation, but your methods only needs 2-5 million steps!!! Is the proposed method just a trick, which does not allow the agents to adopt 2-nd order defecting. What if some agents use your method, while some use other baselines? \n4.\tThe equation for S^env (i,j) should be given in the main paper, because this is the main idea of this paper.",
