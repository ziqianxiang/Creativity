        "comment": "This paper offers \"natural attribute\" methods for shift detection.  Several reviewers are positive, but reviewer czxP is the most authoritative in the eyes of the area chair.  In particular the AC is concerned that the task that this paper defines is artificial and not useful. Naturally occurring shifts are real, happen all the time and meaningfully affect model performance... Natural shifts should be defined over distributions not singular instances. The authors create artificial instantiations of natural shifts to illustrate a well known flaw in OOD detection algorithms.\nTo demonstrate the usefulness of this approach to \"natural shifts\" the authors should should show how this algorithm performs in settings like \"WILDS\"... where the shift are meaningful and not artificial, in the opinion of the AC.  The paper should cite and contrast WILDS (https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.07421) and Mandoline (http://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/chen21i.html) in a future revision."

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper identifies the problem of a Natural Attributed-based Shift (NAS) in the data distribution affecting Deep Learning (DL) systems designed for the task of interest. An example may be a DL system for X-ray based diagnosis being able to handle a different brightness that it was trained for. The paper argues that it is similar to Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data but instead of the difference being in the label space (CIFAR vs SVHN) the label space is similar but the test data distribution is shifted due to a systemic shift in an important data attribute (brightness of image in the X-ray example above). The paper claims the following contributions:\n- A new task of NAS detection and datasets to study it.\n- A comprehensive evaluation of OOD methods on the NAS dataset and demonstration that none of them perform consistently across all NAS scenarios.\n- A novel analysis based on the location of shifted samples in the feature space and performance of existing OOD methods.\n- Demonstrate that a simple modification to training objective for deep classifiers enables consistent OOD performance on all NAS scenarios.\n",
            "main_review": "STRENGTHS\n1. I like the the idea of Natural Attributed-based Shift as an important subset of Out-of-Distribution problems we can face in DL systems. I think it is sufficiently different from typical OOD problems studied in literature (different label space - CIFAR vs ImageNet or different support - images vs sketches). I don't completely buy the argument that one is harder or easier compared to the other (paragraph 2 of Section 1) but I think a systematic study of this problem is important.\n2. The three proposed datasets of: (1) Different grouping of UTKFace, (2) Different grouping of Amazon Review and (3) RSNA Bone Age dataset at different brightness settings, are good examples of interest that capture different domains (image, test and medical diagnosis).\n3. Identification of 3 types of NAS scenarios based on whether the dataset is close to decision boundary (or not) and if it is close to the in-distribution data (or not) is helpful especially since it identifies which OOD methods are expected to work for a particular scenario.\n4. The additional loss terms help enforce the constraints identified in the paper to enable better detection of OOD samples for the Mahanalobis model. The paper empirically demonstrates that they get comparable performance to the original model (even with the new terms) and are able to show good performance in the UTKFace dataset where the Mahanalobis model was not doing well earlier.\n\nMAJOR COMMENTS:\n1. I think NAS is studied implicitly in many circumstances related to pose for example, how to handle side faces for a DL system trained on frontal faces or similar pose problems in 3/6-dof object pose or medical image pose where registration followed by applying the system is an imperfect solution. Studying the NAS problem explicitly is expected to provide better solutions but I don't see any discussion of such a dataset or problem in the paper. I'd like the authors to comment on if they consider such a problem to be a NAS problem and if their proposed solutions apply to this NAS setting? One dataset of interest might be the [3D Object Dataset](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4408987) where a certain range of viewpoints is D_I and the others are D_S.\n2. Table 3 is very dense and not easy to parse. I strongly recommend converting it to the same format as Figure 2 for (a) easy comparison with Figure 2 to measure the impact of additional loss terms and (b) Visual Interpretation of the results.\n3. It is unclear how this method scales to say the ImageNet dataset with 1000 categories and a ResNet-101 model with penultimate layer of size 2048. The additional terms might be too expensive at such scale for training. Any thoughts/comments?\n\nMINOR COMMENTS:\n1. NAS in Deep Learning Literature has been commonly used for Neural Architecture Search. I would recommend not using NAS for Natural Attribute-based Shift as well.\n2. In Introduction: \"benchmark datasets in vision, language, and medical for NAS detection\". The word \"medical\" is incomplete here. I think you mean medical domain?\n3. In Section 4.2, paragraph \"Experimental Settings\", why use ResNet-18 instead of the more common ResNet-50?\n4. In Figure 2, add a note saying Higher is better? Also, for all the figures (a), (b) and (c), the AUROC is at 0.5 for D_I. I could not find any text explaining if some normalization was done for the results or if these are raw AUROC values.\n5. In Section 5.1, why use PCA instead of something like t-SNE?\n6. In Figure 3, can you change it to show NAS_class1 and NAS_class2 as well please? That will be more informative compared to just NAS shown right now.\n7. Why not include Gram matrix and Energy score in Figure 2 analysis?",
            "summary_of_the_review": "Correctness: 4\nTechnical Novelty and Significance: 3 (I am debating between 3 and 4 for the final review. I think the NAS problem is clearly identified and the datasets curated for it are novel but the problem itself, of OOD, is not novel. There are more empirical insights than theoretical ones for the paper. I might change this rating based on the other reviews / discussions).\nEmpirical Novelty and Significance: 4 (I am debating between 3 and 4 for the final review. I think the total sum of contributions: detailed analysis, identification of the NAS scenarios, and additional loss terms to Mahanalobis detector make it novel & significant even if some parts may not be. I might change this rating based on the other reviews / discussions).\n\nOverall Rating: Weak Accept\nGiven the strengths and weaknesses of the paper mentioned above, I recommend an Weak Accept for the paper. It has good contributions with the NAS problem & relevant datasets to test it. It also presents a good analysis of existing OOD methods, their flaws and a potential improvement in one (for the Mahanalobis detector). My main concerns are about the Pose component of NAS and scalability of the proposed modification (new loss terms) which if addressed/responded to in the rebuttal discussion will help me change to an Accept.",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The authors propose a new task named NAS (natural attribute-based shift), which is a sub-task of OOD (out of distribution). Three datasets are designed from existing datasets for the NAS experiment. By visualizing the distribution of category features produced by the model under different datasets using PCA, the authors find three categories for NAS distribution. Total three OOD methods are tested on NAS datasets and show an inconsistency in their performance. Finally, the authors propose to use distance loss and entropy loss to retrain the models to improve the distance-based OOD methods.\n",

Why do the natural properties of age and image brightness make unreliable predictions **more severe**?\n* The experiment setting is weak. It is not convincing to support the claim with just three OOD methods and three binary classification tasks.\n* The acronym for the new task should be distinguished from the abbreviation for the Neural Architecture Search.\n* Table 2 is too far from the paragraph where it was first cited.\n* The formulation in Section 4.2 lacks explanation, making it hard to be reproduced.\n* To make sure the NAS could be detected, the model must be trained by adding extra loss, making the proposed method inefficient. Though the performance has not shown significant degrades, the time cost can not be ignored.\n* The study on different NAS situations is not thorough enough.\n* The authors should also visualize feature distribution after improving the Mahalanobis method using PCA.",
