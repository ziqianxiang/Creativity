            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes a method for goal-conditioned RL that combines three ideas from prior work: bootstrap DQN, hindsight relabeling, and prioritized experience relay. Experiments show that the proposed method outperforms variants of hindsight relabeling.",
            "main_review": "**Significance**: Because the underlying ideas (bootstrap DQN, hindsight relabeling, and prioritized experience relay) are well known, the main criterion for evaluation is the empirical results. The results are quite strong. However, the complexity of the method and its sensitivity to hyperparameters make me a bit skeptical whether the paper will make a lasting impact on the field.\n\n**Correctness**: I had two minor comments about the correctness of the paper:\n\n* Much of the discussion of the paper discussed how hindsight relabeling helps with exploration. I don't think this is correct: exploration is a problem of data collection, while hindsight relabeling is a tool for performing updates using previously-collected data. Hindsight relabeling doesn't (directly) say anything about how the data should be collected.\n* I didn't see bootstrap DQN as a baseline. As prior work has found that using multiple Q functions significantly improves performance (e.g., [1, 4]), I think this is an important baseline to add.\n\n**Originality**: The proposed method is a new combination of old ingredients.\n\n**Clarity**: The paper is mostly clear.\n* I found the discussion of prioritization hard to follow. For example, I didn't understand what \"higher variance first\" means in Fig 5.\n* The related work section lacks structure. I'd recommend organizing the related work thematically, and making sure that the commonality is clear.\n\n**Minor comments**:\n\n* \"non-negative reward\" -> \"non-zero reward\" (The agent could be getting negative dense rewards)\n* \"often fail to perform well in sparse rewards environments\" -- Cite.\n* \"A brilliant ...\" -- Cite [2], which predates the HER paper by ~25 years.\n* \"uniformly sampling one of them, as HER did\" -- The HER paper actually tried many different sampling strategies, including strategies that sampled multiple goals. Check out the appendix of the HER paper.\n* When discussing prior work in the introduction and in Sec. 4.1, I'd recommend citing [1, 4] and other recent papers that use multiple Q functions.\n* \"Both these methods don't work well ...\" -- Cite.\n* \"Goal-Conditioned Supervised Learning\" -- Cite [3], too.\n* \"the rewards in goal-conditioned environments are sparse\" -- Actually define what the reward function is in an equation.\n* \"subtly applies\" -> \"applies\". The application isn't subtle.\n* I found Lines 5 and 8 of Alg 1 unclear.\n* I found Fig 2 hard to interpret. Are there alternative ways of presenting the same data that more succinctly convey the same message?\n* \"sparse and non-negative ... reward of -1\" -- Contradiction: the reward isn't non-negative if it is -1 for some states and actions.\n* \"acorss\" -> \"across\"\n\n\n[1] Lee, Kimin, et al. \"Sunrise: A simple unified framework for ensemble learning in deep reinforcement learning.\" International Conference on Machine Learning.

My two main concerns with the paper are (1) whether most of the empirical benefits are coming from the ensemble and (2) the clarity of the writing.

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper aims to improve learning efficiency for Hindsight Experience Replay(HER). Instead of learning with a fixed proportion of fake and original data like HER does, this paper proposes to adopt the multiple head structure used in Bootstrapped DQN and then utilize the uncertainty measured by the variance of multiple estimated Q-values so as to weight the prioritization of each transition. Specifically, the proposed BHER enhances the importance of data samples with lower uncertainty, and thus achieves a trade-off between exploration and exploitation, resulting in a higher sample efficiency.",
            "main_review": "Strengths:\n- the idea is simple and easy to implement;\n- the BHER can achieve a significant improvement across different tasks;\n\nweakness:\n- This paper claims that BHER can achieve a trade-off between exploration and exploitation about the hindsight experience, but there are not strong enough evidence (empirical or theoretical) to support this claim. Though the experiments in Appendix.D try to show this trade-off, the results can't convince me, Figure.8 only shows that the multiple head principle can have a better exploration about the goal than HER, and the BHER(multiple head principle with prioritization) have the best exploration about the goal, it doesn't show BHER scarifices the exploration so as to improve the exploitation;\n- Most of the performance improvement is due to multiple head principle, the counterintuitive prioritization can only slightly improve the performance in most environments. So the reason behind the counterintuitive prioritization should be further investigated. \n\nsome questions and typos:\n1. the caption of the last figure in Appendix should be 'Figure 8' instead os 'Figure 7';\n2. About the experiment setting, this paper first said that the reward was sparse and non-negative, however, this is contrast to the setting that the agent gets a reward of 0 only when it reaches desired goal, otherwise it receives a reward of -1. \n",
            "summary_of_the_review": "The paper is built on the observation that  achieving different goals may need different pseduo success trajectories which are unfortunately not provided by the naive HER algorithm. The paper then provides a straightforward solution to this by adding a Boostrapped DQN onto HER so as to allow it explore deeper and be able to evaluate the goodness of a pseduo trajectory for different goals.  Although this idea is shown work well compared to the naive HER, I think that further more principled solution may be needed.",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "# Summary & Contributions\n* The authors call attention to sparse-reward, goal-based tasks where Hindsight Experience Replay, through its provision of relabeled goals for otherwise failed experiences facilitates efficient learning.\n* To further improve upon HER, the paper focuses on two algorithmic innovations: (1) maintaining multiple actor-critic pairs inspired by BootstrappedDQN and (2) applying a variant of prioritized experience replay that draws samples from the replay buffer inversely proportional to the current Q-value variance under the critic ensemble.\n* The authors support their approach with comparative experiments to other variants of HER as well as ablation studies of their own proposed method.",
            "main_review": "### Quality\n* #### Strengths\n    * The authors seem to have picked up on something interesting in paying attention to how transitions are sampled during the course of HER. Empirically, their approach seems to provide reasonable to modest gains across various continuous control tasks. \n* #### Weaknesses\n    * ##### Major\n        * The authors have some fundamental issues and misconceptions about the BootstrappedDQN (BootDQN) algorithm. Section 2 mentions that BootDQN addresses exploration by running multiple behavior policies in the environment; if so, then it would be true that the method would have no reason to solve sparse reward tasks a priori as described by the authors. However, the reason for BootDQN's success in exploration is because of posterior sampling [8] and the fact that the ensemble is an approximate posterior over the optimal action-value function of the MDP, conditioned on all agent interactions observed thus far. It is precisely this principle that allows the algorithm to address sparse-reward tasks [2]. The authors' description of Thompson sampling in BootDQN as an ad-hoc heuristic seems incorrect given the rigorous theoretical guarantees that accompany randomized least-squares value-iteration algorithms [3]. The authors are also confused about the use of replay buffers in BootDQN, claiming that data from each head is held separate. There is exactly one replay buffer used in BootDQN and Bernoulli masks are sampled and stored with each transition for implementing the statistical bootstrap. Overall, the connection the authors draw with BootDQN in this work seem rather disingenuous; the proposed algorithm is simply applying ensembles of actor-critic pairs with no connection to the statistical bootstrap, unlike BootDQN. Renaming the algorithm and rephrasing the contribution seem appropriate.\n        * A more critical issue concerning BootDQN and the proposed BHER algorithm is that the former is a purely value-based RL algorithm that maintains a posterior distribution over the optimal action-value function. In contrast, the latter is an off-policy actor-critic algorithm where, naturally, the critic is meant to be an estimate of the action-value function induced by the actor policy. While the empirical results of this paper confirm empirical benefits of this ensembling heuristic (the ablation in Figure 5 shows that this is responsible for most of the BHER performance), the authors have offered no real justification for this ensemble actor-critic algorithm. What is the point of representing epistemic uncertainty over the actor and critic in this manner? \n        * I don't find the so-called counterintuitive prioritization to be counterintuitive at all. It seems natural that hindsight transitions will serve the agent well only when there is little uncertainty in the associated optimal behavior under the relabeled goal. Can the authors explain why sampling based on higher variance seems to still maintain reasonable performance in three of seven environments shown in Figure 5?\n\t* ##### Minor\n\t\t* In the first paragraph of Section 4.2, the authors describe an instance of Prioritized Experience Replay (PER) [6] where the variance of the critic ensemble is used to prioritize transitions sampled from the replay buffer. They seem to confuse this technique with methods for intrinsic motivation [7] based on curiosity and Random Network Distillation.\n\n### Clarity\n* #### Strengths\n    * The authors provide ample details about their experimental setup for reproducibility of their results.\n* #### Weaknesses\n    * ##### Major\n        * Overall, the paper is not well written. There are numerous grammatical errors throughout, genuinely too many for me to sensibly list them all out here. Oftentimes, these errors are missing articles (for example, \"it uses successful trajectories generated by agent as expert demonstrates\") or incorrect phrases (\"on the contrast\", \"we inference all the Q-values\"). Normally, I wouldn't bother nitpicking at a small handful of these, but there are too many throughout the entire body for what may end up being a published conference paper.\n\t* ##### Minor\n\t\t* The authors should remove the phrase \"importance sampling\" that is used twice in the paper to, in my reading, talk about the importance of sampled goals, rather than the Monte-Carlo technique of the same name.\n\n### Originality\n* #### Strengths\n    * The authors demonstrate a good instinct in examining how other techniques used in deep reinforcement learning might further improve the efficacy of HER.\n* #### Weaknesses\n    * ##### Major\n        * Fundamentally, this paper rests on the idea of using ensembles and prioritized experience replay together, neither of which is new to (deep) reinforcement learning [1,4,5,9]. Though I do not know of any prior work that has explored this specific combination, it would not surprise me if such prior work already exists.\n        * More importantly, there are other options for leveraging such ensembles that have not been addressed in this work [1,4]. Similarly, the authors only consider variance-based prioritization schemes, rather than the traditional prioritization based on TD-error or any recent variants of PER. Demonstrating that the authors' specific choices in the proposed approach are better than these existing approaches to ensembling and PER would dramatically improve what so far seems to be a rather incremental algorithm.\n\t* ##### Minor\n\t\t* While it is appropriate for the related work section to focus on HER, it should also acknowledge the two fundamental innovations of this paper (ensembles and prioritization schemes) and provide an overview of related work for these areas as well.\n\n### Significance\n* #### Strengths\n    * The only positive I can glean from this paper are the empirical results which seem to support the use of ensembling in actor-critic algorithms. Figure 5 shows a marginal drop in performance when the proposed counterintuitive prioritization scheme is not used. That said, it is not clear that this paper advances our understanding of ensembling in deep RL any more than prior work.\n* #### Weaknesses\n    * ##### Major\n        * Given the lack of comparisons mentioned above, it's difficult to assess how impactful the proposed approach will be. With the breadth of existing work on the topic, I'm unconvinced that this will add any novel insights into how practitioners use ensemble methods in reinforcement learning. The prioritization scheme, while slightly interesting on the surface, doesn't seem to be a critical ingredient to the proposed algorithm's success based on the ablation studies shown. \n        * I don't believe any of the experiments have shown results for regular DDPG without the use of HER. Having this baseline in place is important as it communicates the extent to which HER is even necessary for achieving a reasonable level of performance in each of the examined environments.\n\t* ##### Minor\n\t\t* \n\n# References\n1.

While their fifth point is true, I would respond to the other points as (1) there is actually no use or examination of the statistical bootstrap in this work as the ensembles rely solely on random initializations, BootDQN also does not distinguish data sources, and there are other principled means of addressing exploration through ensembles such as UCB (2) while the proposed prioritization is new, there are many others that also do not depend on the environment (TD-error) which have not been assesssed (3) the combination is largely uninteresting based on ablation studies in this work which show near negligible impact of the proposed prioritization scheme and (4) I don't believe DDPG (with or without HER) holds state-of-the-art for these Mujoco domains; I would suspect that lies with either Soft Actor Critic or TD3.\n\nTaken together, I don't believe this paper is ready for publication at this time.\n\n\n\n======= Post Rebuttal =======\n\nI thank the authors for their response but the justifications for the utility of representing epistemic uncertainty and lack of baselines are shallow;  it's clear that substantial revisions are needed before the submission is ready for publication.",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper looks at the problem of goal-conditioned reinforcement learning, and focuses specifically on the problem of prioritizing replay in conjunction with hindsight experience replay (HER).\nIt does so by using the idea of multiple heads in the actor-critic policy and critic networks, inspired by bootstrapped DQN. These different heads are initialized separately, and are also used to induce deep exploration in the style of bootstrapped DQN.\n\nThe main idea is to use the variance in the q-values across the heads for different transitions when prioritizing transitions to use for learning. The algorithm, termed counterintuitive prioritization, prioritizes transitions with lower variance. An example on the reacher environment is used to illustrate why this counterintuitive prioritization assists learning, and hypothesizes that it is based on a tradeoff between exploration and exploitation.\n\nExperiments are performed in two simpler environments (Point 2D and Reacher) and 5 environments simulating different robots (Fetch, Sawyer, and Hand). They compare with two algorithms that prioritize transitions for replay based on some other criteria, and show that the counterintuitive prioritization along with deep exploration due to multiple heads leads to faster improvement in success rate of reaching goals in terms of interactions with the environment.\n\nAblations try to tease apart whether this improvement is due to the improved exploration due to multiple heads or the better exploitation due to the counterintuitive prioritization.",
            "main_review": "## High level comments\n### Strengths\n* Incorporating the idea of multiple heads from bootstrapped DQN for goal-conditioned RL (GCRL) and then also using those multiple heads to also prioritize replay is a sensible extension of the idea to GCRL.\n* The counterintuitive prioritization needed when using the variance of the Q-values for prioritization is an interesting effect that is evaluated empirically with a possible explanation that it balances exploration and exploitation. This empirical example comparing the variance in Q-values in HER vs the original samples is helpful to see why the lower variance samples should be helpful.\n\n### Weaknesses:\n* The paper focuses on this counterintuitive prioritization in the experiments. This focus is understandable since that is the novel aspect introduced in the paper. However, it is unclear whether the improved performance by BHER is due to the deep exploration due to multiple heads or this counterintuitive prioritization. The ablation that removes the prioritization seems to still perform almost as well, suggesting that most of the improvement is due to the improved exploration.\n\nThe above reason is why I am unconvinced about the experimental validation. Perhaps an additional ablation of BHER without the deep exploration would highlight the efficacy of the counterintuitive prioritization.\n\nAlso see below for questions about other comparisons.\n\n## Detailed Comments\n\n* Since the bootstrapped heads improve the exploration of the agent, I wonder how this exploration stacks up to other exploration techniques in this domain. For example, would it be better than the directed exploration induced by [1]? I understand that this paper is very recent, but comparison to some other exploration enhancing mechanisms would be good.\n* The approach of using multiple heads and the variance in Q-values for picking samples seems related to [2]. Could authors clarify the difference, and why this method was not compared to in baselines?\n* Section 4.2, which goes over the counterintuitive prioritization and why it is needed, is enlightening but also lacking. The comparison of the variance when using HER and when considering just samples from the environment show that HER samples have lower variance. The paper points out that this discrepancy could be due to the higher proportion of successful trajectories due to hindsight. This analysis is reasonable. But then the authors suggest that prioritizing higher variance samples would be similar to sampling without hindsight. My question is: What would happen if you only sampled higher variance samples from the relabeled experience, and sampled uniformly from the  true experience? Wouldn't that ensure that original samples are not sampled out of proportion?\n* Secondly, by prioritizing lower variance samples, does BHER just sample more from relabeled experience?\n* In the experiments, the Fetch robot task used for evaluation is just the Reach environment, similar to the Reacher task. Evaluation on some actual manipulation tasks such as Push or Pick and Place would be a better evaluation in this domain. This is a small nitpick, the other experiments deal with more challenging tasks. It just seems like the FetchReach task is not bringing much to the table, except nominally adding a domain.\n* As mentioned earlier, in the ablations, BHER without deep exploration would be a good one to have. And in those figures, the baseline DDQN should also be plotted, to show the improvement.\n\n## Minor Comments\n* More preciseness in the problem setup (Section 3.1) would be appreciated. As it stands, this setup would be hard for someone not familiar with reinforcement learning literature to parse.\n* Typo: Section 4.1, line 2\n\n\n[1] - Adversarial Intrinsic Motivation for Reinforcement Learning, Durugkar et al., 2021\n[2] - Automatic Curriculum Learning through Value Disagreement , Zhang et al., 2020",
