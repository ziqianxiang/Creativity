        "comment": "In this paper, the authors propose to use segmentation priors for black-box attacks such that the perturbations are limited in the salient region. They also find that state-of-the-art black-box attacks equipped with segmentation priors can achieve much better imperceptibility performance with little reduction in query efficiency and success rate. Hence, the auithors propose the Saliency Attack, a new gradient-free black-box attack, that can further improve the imperceptibility by refining perturbations in the salient region.\nThe reviewers think that the proposed method is simple and important, and the authors have responded properly to some comments. \nHowever, the reviewers still are not satisfied with the experimental evaluation and comparisons, as the authors can only try to compare with other ideas and test more models in the future.\nIn summary, I think the manuscript at its current staus cannot be accepted."

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes a black-box attack where, by relying on segmentation priors, the perturbation is applied only in the salient region. This allows one to obtain reduce perceptibility with a limited number of queries and a small reduction in success rate. More specifically, once the salient region has been identified, a refining procedure is carried out to find small areas where the perturbation should be added. Experiments are performed on ImageNet and results are compared with those of some SOTA methods and their variants that work on saliency regions.",
            "main_review": "This work tackles an important problem, that is, developing an imperceptible black-box attack. However, there are two main issues concerning the technical approach and the experimental analysis.  \n\n- From a technical point of view the search algorithm devised to refine perturbation is exceedingly naive. It is based on an iterative procedure that resembles quadtree analysis in image processing. The first split of the salient region generates four initial blocks, and a perturbation is added to them to find those that maximize the loss function. After finding the best block, it is further split and the procedure is repeated until the block is reduced to one pixel or no smaller blocks can achieve a better loss. Then, this same procedure is applied again to the second best block, etc. As it is described, this procedure has neither a theoretical nor an experimental justification. In addition, a similar idea but applied in a different context can be found in Guo et al. (2020) and saliency maps to add adversarial attacks are also explored in Sun et al. (2021). Overall, I feel that the contribution is not significant in terms of technical approach.\n\n- The approach is not compared with other black-box attacks that also have the objective to make the perturbation imperceptible, see references below. In fact, experiments are carried out by modifying some SOTA approaches by including saliency regions and comparing them with the proposed solution (see Table 2). In my opinion this is too limited to validate the proposal. \n\nTypos: imperceptiblity, tunning\n\nReferences\n- Guo et al. Watch out!

However, I still believe that the paper needs much more comparisons with state-of-the-art and that the proposal should be better justified from a theoretical point of view. ",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper studies how to reduce the perceptibility of the perturbations to the original images produced by black-box adversarial attacks (for the $\\ell_\\infty$-threat model). In particular, it proposes to use a prior based on segmentation techniques to localize the changes on the subject of the image and leave the background unaltered. Moreover, the Saliency Attack is introduced to further reduce the fraction of the original image which is modified to induce misclassification.",
            "main_review": "Strengths\n- The proposed method is simple and achieves the goal of improving the imperceptibility of the perturbations: using the segmentation prior is effective for avoiding changes on the background, and the Saliency Attack attains better MAD score.\n\n- Several ablation studies are presented to illustrate the proposed method.\n\nWeaknesses\n- The paper focuses on improving the imperceptibility of $\\ell_\\infty$-attacks with a fixed budget $\\epsilon=0.05$, in practice reducing the number of pixels perturbed (a sort of minimization of the $\\ell_0$-norm). However, I think that how visible the perturbations are is more a property of the threat model (set of feasible changes) rather than of the attack used: for example, using a smaller $\\epsilon$ for the same attacks would increase their imperceptibility. Moreover, other $\\ell_p$-norms (e.g. Square Attack has versions for $\\ell_2$ and $\\ell_1$ [A]), including $\\ell_0$, or perceptual metrics like LPIPS [B] should be considered, since they produce more localized changes than $\\ell_\\infty$-attacks.\n\n- There are a few works which aim at finding which areas of an image the attacker should perturb to have invisible changes, both with black- and white-box attacks [C, D]. In particular, [C] show that small perturbations in the $\\ell_\\infty$-norm are not necessary if limited to certain areas to the image to preserve imperceptibility.\n\n- The presentation of the method in Algorithms 1 and 2 seems a bit confuse: first, $\\delta$ is not defined. Second, the \"Refine\" function is called recursively on smaller blocks, but also repeatedly with smaller $k$ in Algorithm 2: is this correct? Also, in Line 9 $k$ is halved: shouldn't it be restarted from the original value when going over the next iteration of the loop in L4?\n\n- From the images in Figure 4 it seems that for Parsimonious and Square Attack perturbations are sampled also on areas which are outside the mask given by the segmentation prior: are those candidates evaluated, spending queries of the total budget (although they can't change the current perturbations)?\n\n[A] https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01208\n[B] https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12655\n[C] https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05040\n[D] https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.13773",
            "summary_of_the_review": "Overall, I think the proposed method is effective, but, especially given that the technical novelty is limited, it should be better positioned: if the main goal is imperceptibility of the perturbations it should be compared to other kinds of attacks beyond $\\ell_\\infty$ ones.

However, these techniques produce examples that a human in the loop can quickly identify.

In addition to this, they also present a technique that improves the imperceptibility without forgoing the query efficiency.",

They also demonstrate that adversarial examples generated by their technique have a higher success rate for evading detection mechanisms.\n \nIn the recent past, a richer class of gradient-free black-box techniques have been proposed in the literature. Why is the paper considering only two of those? For instance, why not consider techniques based on Bayesian optimisation. The same applies to methods for detecting adversarial examples. Why was Feature Squeezing chosen as a baseline to evaluate the success rate?\n\nIn addition to the above, the author(s) report the results only over a sample of 1000 images from ImageNet, why only such a small sample was considered, and I would also encourage the authors to evaluate over multiple samples & report the variance too.",

Moreover, its technical contribution is not very high.\n\nThe motivation of generating the perturbed regions in the salient object region is not sufficiently justified: salient object can still be mostly a\nsmooth low frequency area, e.g., smooth human face/skin, and hence generating the perturbation in this area may not be reasonable. Moreover, it is not clear whether generating perturbation in salient object area makes more sense than generating perturbations in the non-smoothness, high frequency, or  heavy texture area. \n\nThe experiment part is not totally convincing. 1) There is only one data set, which is 1000 images from ImageNet. However, what these images look like will affect the results a lot. For example, does most salient objects have heavy texture area? 2) Also, there is no comparison to the related method in approach of Zhang (2020). 3) I can not find the information of which classification network is used in the experiments.
