        "comment": "This paper studies the problem of learning single-layer neural networks under Gaussian marginals in the presence of outliers. The authors give a recovery algorithm in this setting. The consensus among the reviewers was that the paper lacks technical depth. Specifically, the algorithm is a minor tweak of the one in Wu et al. 2019 for the case without outliers. Another concern was that the algorithm does not recover the prior result when the fraction of uncorrupted points goes to 0. Overall, the paper is below the acceptance threshold."

This paper essentially follows the same two step procedure as in [1] and use a robust gradient estimation procedure over it which is also a common tool used in the robust statistics literature.\n- The main theorem - Theorem 4.3 statement is really hard to understand. Particularly, I see that the error does not go down to 0 even with infinite number of samples and time. There is a pi(2-p)3 term which does not go down to 0. Also, [1] proved a lower bound of 1/epsilon^2 but this paper gives an upper bound of 1/epsilon? Can the authors please clarify this part? In general, I think the writing of the paper could be improved. ",

            "main_review": "Strengths\n+ The paper is well written.\n+ The techniques in this paper are fairly natural and intuitive (for the specific assumptions made in this paper -- see below.)\n+ The results make sense and are consistent with existing results for learning single-layer NNs without outliers.\n\nWeaknesses\n- The algorithm (rather strongly) depends on the i.i.d. Gaussianity assumption of the input data, which -- of course -- is unrealistic in practice. I admit that it is not uncommon to see such assumptions in theory-focused papers, but that's a larger criticism beyond this paper. For this particular case however, it's hard to envision how the techniques would generalize to more realistic situations -- the Williamson-Shmoys angle estimates according to (11) only hold true for i.i.d. Gaussian inputs.\n- I'm a bit confused about the claim about learnability. The main results are for learning WW' where W is the weight matrix, but in the intro the authors talk about sample complexity of learning the network parameters. How could that translate to learning W up to epsilon relative error (and how would sample complexity be affected in this case?)\n- I'm a bit confused about the utility of Algorithm 2 (and Proposition 4.1). Isn't it just univariate Gaussian estimation with outliers, and if yes, why propose a new method and not just use existing robust estimators? \n- It may be helpful to clarify the 'r' hyperparameter in Algorithm 2, and how it affects the constants in Prop 4.1 and the sample complexity.\n\n---\nThanks for the response.

            "main_review": "This is a well-defined problem and the authors make an improvement on previous works on learning the parameters in generative models, which all (to my knowledge) avoided the existence of outliers.  At a technical level, the argument has nearly-exact parallels with the procedure of Wu et al., with a small modification for accoutning for outliers that involves swapping the gradient estimate the median and trimmed mean.  It appears to me that the current result does not recover the Wu et al. result as the probability p of uncorruption tends to 1, which is weird (see below; please correct me if I'm wrong).  The presentation also had some issues making it difficult to determine how accurate the parameter estimation really is.  These are the main reasons I'm leaning towards rejection.\n\nA few concrete comments I'm hoping the authors can address:\n\n(1) Is it the case that the current result does not recover the parameters as p --> 1?  In Theorem 4.3, for p=1, the second term doesn't appear to go to zero, since one will be left with a 3 pi ||W||_F^2 term.  Compare this with Theorem 1 of Wu et al.  \n\n(2) The statements of Theorem 4.3 and Propositions 4.1/4.2 seem incomplete.  Where is the quantifier for epsilon?  The appearance of the \\Psi terms is also confusing and not really remarked upon in any detail, although they seem key, and the lack of placement of epsilon in the statement of the results makes it harder to tell what is going on.   This may be related to the fact that the discussion following the statement of Theorem 4.3 talks about the \"first term\" and the \"second term\", but the quantities mentioned do not actually appear as direct quantities in the theorem statement.  \n\n(3) The appendix is structured oddly.  There are no formal statements of lemmas/theorems; there are only \"Steps\" presented on page 12, and then claimed proofs for the \"steps\" in the subsequent sections.  This made it hard to verify the veracity of many of the claims.  There should be precise, formal statements of results so that the reader can verify the proofs.  \n\nFor instance: in Appendix A.1.3. it seems that the authors are only proving the result for the median filter (assuming this is what med{.} denotes), although the results are claimed for both the trimmed mean and the median filter.  Is there a proof for the trimmed mean somewhere?  Can the authors give some more details on how precisely (47)-(50) are derived? \n\n(4) The authors should be more explicit about how the estimation procedure nearly identically mimics that of Wu et al., with the difference being the outlier-robust mean estimation.  If I had not previously read the Wu et al. paper, it would not have been clear from the text how indebted the present work is to Wu et al.\n\n\nSome other minor comments/typos encountered while reading:\n\n* p.1, \"...datasets impacted by a Byzantine\" -- not sure what this refers to?\n\n* p.2, \"adversial\"\n\n* p.3, \"RVe x\"\n\n* Regarding the assumption that the bias is negative: Claim 2 of Wu et al. shows that having negative bias would require exponential sample complexity.\n\n* Where is \\tilde g_x defined in algorithm 2?\n\n*p. 9 and experiments: why is it that the p=0.95 case is so bad for standard gradient descent?  This seems unusual.  Presumably this is using the batch-splitting approach, so there is randomization induced by which samples appear first in the algorithm.  Did the authors average over different realizations of the batches?  \n\n* In the appendix, g_t appears everywhere but seems to refer to \\tilde g_t.  Are these the same?\n\n\n",
