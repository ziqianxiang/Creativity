        "comment": "This paper aims to address the imbalanced class problem in unsupervised domain adaptation. The challenge lies in how to handle the difficulties introduced by imbalanced classes. To this end, this work proposes a new data augmentation strategy by taking the interpolation of two samples from the same class but from different domains as the augmented samples. The experiments demonstrate promising performance on the class-imbalanced domain adaptation datasets.\n\nHowever, there are several concerns raised by the reviewers. 1) The interpolation between a source and target sample of the same class can potentially be unreliable as the pseudo label methods. 2) Some statements are based on intuition but not well supported by either theoretical analysis or experimental evaluations. 3) The proposed method is inferior to baseline methods on some datasets, it would be helpful to have further analysis of the advantages and limitations of the proposed method. \n\nOverall, the paper provides some new and interesting ideas. However, given the above concerns, the novelty and significance of the paper will degenerate. More discussions on the principles behind the proposed method and more experimental studies are needed. Addressing the concerns needs a significant amount of work. Although we think the paper is not ready for ICLR in this round, we believe that the paper would be a strong one if the concerns can be well addressed."

Specifically, the adversarial samples are generated from the interpolated line of the aligned pairwise source domain samples and target domain samples. The generated adversarial data can augment the training data and help enhance the robustness of models.",
            "main_review": "\n- Since the target domain is unlabeled, the interpolation between a source sample and a target sample of the same class is not reliable, which may face the same error accumulation issue as the pseudo-labeling methods. If the pseudo-label is not correct, the augmented data may not only cause the error accumulation but also damage the domain alignment.\n\n- How does the interpolated adversarial sample generation method deal with the data imbalance issue in the target domain? It seems that the generation process that generates data merely resorts to the guidance of the class probability of the source domain data. \n\n- The interpolation method looks quite general, will this method also work well on the UDA problem?\n\n- In experiments, more discussions are required for explaining why the proposed method performs worse than Sentry (Prabhu et al., 2021).\n",

Different from vanilla unsupervised domain adaptation, the label distributions of different distributions are quite different in CDA. The proposed PAT approach mainly consists of two part, centroid alignment (CA) and interpolated adversarial samples (IAS). Experiments on several benchmarks verify the effectiveness of PAT for the CDA problem. ",

For example, the subsets of the VISDA-2017 dataset are not label-balanced, PAT could be compared with recent UDA methods [a-b] directly w.r.t. the per-class accuracy.\n\n[a].

And the results in Table 4 only show 3 out of 6 tasks on the OfficeHome dataset, and the contribution of IAS seems not significant (I think IAS is main contribution of this paper).\n\n4. minor concerns: how to determine the parameters like \\alpha and \\beta within PAT, results in Fig.7 show PAT is somewhat sensitive to these parameters.
