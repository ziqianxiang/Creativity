        "comment": "The paper gives a framework for learning temporal logic rules from noisy unlabeled data. The key novelty is a formulation of combinatorial rule search as an end-to-end differentiable problem. The method is evaluated on a video dataset and a healthcare dataset. \n\nThe reviewers liked the high-level ideas behind the paper. However, the conclusion was that the experimental results, while interesting, are still somewhat preliminary (in particular, the baselines are weak).  I agree with this point and am recommending rejection this time around. However, I urge the authors to develop the paper further and submit to the next deadline."

Do you need an atomic event predictor or human label to use your proposed system? If so, is it possible to extend your framework to directly have video as input instead of event probability distributions?  Can you do end2end training from raw inputs, such as video or audio? (although you mentioned Faster R-CNN in the experiment section, it is better to discuss the whole pipeline in the methodology).\n\t\tb. Have you tried discrete event embeddings to represent the atomic and composite events so as the framework can learn distributional embedding representation of events so as to learn the temporal rules?\n\t4.

            "summary_of_the_review": "This is a good initial attempt to attack the neural temporal logic programming. However, the steps in the proposal --- temporal compression, predicate modeling, composite event prediction, combinatorial inference, and rule reduction --- requires more clarity and refinement to reach a publication state. Overall, the proposal has little element of neural networks. To me it is more on matrix formulation of ILP problem. It is Okay to me but please consider renaming the paper title. ",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper proposes an end-to-end differentiable strategy (called neural TLP) to learn unknown temporal relations between atomic events (like after(miss, swing), “miss occurs after swing” in the baseball example), subsequently used to predict composite events (like strike). The strategy consists of a cascade of a smoothing stage to filter  out noise from the input time series, an interval time extractor, a stage predicting temporal relations (such as before, after and during) and a linear output layer. Furthermore, the paper proposes a post-hoc procedure to extract propositional logical rules relating atomic events to composite ones from the last layer. The performance of the proposed strategy is evaluated on video recognition (CATER) and healthcare (MIMIC-III) datasets against two baselines, namely a LSTM neural net and a simplified version of the proposed strategy.",
            "main_review": "**Strengths**\n\n- The paper is well written.\n- The proposed solutions, namely the differentiable layers to predict the temporal relations between atomic events and the post-hoc strategy to induce propositional rules from the last linear layer, are simple but non trivial.\n- Results are promising.\n\n**Weaknesses**\n\n- It is not clear how the work positions with respect to recent literature in spatio-temporal reasoning and video question answering. For example, the authors should have a look at [1]-[2]\n- While experimental results are interesting and promising, they provide only a partial picture, as they neglect recent neural advances. Indeed, comparisons are made against only simple baselines and should be conducted against more “structured” neural approaches, see for instance graph-based approaches [1]-[2], where code is available.\n\n**Questions**\n\n1. How scalable is the proposed strategy in terms of number of objects, number of atomic events and compositionality of the target events?\n2. As far as I understand, the proposed strategy considers only the temporal relations among atomic events and objects are considered independent of each other. Is that correct? If so, why is that the case?\n3. While I understand the intuition about the strategy to extract the time intervals of atomic events (as shown in Figure 3), I do not see how well this strategy can perform in the continuous and more noisy setting. How reliable are the obtained estimates?\n4. In CATER experiments, is the perception component (i.e. Faster R-CNN) trained jointly to the Neural TLP  or are two components trained separately?\n5. The names parameter and structure learning are a bit confusing in this context. In their classical definition, parameter learning considers learning the parametric relations among variables in a given graph. In Neural TLP, the temporal relations are not given, rather learnt. Why is this considered as parameter learning?\n6. Can you mention something about the logic expressiveness of the induced rules?",

I like the idea around the proposed differentiable operators used to predict the temporal relations among atomic events. Also, the experimental results are interesting and promising. However, they are preliminary. I would like to see more in-depth analysis on the correcteness of the time intervals for atomic events, the scalability of the proposed strategy and a comparison against recent structured neural approaches for spatio-temporal reasoning. Furthermore, the authors should discuss and relate their work against existing literature in the field of video question answering.",

            "main_review": "The paper addresses an important problem of learning temporal rules from data, for which many applications exist (as the paper convincingly motivates). \n\nA very strong point of the paper is to learn interpretable rules using modern neural network machinery. This can certainly inspire future work. \n\nThe paper is not always easy to follow. It would have been useful to more explicitly state the aims of the proposed method. For example, on page 4 the paper refers to Temporal Relation Networks, but they are dismissed because \"timelines can be long in our setting\", yet, it is not clear what this refers to. For me, it was also quite unnatural to say that composite events are a-temporal (e.g. in the baseball\nexample on page 2). Why does it make sense that you cannot say anything about the timeline of the 'strike' event? Also in the remainder of Section 3.1, various choices are made, which were not all obvious to me. \n\nIn the structure learning part, I was missing the connection to probabilistic rule learning approaches (e.g. ProbFOIL). The essence\nseems to be to learn rules where the temporal atoms have a probability attached to it, unless I am missing something.\n\nIn the evaluation, the paper convincingly shows that variations of the proposed method performs less well. What was not convincing to me\nwere two aspects:\n(1) Why previous approaches are unsuitable for the proposed settings, e.g. probabilistic rule-learning, sequence mining, etc. \n(2) I have doubts about the validity of the medical example. For example, isn't it the case that 'oral water' is simply responsible for \nurine flow rather than after(oral_water, spo2_sao2=high) ? I can understand that a doctor would say that you \"captured important explanatory variables\" in the proposed rules, but that does not mean that it is in any way true. In fact: doesn't this show a downside of the approach in the sense that only temporal events can be used in rules?\n",
