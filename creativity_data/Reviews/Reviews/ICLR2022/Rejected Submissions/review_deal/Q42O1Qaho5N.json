        "comment": "This paper presents a generative model for geometric graphs.  The main contribution is to separate the representation and generation of geometry from that of graph structure and features.  Based on this idea the authors assembled a set of existing ideas and built an auto-encoder style generative model for geometric graphs.\n\nThis paper sits on the borderline, with reviewers split on both sides.  I appreciate the clarifications from the authors during the rebuttal and the interactions with the reviewers.  The main concern is the novelty of this approach, as the main contribution is the idea of separating geometry from graph structure, and most other components of the pipeline already exist in the literature.  Because of this I think the paper can probably devote a bit more to this ablation study.  In particular the paper currently lacks detail about whether the size of the models were controlled when doing the ablation, which could be a confounding factor that explains why the joint model with both geometry and graph structure works better.  Also the different architecture choices may also factor into the difference, it would be more convincing if for example the same combination of multi-head attention blocks and GINE networks are used for the ablated graph encoder (you can simply concatenate the features from both on all layers, or even at the end).\n\nBased on this I would recommend rejection at this time but encourage the authors to improve the paper and send it to the next venue."

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper proposes a generative models for learning over the space of geometric graphs -- those graphs whose nodes are associated with geometric coordinates (point clouds). The point cloud serves as basis for decoding graph structure. This makes the entire system efficient. An extensive suite of experiments on chemical benchmarks (QM9 and ChEBML) show that the proposed method is competitive against state-of-the-art rivals on a variety of measures and tasks.\n",
            "main_review": "Overall this is a well-written paper with clear motivations and description of each model component. The problem of generating geometric graphs is important and the paper demonstrates that the proposed G^3 can leverage both graph structures and the point cloud geometry well. The experiments are extensive and the results are clear with domain-knowledge interpretation.\n\nOn the negative side, it looks like many components of G^3 are be studied before, hence reducing the novelty of the paper.",

The network is comprised of multiple parts which are clearly defined and explained.\nThe numerical experiments indeed show an improvement over other methods, however not in all metrics.\n\nI have a few concerns:\n1. If I understand correctly, the authors choose to first learn the geometry, via template folding (as in FoldingNet), and then, once the node features are learned, use a link prediction mechanism to predict the topology of the graph. To the best of my knowledge, the approach of template folding is bound to its original topology (e.g. genus 0), which is limited. It would be beneficial and enriching if the authors can elaborate on this point. Were other methods considered to learning the geometry, and perhaps the authors can state what is the influence of using such template, which in many cases may not fit to the actual topology of the underlying graph.\n\n2.How did the authors choose the link prediction mechanism? In what sense is it different/better than using something like GAT and its variants ?\n\n3.The authors present their results on 2 popular datasets. However, in order to reach to a more conclusive evidence of the importance and contribution of this work, I would suggest the authors to add more applications, such as learning the geometry and topology of meshes (e.g., ModelNet, ShapeNet). Also, the task of protein folding (e.g., AlphaFold) seems to be appropriate for the suggested method.\n\n",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper studies the problem of geometric graph generation (mainly focusing on molecule graph generation). Specifically, the authors propose a new method,  namely Geometric Graph Generator (G3), which generates three-dimensional geometric graphs. Different from others, G3 can capture both the combinatorial and the geometric information of graphs. The proposed algorithm can successfully generate molecule graphs and runs faster than other baseline methods. The key parts of G3 are the point encoder and graph encoder, and the three-step decoding process, that is the coordinate decode, feature decoder, and finally graph decoder.  The experimental results show that G3 has better performance than other generators in terms of validity, uniqueness, and novelty.\n",
            "main_review": "Strengths: The run time of G3 is impressive compared with strong baselines such as  GraphAF and JT-VAE due to the one-shot nature while obtaining as good in quality as these baseline methods. The designed method may be applied to the application of drug discovery, etc.\n\nWeaknesses: The technical contribution is unclear/limited. The comparison (from both the theoretical side and architecture design side) between G3 and other popular baseline methods is missing. It is unclear why G3 is better than others and why it is so efficient but not other methods. How this designed architecture is useful to guide other works? The other concern is the generalization ability of the proposed method since the proposed method was only tested on two datasets.",
            "summary_of_the_review": "Overall, the problem studied is interesting. The authors aim at designing new NN architecture to generate geometric graphs. The experimental results look promising. Moreover, G3 is much faster than current strong baseline methods. \n\nHowever, the generalization ability of the proposed architecture to other datasets is unknown. The encoding part seems heavily based on other works (similarly decoder parts). Compared with other methods, the reviewer does not see the real novelty part of the technical section.

Works [1][2] at the same period tackle it via matching the representations in the latent space instead of defining reconstruction loss on the data space.

Unclear when interpreting tables 1 & 2. How to determine the angle directions? In comparisons with all the baselines or a certain subset of baselines (e.g., methods without using hard valency checks)?\n3.

More elaborations?\n\n**Comments**\n\n1. What do you mean by the term \"large inner product in 3D\" (page 5)?\n2. It would be helpful to bold the best results in the tables.\n\n**Open Questions**\n\nNot addressing the following comments won't have negative effects on my rating. \nBut it would be nice if the authors can make a few clarifications, which also helps with my understandings!\n1. explorations on the template design in the coordinate decoder\n2. interpretability on the learned geometrical information in the point cloud encoders for molecules (something like [3])\n3. a better (analytical/empirical) way to support the claim that geometry and structure are \"complementary\"?
