        "comment": "I do not recommend accepting this paper, although I make this decision with reservations. The review quality for this paper was not particularly strong, and I wish to emphasize to the authors that I read the paper myself in detail in the process of writing this metareview.\n\nThis paper proposes a new structured pruning technique called LEAN. It involves computing an operator norm of the convolutions in a convolutional neural network, multiplying these norms over paths through the network, and keeping the paths with the highest such values (and pruning everything else). This paper makes the argument that this metric is robust to scaling and prevents network discontinuities. (In this way, the technique is very reminiscent of SynFlow (Tanaka et al., Pruning Neural Networks without any data by iteratively conserving synaptic flow) in terms of motivation and resulting technique, although SynFlow is unstructured. I do not mean this as a criticism - just a suggestion for the authors of a connection they might be able to make in the future.)\n\nOne big concern I have about this paper based on the methodology alone is as follows: the paper states a number of hypotheses about why this is a sensible way to prune (e.g., in the beginning of Section 4). I see no reason why any of these hypotheses are wrong, but the paper never makes an effort to evaluate any of them. I don't mean a theoretical justification here - that's difficult and unlikely to yield useful information about what happens in practice. I mean experiments to ablate the salient properties of the heuristic mentioned in the paragraph at the beginning of Section 4 (Does scaling invariance actually matter in practice? Is network disconnectivity actually a risk in practice?).\n\nMy biggest concerns about the paper, however, are in the evaluation. I share two major reviewer concerns that were mentioned:\n(1) The paper compares to a very limited set of baseline pruning methods, and relatively older ones at that (2019 is indeed old in the world of pruning).\n(2) The paper does not look at standard, \"large-scale\" benchmarks for computer vision - namely, ResNet-50 on ImageNet.\n\nNeither of these concerns is necessarily decisive in my view. For example, with respect to Concern 1, the reviewers unhelpfully do not suggest very many additional structured pruning benchmarks to consider, and I think the additional baselines added during the revision process have softened this concern. I would also recommend taking a look at \"Growing Efficient Deep Networks by Structured Sparsification\" (Yuan et al) for a useful method and a good set of baselines. There are an arbitrary number of baselines one could add and the structured pruning space is a confusing mess, but I think the claims in this paper merit more than are currently present.\n\nWith respect to Concern 2, I'm even more conflicted. On the one hand, I have rarely seen any pruning techniques proposed for or evaluated on vision tasks beyond image classification, despite the fact that - in the real world - segmentation is much more popular than it would seem by reading the ICLR proceedings. To that end, I applaud the authors for focusing on those settings and I see substantial value in a paper that does so. On the other hand, ResNet-50 on ImageNet (among other standard classification benchmarks) is the de facto measuring stick for evaluating pruning methods in computer vision, and the exclusive focus on segmentation here means it is very difficult to compare the proposed technique to other benchmarks. If the paper is to focus on segmentation alone, this places a higher burden on adding many additional comparisons to other methods (i.e., Concern 1). Finally, I don't see any reason why the paper *couldn't* also include ResNet-50 on ImageNet or the like in addition to segmentation; if it is a limitation on the compute available to the authors (something I empathize with), they did not say so in any of the author responses. Upon reading the author responses, I was left asking, \"Why not both?\"\n\nFor those reasons, I do not recommend accepting the paper, although I think there are some good reasons to value the paper's contributions. At the end of the day, there are some relatively simple things that could be changed to make the paper much easier to contextualize within the pruning literature. As of right now, it would be very difficult for me to say whether or in what contexts this method should actually be used in practice.\n\n(P.S. I agree with the reviewers that Figure 3 is exceptionally hard to parse.)"

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The authors propose a structured pruning method which turns structure pruning into a graph pruning problem.  The authors represent each input, output pair as an operator node, with edges measured by operator norms between operators.  The authors then propose an iterative structured pruning algorithm which prunes layers based on the longest path in the graph.  They then evaluate their method on three image segmentation tasks.",
            "main_review": "The method is simple in its approach, which allows the method to be easy to understand.  Suggestions for improvement are minor: Comparisons to additional methods presented in the related work and corresponding benchmarks would strengthen the results (e.g. ResNet per Dong & Yang 2019). Benchmarks for the full network could help better contextualize pruned results. Replicates are presented in a way that is difficult to distinguish methods from one another.  For example it's difficult to distinguish light blue vs gray lines in Figure 3.  Additionally, variability of speedup between training runs is not presented in figure 4. Moreover, the relative number of remaining convolutions metric is presented a bit vaguely.  It's not clear why some panels have these metrics missing.  Additionally, it's not clear how one would calculate what accuracy is used to calculate \"relative number of convolutions at equal accuracy\" for each graph.",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes the LongEst-chAiN (LEAN) method to perform structured pruning of CNN networks. LEAN maps a CNN network to a pruning graph, where every channel of input/output is a node, and every operator is an edge connecting input and output nodes. It uses the operator norms as the weights of edges. Then it prunes the network by keeping the longest path in the graph iteratively until it reaches the target pruning ratio. This paper demonstrates the effectiveness of LEAN pruning by comparing it to two structured pruning methods (structured magnitude pruning, operator norm pruning) across three image segmentation datasets (Simulated Circle-Square dataset, CamVid, Real-world dynamic CT dataset) and three CNN architectures (MS-D, U-Net4, and ResNet50). Experiment results show that LEAN outperforms the other two structured pruning methods as it achieves similar model qualities with much smaller pruning ratios in most cases. Also, the paper shows that a MS-D model pruned with LEAN is 10.9X faster than the unpruned network in practice.",
            "main_review": "Strengths:\n1. The idea of using a graph-based algorithm for structured pruning is novel and interesting. Since LEAN prunes the network by keeping the longest path in the graph, it can use the global pruning ratio without worrying about generating a disconnected network. Therefore, it may prune much more aggressively in some layers than the other two structured pruning methods.\n2. Experiment results show great potentials for LEAN pruning.\n\nWeaknesses:\n1. A primary concern is on the evaluation. (a) The paper only compares LEAN with two naive structured pruning strategies, but not other more advanced methods. (b) The datasets used are too small (e.g., 1000 training examples in the Simulated CS dataset). It is not clear whether applying ResNet50 or U-Net4 is reasonable. Why not use those commonly used datasets (e.g., Cifar10, ImageNet) and networks for evaluation? (c) The speedup results are only shown for an MS-D network on the dynamic X-ray CT dataset. And the paper mentioned that it uses a custom MS-D model which loads only the unpruned filters. Then I wonder what the speedups of networks pruned with other structured pruning methods or unstructured pruning methods are with such customized implementations.\n2. I would like to see some theoretical analysis on why LEAN outperforms the basic structured pruning methods such as structured magnitude pruning or operator norm pruning. It may help make the paper more rigorous.\n3. The authors may want to improve the presentation to better describe the definition of preliminaries and how to construct the pruning graph. Figure 1 (B) is confusing. \n\n\nMinor comments:\n1. The figures are not black/white printer friendly.\n2. Most of the related works discussed in section 2 are those before 2020. I would like to see more discussions on the most recent related pruning works.\n3. It might be better also to report the accuracy/F1-score/mIoU of the unpruned network in the paper.\n4. It would be good to see the structure of the pruned networks with LEAN in either the main paper or the appendix.\n5. In the last paragraph of section 6.1, the paper mentions structured magnitude pruning performs slightly better than LEAN for a few pruning ratios with U-Net4 and the CamVid dataset. But it doesn't give any explanation or discussion.",
            "summary_of_the_review": "Overall, the idea of the paper is novel and interesting, and the experiment results look promising. However, the paper fails to compare LEAN with the most advanced related works on structured pruning. The datasets used in the experiments are too small, and the experimented tasks are not commonly used in CNN pruning works. So it is hard to justify the advances of the proposed pruning method. Also, the presentation of the paper needs to be improved.",
