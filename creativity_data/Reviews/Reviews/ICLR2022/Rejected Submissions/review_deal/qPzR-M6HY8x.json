        "comment": "The paper proposes a new method for the problem of learning under instance-dependent noise (IDN). The idea is to construct a variational approximation to the ideal training objective, which involves learning a single scalar C(x) per instance. In turn, each such scalar is treated as an additional parameter to be learned by the network.\n\nReviewers generally found the basic idea of the proposal to be interesting and novel, with the response clarifying some initial questions on the design of the network to learn C(x). The paper is also well-written, and presents experiments on image and text classification benchmarks. Some concerns were however raised:\n\n(1) _Limited theoretical justification_. There is limited formal analysis of when the proposed method can work well.\n\n(2) _Lack of comparison to IDN baselines_. The original submission did not include any IDN baselines as comparison. The revision included results of the method of (Zhang et al., '21a), which is on-par or better than the proposed method; it seems that this baseline really ought to have been included in the original submission, but it is appreciated that these have been added. A related concern was the marginal gains over the GCE method on the CIFAR datasets.\n\n(3) _Sufficiency of learning a single parameter_. The paper learns a single scalar per sample. Several reviewers were unsure on the sufficiency of this parameter to capture the underlying noise distribution.\n\nFor (1), the authors acknowledge theoretical analysis as an important future direction. This is perfectly reasonable, but does then require weighting more any issues with the the conceptual and empirical contributions of the paper.\n\nFor (2), the response clarified that most of these operate either in the binary setting, or require auxiliary information. This is a valid motivation for the present work; it would however be more compelling to include results in a binary setting, to better understand the strengths and weaknesses compared to existing proposals. The response also clarified the present method does not claim to improve upon state-of-the-art performance, but rather proposes a simple method which has additional applications (as shown in Appendix E). This is a reasonable claim; however, to my taste, there is insufficient discussion of the PLC method (Zhang et al., '21a), and what new conceptual information the present work offers.\n\nFor (3), the response argued that the present results already demonstrate the efficacy of using a single parameter, and that using multiple parameters can be studied in future work. One reviewer was not convinced of the efficacy being shown in some of the results in Appendix E. It could strengthen the work if there is an empirical analysis of when the single parameter assumption starts to break down; e.g., perhaps under increasing levels of CCN noise?\n\nOverall, the paper has interesting ideas and some nice analyses. At the same time, there was clear scope for improvement in the original submission. This was partially addressed in the revision, but given that several domain experts retain reservations (particularly in regards to comparisons against prior IDN works), it is encouraged that the authors incorporate the above comments for a future version of the paper."

            "main_review": "Overall this work has enough novel and significant contributions, but some issues with the experiments weaken the work. The single-parameter noise model and the use of ICE to learn with IDN are novel to my best knowledge, though aspects of these ideas exist in other literature. The paper does a good job describing the proposed method, but the experiment section lacks some important details.\n\n---\nStrengths:\n\n- The single-parameter noise model proposed in this work is somewhat novel, and the idea is relatively simple (which is a good thing). This simplicity allows easier estimation (smaller estimation error), though it may have larger approximation error, compared with methods that model general noise transition function $T(x)$. But it indeed has a good balance of both approximation error and estimation error, in the middle of CCN (where $T(x)$ is a constant matrix) and general $T(x)$. This noise model is well-motivated.\n\n- The use of ICE to overcome the issue where $T(x)$ could vary significantly for two adjacent instances is interesting and seems beneficial.\n\n---\nWeaknesses:\n\n1. Lack of theoretical results. Variational approximation in this paper is only used to justify that the proposed single-parameter noise model leads to a valid lower bound. In fact, one can use any noise model and still get a valid lower bound using the same justification. The paper does not provide any theoretical analysis of the gap. Also, the connection with CCN is not clear. It looks like the proposed noise model does not include CCN as a special case.\n\n2. In the experiments, it is not clear how that clean labels and noise are generated. The authors only mentioned that they followed a similar way used in Zhang et al. (2021a). However, the exact details are missing in the paper and the appendix. I am kindly asking the authors to provide this information. Some specific questions:\n\n- In Zhang et al. Section 4, they first trained a model to approximate the posterior class probability $\\eta(x)$ using the whole data set. Then they sampled $y_x \\sim \\eta(x)$ for each instance $x$. Instead of using the original labels, they used the sampled labels as clean labels. Was this paper following the same approach?\n\n- In Zhang et al. Section 4, several types of noise generation are considered. Which type did this paper use? If for different data sets different types were used, please list them accordingly.\n\n- In Table 1 of this paper, how was the overall noise rate controlled? If this paper followed Zhang et al. by multiplying the noise function by some constant factor, please specify the constants. Please also list the controlled noise rate for each data set.\n\n3. This paper did not compare with the method in Zhang et al. (2021a) without any justification, even though the paper used Zhang et al.'s setting for noise generation. Please add the method in Zhang et al. to Table 1, or provide explanation why you chose not to compare with Zhang et al.\n\n4. In Section 3.2, one important assumption is that the noisy posterior class probability ($q$) and the clean posterior class probability ($p$) share the same argmax. This is quite a strong assumption, because effectively, with this assumption, one can train directly on the noisy examples using standard methods and predict correctly (in the Bayes optimal sense). In fact, such assumption is not necessary for good predictions. For example, in CCN setting, if the noise transition matrix is invertible, one can train a good classifier using noisy examples and predict well w.r.t. the clean distribution. In Zhang et al., no such assumption was made.  A related question: how is this assumption enforced in the noise generation for the experiments?\n",
            "summary_of_the_review": "Overall this work has enough novel and significant contributions (single-parameter noise model and ICE). But it has a strong assumption (argmax preserving) and lacks theoretical justifications. More importantly, the experiment section lacks detailed descriptions and did not compare with Zhang et al. (2021a). These shortcomings make me skeptical about the effectiveness of the proposed method. Therefore, I vote for a weak reject.\n\n---\n\nAfter rebuttal:\n\nI raised my score to 6.
