            "main_review": "Although the question raised by this paper is interesting, I am not convinced enough by the proposed answer to warrant acceptance. In particular,\n\n**There are many writing flaws**:\n- last sentence of 2nd paragraph in unclear\n- 1st sentence of 3rd paragraph in unclear: *kernel methods* (and not *the kernel method*) are a family of algorithms\n- kernel methods bec*o*me (last word of p.1)\n- We *conjecture* (1st contribution bullet point)\n- please cite the SVM paper when introducing them (1st par. of sec. 2)\n- kernel *trick* (2nd par. sec. 2)\n- SVM paragraph: remove *kind of*\n- Eq. (4), a $\\top$ is missing between the $\\phi$ (also support vectors are never defined)\n- top of page 4: there is a very clear theoretical answer about what kernel is a valid or not. The good performances of the sigmoid kernel (reference needed here) does not change anything\n- I cannot understand what authors mean by *that expands the family of kernel functions*\n- Fig.2 seems to imply that tree and graph kernels do not satisfy Mercer's conditions: why such a separation? Also, the ... boxes are not relevant, and \"Don't satisfy...\" would be a better legend\n- the Mersenne Twister distribution could be introduced and commented before the theorem statement\n- Eq. (5): I assume $N_l$, $N_m$ instead of $N_1$, $N_2$\n- the \"number of observations belonging to class X\" would be more clear than the *size*\n- the $\\rightarrow$ vector notation is introduced once and is not consistent with the rest of the paper\n- expliciting the formulas in eq. (7) is not necessary\n\n**The exposition of classical and quantum kernels is particularly messy**, which is very harmful as it is a key point in the paper:\n- weird $x$ notation\n- $f_c$ is mapping $x$ to $\\phi(x)$ ?! \n- the dot product denoted with both $^T$ and $\\cdot$\n- note also that to compute a distance, one would use $|| \\phi(x) - \\phi(y)||$ rather that $<\\phi(x), \\phi(y)>$ as claimed by the authors\n- in the quantum paragraph, I assume $F_q$ means $f_q$\n- it seems to me that the definition of $f_q$ from $\\mathcal{O}$ to $\\mathcal{F}_q$ is repeated. Furthermore, I cannot see any difference from the standard kernel definition\n- $f_q$ is mapping $x_i$ to a quantity that depends on $x_j$ ?!\n- the $|\\cdot >$ notation is very confusing for people used to kernel dot products. Even if it is the standard notation in the quantum literature, why don't we have two $|$ in the definition of $f_q$?\n- the circuit $U$ is never defined\n\nIn the same vein, **the maths seem not rigorous to me**:\n- how can the proof of Theorem 3.1 begin by \"we assume\" ?! If you have an extra assumption, just put it in the theorem statement\n- the same goes for the proof of Theorem 3.2\n- the exact statement of Theorem 3.2 should be \"there exists $\\delta_0$ such that...\"\n- the CLT does not imply the existence of a $R$ such that the distribution is the standard Gaussian (what if the empirical mean is $1/n$ for instance?)\n- what are the \"measurements\" referring to?\n- where do $\\sigma$ and $\\mu$ play a role?\n- please prove \"it is easy for a deterministic kernel [...] with small error\"\n\nAnd **the contribution is at best incomplete**, if not erroneous (see comments about the proofs above):\n- Theorem 3.1 only states that quantum kernels are superior than standard kernels on this example because the latter cannot learn anything. Can we prove that quantum **can** learn something in this case, i.e., are strictly better. Otherwise the statement is pretty vacuous.\n- the definition of $\\delta$ is based on empirical quantities, is it suitable? Shouldn't a quantity in expectation make more sense?\n- what happens for kernels defined on non-vectorial inputs? Do they have a quantum analog? It should be discussed\n- can we use another distance than the Euclidean one?\n- if we add an offset to the distance, it seems that the 0.6 threshold exhibited changes, making me dubious about such an absolute value\n- Theorem 3.2 actually only shows that quantum kernels are worse than standard ones in a precise regime, not that they are better in the opposite scenario\n\nMore generally, the general idea I retain from this paper is that computing quantum kernels requires some randomness, and that if this randomness is greater than the \"task randomness/difficulty\", it is vain to use quantum kernels. If this message is the right one, I would suggest the authors to be more clear on this, and to drop the $\\delta$ criterion, which seems to be a proxy for the task difficulty.",

For example, the first sentence in the proof of Theorem 3.2. ``Suppose our measurement independent identical distribution ... where M is the random variable, R is the\nnumber of measurement shots.\" is not correct in both English and mathematics. Also, I am not sure if the proof really did the job to prove the statements in Theorem 3.2.\n\n4. The experiments are not convincing. Many implementation details are missing.
