            "summary_of_the_paper": "The authors propose a multitask reinforcement learning method to better design mixed-signal circuits. The method is based on the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) method, but the main difference lies in the fact that the tasks are pre-classified and task-specific loss functions, instead of single loss function, are used to enlarge learning efficiency as well as efficacy. The feasibility of the proposed method was identified on three benchmark circuits, two-stage OTA, strongARM latch, and folded-cascode OTA. The results ensure the efficiency of the proposed method over the evolutionary strategy (ES), Bayesian optimization (BO), and DDPG methods. \n",
            "main_review": "Strengths: the results are interesting and impressive.\n\nWeaknesses:\nAlthough the present results are interesting and promising, I have the following opinions on the present work.\n\n1. The proposed method appears correct. However, I would like to indicate the unfair comparison with previous works in the manuscript. The key to the improvement in efficiency (in terms of circuit simulation time) is the preprocessing of the data such that the full tasks are classified as small tasks relying on PVT corners. This cost is not considered in the efficiency of the proposed method, so that the efficiency comparison may be unfair in the present manuscript.\n\n2. The novelty of the proposed algorithm is very limited given that the method is merely based on the extension of DDPG to multitasks using multiple loss functions.\n\n3.\tI wonder if ICLR is an appropriate conference for the present work. I strongly believe that design-specific conferences, e.g., DAC, are appropriate venues for the present work. The reason is twofold. (1) The proposed method is tailored to a very specific domain (mixed-circuit design). I wonder if the proposed method has scalability to general tasks other than the proposed domain. (2) The proposed method is very technical based on the previous method (DDPG), and thus it is deemed that the contribution of the proposed work to the general RL society is marginal. Regarding the lack of general interest, the impact of the present work is limited.\n\n4.\tThe key to the improvement in efficiency (in terms of circuit simulation time) is the preprocessing of the data such that the full tasks are classified as small tasks relying on PVT corners. This cost is not considered in the efficiency of the proposed method, so that the efficiency comparison may be unfair in the present manuscript. Additionally, the preprocessing requires quite strong domain knowledge, which may not align with the trend in RL.\n\n5.\tThe scalability of the proposed method to more complicated mixed-signal circuits is of crucial importance. The three benchmark circuits are basic, so that it is quite hard to justify the proposed method. Additionally, the cost of the preprocessing should largely increase, and the complexity of task classification should increase as well. The authors should show the feasibility of the proposed method on circuits of large complexity. ",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper proposes RoDesigner, a multi-task reinforcement learning based circuit design approach. The problem is carefully stated into a machine learning (RL) problem, which considers PVT information and diverse constraints in practice. Task space pruning is adopted to speedup the simulation process. Experiments show that the propsoed method can run efficiently, and the circuit performance can be as good as that of human design, with significanly reduced time cost from several days to hours.",
            "main_review": "For me, the paper is mostly about applying multi-task RL to the circuit design problem. The key is to properly adapt the RL training mechanism into the practical problem, by defining the losses and rewards, state and action spaces and practical constraints. While there is not much theoretical guarantees and analysis on the design (e.g., eqn (2) is based on humen expertise), the numerical results suggest that the proposed method could be effective in practical applications.\n\nTo be honest, I'm not very familiar with the field of circuit design. Thus, I'm not sure about the common procedures and evaluation for chip design, and how ML/RL has been combined with such problems. It seems that the main novelty as claimed is to consider unpredictable variations in the model by using RL. If this paper is the first one to use RL in circuit design, then I think this could be a good application paper. Otherwise, I don't think the novelty of this paper meets the standard of ICLR.\n\nI would tentatively rate 6. However, I may change the score based on other reviews' commonts on the novelty of the work. Also, though this paper may fit into ML conferences like ICLR, I feel that perhaps it is more suitable to be published at a circuit design related venue.",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper presents a method for automatic analog circuit sizing optimization under process, voltage,\nand temperature (PVT) variation. RoDesigner selects the corner tasks and then uses DDPG and PCGrad to tackle multi-task learning for optimizing analog circuits. Full simulation of circuits with PVT is time expensive, the RL algorithm is trained on small sized tasks and it generalizes for full task space. The method is tested against 3 circuits and it demonstrates that it can find solutions with less simulation time, compared to evolutionary search (ES) and Bayesian Optimization (BO). And it can find solutions that are on-par with human designs.",
            "main_review": "The paper demonstrates the success of the RL method on analog circuit design under PVT.\nAutoCkt also mentions to consider PVT which takes more simulation time. A comparison between RoDesigner and other RL methods applied to analog design would be interesting to see.\nIt would be also interesting to test on more circuits and analyze if the model can transfer knowledge from one circuit to another. If after training RL on a circuit will later make training on another circuit faster.\nOne of the main observations is that task space pruning using k-means clustering empirically makes the RL method more sample efficient. Analysis on how much of the task space can be pruned until it doesn't work. Is the pruning of task space different for different circuits?",
