            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper designs a traffic congestion prediction method based on lag-specific transfer entropy. The paper adopts the bootstrap strategy of the Markov chain, designs a “trend and residual” decomposition scheme, and combines two normalization methods. It uses simulated and real trajectory data collected from a small area in South Korea for verification.",
            "main_review": "First of all, the motivation of the paper that Figure 1 attempts to convey is not clear. Specifically, Figure 1 only shows a scenario of congestion prediction (this is obvious), but it does not explain why we need to resort to the lag-specific transfer entropy (TE) in the task of traffic congestion prediction. What kind of observations in real-world practices prompt us to believe that other methods cannot effectively discover the congestion propagation relationship that TE can describe? \n\nIn related work, the author emphasizes: \"While these approaches relate to time delay estimation in terms of understanding congestion propagation patterns, pattern analysis and traffic forecasting are different from the time delay estimation problem of interest.\" However, travel time estimation is already an extensively studied topic. See for an example\n\n-\tBai, Mengting, et al. \"PrePCT: Traffic congestion prediction in smart cities with relative position congestion tensor.\" Neurocomputing 444 (2021): 147-157.\n\nThe author needs to explain more clearly what is the connection and difference between the traffic congestion prediction task in this study and travel time estimation or flow prediction?\n\nAt the same time, applying the concept of transfer entropy or causality to traffic prediction is not a new idea. Please refer to these papers. Furthermore, many studies have verified the effects of introducing TE and statistical causality into traffic analysis and prediction tasks, for example:\n\n-\tSalotti, Julien, et al. \"Comparison of traffic forecasting methods in urban and suburban context.\" 2018 IEEE 30th International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence (ICTAI). IEEE, 2018.\n\n-\tLi, Li, et al. \"Robust causal dependence mining in big data network and its application to traffic flow predictions.\" Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies 58 (2015): 292-307.\n\nUrban traffic systems are more sensitive to perturbations than other previously applied fields of lag-specific Transfer Entropy, such as climate systems. The article did not consider the emergent conditions of traffic flow in the method design and experiment.\n\nThe causal relationship in the transportation system changes with time, which is both instantaneous and periodic. The method designed in this paper may be able to achieve accurate short-term prediction by capturing the instant causal relationship in short-term prediction, but does it have the ability to capture long-term causality from historical records?\n\nThe method designed in the paper adopts the bootstrap strategy of the Markov chain, lags the specific transfer entropy. The paper designs a “trend and residual” decomposition scheme and combines two normalization methods. To sum up, it mixes several mathematical tools and applies them to traffic prediction. \n\nThe experiment chose a small area. The prediction accuracy is not compared with the ground-truths (reflected in Figure 4), nor is it compared with other baselines, such as the SOTA GNN models, Graph Wavenet, DGCNN, etc. The complex scenario selected only contains five routes within an intersection area. There is no evidence to show that this method can handle networks. That is, how to verify its scalability is a problem worthy of attention.\n\nLastly, some language issues or typos:\n\n-\tPage 2, Paragraph 8, “Li et al. (2017) proposed a deep learning framework for traffic forecasting, called diffusion convoluional RNN” -> diffusion convolutional RNN\n\n-\tPage 3, Paragraph 1, “in the time or frequency domains to transfer entory (TE) operating in the information domain” -> entropy\n\n-\tPage 6, Paragraph 1, “Suppose that bootstrap observations of the time lag follows a distribution” -> follow\n\n-\tPage 8, Paragraph 2,  “with nonlinear normalization are much smaller then the others” -> than\n",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "Summary: The paper proposes an estimator for future traffic congestion. The problem is called time delay estimation: given an origin location and a destination location, estimate the time needed to complete the path based on previously observed traffic speed data on the two roads. ",
            "main_review": "Strengths\n1 - The applied problem is a relevant one, with many social and economic implications\n2 - Proposed an algorithm for estimation of time delay \n3 - Evaluation is carried out on a real-world dataset\n\nWeaknesses:\n1 - Not addressing a challenging problem in terms of machine learning\n2 - Lack of novelty\n3 - Weak baselines\n\nThe paper may be criticized for its lack of general methodological novelty. The algorithm does not bring new ideas or innovations in terms of machine learning algorithms. However, it is a clever and well-thought combination of different strategies to forecast the destination time series based on the origin time series. These data sources are intuitively informative and should be incorporated in a forecasting algorithm but it is not clear why the rest of the traffic map data is left out. It is not clear why the authors did not consider the more complete information composed by the traffic in the other edges of the traffic network besides the origin and intended destination locations. This traffic coupled with the graph topology should be explored and it is likely to be available. \n\nA single traditional baseline is considered. The authors compared their method with DCCA which is a old-fashioned time series method. It is based on detrending two series and then carrying out a cross-correlation analysis. The authors list several recent papers based on deep learning but they are ignored in the comparative evaluation section.  In the related work, they cite a series of papers addressing this same problem with a deep learning approach but there is no comparison between their method and these alternatives. \n\nIn summary, the paper uses several well-known techniques to solve this applied problem. It is an interesting solution for the given problem but it adds very little to the machine learning theory. Besides, important information on the rest of the traffic graph is ignored and this additional information is likely to be available nowadays. Finally, the comparative evaluation is not thorough. It is based on a single alternative method that is a very traditional time-series method.   ",
