The paper proposes a three-step method Confounder Balanced IV (CB-IV) Regression, where the confounder balance step addresses observed confounders and the instrumental variable deals with unobserved confounders. In the provided numerical experiments, the proposed method is shown to successfully remove the bias.\n",
            "main_review": "The paper raises an interesting bias problem in non-linear IV methods with valid practical implications. The paper identifies different roles of unobserved and observed confounders and removes the two sources of bias combining confounder balance and instrumental variable.\n \nIt would be very nice of the authors to provide more explanations to the points below.\n\n(1) The structural model (Eq.(5)) seems a bit unnatural/stringent to me. I could think of a few alternatives without the additive noise assumption, e.g., for T, T = f_1(Z,X) + f_2(X,U) + f_3(Z,U), and for Y: Y = g_1(T,X) + g_2(X,U) + g_3(T,U). Could you please provide some references or motivations of using Eq.(5)?\n\n(2) The second step of the optimization (Confounder Balancing) minimizes the Wasserstein distance. It would be very helpful to provide some intuitions of the choice over integral probability metrics.\n\n(3) The authors state in the conclusion that \"The same framework is also applicable to continuous treatment variables, but the conditional independent constraint of continuous variables is still an open problem...\" If I understand correctly, the difficulty lies in finding the conditionally independent representation. In Section 3.3, the authors mentioned previous works using mutual information for confounder balancing given continuous treatments. I am wondering why the mutual information criterion does not solve the continuous treatment case in the CB-IV framework?",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper considers the problem of treatment effect estimation in the presence of unmeasured confounders. The authors focus on an instrumental variable (IV) approach. Traditional IV approach requires strong assumptions, e.g., linearity or additivity. The paper aims at relaxing these stringent assumptions by proposing a Confounder Balanced IV Regression (CB-IV) algorithm. The proposed algorithm combines confounder balancing and IV regression. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm even without the additive separability assumption on noise.\n",
            "main_review": "To the best of my knowledge, this paper is a novel combination of the confounder balancing and IV regression. The problem considered is a very important problem; the assumptions required by the classical IV method are strong, and it is important to relax them. I’m overall positive about the paper, but here are a few comments and questions I have.  \n\n-\tThe authors mention many times in the paper that “effective even without the additive separability assumption on noise”. However, looking at equation (5), I think the form still looks “additive”. There do not appear to be interaction terms between U and X. I understand that having interaction terms between U and X could make things overly complicated, and I’m fine with this assumption, but it will be great if the assumptions can be explained and advocated more accurately. \n-\tRelated to the above point, can Y be written in the more general form of Y = g1(T,X) + g2(T,U)? If not, it will be great if we can see more explanation of this assumption. Why do you choose this form? Is it because of its generality or it is necessary for the theorems to go through?\n-\tWe never really have a definition of h(T, X) in the paper. It is confusing what it really means. The first time it appears is in equation (2). \n-\tRelated to the above point, many notations appear earlier than their definitions. For example, g1, g2. They are used in equation (2) but not defined until (5). \n-\tI think the term “confounder balancing” can be explained better. Currently it is only briefly explained in the related work section and section 3.3(2). It would be great if we can see: what does it mean by confounder balancing, why is it desirable, and how do we do this in the proposed algorithm. \n",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes a confounder balanced IV regression (CB-IV) algorithm to estimate average treatment effects (ATEs) in the setup of instrumental variable (IV) regression. The CB-IV algorithm is essentially a two-stage representation learning method with instrumental variables. The implementation process is similar to the classic two-stage least-squares regression method for IV regression. The first stage is to regress the treatment variable onto the instrumental variable and observed confounders. In the second stage, the authors propose to regress the outcome variable onto the predicted treatment variable and observed covariates while balancing the representation of the observed covariates between the treated and control group. The proposed algorithm shows strong performances in extensive simulation.\n\n",
            "main_review": "Strengths:\n\nThis paper does an excellent job of reviewing the literature in IV and balanced representation learning. It is clear what are the limitations of the existing methods and applying the proposed method can potentially lead to some improvements. The paper shows an interesting identification formula for treatment effects when the learnt representation is independent of the predicted treatment variable. The authors use both synthetic and real-world datasets to validate the proposed method. Overall, the paper is well-written and easy to follow, e.g., the assumptions and proposed method are all well stated.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\nAs you mentioned in Section 2.1, there is a trade-off in learning balanced representations. In fact, if the sample size is large, I don’t see any point in learning balanced representations because we can estimate the control and treated outcome well enough for any value of the observed covariates. If we still try to balance the representations, the representations will lose information predictive of the predicted treatment variable. This information is often also the information predictive of the outcome. In other words, learning balanced representations can increase the bias of treatment effects estimation. In finite samples, learning balanced representations can be seen as a kind of regularization on the outcome regression model. Its gain is from decreasing the estimator variance at the price of increasing the bias. The authors mention a few times in the paper balanced representations remove the confounding bias from the observed confounders, which is the opposite of what I think. A more complete and clear story of the bias-variance trade-off should be provided in this paper.\n\nIn the simulation studies, the authors only compare with deep IV methods. Could you also compare your method with the kernel-based IV methods e.g., [Singh et al., 2019; Muandet et al., 2019]? In Figure 2, we don’t see any performance improvement as the sample size increases. The proposed method already does very well in small sample sizes on average.  The balanced representation methods without using IV perform much better than the pure IV based methods. Could we adjust or increase the difficulty of the simulation so that there are clear trends of the results and using the instrumental variable also becomes more important? Finally, I don’t get why OneSIV, the ablation version of CB-IV, has worse performance as the sample size increases.\n",

I feel the paper has room for improvement regarding the simulation studies and the bias discussion of balanced representation. I keep my score slightly lower than acceptance.

In addition, is there theoretical guarantee that the learned representation $C$ is independent of $\\hat{T}$? \n\n2.
