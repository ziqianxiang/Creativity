            "summary_of_the_paper": "Realizing that most of the existing domain adaptation methods assume no domain change in the output space and share a common label space across domains, this paper introduces a more general taxonomy adaptive domain adaptation problem under various settings: open taxonomy, coarse-to-fine taxonomy, and partially-overlapping taxonomy.\n\nFurther, an approach that jointly addresses the image-level and label-level domain adaptation is proposed with a bilateral mixed sampling strategy to augment the target domain, and a re-labeling method to unify and align the label spaces, as well as an uncertainty-rectified contrastive learning method respectively.\n\nExtensive experiments are conducted under the traditional unsupervised domain adaptation and the proposed various settings and verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n",
            "main_review": "Strengths:\n+ Among the proposed settings, the coarse-to-fine taxonomy one is new to me. Other settings have already been proposed in open-set domain adaptation and universal domain adaptation.\n+ An approach that jointly addresses the image-level and label-level domain adaptation is proposed, though it seems like a combination of several techniques.\n+ Competitive performance on various semantic segmentation datasets.\n+ This paper is well-written and clear for most readers.\n\nWeaknesses:\n+ My first major concern is the novelty of this paper. First, the proposed taxonomy adaptive domain adaptation (TADA) problem is not new. Only the coarse-to-fine taxonomy one is new to me. Other settings have already been proposed in open-set domain adaptation and universal domain adaptation.\n+ Another concern is the contribution of the proposed method. It seems like a combination of several techniques, including a bilateral mixed sampling strategy to augment the target domain, and a re-labeling method to unify and align the label spaces, as well as an uncertainty-rectified contrastive learning method respectively. Neither the re-labeling method nor the contrastive learning method is new. Further, in Tranheden et al. (2021), cross-domain mixed sampling (DACS) is shown helpful to UDA of consistent taxonomy. The authors only tailor this mixed sampling strategy into the taxonomy adaptive setting.\n+ The over-designed method consists of many parts, resulting in various trade-off hyperparameters in the overall loss function and making it hard to select the optimal ones. This limitation will cause the proposed method hard to apply to new tasks or datasets.\n+ As for the experiments, the authors only conduct experiments on the semantic segmentation datasets, leaving the traditional classification datasets such as Office-31, Office-Home, VisDA-2017, and DomainNet on the shelf. From this perspective, we cannot say that the proposed method is for the general domain adaptation problem.\n+ A minor issue: The abbreviation (TADA) of the taxonomy adaptive domain adaptation is also not inappropriate, since it is the same as an existing domain adaptation method named Transferable Attention for Domain Adaptation (TADA), which will mislead readers in the field.\n",

A new algorithm with a bunch of techniques is proposed to address this new domain adaptation problem. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed method under different taxonomy inconsistency scenarios. The results show that the proposed method address this problem better than the existing ones.   \n",
            "main_review": "The advantages of this paper are as follows.\n1) A new domain adaptation setting has been proposed, which have never studies by the previous methods before, although this setting is substantially overlapped with several existing domain adaptation settings.\n2) A new approach is proposed to address this new problem. The approach is based on bilateral mixed sampling strategy, relabelling and uncertainty-rectified contrastive learning. The proposed method is technically sound. \n3) Experiments have been conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method under different scenarios of the setting, including open taxonomy, coarse-to-fine taxonomy, and partially-overlapping taxonomy.\n\nThe disadvantages of this paper are as follows.\n1) The studied setting has subtle difference from existing domain adaptation settings and this paper does not clearly describe the difference and convincingly justify the necessity to investigate this setting alone. Another domain adaptation problem, called universal domain adaptation, which also address the inconsistency between the label spaces of the source and target domains. Universal domain adaptation is a more practical setting and draws increasing attentions in recent years. \n2) The comparison with existing methods are weak to show the advantage of the proposed method. As mentioned above, the proposed setting is a hybrid problem that is closely related with semi-supervised domain adaptation, partial domain adaption, open-set domain adaptation, universal domain adaptation, etc. However, in the experiment, the method is only compared with unsupervised domain adaptation methods and their naive variants. The baselines are too weak which makes the seemingly large gains less convincing.  Besides, the proposed setting assumes the availability of a few labeled samples from target domain; unsupervised domain adaptation methods, which are employed for comparison, cannot well utilize them. So, the comparisons are not fair.\n3) There are little analysis about the experimental results, which makes it hard to interpret some of the abnormal phenomenons in results. For example, almost all compared methods suffer from performance drops when integrated with the proposed SLM module, while the proposed method benefit from it. It is hard to infer the reason without explanations. \n4) The proposed method is very complicated - it takes several types data as input and generate more intermediate data types. Besides, the model has multiple components. This paper fails to present the method clearly, making it quite hard to follow.    \n   \n  \n\n\n",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper proposed a new problem, Taxonomy Adaptive Domain Adaptation (TADA), here source and target classes do not have a one-to-one mapping, but they may belong to different granularity levels (e.g. vehicle vs car and cycle). The article presents an approach for this setup built on different components, namely:  stochastic label mapping (SLM) which randomly maps a source label to one of the possible target ones; re-labeling (RL) target instances for which the predicted score is higher than a threshold; Bilateral Mixed Sampling (BMS) which mixes target and source samples to augment the former set; Contrastive Learning (CT) between original and augmented samples from BMS; with uncertainty rectification (UCT), that weights each pixel based on the uncertainty on its predictions. Experiments on different semantic segmentation settings show that the model outperforms various DA baselines.",
            "main_review": "**Strengths**\n1. The presented problem is very interesting, bringing the challenges of DA with different source-target labels spaces to a different level, where the mismatch might be driven by the granularity of the labels. This problem is both realistic (e.g. different datasets may come with different annotations) and timely (i.e. so far the literature has been focused on mismatches at the same granularity level).\n\n2. The approach presents components (e.g. SLM, BMS) tailored to the addressed problem. The experimental comparison shows that their combination is effective across various setups, including standard unsupervised DA.\n\n**Weaknesses**\n\n1. The proposed components, mostly focus on the one-to-many mapping (e.g. BMS, SLM). Providing a unique approach tailored to all TADA settings would have been a stronger technical contribution and baseline for future works.\n2. The impact of BMS is not ablated in the tables.\n3. Being the TADA problem formulation new, it would have been helpful to benchmark approaches in classification rather than segmentation, possibly considering recent larger-scale datasets containing much more semantic categories (e.g. 345 of DomainNet [a] vs ~20 of the considered benchmarks).\n\n**Minors**:  \nThe font in Figure 2 results small and hard to read.\n\nReferences: \n[a] Peng, Xingchao, et al. \"Moment matching for multi-source domain adaptation.\" CVPR 2019.",
            "summary_of_the_review": "The article presents an interesting problem formulation and an approach outperforming multiple baselines in the new setting. My current rate is borderline since the problem-specific components focus just on one of the proposed settings, falling short in providing insights for the various settings illustrated in Fig. 2. Moreover, the experiments miss a benchmark with a larger number of semantic categories (even in object classification).",

Despite a number of works have been proposed to address inconsistent taxonomy, like open-set, class-incremental, etc., this work comprehensively summarizes all the inconsistent scenarios and forms a unified problem setting, TADA. To solve it, the authors propose a solution based on mixed sampling, pseudo-labeling techniques to mitigate the discrepancy in label. For robust image representation learning, an uncertainty-rectified version of contrastive learning is proposed. Quantitative and qualitative experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",
            "main_review": "Pro:\n1.\tThe paper is well motivated. TADA well describes a practical setting without assuming consistent label taxonomy between source and target or one particular type of inconsistency, like open, class-incremental, etc. \n2.\tThe proposed method handles all the inconsistent label taxonomy including open/coarse-to-fine, partial-overlapping.\n3.\tPaper is clearly written.\n4.\tOverall experimental results are satisfactory, except for a few questions (see below).\n\nCon:\n1.\tThe proposed techniques are based on well-studied pseudo-labeling, mixed sampled, and contrastive learning. Although modifications are designed, for instance, an uncertainty-rectified version of CL is added to enhance the robust learning. The major technical contribution is limited to some extent.\n2.\tIn pseudo-labeling strategy, the threshold parameter $\\theta$ is important and sometimes can be sensitive. The analysis on $\\theta$ is missing.\n3.\tLooking at the results of new classes in grey, I expect to see a large improvement of UCT over CT to show the effectiveness of uncertainty-recertify. While in Table 2, 17.26 (M+CT) vs. 16.92 (M+UCT). Table 3, 53.76 (M+SLM+UCT) vs. 53.69 (M+SLM+CT). Table 4, 56.20 (M+SLM+UCT) vs. 54.32 (M+SLM+CT). The results of “Open Taxonomy: SYNTHIA -> Cityscapes” is even worse. Any potential explanation?\n\nMinor: The first sentence in Introduction “Approaches for domain typically focus on image level domain gap, …” is inappropriate. There are extensive domain adaptation works out of image domain, such as text, graph, etc. The authors may want to limit the statement to visual/image DA methods. \n",
