Heatmap-based input, combined with Conv3D prediction network, has several advantages such as its robustness and generalizability. The authors empirically demonstrates that the proposed approach achieves superior performance on standard benchmark datasets.\n",
            "main_review": "Strength)\nExperimentally shows that an alternative representation of heatmap input + 3DConv outperforms the popular graph-based approaches for skeleton-based action recognition task.\nProposed method is intuitive, simple, and shows robustness and better generalization ability as claimed by the authors.\nExperimental evaluation is extensively done.\n\nWeakness)\nThe 3DConv network framework itself is trivial. \nThe claim on generalizability, as they put “we empirically find that PoseConv3D generalizes well across input skeletons obtained by different approaches.”, is quantitatively evaluated, but not well explained, persuasive or analyzed otherwise.\n\n",
            "summary_of_the_review": "Overall)\nExperimental findings from this paper is encouraging and promising. Researchers have spent much effort on improving GCN based models and while 3DConv based approaches were under-explored. Meanwhile, the paper currently lacks insights or further explanations on why this approach is much more robust and generalizable, other than the mere numbers. Overall, above borderline.",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper addresses the problem of human action recognition. The proposed pipeline is composed of three modules:\n- people detection\n- 2d pose estimation\n- action classification with CNN\nThe novelty is in the input of the third module, which is the 4D tensor (T x K x H x W) composed by the temporal stack of the K heatmaps, where K is the number of body joints. This data input allows the exploitation of CNN instead of GCN for the action classification step.\nA very deep experimental section is provided to prove the superiority of the proposed data input.",
            "main_review": "The main novelty of the submitted paper is the data input of the classification stage, which is the \"stack\" of the outputs from the previous stage. The novelty is thus limited.\nThus, in my opinion, the main contribution is the quality and quantity of experiments. \nHowever, experiments alone are not sufficient for this type of publication. Moreover, a more clear and structured evaluation should be reported. \nFollows a list of issues.\n\n1) the keyword 3D is really misleading. The used poses are not 3d (x, y, z). The input of the classifier is not 3d but 4d (time x joint x H x W). \n2) The sentence \"human skeleton is a compact representation of human action\" is not true. Human skeleton is a representation of the instantaneous pose.\n3) In the introduction: \"feature representation: RGB frames, optical flows, audio waves, human skeletons\". I think this is a collection of very different abstraction levels of data, and they are not only different representations\n4) The issues of GCN approaches listed in the introduction should be used in the remain of the paper to prove the superiority of the proposed method. To this aim, I think that the robustness of the classification w.r.t. shift of coordinates should be better define and prove. Using top-down methods, coordinate normalization preprocessing tasks can solve the issue\n5) \"PoseConv3d can handle different numbers of persons wihtout increasing computational overhead\" is not true nor demonstrated.\n\n\n\n\n",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "- While most works in Skeleton based action recognition have used GCNs for modeling, this paper makes a case for using 3D CNNs instead. To do so, the paper represents the input as a stack of heatmaps instead of a joint graph. 3D CNNs popular in the RGB action recognition community are adopted for 3D stacked heatmaps. \n- The paper shows the advantages of the 3D CNNs over GCNs through extensive experiments. The proposed approach outperforms previous approaches on 6 skeleton-action recognition datasets and on fusion with RGB based approaches. Various properties of the approach and design choices are throughly analysed. \n",
            "main_review": "Pros:\n- The paper is well written and the problem being tackled is clearly described. The claims are supported by experiments. \n- Use of a 3D stack of heatmaps with standard 3D CNN backbones is a reasonable choice. The paper makes small modifications to the original architectures (like SlowFast, X3D) to account for the differences in RGB vs pose-heatmaps. In addition to bringing performance improvements, it often comes with reduced computational complexity. Also, the proposed approach is more scalable as number of people in the scene increase. \n- The study on various pose extractors and their effect on the final performance is helpful. \n- Good tricks and techniques : The paper uses certain tricks to further enhance the performance, some of which are borrowed from prior works in Skeletal-based action recognition and RGB-based action recognition to improve performance. Specifically, instead of uniform sampling, the paper uses the TSN style sampling to better cover the video content, to save on space coordinates are expanded into heatmaps during training, subject-centered cropping is performed to focus on the person in the frame, bidirectional lateral connections for multimodal fusion. \n- The study on performance, robustness and generalization of the proposed approach including experiments in the Appendix are helpful. \n- The approach does not require changing the architecture and hyperparameters for different datasets compared to other competing approaches. \n- The proposed approach can be used for multimodal early fusion more easily compared to prior approaches. \n\nCons / Questions:\n- The approach is not very novel and parts of the approach do exist in prior works in Skeleton & RGB based action recognition. That said, I think that the paper presents a good study on some of the best practices for Skeleton-based action recognition and makes a compelling case for using 3D CNNs for the task.  \n- Pose Extractors :\n    - It would help to include the pose extractor used (or GT) and whether 3D/2D skeletons were used in Table 3. \n    - It seems MS-G3D uses GT (provided with the dataset) skeleton, whereas the proposed approach and MS-G3D++ use 2D estimated skeletons. Does the paper claim that 2D estimated poses for NTU dataset give performance comparable or better than 3D GT skeletons (Table 3) ? Some intuitions on why this should be the case should help. \n    - While it is helpful to include the MS-G3D++ baseline for a fair comparison, a comparison with PoseConv3D using the heatmaps/poses used by prior approaches will further help separate the contribution of the pose extractor and the proposed model. \n- Multimodal fusion :\n    - Since the various previous approaches might have different underlying models, the authors should also include R and P only results using their approach to Table 4. \n- A table which shows the contribution of each technique (sampling, subject-cropping) would be beneficial to understand the improvement in results over prior approaches (in context of Table 3). \n- Are the numbers in Figure 3 and Table 3 comparable ? \n- Does uniform sampling help GCN (like MS-G3D++) based approaches ? \n- 10-clip testing : \n    - It seems that the Table 3 results involve 10-clip testing. This should be mentioned in 'Skeleton-based Action Recognition' in 4.2. \n    - For 10-clip testing, are the prediction scores averaged for each of the sampled clips ? \n\nMinor / Other questions:\n- Does Late fusion involve averaging the scores or does it involve training ? What about Early+Late fusion ? \n- The proposed approach scales more easily as the number of people in the scene increases as rightly pointed out. Would it hurt to have too many people since the heatmaps can merge into each other (clutter) whereas GCNs might not face this problem? What are your thoughts on this ? \n- Clarity : \n    - 3.2, 'target heatmap' can get confusing. \n    - I believe that the meaning of a 10-clip testing here is different from that used in some Action recognition setups where one crops from corners, center and applies flips to generate 10 clips. This should be clarified to avoid confusion. \n\nReferences/Related Works: \n- Some relevant references : \n    - Mimetics: Towards Understanding Human Actions Out of Context (IJCV 2021)\n    - MMTM: Multimodal Transfer Module for CNN Fusion (CVPR 2020)\n    - Stronger, Faster and More Explainable: A Graph Convolutional Baseline for Skeleton-based Action Recognition (ACM MM 2020)\n    - JOLO-GCN: Mining Joint-Centered Light-Weight Information for Skeleton-Based Action Recognition (WACV 2021)\n    - Dynamic Motion Representation for Human Action Recognition (WACV 2020)\n- Some references which could be considered contemporaneous (which are probably not published, but atleast one arXiv version was available for >4 months).

            "main_review": "The 3 measures that are presented at the beginning of the paper, that being Robustness, Interoperability and Scalability  should have been the metrics against with the paper is evaluated. \nI assume that GCN are defined as only coordinate based however there are methods out there that define them as heat maps as well and can be used for action recognition.

Sia-gcn: A spatial information aware graph neural network with 2d convolutions for hand pose estimation. arXiv preprint arXiv:2009.12473.\nto name a few, so I am not sure how novel the idea of the paper really is.\nI think that GCN is really narrowly defined in this paper\nThe 3D spoken of in this paper is the temporal definition as opposed to the 3rd spatial dimension which is a bit misleading.  I know this is not explicitly and clearly stated at the beginning of the paper.\nI am a bit confused, are all the heat maps through time converged into one heat map?\nWhat is the pre processing described in the figure 2 caption?\nThe heat maps spoken of in this paper have nothing to do with the uncertainty in determining the joint coordinates and positions but rather a definite location that is blurred by a gaussian , equation 1, at least it appers that way.\nFor the experimentation, all the datasets used, it is not clear which ones are the authors and which ones belong to others, please properly address this with citations and clear statements.\nThe granularity of the action categories will bias the results.  It would have been helpful to properly define what the classes are for the various test data sets and how many classes there are.  Also, a discussion of the granularity and separability of the classes and how this influences the results would be helpful.",
            "summary_of_the_review": "I really do not see anything new in this paper.  The heat maps are existent when computing joint positions using conventional GCN  and only when put into a graph structure do we lose that preciseness.    It appears that the paper also defines a precise location and then blurs that location.  Rather than processing as a graphical network, I assume that the paper treats the heat maps through time and processes these for action recognition, this does not appear to be anything new.\nThe idea appears to be trivial and does not differentiate itself enough from what actually exists in the literature.  The blueness of the joint positions appears to be arbitrary and does not correlate with the uncertainty in the joint position detection.",
