            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper was trying to solve the problem of REID models learn to discriminate cameras vs identifies. In this paper, the authors proposed  Camera Bias Regularization (CBR) term to close the gap between intra-camera and inter-camera distance distribution. CBR shows good performance as a regularization term on both supervised or domain adaption style REID tasks.",
            "main_review": "The problem identified by the author is a fundamental problem for cross-camera REID problems. However, the proposed solution is not a principled solution but a simple heuristics. Also adding such a heuristic that involves a few argmax will inevitably makes those algorithms leveraging CBR computationally expensive.\n\nIn the paper, the author's approach (CBR) is trying to push away features for the same identify and same camera while pulling together features from different cameras with the same identity. The scale of the regularization term and loss term are not directly comparable. It's really hard to know what would be a good balance between loss function (accurarcy) and how far away/gap. A good alternative would be the entropy or information gains w.r.t. camera change.\n\nThe gain performance of the algorithm is marginal (Table 2) compared to surprivised algorithm, and the distance distribution difference is not that great Figure 4 (b). It is hard to attribute the gain to CBR. In the unsupervised setup, CBR did look more promising in the experiments.\n\nOn the computation and optimization setup, the authors did not detail how much more computation is needed for CBR. Also the optimization is not trivial. It would be great to include those numbers as well. ",
            "summary_of_the_review": "I would argue that the proposed solution is either an efficient solution or a principled solution. Given the gain is not significant in the supervised case, it's hard to attribute the gain to the proposed CBR. I would recommend the authors try out different ways to solve the problem.",

The optimization objective of CBR is to reduce the gap between intra-camera and inter-camera distance distribution. The proposed method is evaluated on different tasks, including supervised learning, direct transfer, purely unsupervised learning and unsupervised domain adaptation. Experimental results show using CBR can get improved results on different tasks. \n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "main_review": "Strengths： \n+ the idea of aligning the distribution between cameras is novel, and the proposed CBR appears to be technically sound.\n+ CBR is a plugged-and-play module for various re-id methods. \n+ experimental results in the paper are easily reproducible. \n+ the paper is well-organized and clearly written\n+ the discussion in this paper can provide some insights for object (person/vehicle) re-ID studies, such it is helpful for re-id results to reduce the gap between inter and intra camera distance distribution. \n\nWeaknesses:\n-\tIt is unclear whether CBR works as expected (i.e., align the distribution of intra-camera and inter-camera distance). \nIntuitively, there are more than one possible changing directions of the two items in Equ 3. For example, 1) the second term gets larger, the first term gets smaller (as shown in Fig.2), 2) both of them get smaller, 3）the second term stays the same, and the first term gets smaller. However, according to Fig.4 (b) and Fig.5 (b), we can observe that the changes of the distance distribution caused by CBR should be in line with 2) and 3) mentioned above rather than 1) “expected”. Therefore, this paper should provide more explanation to make it clear. \n\n-\tOne of the main contributions of this paper is the CBR, so different optimization strategies and the corresponding results should discussion. For example, what will happen by minimizing both of the inter and intra terms in Eq 3 or only minimizing the first term? \n",
            "summary_of_the_review": "Although considering the camera distribution is not a new idea, the perspective of this paper is novel and feasible by optimizing camera distribution in the loss function. However, a very important point is not explained clearly in this paper, i.e., how does CBR work (please refer to Main Review). Does it work as Fig2 shown? Various situations should be discussed in the paper. Without these contents, I think the current version of this paper is not qualified. ",

The proposed method imposes a camera-level constraint to deal with the camera bias problem in person re-ID and mine valid samples for optimization. It also gives a cross-camera clustering strategy to ensure the usability of their method when deployed in unsupervised re-ID. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of their method in supervised, unsupervised and domain generalized  re-ID.",
            "main_review": "The overall writing is good and the analysis about the CBR is sufficient. The authors actually do a good job of visualizing the mechanism of CBR. However, I tend to give ``weak reject\" due to the following reasons.\n\n\n1. The overall idea of applying camera constraint to re-ID is not novel. There are many papers discussing the effect of considering camera information in unsupervised person re-ID, like [a,b]. Furthermore, the design of CBR is quite similar to triplet loss and it also uses the sampling mining strategy in triplet loss. Although it is deployed in intra-class samples, I don't think the contribution is novel enough for publication.\n\n\n2. The demonstration about cross-camera clustering is not clear. For example, I can not understand the last sentence \"Nevertheless, they may be indirectly linked by the instance in another camera and finally be clustered into a group.\" Please add more explanations.\n\n3. In Tab.5, why do you apply your CBR to MMT? Why not directly utilize it on SpCL as CAP does?

            "main_review": "This paper investigates the camera bias problem that limits the performance of Re-ID models. To alleviate the effects of serious camera bias, this paper proposes a Camera Bias Regularization (CBR) term to close the gap between intra-camera and inter-camera distance distribution. Besides, this paper also designs a Cross-Camera (CC) clustering algorithm to cooperate with CBR for unsupervised Re-ID. Experiments on different Re-ID tasks (supervised, fully unsupervised, unsupervised domain adaptation, and direct transfer) are conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed camera bias regularization.\n\nThe strengths of this paper are as follows.\n\n(1) The proposed Camera Bias Regularization (CBR) can be easily implemented.\n\n(2) Extensive experiments on different Re-ID tasks show the effectiveness and generality of the proposed method.\n\n(3) This paper is well-written and the ideas are clearly clarified.\n\nThe weakness of this paper and my concerns/questions are as follows.\n\n(1) The CBR term aims to enlarge the intra-camera distance and reduce the inter-camera distance simultaneously. However, I doubt whether enlarging the intra-camera distance can alleviate features’ discriminability. Besides, how to trade-off between enlarging the intra-camera distance and reducing the inter-camera distance? \n\n(2) The CBR term (Eq. (3)) only considers instances of the same identity label with same/different camera labels. Why not consider instances of different identity labels with same/different camera labels?\n\n(3) The form of the proposed loss function (Eq. (3)) is not novel enough and there are many other variants of this function. Why do the authors choose the form like Eq. (3)?\n\n(4) In page 4, the authors claim that “…… leads to the increase of the Re-ID loss function L_{reid}.” However, there is a lack of the experimental analysis (like the loss curve) about this and thus it is not convincing to me.\n\n(5) In unsupervised domain adaptation Re-ID, the authors claim that the proposed CBR can resist the noises of pseudo labels but the experiments but the purity of the pseudo labels (like F-score) are missing.\n\n(6) If the camera number is large enough, is there still existing the cross-camera bias or is the cross-camera bias still affecting the performance significantly? There is a lack of the experiments about the effectiveness of the camera number on the proposed CBR term. For example, comparing the performance between only using two cameras and using three cameras.\n\n(7) In the experiments about purely unsupervised Re-ID and domain adaptation Re-ID, why only using MMT as the baseline method? More different baseline methods should be implemented with the proposed method to show the expansibility of CBR.\n\n\n\n",
