            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes GRASSY, a novel method for molecular graph generation. The key novelty of GRASSY is the use of geometric scattering transform, which helps model learn good latent representations and generate more drug-like molecules.",
            "main_review": "# Strengths\n\nThe proposed idea of using scattering moments as the input feature to the model are interesting and enlightening. It opens up a novel and promising path for researchers in molecule generation and drug discovery. In addition, this paper proposes a validity metric directly related to the drug likeness of molecules, which is very different from previous work. This may serve as a meaningful metric to evaluate the practicality of molecule generation method in the future.\n\n# Weakness And Questions\n\n1. It seems that there is a lack of clear motivation of using scattering transform. Though clear definitions of scattering transform and scattering moments are given in Section 3, I am still wondering why they are used to learn a latent space of molecules through auto-encoder? What are their concrete advantages over commonly used molecular graph representations like one-hot atom type matrix and bond adjacency tensor?\n\n2. In Section 4.1, why the four conditions are required for a molecular graph generation model? Are they advantages of using scattering transform or scattering moments?\n\n3. I am confused about the generation process described in Section 4.4. The first paragraph mentions that getting the two latent vectors $z_i, z_j$ of two graphs, interpolating between them getting $z_{i\\to j}$, then get the adjacency matrix $\\hat{W}_{i\\to j}$. However, the subsequent reconstruction loss is computed on $\\hat{W}_i, \\hat{W}_j$. Then what is the relationship between them? Second, a molecular graph does not only include the adjacency matrix but the atom types are also needed. Why atom types are not generated and the discriminator model does not take atom types as input?\n\n4. In the Section 5, page 9, one validity criterion is defined as  *No vertex should have degree (covalent bonds) exceeding 5*. However, atoms with different types have different maximum number of covalent bonds. For instance, a carbon atom should not have more than 4 covalent bonds. It is not right to uniformly set maximum number of covalent bonds as 5 for all atoms.\n\n5. Do authors consider doing molecular property optimization using GRASSY? If not, then why a property prediction model (Section 4.3, Figure 1) is used?\n",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes to use geometric scattering in place of the popular graph neural networks to represent molecular graphs. In order to obtain a latent space related to the properties, the authors learn the graph representation through a joint optimization objective including both the reconstruction loss and the property prediction regression loss. Furthermore, a GAN-based objective is used to learn the generative model mapping the latent space back to the molecule space. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework on molecule generation and property prediction tasks using ZINC and BindingDB datasets.",
            "main_review": "Pros:\n\n- This paper introduces geometric scattering transforms into the molecule representation learning domain. Comparing with graph neural networks, scattering transforms can capture both local and global information in a single layer, and so potentially it could be a more powerful graph modeling tool.\n\nCons:\n\n- The contributions of the paper are somewhat weak. The main novelty comes from the joint training objective described in section 4.3 and 4.4. In section 4.3, the joint objective of reconstruction loss and the regression loss seems quite straightforward. While in section 4.4, the three loss are given without further explanation. The authors need to explain how the proposed loss is different from the Autoencoder Adversarial Interpolation approach introduced by previous work.\n\n- The paper describes 4 different \"Lipschitz smoothness\" condition of the functions but they are not related to other parts in the learning framework. The smoothness loss seems unrelated because the decoder is not part of $f$ or $f'$.\n\n- The molecular property prediction experiments lack sufficient baselines.\n\nTypos:\n - Last sentence on page 4, \"... the dimension of the the scattering embedding ...\"\n - First sentence in section 4.3, $F(E(X))$ should be $F(E(S))$\n - First sentence in section 4.4, $Z_j = E(S(G_i))$ should be $Z_j = E(S(G_j))$\n\nQuestions:\n - What are the learnable parameters in the \"learnable scattering framework\" mentioned in the first paragraph of section 4.2? Equation (3) and (4) does not seem to have any parameters.",

            "main_review": "Weaknesses  \n*Missing a lot of references to prior works in molecular graph generation. Eg.  \n[1] “Composing molecules with multiple property constraints” ICML 2020  \n[2] “Multi-Objective Molecule Generation using Interpretable Substructures” ICML 2020  \n[3] “MARS: Markov Molecular Sampling for Multi-objective Drug Discovery” ICLR 2021  \n[4] “Junction Tree Variational Autoencoder for Molecular Graph Generation” ICML 2018  \n[5] “Graph Convolutional Policy Network for Goal-Directed Molecular Graph Generation” NeurIPS 2018  \n[6] “Constrained Graph Variational Autoencoders for Molecule Design” ” NeurIPS 2018  \n\n*I think there are few issues with the evaluation scheme.   \nIn particular, the chemical validity criteria used in the paper is suspect. “No vertex should have degree (covalent bonds) exceeding 5. Our data predominantly con-tains hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, sulphur, chlorine and fluorine atoms, none of which have enough valence electrons to bond with more than 5 atoms simultaneously” – Using a single valency threshold for all atoms is chemically incorrect. Each individual atom type should have its own valency value. Eg Carbon should have 4 bonds, Chlorine/Fluorine should have 1 bond. The standard procedure for determining chemical validity in prior works has been to leverage the molecule checking functions from a cheminformatics package, eg RDKit.    \nTable 3: fraction of graphs generated with molecule like structure. The validity threshold (defined as the minimum number of atoms in a molecule graph?) seems to be quite arbitrary. It is not clear to me what rule was used to set the validity thresholds of 5, 15, 25 in BBAB, FBAB, JBCD using the min and max number of atoms in each dataset. Also, why not also set a maximum number of atoms?\n  \n*Few baselines used to compare the proposed model, and missing some recent works  \n\nOther comments/questions  \n“Furthermore, step-by-step graph generation frameworks that use reinforcement learning or other sequential pro-cessing can be slow and result in a high proportion of invalid molecules with sub-stantial post-processing needed in order to satisfy the principles of stoichiometry” – Any benchmarks to explore the computational speed of the proposed model? Also, I’m not sure how the stoichiometry is related to the molecule generation task proposed here.  \n“However, there has been relatively little attention given to graph generation, with the most common approaches being somewhat cumbersome methods of se-quential or reinforcement-learning based generation” – there actually has been quite a lot of recent graph generation methods. Also, should be more precise on what exactly is ‘somewhat cumbersome’ about these existing sequential or RL based graph generation methods?  \nFigure 2, 3, 4: too small to see text   \nHow were the 3 tranches from ZINC (FBAB, BBAB, JBCD) selected? There seems to be ~1.7K tranches in ZINC, with various combinations of molecular weight and logP ranges  \nWhat model is used in the molecular property predictor module?  \n",
