It was demonstrated that the constructed parametric scattering transform shares similar stability to deformations as the traditional scattering transforms, and provides state-of-the-art results for classification in the low-data regime when combined with a linear layer and as well in a hybrid CNN.\n",

The authors should make clear the main contributions of this paper, and present more details in the technical part. The current version is not easy to follow. The authors should provide the insights and more details in answering the question:  is it necessary to use a tight frame when constructing wavelet filterbanks? ",

In particular, it focuses on the Morlet wavelets, whose construction depends on the selection of scales, orientation and aspect ratios of the corresponding wavelet filters. The proposed work has very limited novelty and major contribution lies on the empirical guidance on how to design this special type of wavelet networks for certain data sets. Overall, the work lacks sufficient theoretical depth and the claimed optimality is ad-hoc.  ",

My major concern is the novelty of the proposed work and insufficient contributions in algorithmic/methodology development.",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes to learn an optimal wavelet transform to improve the performance of scattering networks in small-sample classification settings. It shows that  by learning several hyper-parameters of Morlet wavelets, it is possible to make a significant improvement over the default hyper-parameters. It shows that a frame condition for the wavelet transform is not always needed to achieve good performance. \n",
            "main_review": "The paper is well written, but  I have some technical concerns.\n The word tight frame  is often used in the literature for transformations with a much stronger condition (see. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_(linear_algebra)#Tight_frames). It is thus not proper to say that the Morlet wavelet transformation is a tight frame. I would be better to use a different word in the paper. \n\nRegarding the proposed methodology, I have a few questions:\n- What is the range of the hyper-parameters in Table 1? For the frequency scale xi, for example, should it be bounded so that to avoid potential aliasing in the computation of the scattering coefficients? I would make it more clear the domain of these parameters. If it is a constrained optimization problem, how the constraints are addressed? \n- In the section 4.1, to evaluate the distance between two individual wavelets, it seems to me that the distance should also take into account of the periodicity of the frequency scale xi, as it is also periodic as the angles due to the discretization of the wavelets. However, this is not the case. \n- The result in Figure 3 is about the deformation stability, however, it shows only the translation and rotation stability, which seems to be much easier. Are you using the Morlet equivariant parameterization or not (not clear to me)? \n",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper sets out to emprically test whether tight frames can be improved upon by adjusting/learning in various forms (as first stage of a deep network, for example).\nIt claims to show that under learning, tight frames will deviate from tightness (become not tight) and, in the process, not surprisingly, adjust to be better at the tasks trained for (it is after all an optimisation process!). Moe than that, it claims - perhaps also not surprisingly - that the gains are more pronounced in the small data regime (where one might posit that the bias of initialisation at some tight frame might help ensure some efficiency of representation). ",
            "main_review": "I like what the paper sets out to do - in a broad brush way. That is, I think the general topic is worthy of investigation.\nI am less sure that the results of this study - in the way it is carried out - yield much in the way of surprise (and in some sense, in terms of clear message).\n\nFirstly, perhaps to spare the reader of the mathematical formalities, it doesn't even define what a tight frame is. I'll also spare the reader the same gory details but in a nutshell it measures the \"energy loss\" (squared norm)/energy amplification of a frame. A frame must not let the energy drop to zero (otherwise the signal is lost - no information) nor grow to infinity. The essence is stability of inversion. If \"things can get mapped to zero\" then they can't be recovered. If things can get mapped to infinity, likewise there is clear problems of inversion.\nFor a finite frame (and all practical numerical implementations are either finite frames or finite approximations of infinite frames. \nThus the operator framework of frames reduces to standard linear algebra and the frame bounds (lower the energy can become and highest it can become) - and more importantly the ratio of these two, is essentially akin to the standard and familiar condition number. \nA tight frame is one whether the condition number is one - the frame bounds match each other - lower and upper.\n\nMy reason to sketch the above is that I fail to see how one can meaningfully tackle the question(s) posed in the title of the paper without attempting to measure the tightness of the frames involved. Unless I have misunderstood aspects of the paper, the paper seems satisfied with detecting drift away from the original tight frame, in measures related to coefficient changes, but not - as far as I can see - in measures specifically relating to drift from tightness. I could deform one tight frame into another and yet still get quite different end resulting coefficients. \n\nI do understand that there is a rub here - mostly tightness is decided analytically and that numerically one can only estimate the tightness (and as per above - since one deals with finite versions of frames, one is more or less reduced to something akin to taking SVD's to estimate condition number). So that is the sort of thing I would be expecting to see - not some (to me) unrelated measures of coefficient deviation and accompanying informal display of filter responses etc. ",
            "summary_of_the_review": "It seems to me the authors have set off on a well motivated but poorly designed study of an interesting and useful question to study. \nI don't see how their methods can ensure that tightness is really the thing being varied by the experiments (although statistically is is likely to vary) and hence the paper stand on suspect ground.\nThat said, I think it *likely* that the tightness has varied and that the results are generally true (and they are generally unsurprising I might add) - problem is that one needs to quantify variations from tightness to close the argument(s) and I don't see that this paper did that.",
