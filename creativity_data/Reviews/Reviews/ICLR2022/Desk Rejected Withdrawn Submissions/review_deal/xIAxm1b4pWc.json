        "comment": "The paper proposes to incorporate unsupervisedly extracted emotion-related tokens/embeddings to improve sentiment classifiers trained on top of BERT. The strengths of the paper, as identified by reviewers, are in the importance of the problem, a relatively easy-to-reproduce method, and a clear write-up. However, all the reviewers identify several major weaknesses, including the lack of a clear research question, unclear contribution, limited novelty of the method, missing baselines, and relatively small gains in the downstream task of sentiment analysis. In sum, all the reviewers agree that the draft is not yet ready for publication."

These additional emotion inputs are generated using pre-trained transformer in a zero-shot fashion. Experimental results show a modest improvement for existing approaches such as BERT and DistilBERT. \n\n##########################################################################",

Sentiment classification is an important task that has unlimited real-world applications and can also improve the performance of other NLP systems. \n\n2. Although the proposed pipeline is simple. I was easily able to follow the paper, yet I am unable to understand the contribution of the work.\n\n##########################################################################\n\nCons:\n\n1.  I am unable to see a technical contribution of this work. To me, emotion detection is a more challenging task than sentiment classification (the author also highlight this), whereas the proposed work is employing emotion classes to improve sentiment classification.\n\n2. The results do not look very different, with and without emotion information. Moreover, the way to incorporate emotion information in the existing transformers is straight-forward. \n\n3. Can you please share details on the t-test and how and whether the results are statistically significant.\n\n##########################################################################",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes a simple way to supplement emotions related information to a downstream classifier. Authors first utilize a pre-trained BART Model to predict probabilities of a pre-defined set of emotion-related words. Then, they prepend the emotion words as text input to the transformer-based classifier. On two public sentiment classification datasets, authors show that adding emotion information leads to decent performance gains.",
            "main_review": "### Strengths:\n- The authors propose an intuitive, easy-to-implement way to provide additional information in the form of emotion words to improve a downstream sentiment classifier. The paper shows that adding such information improves sentiment classification information on two sentiment classification datasets.\n- The paper describes the experiments in great detail.\n\n\n### Weaknesses:\n- The Paper lacks a research question that the authors are trying to answer. I would suggest authors first define a research problem that they are trying to solve and then should design experiments to answer that. For example, if the research question is to investigate ways in which one can augment pre-trained transformer models, then authors should compare multiple ways to inject such knowledge and carefully study the effectiveness of multiple methods using ablation studies. In the current form, the paper solely focuses on improving performance on a given dataset and reads like a course/Kaggle project report instead of a research paper.\n- Paper lacks a good baseline. As part of the zero-shot pipeline, you are running a BART model so one fair baseline could be to add embeddings generated from BART forward pass to the downstream classifier. Such a process will have an equivalent model capacity and runtime complexity, hence it's a fair baseline to have. Since adding additional information to BERT style models is not novel, authors should also consider comparing their approach with the previously proposed approach such as [1].\n- This work is naturally connected to prompting [2] as prompting provides a simple yet effective way to extract useful information from pre-trained models which can be used for classification. In fact, the 0-shot pipeline that authors are using is doing prompting with the BART model. So, I think it's important to connect this work to promoting literature. Further, I would argue that you don't need the BART model at all as you can simply use prompting to generate a probability distribution over the selected emotion words. Simply pass \"<Your sentences>. This was a {mask}\" to the BERT model and BERT can provide you conditional probabilities of all emotion words that you can use for your downstream classifier.\n- Authors spend a great amount of time discussing ensembling gains. On most of the tasks, we can improve performance using a model ensemble so this piece of information is not at all useful to the NLP community. I would recommend limiting ensemble discussion to just 1-2 sentences and adding additional experiments (ablation studies, comparison with other methods) to make this work interesting.\n \n\n### References: \n1.
