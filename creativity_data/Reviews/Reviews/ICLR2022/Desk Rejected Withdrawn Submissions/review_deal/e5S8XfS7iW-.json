The proposed method considers semantic relationships between concepts and uses neural circuits to express the units aligned to semantically related concepts.",
            "main_review": "Strengths:\n\n(1) Writing: writing is clear and easy to follow\n\n(2) Originality: representing concepts in a structural way is meaningful and many XAI papers consider them as well, e.g.,:\n\n[1] A Peek Into the Reasoning of Neural Networks: Interpreting with Structural Visual Concepts\n\n[2] Interpreting CNN Knowledge via an explanatory graph.\n\nIntroducing structural information in Network DIissection is interesting and promising\n\nWeakness:\n\n(1) Lack of baselines, looks like the results do not compare with baseline methods.\n\n(2) Fidelity of the alignment: human-understandable concepts may not be used by CNN during the decision, if the CNN use other decision logic which has no strong relation to the human-defined concepts, then the alignment can not explain the decision of CNN.\n\n(3) Generalization: Could we automatically find the concepts instead of human-predefined? It looks hard in the current setting. If we want to explore the alignment on new tasks (segmentation, detection, VQA) and other datasets, it look we need to create fine-grained annotations for each new dataset/task.\n\n(4) The automatic propagate looks highly aligned with WordNet, how to handle the situation that WordNet structure can not easily maintain in a given dataset. For instance, the dataset may have no label for high-level concepts. For instance, 'animal 'is not a common label, you may need to manually label each of these concepts.",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper aims at proposing an approach for the semantic alignment of neural networks units and human-level concepts in the same vein as the work of [Bau et al, 2017]  and their network dissection approach. Compared to previous work, the authors constrain the alignment with an ontology, i.e. concepts and their relations thus providing a semantic alignment measure and a  new interpretation and inspection approach based on neural circuit coherence. Experimental validation of the approach is done on the Broden dataset and its extended version. ",
            "main_review": "**Strenghs**\n\n+ The idea of using ontology-driven semantic alignment is very interested in the context of neuron units interpretability. Indeed,  it contributes to advancing the understanding of deep neural models which is of prime importance for their deployment.  The proposed approach can be seen as an improvement of the Network Dissection approach [Bau et al, 2017] by constraining and exploiting a structured knowledge between semantic concepts, represented as an ontology. As it is usual to represent domain knowledge in the form of ontology, it seems a good way to improve semantic alignment.\n+ The paper is well written.\n+ Results on the Broden dataset are promising\n\n**Weaknessess and main concerns**\n\n+ Several references are missing in the related work section both in order to better position the proposed approach compared to other neural network understanding approaches. For instance, how is the approach compared to concept activation vectors  (Kim et al) and their extension? How is the approach position compared to approaches that have shown the importance of semantics in deep neural networks?  I also suggest to the authors to have a deep look at the literature on ontology matching and alignment. \n+ One of the strong hypothesis of the proposed approach is the availability of a pixel-level annotated dataset. How to relax this hypothesis ? What is the behavior of the approach in the case of a noisy annotated dataset and thus a noisy concept mask ?\n+ Some strong formalization is needed. For instance, in the equation of section 3.1, an implication relation is used. On the ontology and domain representation level, implication relation has well-defined semantics. Moreover, this equation (1) should be more discussed since the second part of the equation is closer to a mereology relation than a hypernymy relation.\n+ A deeper discussion on the relation between semantic similarity and visual similarity is needed since that paper assumes a strong correlation.\n+ What about the semantics of the semantic relation s ? \n+ The results of Figure 3 is not so clear and coherence and a measure on the similarity between the extracted concepts could be important additional information.\n+ What is the behavior of the approach with different semantic measures than the Jian and Conrath ?\n+ What brings the circuit in term of interpretation ?\n\n",
            "summary_of_the_review": "The proposed approach is interesting but can be seen as an improvement of the network dissection approach by constraining high-level concepts with an ontology.   Although interesting, the novelty of the approach is limited and based on very strong assumptions that are not sufficiently discussed. Moreover, the approach lacks a more solid foundation in the area of ontology alignment.",

It uses a pre-trained CNN architecture for computer vision, and assigns structured semantic roles to a subset U of its neural units of the last layers. As the ontology introduces semantic relations between concepts the NN is enabled to cluster topologically related units into semantically rich and meaningful neural circuits.\nThe evaluation shows the difference between the IoU measure and the newly introduced sigma measure as well as the accuracy effects if neural circuits that are aligned to ontological concepts of the Broden and ImageNet dataset are removed.\n \nThe paper contributes:\nAn ontology on top of the Broden dataset where relations are defined without using additional annotations by including hypernymy semantic relations.\nA developed metric or probabilistic formulation (score function sigma) of the interaction between neural activations and semantic concepts\nDerived from the IOU measure of (Bau et al. 2017) to be independent from the popularity of a concept in the dataset.\nAlignment of the neural units with multiple concepts.\nFor every unit u, sigma yields the relation to every individual concept and concept of families and therefore shows the most related semantic classes.\n--> Increased interpretability",

            "summary_of_the_review": "Using auxiliary information in form of an ontology seems to be a promising research direction. However, based on the evaluations it is not clear how the metric benefits from the concept relations of the ontology. It would be from interest to better explain why the idea of unifying concepts in an ontology improves the interpretability.\n \nTherefore, the paper needs to rework on grounding the key message of the paper with a more precise evaluation.",
