            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper proposes an error-mitigation/regularization strategy for a certain family of near-term quantum neural networks (QNN). The authors propose 3 techniques that are supposed to make a QNN more resilient to noise:\n1. Post-measurement normalization - basically the quantum analog of batch normalization,\n2. Noise injection - adding additional random gates that perturb the computation or the measurement outcome,\n3. Post-measurement quantization - quantizing measurement outcomes on layer boundaries, akin to a classical layer-wise nonlinearity.\nThe authors present ample numerical evidence by evaluating different QNN architectures on different (very small) datasets and different quantum hardware (including classical simulation). These numerical experiments seem to imply that the presented methods improve the robustness of the QNN.",
            "main_review": "On the positive side, the paper presents some intuition and a wealth of numerical evidence that the presented methods improve the robustness of the QNN. Unfortunately, I find the theoretical/mathematical part of the paper to be lacking rigor and detail. The paper contains a single theorem that is only proved in the (trivial) specific case of a single qubit -- the authors' remark that the theorem is easy to generalize to multiple qubits is unsubstantiated, and likely nontrivial in the presence of any entanglement (which is necessary for any preformance improvement when compared to classical neural networks). As it is stated and proved, the theorem can not be applied to the inherently multi-qubit states of the entire QNN. The presentation of the paper would be also greatly improved if the authors differentiated more clearly between input vectors (or matrices?), their labels, random variables, their expectations (and empirical estimates thereof), underlying probabilities etc. The entire theoretical contribution of the paper seems to be the application of the well-known technique of batch normalization on the measurement outcomes of a quantum layer.",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "In this paper the  authors propose a quantum neural network framework for mitigating the effects of noise resulting from the quantum computer various processes. The paper is well written and clearly presents the concepts necessary for the understanding of the results and contribution. The paper proposes post-measurement quantization and normalization as well as noise injection for the increase of the accuracy during the learning process.",
            "main_review": "The authors present three methods to improve and take into account the noise brought by the usage of quantum computer to the artificial neural networks. The paper is well written but several concerns appear:\n\n1 - the introduced method are by default independent from the neural network. The post measurement effects and representation as linear additive noise are well known in classical quantum literature and various methods already exists. The proposed methods by the authors are standard approaches already being used to even simply to obtain reliable results of measurement from ensemble quantum systems for instance. Post measurement normalization and quantization is thus very standard approach to deal with the noise created as a result of quantum-> classical information transformation, The obtained results are therefore not unexpected. \n2 - noise augmented learning. similarly to the previous comment introducing the noise for learning is - as even the authors commented correctly - quite an established and studied fact. In addition the noise introduced here is no different than the usually inserted noise. Therefore the result is not surprising. \n3 - finally due to the above mentioned comments, I feel that the paper is not the best match for this conference because it does not introduce novel concepts but rather applies well known concepts as a application to a technology that can offer much more.

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper introduces a noise model for quantum computing for both training and inference stages of a quantum neural network, yielding improved accuracy on real hardware. The paper provides experimental evidence for a simplified noise model and proposes three noise mitigation strategies: measurement normalisation; data augmentation step via noise injection during training; and post-measurement quantisation. Experimental results are shown on 6 physical quantum devices and 8 classification tasks, showing significant classification accuracy improvements.",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper considers the effect of noise in quantum neural networks (QNN) and proposes the following techniques to mitigate noise in QNN:\n\n(1) The authors claim that the output of a noisy QNN is a linear function of the output of a noiseless QNN. So they give a method to normalize the output.\n\n(2) The authors propose to inject noise during the training of QNN. This is only relevant when we simulate the training of QNN on classical computers. If we train the QNN on quantum computers, this technique does not seem useful.\n\n(3) The authors consider quantizing the output of a noisy QNN which can effectively remove small noise.\n\nThe authors presented numerical and physical experiments to demonstrate the usefulness of the above techniques.",
            "main_review": "I will separately discuss the three techniques proposed in this work. \n\nTechnique 1:\n\nThe observation that \"the noisy output is close to a linear function of the ideal output\" is already presented in [1]. The scenario in [1] focuses on general quantum circuits, which include QNN as a special case. Furthermore, the linear functional relation only holds (from the proof of Theorem 3.1) when the noise can be represented as \\rho_i --> E(\\rho_i). However, this assumption is not generally true.\n\nConsider a gate-dependent noise model: Hadamard gate has almost no error, but T gate has a depolarization noise of 0.05.\n\nThe two single-qubit quantum circuits,\n0 -> H -> H -> H -> H -> H -> H -> H -> H\n0 -> T -> T -> T -> T -> T -> T -> T -> T\ndo not follow the assumption used in this paper.\n\nIn the all H circuit, we have |0><0| --> |0><0|.\nIn the all T circuit, we have |0><0| --> (0.95^8) |0><0| + (1 - 0.95^8) (I / 2).\n\nSuch a gate-dependent noise model is common in quantum circuits. [1] motivates the linear functional form more carefully. Therefore, it seems that the first main technique proposed in this work does not capture physical reality well.\n\nTechnique 2:\n\nWe expect that the training of QNN to be done on quantum computers. The noise injection only makes sense when we simulate the training of QNN on classical computers. But there is no advantage in using QNN if we only simulate them on classical computers (and will easily become intractable when we have 100 qubits in the QNN). Furthermore, physicists and people working in quantum computing have already been simulating noise to understand the physical system better, see e.g., [2, 3]. I don't think this technique is a worthy contribution.\n\nTechnique 3:\n\nDiscretization (quantization) of the output is a reasonable approach for removing small noise. QML models for multi-class classification already used this technique, see e.g., [4]. Hence the technique itself is not novel.\n\nOverview:\n\nI think the main contribution of this work is the evaluation of these well-known techniques in noisy QNN for classification tasks. The authors should tone down the proposal of these techniques because they seem to be mostly known.\n\nI do appreciate the extensive experiments conducted in this work. The experiments are a solid contribution to the field. However, the experimental results are all expected.\n\n[1] Czarnik, Piotr, et al. \"Error mitigation with Clifford quantum-circuit data.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2005.10189 (2020).\n\n[2] Madjarov, Ivaylo S., et al. \"High-fidelity entanglement and detection of alkaline-earth Rydberg atoms.\" Nature Physics 16.8 (2020): 857-861.\n\n[3] Magesan, Easwar, et al. \"Modeling quantum noise for efficient testing of fault-tolerant circuits.\" Physical Review A 87.1 (2013): 012324.\n\n[4] Cappelletti, William, Rebecca Erbanni, and Joaquín Keller. \"Polyadic quantum classifier.\" 2020 IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering (QCE).
