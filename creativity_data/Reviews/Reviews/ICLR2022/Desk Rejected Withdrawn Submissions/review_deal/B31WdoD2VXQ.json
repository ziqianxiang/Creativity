            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes an approach, namely SLT-Net, for segmenting concealed objects from images and videos. The paper also contributes a dataset MoCA-Mask (refined and added ground-truth masks and pseudo-masks to MoCA). The main technical contributions of SLT-Net include a short-term correlation architecture (instead of directly using flows as in previous methods) and a long-term consistency architecture. Experiments are done on CAD, COD10K, and CoCA-Mask with good results compared with state-of-the-art approaches. Written presentation are mostly clean and easy to follow except a few places (detailed below).",
            "main_review": "## Strengths:\n- Directly using correlation instead of using optical flows in short term architecture is well-motivated and shown effectiveness.\n- The overall architecture is effective and achieve state-of-the-art performance on three different datasets.\n- Good ablation and selection of baseline methods.\n- The paper also contributes a new (although it is not completely new) dataset and benchmarking results on it.\n\n## weakness:\n- Written presentation is unclear at some parts. For example, the CAB block is presented clearly in text and in Eq (1) and Eq (2), but that seem different from Figure 3. In Eq (1) and (2) there seem to have correlation dot product followed by exp and then normalization. However, in figure 3 there are also MaxPool and Conv, why these operators are not explained in text or equations?",
            "summary_of_the_review": "In overall, the contributions of the paper are good: the proposed architecture achieve SoTA results on 3 different datasets, solid ablations, and contributes a (partly) new dataset. With further clarification / presentation improvement, I believe this paper could be a good read for ICLR audience, thus I recommend to accept this paper conditioned written/presentation improvements.",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper attempts a problem called Video Concealed Object Detection (VCOD). \nBy concealed objects, authors mean where objects have a lot of similarities with the background, making even motion difficult to detect for segmenting them effectively. \n\nThe authors proposed a two-stage method: short-term correlation pyramid & long-term refinement. \nIn the short-term correlation pyramid, multi-scale features are extracted from the transformer encoding, and correlations are found to form a pyramid, which gives the global correspondence required to extract motion-related features. The CNN decoder helps with the segmentation, which is further refined using LSTM at the video level while concatenating it with the original frames. \n \nThe authors introduce a new dataset called Moca-Mask, which comprises 141 video sequences (with every 5th frame labeled).\nThe results are better than the existing methods.\n\n\n\n\n",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes a framework for video concealed object detection, which has been called camouflaged object detection/segmentation in prior works. The proposed framework, namely SLT-Net, includes two subnets: short-term and long-term networks. SLT-Net includes many components, mostly from existing works, such as transformer encoder, short-term correlation pyramid, CNN decoder for motion capturing from two consistent frames, and spatial-temporal transformer for long-term consistency computation. The authors also rebuild a dataset, namely MoCA-Mask, on top of the original MoCA dataset by selecting videos and annotating segmentation mask. Experimental results show that SLT-Net is better than compared methods.",
            "main_review": "The MoCA-Mask dataset with its segmentation mask ground-truth can be used to train models, which need to exploit temporal information in videos. Therefore, this dataset is expectedly helpful for the community.\n\nThe proposed SLT-Net is a collection of existing work. The transformer backbone for both subnets is from [Wang et al., 2021a]. Components of the short-term subnet come from [Fan et al., 2021a] and [Wei et al., 2020]. In addition, descriptions of weighted IOU loss and BCE loss are incorrect. The long-term subnet is from [Ji et al., 2021a] and [Fan et al., 2021b]. The authors cannot combine many works and then say their developed network is contribution. It is not applied for a top conference. Furthermore, pseudo ground-truth creation is described in detail unnecessarily.\n\nThe experiments are unfair. First, I wonder why the authors compare their method with other methods on the COD10K image dataset, although the task is for video. Compared methods are old, and from experiments of [Fan et al., 2021a]; the authors do not compare their method with new camouflaged object detection/segmentation methods published in 2021. In addition, they use a spatial version of SLT-Net, called SLT-Net-Single, by removing all temporal related components. It means that the SLT-Net-Single is just a combination of transformer encoder and CNN decoder, which are from other work. Therefore, this experiment is meaningless. Second, for the MoCA-Mask dataset, the performance of SLT-Net-Single (which is already better than compared methods) is approximate to those of the two proposed methods (SLT-Net-short-term and SLT-Net-long-term) when not using pseudo labels and slightly smaller than those of the two proposed methods when using pseudo labels (less than 3%). In addition, the SLT-Net-long-term is just slightly better than SLT-Net-short-term (less than 1%), not “outperforming” as mentioned in the manuscript. It shows that the proposed methods are not so effective. And it is similar for the CAD dataset. In addition, the CAD is too small, with only 9 video sequences. How do the authors can train and test methods on this small dataset? Third, the contribution of short-term correlation pyramid, which is highlighted in the Introduction, is not evaluated.\n\nPaper writing needs to be revised to correct claims and conflicts in the manuscript.\n\nThe task of concealed object detection has been investigated for several years. It was called camouflaged object detection/segmentation in both image [a, b] and video [c]. The authors just changed the name from “camouflaged object” to “concealed object” in order to claim “video concealed object detection is relatedly new and unexplored problem,” which is unreasonable and incorrect. The authors should cite these works instead of renaming the task without mentioning the original work to say their work is new.\n\n[a] Trung-Nghia Le et al., Anabranch network for camouflaged object segmentation, CVIU, 2019.\n[b] Deng-Ping Fan et al., Camouflaged object detection, CVPR, 2020.\n[c] Hala Lamdouar et al., Betrayed by motion: camouflaged object discovery via motion segmentation, ACCV, 2020.\n\nThere is a logical conflict in the manuscript. The authors say that VCOD is more challenging than COD in images, and optical flow fails to estimate motions. Because of this observation, they propose to use a dense correlation volume to implicitly capture motions between neighbouring frames. However, they also say that the concealed state is broken when the object moves, and they use optical flow to propagate the masks, resulting in pseudo ground-truth for training networks. \n\nThe task should be consistent throughout the manuscript. The authors use both “detect” and “segment” to identify the same task.\n",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper presents an approach for concealed object segmentation in videos. Motion cues in videos are critical to the task. However, explicitly estimating optical flow is not reliable. So this approach proposes to use a full-range correlation pyramid for capturing short-term motion cues in neighboring frames, and use spatial-temporal transformers (sequence-to-sequence models) for capturing long-term motion cues in the whole video. Since there are no public large scale dataset for this task, they also curate a benchmark on top of MoCA. The final results on the benchmark dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of both modules. ",
            "main_review": "Strength:\n(1) Overall, the paper is well written and reads smoothly.\n(2) The motivation behind the core modules of the proposed method, including the correlation pyramid and the spatial-temporal transformer, is clearly stated and convincing. \n(3) The experimental results are clearly state-of-the-art.\n\n\nWeakness:\n(1) The related work section is not satisfying. In particular, side-by-side comparison of this work and the existing works is missing. This is particularly important to clearly understand the technical contributions of this work.\n\n(2) The improvement brought by the two modules is much smaller than the improvement brought by the baseline SLT-Net-single as shown in Table 1 & 2. This needs to be discussed.\n\n(3) It will be helpful to provide some visual illustrations on how the two modules improve the segmentation accuracy. \n\nQuestions for authors:\n(1) In Table 1, SLT-Net-single, which should be a baseline, is already significantly better than other methods. Is this because of the use of transformers for extracting features? Has the previous works explored the use of transformers to extract features in this field?\n\n(2) In Table 2, SLT-Net-short-term get even worse results than SLT-Net-Single when there are no pseudo labels. The reason needs to be discussed here.\n\n(3) In Figure 3, what is the role of the max pool operator?\n\n\n\n",
            "summary_of_the_review": "This paper presents an interesting approach to address the concealed object segmentation problem. A benchmark dataset is proposed. The related work section is less satisfying but I think can be fixed in the rebuttal stage. The empirical evaluation is less satisfying--- it seems the improvement brought by the proposed two modules is marginal compared to the baseline SLT-Net-single. ",
