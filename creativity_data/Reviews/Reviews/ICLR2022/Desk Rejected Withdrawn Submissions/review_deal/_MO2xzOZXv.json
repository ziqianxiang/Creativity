The reviewers provided good comments to authors that can improve their work.\n\nStrengths/Weaknesses:\n\n(+) Experimental results are reasonably detailed with an extensive ablation study. \n\n(-) Experimental results are limited to two synthetic and one small MUTAG dataset.\n\n(-) The reviewers found the work to be missing a motivation. The authors are correct that subgraph isomorphism frequencies and counts are extremely important in many areas of science, including graph representation learning, the reviewers found it unclear why GNNs are the right tool for the task (in lieu of a specialized randomized algorithm, for instance). \n\n(-) Regarding specialized algorithms, there are state-of-the-art randomized algorithms that are not search-based via backtracking cited in the paper, such as Motivo (Bressan et al., 2020) and PSRW (Wang et al., 2014) and their derivatives (as one of the reviewers pointed out).\n\n(-) The reviewers were not particularly excited with the technical depth of the paper.\n\nThe work definitively has potential. I would encourage the authors to consider better motivating the work."

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper present a graph neural network model for subgraph isomorphism counting. The proposed GNN model is based on aggregating and propagating edge features. The edge embeddings of the input graph are generated based on the embeddings of the query graph. The isomorphism counting is performed in a semi-supervised manner. Experimental results on two synthetic dataset and one TU dataset (MUTAG) has been presented.",
            "main_review": "Overall the paper is well-written. The main contribution of the paper is the proposed graph neural network model for subgraph isomorphism counting based on edge embeddings generated by propagating edge features. \n\nThe main concerns to arrive at the recommendation are as follows.\n\n1. Motivation: While it is stressed enough in the paper that node-centric embeddings fall short of matching complex structures for isomorphism counting, the paper fails to answer and convince how exactly does it fall short and how does the proposed method address this issue? Also, the motivation for the proposed module on modulation conditioned on queries is not well explained in the paper. In essence, the rationale for the proposed method is not clear.\n\n2. Scalability and datasets: Apparently generating input graph representation based on queries is computationally too intensive, particularly when the input graph is large with many edges with subgraph isomorphism counting is mostly interesting for large-sized graphs. Towards this end, the experiments presented with datasets (two synthetic and one small MUTAG dataset) are too limited. Please present results on OGB datasets? This becomes evermore important, when  Buritsas et al. 2020 solves the same problem, but large OGB datasets. Also, please provide comparison with Buritsas et al. 2020, along with more elaborate claims on contributions with w.r.t.  Buritsas et al. 2020.\n\n3. Expressivity and power: Since Buritsas et al. 2020 presents results about expressiveness and power of the GSN, a suggestion would be to consider presenting theoretical characterization of the proposed model.\n\n4. Typos and clarity: There are few typos or unclear text in the paper (e.g., error, the need for subgraph patterns etc.). The notation for edge embeddings {\\bf h}_<.,u> and {\\bf h}_e seem similar, but please define {\\bf h}_e. In equations (5) and (6), why are \\gamma_e and \\beta_e scalars, whiles boldface letters are used for vectors.\n",
            "summary_of_the_review": "The proposed model for subgraph isomorphism counting is not well-motivation, and the claimed shortcomings for existing methods based node-embeddings are not justified. Comparison in terms of experiments as well contributions with a closed related paper Buritsas et al. 2020 that solves the same problem and provides a theoretical characterization is missing. Experimental validation is limited, datasets are not diverse to support the model (there are many TU datasets and preferably OGB datasets that may be used, for instance).",

This paper proposes two strategies in enhancing existing GNNs to achieve the goal. First, instead of using node-centric message passing, an edge-centric message passing is used. Second, a synergy between query graph and target graph is proposed to make the graph representation between both. It is shown that the proposed approach outperforms baselines.\n\n",

The paper is in general well written and easy to follow.\n3. The proposed approach has demonstrated better performance than baselines.\n\nWeaknesses:\n1. It needs to be better motivated why the count itself is important while the exact match is not. \n2. Although the solution has shown its superiority empirically, there is not too much theoretical analysis why it is the case. For example, what is so different of the current edge-centric message passing from node-centric message passing where edge information is also included. And why this difference has a better expressiveness in addressing subgraph isomorphism problem.\n3. The joint representation of both query graph and candidate graph is not new, and why the proposed approach is superior to the existing ones?\n4. It is better advised the implications of the prediction error in the experiments. First, MAE is dependent on the absolute size of the graphs etc, better to change it to MAPE. Second, according to Q-error, the prediction is in average twice or 1/2 of the ground truth. How can we leverage the predicted result in practice?\n\nReferences:\n[1 Bai et al., SimGNN: A Neural Network Approach to Fast Graph Similarity Computation, WSDM 2019\n[2] Li et al., Graph Matching Networks for Learning the Similarity of Graph Structured Objects, ICML 2019.",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The authors propose a graph neural network (GNN) model for subgraph isomorphism counting.

            "main_review": "Strengths:\n- Model is explained clearly, and the motivation for an edge-centric approach is reasonable.\n- Experimental results show clear improvement both in performance and/or speed over competing models.\n- Model and codebase could be of interest to subject matter experts.\n\nWeaknesses:\n- Experiments are performed in relatively small networks\n- It is not clear who the target audience is for this work. Model doesn't seem to adequately please any particular group (see below for details)\n- No case study to justify the practical value of the proposed method\n- Some citations missing, in particular work on fixed-parameter tractable algorithms\n\n\nExtended review:\nAs mentioned in the \"Strenghts\", I think that the authors do a good job at explaining their model and motivating the problem. It should be relatively straightforward for an interested party to reproduce the results, especially with the provided code. The experimental results, in particular the ablation study, provide compelling evidence to support the claims about the advantages of an edge-centric approach.\n\nWhere I believe this paper falls short is in having a clear target audience and providing more evidence that their model is relevant to that audience. \n\nOn one side, we have people who want an exact solution or at least an approximate solution with some theoretical guarantee on the approximation; this includes theoreticians and also practitioners who need to have some sense of the accuracy of the method. The paper is NOT targeted to this audience, since the authors hint heavily at the fact that empirical errors of GNN approaches are within a tolerable margin. Furthermore, any kind of theoretical analysis is challenging in this type of models.\n\nThat leaves us with subject matter experts in applications where an approximate count, without rigorous guarantees on the approximation, suffices. For this crowd, it is not clear how impactful the results in Table 2 and 3 would be. Looking at the MAE, existing methods have an error of 10 (common) to 70+ (rare) on average. Is missing 10 subgraphs or up to 70 in some cases a significant hurdle in practice? Moreover, if we look at the Q-error, for instance GCN-SMALL, a 14.8 MAE translates to a 2.1 Q-error, which means that the true count in these graphs is somewhat between 7 and 28 subgraphs. Is that a significant error?\n\nI think the paper would greatly benefit from a case study where the authors show that the proposed method is improving the \"quality of life\" for a subject matter expert. If the proposed method helps to new insights that were not possible with previous counting methods, that would be very compelling evidence. Otherwise, it is challenging to assess the relevance of the method for practitioners.\n\nAs a third candidate audience for this work, we have machine learning experts working an graph representation learning. I do not believe that the work introduces any new insights to this crowd, since the components and ideas used in the model have been used before.\n\nMinor comments:\n- The authors state that subgraph isomorphism counting is NP-complete. Technically, it is #P-complete.\n- One way to deal with the computational complexity in counting problems is to consider fixed-parameter tractable algorithms.

See for instance Alon, Noga, Raphael Yuster, and Uri Zwick. \"Color-coding.\" Journal of the ACM (JACM) 42.4 (1995): 844-856. \n- On page 4, line 4, it should be h^0_{u,v} \\neq h^0_{v,u}",

In this paper, the main technical contribution made by the authors should be the edge-centric message-passing network for graph isomorphism counting, in replacement of the existing node-centric message-passing neural network, because of the insight from the authors that edges are more important than nodes in graph isomorphism. The other parts of the network are kept to be simple neural network building blocks to perform the regression task on the number of isomorphic subgraphs. The experiment results show that the proposed method can outperform existing GNNs, but there is still much room for improvement compared to the optimal ground truth labels.",
            "main_review": "### Strengths\n1. The proposed method seems to have a simple model structure but the experiment results are good compared to other GNN-based methods.\n1. The experiment results are detailed with dataset configuration, ablation study, and a study on the sensitivity of the parameters.\n1. The experiment setups are detailed and the code is provided to reproduce the reported results.\n\n### Weaknesses\n1. The major technical contribution made in this paper, according to my own understanding, is the edge-centric graph neural network. The experiment results on various datasets show that the edge-centric GNN is more powerful compared to other node-centric GNNs. However, it is not a novel idea for incorporating edge features in GNNs, just to name a few:\n    * https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07620\n    * https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Gong_Exploiting_Edge_Features_for_Graph_Neural_Networks_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf\n\n    The other modules designed in this paper seem to be standard neural network building blocks, to perform the regression task towards the ground truth number of isomorphic graphs. Therefore, the technical contribution of this paper is somewhat trivial.\n1. The proposed pipeline of this paper (also the pipeline in RGCN/RGIN, Liu et al, KDD 2020) seems to be an extension from the line of graph similarity learning papers to the subgraph isomorphism problem. Some representative graph similarity learning papers are\n    * http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.12787\n    * http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01098\n    * http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05689\n    * https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03092\n\n    And the above papers are usually more technically novel by explicitly considering the matching step. Besides, a drawback of these methods that perform a regression task at the output step (including yours) is that the network cannot provide the matching result which is crucial for certain applications. This line of works does not touch the combinatorial nature of graph similarity/isomorphism either. Therefore, I am also suggesting another line of works that can provide graph matching results and/or explicitly deals with the graph similarity problem as a combinatorial problem: \n    * https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.15039\n    * https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03129\n    * https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00597\n\n### Other Remarks\n1. It seems improper to add the \"QED\" sign in Definition 1.\n2. Perhaps a typo in Sec 3.1: messages on edges are propagated to and aggregated for each edge based on the edge adjacency, as shown in **Fig. 2(b)c**.",
            "summary_of_the_review": "The strength of this paper is that the experiment results are detailed with ablation studies. However, my major concern about this paper is the technical contribution made by this paper, and I would personally regard this paper as a combination of existing techniques. I have provided some suggestions in the \"weakness\" part, and I am wishing to see a technically improved version of this paper in the coming venues.\n",
