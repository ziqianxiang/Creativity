            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes WeaveNet to solve linear assignment problems. The authors focus on the problem of over-smoothing in GCN and claim to alleviate it with the design of stacked set-encoder and cross-concatenation operations. The authors verified their algorithms on some datasets used in literatures and 3d point cloud matching.",
            "main_review": "+ the focus of solving linear assignment problems is relative novel\n+ it is a  fully-symmetric solver, which is the desired property\n\n- Overall, this is a feed-forward network that they to solve very general NP-Hard problems. I guess this is too good to be true and likely impractical. I would love to see more realistic work that combines traditional search guided by neural networks;\n- The details of sec 3.2 is hard to follow;\n- The experiments are preliminary and mostly just ablation studies. Although the authors perform a lot of experiments, most, if not all, baselines results are provided by the authors themselves rather than from the previous paper, which renders the whole section not that informative. This is especially for the 3D point cloud matching problem. There are a lot of networks designed for this task.\n- I guess the biggest problem for networks like WeaveNet is its generalizability. I guess for many categories of linear assignment problems where similarity is not important unlike 3D point cloud matching, such networks would not work at all. For example, I am interested to see if the author could test their solver to solve a general SAT problem or a max-SAT problem in which benchmarks are widely available. A section that discusses the limitation should be included IMO.",
            "summary_of_the_review": "Overall I am neural regarding my recommendation of the paper. This paper has its own merits. However, it is unclear how practical such a solver is given the experiments are mostly ablation studies and the benchmarks are not informative.",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The authors propose a simple architecture, called WeaveNet, to handle the classical assignment problems. It builds on top of the stacked set-encoder structure, which can relieve the over-smoothing and larger search space problem of the standard GCNs. Experiments show that it is much better than the standard graph neural networks in some toy experiments and also effective on the 3D point cloud matching task.",
            "main_review": "+The presentation is clear, and the figures are informative. Besides, the experiments can also support most of the claims.\n\n-The authors claim that the WeaveNet can approximate two strongly NP-hard variants, which is somehow overclaiming. With some limit-scaled experiments, it is hard to say like this.\n\n-There are no ablation studies on the proposed structure. The proposed WeaveNet is built on the stacked set-encoder with cross-concatenation operations, which is unclear to me why it should be like this.\n\n-The evaluation of 3D point cloud matching is somehow over-simplified. Although it shows some improvements on the selected setting, I am not sure how it will perform on large-scale evaluations.",
            "summary_of_the_review": "Overall, the paper is in good shape. It will be better if the authors can handle the problem of ablation studies to have a systematic analysis of the method itself. On the other hand, the toy experiments somehow make the paper a little weaker.",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper proposed a network architecture (WeaveNet) that predicts an affinity matrix between two sets of elements.  The proposed network is symmetric between two sets and is more powerful than previous works DBA (Gibbons et al., 2019) using the set encoder and cross concatenation. Experiments on synthetic dataset for stable matching and 3D point cloud matching show improvements over baselines. ",
            "main_review": "Strength:\n\n1. The paper proposed several improvements over previous works to learn better affinity matrix between two sets of elements including two streams of feature processing with cross concatenation, and set-encoder to aggregate the features.\n\n2. The experiment conducted on the synthetic dataset is solid, by comparing heuristics methods using handcrafted features, the paper also ablated on the model size (different number of elements), and different components in the paper (in particular: single stream WeaveNet), as well as the generalization analysis to domain shifts. \n\nWeakness:\n\n1. Overclaiming. The paper claimed the proposed method to be \"a differentiable solver for non-linear assignment problem\". However, the main idea is using the network to predict an affinity matrix and binarize the matrix to get the assignment (Sec. 3.1). This is very different from a solver for assignment problem, first, the affinity matrix generated by a network will not be optimal for the assignment problem, second, even given an affinity matrix, determine the optimal assignment from this matrix is not a trivial problem (Hungarian algorithm is often used).\n\n2. Novelty. predicting an affinity matrix between two sets of elements have been discussed for many literatures (point cloud matching, structure from motion, etc), The most related work is DBA (Gibbons et al., 2019), however, the improvement upon this paper is minor: a) cross concatenation only concatenates one matrix with transposing another matrix (second paragraph in sec 3.2) to make it  two streams and the output to be symmetric, b) replace max-pool in GBA with set-encoder (which is first MLP, then max-pool). The previous approach is  $cat(\\varphi(z),max_{z^{\\prime} \\in z_v} \\varphi (z^{\\prime}))$ and the proposed approach is $\\varphi_2 (cat(z,max_{z^{\\prime} \\in z_v} \\varphi (z^{\\prime})))$ (Eq.1) these two improvements are minor comparing with previous works. \n\n3. Experiments: The comparison with CN3D model on 3D point cloud is evaluated when \" sub-sampled 64 among 1024 points after the feature embedding module and evaluated their accuracy\", only sampling 64 points will introduce a huge variance in the final result. It's not convincing the the problem is due to the memory consumption, as during inference, pytorch will not need to save intermediate results, and the memory is much small typically. There is also no qualitative examples in the paper.\n\nOther questions:\n4. In Sec 3.2, the second paragraph is showing \" $z^{12}$ and $z^{21}$ are organized by 2D dimensional features\",  which means the last dimension is 2D, however, in the third paragraph, \"$z^{12}\\in R^{N^2×D}$ be a row of Z12\", which means the last dimension is D, why having this inconsistency?\n\n5. small typos:\n\"which have two streams that models\" -> \"which have two streams that model\"",

Also, they propose a testing protocol and a few criteria to evaluate the performance of methods on the stable matching problem.",
            "main_review": "The strengths and weaknesses are listed below.\n\nStrengths:\n1. A fully-symmetric solver is proposed with SOTA performance.\n2. Overall, the manuscript is well-prepared.\n\nWeakness:\n1. Some parts are not clear. For example, what's the loss function of this method? From the evaluation part of the manuscript, I feel this method is a supervised method, can the method be extended to the unsupervised scenario? \n2. Although it's understandable, the hand-crafted features are still better than the proposed method.\n3. It's unclear what has been learned from the data. In other words, it is not clear what contributes to the performance of the model.\n4. The authors motivated them to develop the proposed method by claiming that many problems are symmetric, which is indeed true. But what if the problem is asymmetric? How could the proposed method handle this case?\n5. Some traditional structured prediction methods, such as SSVM, CRF, are neither referred nor compared, which is a minor concern.",
