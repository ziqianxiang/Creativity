            "summary_of_the_paper": "- The paper focuses on the problem of panoptic segmentation with a specific focus on occluded scenarios.\n- The proposed method uses UPSNet as the backbone and the detection branch is modified.\n- The features in the ROI lattice are used to compute posterior probability using a mixture of gaussian which are further scaled up using an attention map.\n- The results are reported on the COCO dataset and the Cityscapes dataset. The main baseline is UPSNet.\n",
            "main_review": "**Strengths**\n- I appreciate the choice of the focus problem. Panoptic segmentation under occlusion is challenging and worth the research efforts.\n- The paper is well written and easy to follow.\n- The proposed approach is reasonable and shows promise given the showcased qualitative examples.\n\n\n**Weaknesses**\n- UPSNet is a weak baseline in comparison to the current state-of-the-art methods proposed for COCO and Cityscapes [1, 2, 3]. UPSNet reports 46.7 PQ on COCO is around 9 points behind the current architectures, which also perform well under occlusion. The proposed approach is general and should be tested on these architectures to make a strong case for its efficacy.\n\n- Table 1, the reported metrics PQ, SQ and RQ are worse than the baseline UPSNet. I believe these metrics are \"higher the better\". Is this a typo? The supporting text in the paper does not go with the numbers reported in the table. Please let me know if I have misunderstood anything here.\n\n- The quantitative results on the Cityscapes dataset are in the appendix. This is a main result and I would encourage the authors to make this part of the main paper. Further, the results on the cityscapes infact get worse compared to the baseline.\n\n- Please quantitatively evaluate the proposed approach on the subset of COCO and Cityscapes which is more \"occluded\". For example, this subset can be defined using heuristics based on bounding box IoU. This would provide key insights into whether the proposed approach is truly working under occlusion. \n\n\nReferences:\n[1] K-Net: Towards Unified Image Segmentation, NeurIPS 2021\n[2] MaskFormer: Per-Pixel Classification is Not All You Need for Semantic Segmentation, NeurIPS 2021\n[3] MaX-DeepLab: End-to-End Panoptic Segmentation with Mask Transformers, CVPR 2021",
            "summary_of_the_review": "- The proposed approach is not supported with good results.\n- The baseline is weak and the results are worse than the baseline. Surprisingly, addition of the compositional methodology makes the overall panoptic segmentation worse.\n\nFor these reasons, I rate this work as 3 (reject).",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "Panoptic segmentation (ideally) requires some knowledge of occlusion between instances since unlike instance segmentation, a pixel can only belong to a single object or stuff class. The authors consider UPSNet, a strong panoptic baseline, which indirectly resolves occlusions by learning the merging of instances/stuff. The authors believe that it might be useful to augment the so-called \"box head\" of R-CNN which takes a fixed grid of features sampled at a proposal box and computes classifications/regressions using an MLP on flattened features. They insert attentional layers before this flattening process which are then combined with features computed as a mixture of components learned offline. Despite all of this, their system performs worse than the underlying baseline architecture they build upon.",
            "main_review": "This paper is quite difficult to follow and the results lack justification.\n\n1. It doesn't seem like this introduces a new mechanism to explicitly compute occlusion (or ordering), but rather to improve features for the UPSNet panoptic head? Elaboration on the \"arrow\" before \"class scores\" in Figure 3 would be helpful (is this just the standard MLP of the box head?)\n2. The need to compute clusters is an offline procedure that relies on pre-trained components is undesirable\n3. The results are simply not good. Why does this produce results _worse_ than UPSNet when it appears to only _add_ to the architecture?\n4. Why would something like self-attention on the RoI not allow for \"spatial\" awareness\" within the detection branch? This seems like a reasonable baseline that should be included.\n5.
