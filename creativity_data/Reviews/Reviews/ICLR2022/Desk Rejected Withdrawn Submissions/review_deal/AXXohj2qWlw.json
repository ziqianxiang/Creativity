The authors tried to prove their idea by an empirical analysis of a personality trait prediction problem based on transaction data. The authors mainly used qualitative analysis in their experiments. ",
            "main_review": "1. First of all, the author's identity is leaked in sentences like \"We had previously solved the micro-segmentation problem by extracting temporal features from the state space of a recurrent neural network (RNN).\" and \"we have already shown the potential in predicting default rate and customer liquidity indices (Maree & Omlin, 2021).\" This violated the double-blind review policy of ICLR.\n2. Not enough details of the dataset are provided, e.g. sample data points, data distribution.\n3. Not enough explanation of the model, e.g. what's the input dimension?\n4. Experimental results are not convincing. Only qualitative results are presented. It's hard to draw a convincing conclusion from the figures in this paper.\n5. While the problem the authors tried to attack is meaningful, the technical novelty of the solution is not high enough.",

Then they estimate a hierarchical clustering of the Big5 traits' evolution patterns and aim to provide insights on the most predictive features.",
            "main_review": "Theoretical background\nThe evolution of personality traits with age is well-studied in social psychology and in particular the neuroticism trait is known to be decreasing with age in females. \nSrivastava, S., John, O.P., Gosling, S.D. and Potter, J., 2003. Development of personality in early and middle adulthood: Set like plaster or persistent change?. Journal of personality and social psychology, 84(5), p.1041.\n\nI would recommend the authors to consider the theoretical framing of personality states rather than traits which expresses more adequately the variation of personality in shorter time windows.\nKalimeri, K., Lepri, B. and Pianesi, F., 2013, December. Going beyond traits: Multimodal classification of personality states in the wild. In Proceedings of the 15th ACM on International conference on multimodal interaction (pp. 27-34).\n\nThat said, the limitation of personality traits theoretical framing in including cultural and sociodemographic elements remains. The fidelity resonates more to the \"loyalty\" dimension of the moral foundation theory.\n\nExperiments\nThe methodological steps should be described with more clarity.\n\nThere are no information provided on how the model is build and trained. Given the tendency of RNN models to overfit such information is essential to evaluate the successive steps.\n\nAlso regarding the regression the actual size of the dataset where the regression model is fit is not provided. \n\nthe linear regression model is taking advantage of a very particular monotonous trend of the traits, empirically observed in the time window of interest. How generalizable is such an approach?\n\n\n",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper proposes a new approach of learning the novel customer features based on big-five personality traits, which provides more nuanced information than typical coarse features like demographics.\nThe authors empirically discover better customer representations and further leverage them for the customer segmentation (clustering) problem in financial cases. The paper's main contribution is to bridge the psychology theory and the neural network with explainable results.\n\n",
            "main_review": "Strengths:\n- A new thinking of leveraging transactional data for personalized financial services.\n\nWeaknesses:\n- The experimental methodology needs a detailed explanation. The current version lacks a description of the training procedure and formulations.\n- The paper provides the insufficient context of the problem setup; thus, it is hard to connect it to empirical applications.\n- The paper claims the learned customer representation reflects the personality, the analysis for which is not very convincing. \n- Overall, the presentation is hard to follow, and the usage of some terms is confusing. \n\nOther comments\n- Representation learning needs not only the good model architecture (in this work, RNNs for temporal data make sense) but the training objective that will highly affect the final representation result.\n- The literature review for the part of the model explanation should be revised (which should be pretty close to the LIME, SHAP, or LRP-based methods).\n- It is interesting to see the connection between psychology and computer science; however, more evidence should be provided to support this attempt.\n",

            "main_review": "Strengths:\n- Micro-segmentation of customers is an interesting AI application\n\nWeakness:\n- Lack of technical contribution. Most of the ideas are from [1] and [2], and the only contribution seems to come from adding a linear regression layer on top of the hidden state of RNN, which looks like just a standard output layer.  \n- Critical information of the model and problem setup is missing. It's unclear how the coefficients reported in [1] help train an RNN model. It's unclear what the authors mean by \"temporal features\". The input, output, ground truth, model architecture are all unclear. It's unknown how the authors can train the LSTM models, which serve as the backbone. It's unknown how the authors could train a linear regression model separately. In summary, too much information regarding the problem and model setup is missing. \n- The overall presentation is hard to follow, and the usage of the term is confusing. In the abstract, the meaning of \"extracting temporal features from the state space\" is unclear. What do the authors mean by \"three long short-term memory nodes\"? Based on the context, it seems the authors want to say the size of the hidden state of the LSTM is 3. Likewise, the meaning of \"three hidden nodes\" is unclear either. There are other ambiguous usages of terminologies in the paper, which make the overall presentation difficult to follow. \n\n[1] Sandra Matz, Joe Gladstone, and David Stillwell.
