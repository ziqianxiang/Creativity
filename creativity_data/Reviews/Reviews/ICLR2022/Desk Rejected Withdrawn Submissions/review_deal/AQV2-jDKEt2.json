For this, the authors provide a new feature extractor, an ensemble of semantic and low-level feature extractors, and PR module. The proposed method is evaluated on multiple datasets.",
            "main_review": "#### **Strong point:**\nThis paper is somewhat well-motivated. UGCs are widely spread, and their pristine sources cannot be found in many cases. So, automatically checking their qualities without references is a necessary preliminary step to build estimators or feature extractors. Also, I agree that skewed MOS is problematic since it makes training networks over multiple datasets harder.\n\n#### **Weak points:**\n1. This paper is hard to read due to many grammar issues and the weird reference style. Mathematical notations are also problematic.\n2. The novelty is limited. The neural architecture is just a combination of previously proposed ones. The only new technique is the score calibration, but the improvement is not significant. Also, there are previous works on NR-VQA/IQA using CNNs, which dilutes the empirical novelty of this paper.\n3. More experiments are required. The leading performance of the proposed method is not surprising to me, since it uses a wider and deeper network than baselines. Also, the PR module itself makes the network deeper. It is common knowledge in the deep learning community that making modern CNNs wider and deeper yields better generalization. So, the authors should provide more ablation studies. For example, it is one possible option to check the performances of baselines after modifying their networks with more complex ones.\n4. I cannot understand how PR module and loss solve the problem of skewed MOS. I find the GT score is not modified in the loss functions. Then, isn’t it just re-scale the coarse score to a fine one? ",

            "main_review": "Strengths:\n\nNo glaring strengths\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n1. Seems like a very rush submission to the reviewer with grammar issues, not-well-defined math notations, etc.\n\n2. The primary motivation of the proposed progressive regression loss is that some VQA dataset has right-skewed MOS distribution. The reviewer does not understand that why skewed MOS distribution should be an issue in learning IQA models and how the proposed progressive regression loss solves the problem.\n\n3. The authors may need to provide strong justifications to combine deep and hand-crafted features. Otherwise, the method seems to be ad hoc.\n\n4. The loss function is, in essence, a form of ordinal regression. The authors are encouraged to contrast Eqs. (2)-(4) with widely used losses in ordinal regression.\n\n5. The experimental setup is unclear. For example, how are the authors able to set the hyperparameters without the use of a validation set?\n\n6. What are the cross-dataset performance?\n\n7. What is the sensitivity of the loss function w.r.t. $N$?\n\n",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes a blind video quality assessment method for user-generated content. To address two problems of imbalanced subjective MOS of the existing UGC dataset and unpredictable distortions, it introduces a progressive regression network, named PRNet, which utilizes the coarse-to-fine strategy and extracts wide and deep features for predicting the MOS. Experimental results of three UGC datasets show its superiority over the SOTA methods.\n\n",
            "main_review": "Motivation: This paper focuses on two problems, namely imbalanced subjective MOS and unpredictable distortions and it tries to solve the above problem and improve the assessment performance. The motivation is clear and OK to me.\n\nMethod: The technique of combining low-level and deep features for UGA-VQA is not novel, and several methods reviewed in the related work have introduced this idea and methods, such as RAPIQUE. The low-level and deep features are used the same as the other work.\n\nExperiment: Although the proposed method achieves the best performance in Table 1, it cannot convince me that why this method can beat other methods. How about the performance comparison with RAPIQUE? In addition, there is only one ablation study experiment, which is short to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed modules, such as what kinds of deep features are more effective in VQA problem, after all the deep feature from Resnet is too common?\n\nOthers:1)  I am confused by the phrase \"progressive regression\", what is its meaning? 2) The reference style in the text is strange.\n\n",
