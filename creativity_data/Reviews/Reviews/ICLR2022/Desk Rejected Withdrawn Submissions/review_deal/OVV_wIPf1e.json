            "main_review": "The differences between causaltgan and causalgan are not very clear from the introduction. The narrative should be detailed to convince the reader that the paper is addressing something that this existing work didn't.  As far as I am aware of, \"binary variables\" is not a restriction of CausalGAN since one can implement any discrete/continuous variable with their \"causal controller\" network. The tabular data could always be mapped to discrete variables, and it turns out this is what the authors do here as well, which will be clear later on. \n\nFigure 1 uses the same idea as CausalGAN. The main difference is that the authors demonstrate one way to handle partial information: Simply generate data from the structure that you know, then generate the remaining variables using a conditional GAN. This idea makes sense and is new. \n\nThe first paragraph of Related Work reads like completely unrelated sentences for each paper. How do these compare to the current work? Most of these works are probably not related. I recommend rewriting this section to create a more consistent storyline for the paper. \n\n\"The objective of Causal-TGAN is to estimate the empirical data distribution PT (V) of T by incorporating expert knowledge encoded in G.\"\nIt is not clear why the causal knowledge is useful/required here. Could you please explain?\n\nIn terms of modeling different types of data: continuous variables are assumed to be distributed as jointly Gaussian.\n\n\"4.1.2 GENERATOR CONSTRUCTION\"\nThis method is a replica of the one proposed in CausalGAN, whereas there is no mention of this relation in the paper. \n\nThe above comment is also true for section 4.1.3 Data Sampling. Please add the appropriate citation to credit the existing work to avoid the claim this is the novelty of the current paper.\n\nAfter reading the whole paper, I haven't actually found the part that makes the approach tailored to tabular data, which would be the novelty in relation to CausalGAN. Unless I am missing something, the only information there is in the paper is \"use discrete values for categorical\" and \"use Gaussian mixture for continuous\". But, unfortunately, this is not enough novelty to warrant a publication in ICLR.\n\nI also do not understand the value of adding (partial or full) causal structure if the objective is only data generation. What is the advantage of using causal structure over a usual GAN? I haven't seen this or any relevant discussion in the experiments. \n\nMinor comment:\npg. 3: \"orientates\" ",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes Causal-TGAN, which generates tabular data from noise, based on prior knowledge of the causal relationship between table variables (i.e. columns). By constructing the structural causal model (SCM) based on prior knowledge, the authors employ one generator each column where the topology of the generators follow the causal structure. On both simulated datasets and real-world datasets, Causal-TGAN demonstrates competitive performance compared to previous baselines that do not use causal knowledge.",
            "main_review": "Strenghts:\n- The proposed model is simple, and easy to follow. Constructing a group of sub-generators that follow the causal knowledge makes sense.\n- The authors demonstrate empirical superiority of Causal-TGAN in both simulated and real-world datasets.\n\nWeaknesses:\n- Limited technical novelty. Crudely put, all Causal-TGAN does is manually construct the generator topology based on the a priori causal knowledge, and demonstrate that it is effective, which does not come as a surprise. If Causal-TGAN was able to automatically construct the generator topology by estimating the causal relationship among variables, that would have been impressive, but that is not the case in this work.\n- Furthermore, according to the experiments with the real-world data (Table 2), the proposed method without prior causal knowledge is on par with baselines at best. But in most cases, we do not possess such causal knowledge of the given data. Granted, with partial causal knowledge, Causal-TGAN outperforms baseline models, but the authors rely on Greedy Equivalence Search to estimate the causal relationship, which is the main factor for the increased performance, and hence not the contribution of this paper.\n- Presentation can be improved regarding the real-world dataset. Based on the paper, it is impossible to figure out what kind of task each dataset is used for. It seems that Adult, Census, and Intrusion is related to classification, and News to regression. But the paper does not explain what kind of task each dataset is specifically doing, or how GAN-generated samples are used.",
            "summary_of_the_review": "The authors propose a reasonable approach to generating tabular data using GAN, where the generator is manually constructed to mimic the causal relationship among the variables. However, the technical novelty is limited in that the authors rely on a priori knowledge of the causal relationships among variables, and without the knowledge, the proposed method shows more or less the same performance as the previous studies on real-world datasets.",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper focuses on using GANs to generate tabular data. Specifically, this paper proposes to leverage the causality mechanism to design the generator structure. In this paper, the causality is brought by expert knowledge. Further, it is worth noting that while the mainstream in the deep learning community to incorporate the causal theory into modeling is to learn the causal relationship implicitly in a black-box manner, this work tries to explicitly use it on designing model’s inductive bias, which is much simpler but might be fruitful.

            "main_review": "There are some weaknesses of the paper and the reviewer’s questions.\n1.\tGenerating synthetic tabular data is non-trivial due to several factors. Following are two examples. a) It is common that multiple entries in a table are associated with the same entity, resulting in additional relationships in the table. 2) There can be missing values in the table. For instance, a feature of an entity includes two fields, one of which is whether the entity has the feature, and the other is the value of this feature if the entity has it. However, this paper’s discussion assumes the data with extreme simplicity and does not consider difficult and common problems in generating tabular data.\n2.\tThis paper proposes to use known causal relationships between features. However, in practice, prior knowledge is not always available and might be inaccurate to a specific subpopulation. This is the particular reason that most researchers focus on mining causal relationship from the data automatically. The reviewer is concerned about the practicality of this work.\n3.\tThis work reminds the reviewer of the multi-label classification task, which is similar to the tabular data generation task. Both tasks aim to approximate the joint distribution of a set of features. The multi-label classification can be resolved by decomposing the feature set with the chain rule, which relies on a proper order to apply the chain rule [1]. The review’s question is, is the order decided by causality is the most appropriate order for training? For example, given an SCM: A->B and A has a long-tail distribution while B has a uniform distribution, is modeling P(B|A) better than modeling P(A|B)? \n4.\tConsidering an SCM A1->A2->…->An (where n can be large), would there be an exposure bias problem in generating the corresponding sample with the proposed method?\n5.\tWhy does only the generator, but not the discriminator, use the causal structure?\nThe reviewer thinks there should at least be some discussions about questions 2,3,4.\n\n\n[1] Vinyals O, Bengio S, Kudlur M.

            "summary_of_the_review": "The reviewer thinks if this paper aims to focus on tabular data generation, it would be better for it to provide some intuition to resolve the problems specific for the tabular data, such as the ones shown in (1); on the other hand, if this paper aims to advocate causal-design of the generator, there should be more comprehensive experiments except for the ones on tabular data. In summary, the reviewer finds this paper a) lack enough novelty in that only the idea of using known SCM but no heuristic to uncover SCM is proposed; b) lack sufficient discussions and theoretical evidence to support its claim that the proposed causal generator is superior to other designs. Therefore, the reviewer is not persuaded that this paper meets the criteria of ICLR.",

The idea of using causal DAG to generate data is useful, especially for out-of-distribution data generation.\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n1.
