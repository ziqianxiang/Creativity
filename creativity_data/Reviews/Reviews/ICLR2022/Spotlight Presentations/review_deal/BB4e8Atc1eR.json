        "comment": "This is an exciting paper that provide the efficient algorithms for exact sampling from NDPPs along with theoretical results that are very pertinent in and out themselves. The AC agree with the reviewers that the authors satisfactorily addressed the concerns raised in the reviews, and is convinced that the revised version will be greatly appreciated by the community. We very much encourage the authors to pursue this line of work and in particular to overcome the practical restriction to the ONDPP subclass."

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper studies the problem of sampling from non-symmetrical Determinantal Point Processes (NDPPs); in particular, this paper focuses on exact sampling for low-rank NDPPs.\n\nThe main contributions of this paper are:\n1. This paper proposes to adapt the Cholesky-decomposition-based sampler for DPPs to a linear-time sampler for low-rank NDPPs (rank of NDPP << size of the ground set)\n2. This paper proposes to use rejection sampling to implement a \"sub-linear-time\" (assuming that the # of rejections are bounded by a small constant) sampler for a subclass of NDPPs called orthogonal NDPPs (ONDPPs), by leveraging an existing sub-linear-time sampler for DPPs.\n3. This paper shows that empirically, in terms of modeling real-world datasets, ONDPPs are as effective as the general NDPPs and more importantly, we can efficiently learn ONDPPs in a way such that when it comes to rejection sampling, the # of rejections is bounded by a small number.",
            "main_review": "This paper is overall well-written, easy to understand and both the theoretical and empirical results presented in this paper are very exciting.\n\nCompared to the linear-time Cholesky-decomposition-based sampler, the rejection-sampling-based method is definitely the main focus of the paper. Though the rejection-sampling method is not strictly sub-linear-time in general, the theoretical result presented in this paper (Theorem 2) directly implies that in practice, we can easily allow efficient sampling by bounding the expected # of rejections in learning NDPPs (ONDPPs); more importantly, the authors conducted comprehensive experiments to show that in learning NDPPs, by imposing the constraints (orthogonality & extra regularization term) we need for efficient sampling, we are not losing the expressive power of NDPPs. Experiments also show that compared to the linear-time sampling algorithm, the rejection-sampling method scales much better on both synthetic and real-world datasets.\n\nNDPPs are a strictly more expressive class compared to DPPs but the absence of efficient sampling algorithms puts a major barrier from replacing DPPs by NDPPs in large-scale applications. By proposing an efficient \"sub-linear-time\" sampling algorithm for NDPPs, this paper makes substantial progress in scaling up NDPPs and opens up new avenues for applying NDPPs to various real-world scenarios. \n\nCons:\n1. Compared to the rejection-sampling method, the linear-time algorithm is not as interesting and novel and somewhat deviating from the main story. Authors might want to consider presenting the linear-time algorithm without getting into the technical details. Of course, the experiments that compares the rejection-sampling method against the linear-time algorithm is still important.\n\n2. Section 4.2 is a little bit difficult to follow for those who are not familiar with the tree-based sampling algorithm for DPPs. Authors might want to expand this section a little bit.\n",

They also provide empirical results comparing their learned kernels with previous works and compare times for their various sampling algorithms.",
            "main_review": "The paper is well written, clear, and interesting to read. They are the first to give efficient algorithms for exact sampling from NDPPs (the previous sampling algorithm takes time cubic in ground set size, which is impractical for real-world data). Their work can lead to more applications of NDPPs in practical settings. It is also timely and adds to the growing literature on NDPPs.\n\nSome comments:\nFor equations 2 and 3 (and similar probabilities elsewhere in the paper which only involve singleton sets), it might help the reader if you use Pr$(i \\in Y\\ |\\ j \\in Y)$ rather than Pr$({i} \\subseteq Y\\ |\\ \\{j\\} \\subseteq Y)$. Also, for these specific equations, you mention that Poulson (2019) shows them via the Cholesky decomposition but that seems overkill. For these specific equations (2 and 3), you can just derive equation 2 by computing $\\frac{Pr(i,j \\subseteq Y)}{Pr(j \\subseteq Y)} = \\frac{\\det (K_{i,j})}{\\det(K_{j})}$ and equation 3 also by $\\frac{Pr(i \\in Y, j \\notin Y)}{Pr(j \\in Y)} = \\frac{Pr(i \\in Y) - Pr (i,j \\subseteq Y)}{Pr(j \\in Y)} = \\frac{\\det (K_{i}) - \\det (K_{i,j})}{\\det(K_{j})}$. It seems like Poulson (2019) uses LU decomposition (in Proposition 3 and 5) because their propositions are more general and apply to disjoint subsets (possibly having more than one element). Also, I'm not very familiar with these factorizations but seems like LU decomposition is different from Cholesky decomposition (at least from my understanding reading the wiki for Cholesky decomposition). Experts might be irritated by this (or maybe it's fine in which case, please let me know).",

The marginal kernel of such a DPP may be written in the form $K=ZWZ^\\top$ with $Z$ a $M$ by $2K$ matrix and $W$ a square matrix of size $2K$ that is not symmetric. The authors then:\n- discuss in Section 2 how Poulson's algorithm is adapted to sample from such NDPPS\n- in Section 3: show that, as L is low-rank, the generic $O(M^3)$ cost of Poulson's algorithm can be reduced to $O(MK^2$ as updates of the marginal kernel can be efficiently done by only updating the inner $W$ matrix\n- in Section 4: give a sublinear-time rejection-sampling based algorithm adapting the tree-based algorithm of Gillenwater et al. In this section, they:\n\t* propose a well-adapted, DPP based on a symmetric kernel $\\hat{L}$ that is easy-to-sample (it is a DPP based on a symmetric PSD kernel and can be sampled from many different fast existing algorithms), and for which any set $Y$ verifies $det(L_Y)\\leq det(\\hat{L}_Y)$ where the upper-bound is actually attained (Thm 1). In order to exactly control the rejection rate of their proposed algorithm (that is equal to $det(\\hat{L}+I) / det(L+I)$, the authors simplify the model by supposing that $V$ and $B$ are orthogonal to each other (Thm 2)\n\t* in passing, the authors observe that the complexity of Gillenwater et al's algorithm can in fact be easily improved by a factor $k$ where $k$ is the size of the sampled set \n- in Sections 5 and 6, experiments are provided comparing their samping method with the state-of-the-art",
            "main_review": "The paper is well-written. Even though it is a somewhat straightforward mix of ideas from Gartrell et al. (motivating such NDPPS), Gillenwater et al. (sublinear sampling algorithm of symmetric DPPs), and Poulson (Cholesky-based sampling of DPPs and NDPPs); I believe that the results are interesting enough for acceptance. The main contribution of the paper is, to my eyes, to have found a symmetric DPP that is well-suited for rejection sampling. The proof that $\\forall Y, det(L_Y)\\leq det(\\hat{L}_Y)$, essential for the rejection sampling framework to work, is an interesting contribution (and could be used in other works on DPPs as well). In passing, I find the proof hard to follow and suggest to the authors to do their best to find ways of simplifying it as much as possible for the camera-ready version. The simpler the proof, the more easily it could be transferred to other scenarios, increasing the potential impact of the paper.\n\nAs for Theorem 2, the orthogonality constraint is frustrating and I would imagine that further efforts could lift this constraint and obtain a bound that depends on how orthogonal both subspaces are (and recovering the current bound when they are indeed orthogonal). On the other hand, ONDPPs can indeed be motivated for learning as they indeed ensure that the full \"available rank\" is put to contribution. The empirical results tend to validate this intuitive argument.",
