            "review": "In this paper, the authors show how a Deep Learning model for sea surface temperature prediction can be designed to incorporate the classical advection diffusion model. The architecture includes a differentiable warping scheme which allows back propagation of the error and is inspired by the fundamental solution of the PDE model. They evaluate the suggested model on synthetic data and outperform the current state of the art in terms of accuracy.\n\npros\n- the paper is written in a clear and concise manner\n- it suggests an interesting connection between a traditional model and Deep Learning techniques\n- in the experiments they trained the network on 64 x 64 patches and achieved convincing results\n\ncons\n- please provide the value of the diffusion coefficient for the sake of reproducibility\n- medium resolution of the resulting prediction\n\n\nI enjoyed reading this paper and would like it to be accepted.\n\nminor comments:\n- on page five in the last paragraph there is a left parenthesis missing in the inline formula nabla dot w_t(x))^2.\n- on page nine in the last paragraph there is the word 'flow' missing: '.. estimating the optical [!] between 2 [!] images.'\n- in the introduction (page two) the authors refer to SST prediction as a 'relatively complex physical modeling problem', whereas in the conclusion (page ten) it is referred to as 'a problem of intermediate complexity'. This seems to be inconsistent.",

            "review": "The authors use deep learning to learn a surrogate model for the motion vector in the advection-diffusion equation that they use to forecast sea surface temperature. In particular, they use a CNN encoder-decoder to learn a motion field, and a warping function from the last component to provide forecasting. \n\nI like the idea of using deep learning for physical equations. I would like to see a description of the algorithm with the pseudo-code in order to understand the flow of the method. I got confused at several points because it was not clear what was exactly being estimated with the CNN. Having an algorithmic environment would make the description easier. I know that authors are going to publish the code, but this is not enough at this point of the revision. \n\nPhysical processes in Machine learning have been studied from the perspective of Gaussian processes. Just to mention a couple of references “Linear latent force models using Gaussian processes” and \"Numerical Gaussian Processes for Time-dependent and Non-linear Partial Differential Equations\"\n\nIn Theorem 2, do you need to care about boundary conditions for your equation? I didn’t see any mention to those in the definition for I(x,t). You only mention initial conditions. How do you estimate the diffusion parameter D? Are you assuming isotropic diffusion? Is that realistic? Can you provide more details about how you run the data assimilation model in the experiments? Did you use your own code?\n",

            "review": "The paper ‘Deep learning for Physical Process: incorporating prior physical knowledge’ proposes\nto question the use of data-intensive strategies such as deep learning in solving physical \ninverse problems that are traditionally solved through assimilation strategies. They notably show\nhow physical priors on a given phenomenon can be incorporated in the learning process and propose \nan application on the problem of estimating sea surface temperature directly from a given \ncollection of satellite images.\n\nAll in all the paper is very clear and interesting. The results obtained on the considered problem\nare clearly of great interest, especially when compared to state-of-the-art assimilation strategies\nsuch as the one of Béréziat. While the learning architecture is not original in itself, it is \nshown that a proper physical regularization greatly improves the performance. For these reasons I \nbelieve the paper has sufficient merits to be published at ICLR. That being said, I believe that \nsome discussions could strengthen the paper:\n - Most classical variational assimilation schemes are stochastic in nature, notably by incorporating\nuncertainties in the observation or physical evolution models. It is still unclear how those uncertainties \ncan be integrated in the model;\n - Assimilation methods are usually independent of the type of data at hand. It is not clear how the model\nlearnt on one particular type of data transpose to other data sequences. Notably, the question of transfer\nand generalization is of high relevance here. Does the learnt model performs well on other dataset (for instance,\nacquired on a different region or at a distant time). I believe this type of issue has to be examinated \nfor this type of approach to be widely use in inverse physical problems. \n",
