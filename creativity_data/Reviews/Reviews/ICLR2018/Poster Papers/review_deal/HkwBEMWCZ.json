            "review": "Paper examines the use of skip connections (including residual layers) in deep networks as a way of alleviating two perceived difficulties in training: 1) when a neuron does not contain any information, and 2) when two neurons in a layer compute the same function. Both of these cases lead to singularities in the Hessian matrix, and this work includes a number of experiments showing the effect of skip connections on the Hessian during training. \n\nThis is a significant and timely topic. While I may not be the best one to judge the originality of this work, I appreciated how the authors presented clear and concise arguments with experiments to back up their claims.\n\n",

            "review": "The authors show that two types of singularities impede learning in deep neural networks: elimination singularities (where a unit is effectively shut off by a loss of input or output weights, or by an overly-strong negative bias), and overlap singularities, where two or more units have very similar input or output weights. They then demonstrate that skip connections can reduce the prevalence of these singularities, and thus speed up learning.\n\nThe analysis is thorough: the authors explore alternative methods of reducing the singularities, and explore the skip connection properties that more strongly reduce the singularities, and make observations consistent with their overarching claims.\n\nI have no major criticisms.\n\nOne suggestion for future work would be to provide a procedure for users to tailor their skip connection matrices to maximize learning speed and efficacy. The authors could then use this procedure to make highly trainable networks, and show that on test (not training) data, the resultant network leads to high performance.",

            "review": "This paper proposes to explain the benefits of skip connections in terms of eliminating the singularities of the loss function. The discussion is largely based on a sequence of experiments, some of which are interesting and insightful. The discussion here can be useful for other researchers. \n\nMy main concern is that the result here is purely empirical, with no concrete theoretical justification. What the experiments reveal is an empirical correlation between the Eigval index and training accuracy, which can be caused by lots of reasons (and cofounders), and does not necessarily establish a causal relation. Therefore, i found many of the discussion to be questionable. I would love to see more solid theoretical discussion to justify the hypothesis proposed in this paper.\n \nDo you have a sense how accurate is the estimation of the tail probabilities of the eigenvalues? Because the whole paper is based on the approximation of the eigval indexes, it is critical to exam the estimation is accurate enough to draw the conclusions in the paper. \n\nAll the conclusions are based on one or two datasets. Could you consider testing the result on more different datasets to verify if the results are generalizable? ",
