R2 and R3 feel this might be a potential problem. R2 advocates weak accept and given that R1 is keen on the paper, the AC feels it can be accepted.\n\n",

Instead of ReLU networks with average/max pooling (as is standard in practice), the authors consider linear activations with product pooling.  Such networks, which have been known as convolutional arithmetic circuits, are easier to analyze (due to their connection to tensor decomposition), and provide insight into standard DNNs.\n\nFor these networks, the authors show that overlap results in the overall function having a significantly higher rank (exponentially larger) than a function obtained from a network with non-overlapping convolutions (where the stride >= filter width).  The key part of the proof is showing a lower bound on the rank for networks with overlap.  They do so by an argument well-known in this space: showing a lower bound for some particular tensor, and then inferring the bound for a \"generic\" tensor.\n\nThe results are interesting overall, but the paper has many caveats:\n1.  the results are only for ConvACs, which are arguably quite different from ReLU networks (the non-linearity in successive non-pooling layers could be important).\n2.  it's not clear if the importance of overlap is too surprising (or is a pressing question to understand, as in the case of depth).\n3.  the rank of the tensor being high does not preclude approximation (to a very good accuracy) by tensors of much smaller rank.\n\nThat said, the results could be of interest to those thinking about minimizing the number of connections in ConvNets, as it gives some intuition about how much overlap might 'suffice'.  \n\nI recommend weak accept.",

            "review": "The paper analyzes the expressivity of convolutional arithmetic circuits (ConvACs), where neighboring neurons in a single layer have overlapping receptive fields. To compare the expressivity of overlapping networks with non-overlapping networks, the paper employs grid tensors computed from the output of the ConvACs.  The grid tensors are matricized and the ranks of the resultant matrices are compared. The paper obtains a lower bound on the rank of the resultant grid tensors, and uses them to show that an exponentially large number of non-overlapping ConvACs are required to approximate the grid tensor of an overlapping ConvACs. Assuming that the result carries over to ConvNets, I find this result to be very interesting.  While overlapped convolutional layers are almost universally used, there has been very little theoretical justification for the same. This paper shows that overlapped ConvACs are exponentially more powerful than their non-overlapping counterparts. ",

            "review": "The paper studies convolutional neural networks where the stride is smaller than the convolutional filter size; the so called overlapping convolutional architectures. The main object of study is to quantify the benefits of overlap in convolutional architectures.\n\nThe main claim of the paper is Theorem 1, which is that overlapping convolutional architectures are efficient with respect to non-overlapping architectures, i.e., there exists functions in the overlapping architecture which require an exponential increase in size to be represented in the non-overlapping architecture; whereas overlapping architecture can capture within a linear size the functions represented by the non-overlapping architectures. The main workhorse behind the paper is the notion of rank of matricized grid tensors following a paper of Cohen and Shashua which capture the relationship between the inputs and the outputs, the function implemented by the neural network. \n\n(1) The results of the paper hold only for product pooling and linear activation function except for the representation layer, which allows general functions. It is unclear why the generalized convolutional networks are stated with such generality when the results apply only to this special case. That this is the case should be made clear in the title and abstract. The paper makes a point that generalized tensor decompositions can be potentially applied to solve the more general case, but since it is left as future work, the paper should make it clear throughout.\n\n(2) The experiment is minimal and even the given experiment is not described well. What data augmentation was used for the CIFAR-10 dataset? It is only mentioned that the data is augmented with translations and horizontal flips. What is the factor of augmentation? How much translation? These are important because there maybe a much simpler explanation to the benefit of overlap: it is able to detect these translated patterns easily. Indeed, this simple intuition seems to be why the authors chose to make the problem by introducing translations and flips. \n\n(3) It is unclear if the paper resolves the mystery that they set out to solve, which is a reconciliation of the following two observations (a) why are non-overlapping architectures so common? (b) why only slight overlap is used in practice?  The paper seems to claim that since overlapping architectures have higher expressivity that answers (a). It appears that the paper does not answer (b) well: it points out that since there is exponential increase, there is no reason to increase it beyond a particular point. It seems the right resolution will be to show that after the overlap is set to a certain small value, there will be *only* linear increase with increasing overlap; i.e., the paper should show that small overlap networks are efficient with respect to *large* overlap networks; a comparison that does not seem to be made in the paper. \n\n(4) Small typo: the dimensions seem to be wrong in the line below the equation in page 3. \n\nThe paper makes important progress on a highly relevant problem using a new methodology (borrowed from a previous paper). However, the writing is hurried and the high-level conclusions are not fully supported by theory and experiments. ",
