        "title": "ICLR 2018 Conference Acceptance Decision",
        "comment": "The committee feels that this paper presents a simple, yet effective way to adapt language models from various users in a sufficiently privacy preserving way.  Empirical results are quite strong.  Reviewer 3 says that the novelty of the paper is not great, but does not provide any references to prior work that are similar to this paper.  The meta-reviewer finds the responses to Reviewer 3 sufficient to address the concerns.\n\nSimilarly, Reviewer 2 says that the paper may not be relevant to ICLR, but the committee feels its content does belong to the conference since the topic is extremely relevant to modern language processing techniques.  In fact, the authors provide several references that show that this paper is similar in content to those submissions.\n\nReviewer 1's concerns are also not sufficiently strong to warrant rejection.  The responses to each criticism suffices and the meta-reviewer thinks that this paper will add value to the conference.",

            "review": "This paper deals with improving language models on mobile equipments\nbased on small portion of text that the user has ever input. For this\npurpose, authors employed a linearly interpolated objectives between user\nspecific text and general English, and investigated which method (learning\nwithout forgetting and random reheasal) and which interepolation works better.\nMoreover, authors also look into privacy analysis to guarantee some level of\ndifferential privacy is preserved.\n\nBasically the motivation and method is good, the drawback of this paper is\nits narrow scope and lack of necessary explanations. Reading the paper,\nmany questions arise in mind:\n\n- The paper implicitly assumes that the statistics from all the users must\n  be collected to improve \"general English\". Why is this necessary? Why not\n  just using better enough basic English and the text of the target user?\n\n- To achieve the goal above, huge data (not the \"portion of the general English\") should be communicated over the network. Is this really worth doing? If only\n  \"the portion of\" general English must be communicated, why is it validated?\n\n- For measuring performance, authors employ keystroke saving rate. For the\n  purpose of mobile input, this is ok: but the use of language models will\n  cover much different situation where keystrokes are not necessarily \n  available, such as speech recognition or machine translation. Since this \n  paper is concerned with a general methodology of language modeling, \n  perplexity improvement (or other criteria generally applicable) is also\n  important.\n\n- There are huge number of previous work on context dependent language models,\n  let alone a mixture of general English and specific models. Are there any\n  comparison with these previous efforts?\n\nFinally, this research only relates to ICLR in that the language model employed\nis LSTM: in other aspects, it easily and better fit to ordinary NLP conferences, such as EMNLP, NAACL or so. I would like to advise the authors to submit\nthis work to such conferences where it will be reviewed by more NLP experts.\n\nMinor:\n- t of $G_t$ in page 2 is not defined so far.\n- What is \"gr\" in Section 2.2?\n",

            "review": "This paper discusses the application of word prediction for software keyboards. The goal is to customize the predictions for each user to account for member specific information while adhering to the strict compute constraints and privacy requirements. \n\nThe authors propose a simple method of mixing the global model with user specific data. Collecting the user specific models and averaging them to form the next global model. \n\nThe proposal is practical. However, I am not convinced that this is novel enough for publication at ICLR. \n\nOne major question. The authors assume that the global model will depict general english. However, it is not necessary that the population of users will adhere to general English and hence the averaged model at the next time step t+1 might be significantly different from general English. It is not clear to me as how this mechanism guarantees that it will not over-fit or that there will be no catastrophic forgetting.",
