        "comment": "The submission formulates self paced learning as a specific iterative mini-max optimization, which incorporates both a risk minimization step and a submodular maximization for selecting the next training examples.\n\nThe strengths of the paper lie primarily in the theoretical analysis, while the experiments are somewhat limited to simple datasets: News20, MNIST, & CIFAR10.  Additionally, the main paper is probably too long in its current form, and could benefit from some of the proof details being moved to the appendix.\n\n",

            "review": "Overview:\nThis paper proposes an approach to curriculum learning, where subsets of examples to train on are chosen during the training process. The proposed method is based on a submodular set function over the examples, which is intended to capture diversity of the included examples and is added to the training objective (eq. 2). The set is optimized to be as hard as possible (maximize loss), which results in a min-max problem. This is in turn optimized (approximately) by alternating between gradient-based loss minimization and submodular maximization. The theoretical analysis shows that if the loss is strongly convex, then the algorithm returns a solution which is close to the optimal solution. Empirical results are presented for several benchmarks.\nThe paper is mostly clear and the idea seems nice. On the downside, there are some limitations to the theoretical analysis and optimization scheme (see comments below).\n\nComments:\n- The theoretical result (thm. 1) studies the case of full optimization, which is different than the proposed algorithm (running a fixed number of weight updates). It would be interesting to show results on sensitivity to the number of updates (p).\n- The algorithm requires tuning of quite a few hyperparameters (sec. 3).\n- Approximating a cluster with a single sample (sec. 2.3) seems rather crude. There should be some theoretical and/or empirical study of its effect on quality of the solution.\n\nMinor/typos:\n- what is G(j|G\\j) in eq. (9)?\n- why cite Anonymous (2018) instead of Appendix...?\n- define V in Thm. 1.\n- in eq. (4) it may be clearer to denote g_k(w). Likewise in eq. (6) \\hat{g}_\\hat{A}(w), and in eq. (14) \\tilde{g}_{\\cal{A}}(w).\n- figures readability can be improved.",

            "review": "This paper introduces MiniMax Curriculum learning, as an approach for adaptively train models by providing it different subsets of data. The authors formulate the learning problem as a minimax problem which tries to choose diverse example and \"hard\" examples, where the diversity is captured via a Submodular Loss function and the hardness is captured via the Loss function. The authors formulate the problem as an iterative technique which involves solving a minimax objective at every iteration. The authors argue the convergence results on the minimax objective subproblem, but do not seem to give results on the general problem. The ideas for this paper are built on existing work in Curriculum learning, which attempts to provide the learner easy examples followed by harder examples later on. The belief is that this learning style mimics human learners.\n\nPros:\n- The analysis of the minimax objective is novel and the proof technique introduces several interesting ideas.\n- This is a very interesting application of joint convex and submodular optimization, and uses properties of both to show the final convergence results\n- Even through the submodular objective is only approximately solvable, it still translates into a convergence result\n- The experimental results seem to be complete for the most part. They argue how the submodular optimization does not really affect the performance and diversity seems to empirically bring improvement on the datasets tried.\n\nCons:\n- The main algorithm MCL is only a hueristic. Though the MiniMax subproblem can converge, the authors use this in somewhat of a hueristic manner.\n- It seems somewhat hand wavy in the way the authors describe the hyper parameters of MCL, and it seems unclear when the algorithm converge and how to increase/decrease it over iterations\n- The objective function also seems somewhat non-intuitive. Though the experimental results seem to indicate that the idea works, I think the paper does not motivate the loss function and the algorithm well.\n- It seems to me the authors have experimented with smaller datasets (CIFAR, MNIST, 20NewsGroups). This being mainly an empirical paper, I would have expected results on a few larger datasets (e.g. ImageNet, CelebFaces etc.), particularly to see if the idea also scales to these more real world larger datasets.\n\nOverall, I would like to see if the paper could have been stronger empirically. Nevertheless, I do think there are some interesting ideas theoretically and algorithmically. For this reason, I vote for a borderline accept. ",

            "review": "The main strength of this paper, I think, is the theoretical result in Theorem 1. This result is quite nice. I wish the authors actually concluded with the following minor improvement to the proof that actually strengthens the result further.\n\nThe authors ended the discussion on thm 1 on page 7 (just above Sec 2.3) by saying what is sufficiently close to w*. If one goes back to (10), it is easy to see that what converges to w* when one of three things happen (assuming beta is fixed once loss L is selected).\n\n1) k goes to infinity\n2) alpha goes to 1\n3) g(w*) goes to 0\n\nThe authors discussed how alpha is close to 1 by virtue of submodular optimization lower bounds there for what is close to w*. In fact this proof shows the situation is much better than that. \n\nIf we are really concerned about making what converge to w*, and if we are willing to tolerate the increasing computational complexity associated solving submodular problems with larger k, we can schedule k to increase over time which guarantees that both alpha goes to 1 and g(w*) goes to zero. \n\nThere is also a remark that G(A) tends to be modular when lambda is small which is useful.\nFrom the algorithm, it seems clear that the authors recognized these two useful aspects of the objective and scheduled lambda to decrease exponentially and k to increase linearly.\n\nIt would be really nice to complete the analysis of Thm1 with a formal analysis of convergence speed for ||what-w*|| as lambda and k are scheduled in this fashion. Such an analysis would help practitioners make better choices for the hyper parameters gamma and Delta.",
