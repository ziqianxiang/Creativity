        "comment": "The authors propose a hierarchical VAE model with a discrete latent variable in the top-most layer for unsupervised learning of discriminative representations.  While the reported results on the two flow cytometry datasets are encouraging, they are insufficient to draw strong conclusions about the general effectiveness of the proposed architecture. Also, as two of the reviewers stated the proposed model is very similar to several VAE models in the literature. This paper seems better suited for a more applied venue than ICLR."

The authors empirically demonstrate that the latent space of their model separates well healthy vs pathological cells in a dataset for Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) diagnostics. \n\n\nMain\n\nOverall the paper is reasonably well written. There are a few clarity issues detailed below.\nThe results seem very promising as the model clearly separates the two types of cells. But more baseline experiments are needed to assess the robustness of the results. \n\nNovelty\n\nThe model introduced is a variant of a deep latent Gaussian model, where the top-most layer is a discrete random variable. Furthermore, the authors employ the Gumbel-trick to avoid having to explicitly marginalize the discrete latent variables.\n\nGiven the extensive literature on combining discrete and continuous latent variables in VAEs, the novelty factor of the proposed model is quite weak. \n\nThe authors use the Gumbel-trick in order to avoid explicit marginalization over the discrete variables. However, the number of categories in their problem is small (n=2), so the computational overhead of an explicit marginalization would be negligible. The result would be equivalent to replacing the top of the model p(y) p(z_L|y) by a GMM p_{GMM}(z_L) with two Gaussian components only.\nGive these observations, it seems that this is an unnecessary complication added to the model as an effort to increase novelty. \nIt would be very informative to compare both approaches.\n\nI would perhaps recommend this paper for an applied workshop, but not for publication in a main conference.\n\nDetails:\n\n1) Variable h was not defined before it appeared in Eq. (5). From the text/equations we can deduce h = (y, z_1, â€¦, z_L), but this should be more clearly stated.\n2) It is counter-intuitive to define the inference model before having defined the generative model structure, perhaps the authors should consider changing the presentation order.\n3) Was the VAE in VAE+SVM also trained with lambda-annealing?\n4) How does a simple MLP classifier compares to the models on Table 1 and 2?\n5) It seems that, what is called beta-VAE here is the same model HCDVAE but trained with a lambda that anneals to a value different than one (the value of beta). In this case what is the value it terminates? How was that value chosen?\n6) The authors used 3 stochastic layers, how was that decided? Is there a substantial difference in performance compared to 1 and 2 stochastic layers?\n7) How do the different models behave in terms train vs test set likelihoods. Was there overfitting detected for some settings? How does the choice of the MCC threshold affects train/test likelihoods?  \n8) Have the authors compared explicit marginalizing y with using the Gumbel-trick?\n\nOther related work:\n\nA few other papers that have explored discrete latent variables as a way to build more structured VAEs are worth mentioning/referring to:\n\n[1] Dilokthanakul N, Mediano PA, Garnelo M, Lee MC, Salimbeni H, Arulkumaran K, Shanahan M.

            "review": "This paper addresses the question of unsupervised clustering with high classification performance. They propose a deep variational autoencoder architecture with categorical latent variables at the deepest layer and propose to train it with modifications of the standard variational approach with reparameterization gradients. The model is tested on a medical imagining dataset where the task is to distinguish healthy from pathological lymphocytes from blood samples. \n\nI am not an expert on this particular dataset, but to my eye the results look impressive. They show high sensitivity and high specificity. This paper may be an important contribution to the medical imaging community.\n\nMy primary concern with the paper is the lack of novelty and relatively little in the way of contributions to the ICLR community. The proposed model is a simple variant on the standard VAE models (see for example the Ladder VAE https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02282 for deep models with multiple stochastic layers). This would be OK if a thorough evaluation on at least two other datasets showed similar improvements as the lymphocytes dataset. As it stands, it is difficulty for me to assess the value of this model.\n\nMinor questions / concerns:\n\n- The authors claim in the first paragraph of 3.2 that deterministic mappings lack expressiveness. Would be great to see the paper take this claim seriously and investigate it.\n- In equation (13) it isn't clear whether you use q_phi to be the discrete mass or the concrete density. The distinction is discussed in https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.00712\n- Would be nice to report the MCC in experimental results.",
