In particular, the authors demonstrate that a deep autoencoder, carefully tuned, can out-perform  more complex RNN-based models that have temporal information.  The authors examine how different non-linear activations, model size, dropout, and a novel technique called \"dense re-feeding\" can together improve DNN-based collaborative filtering.\n\nPros:\n- The accuracy results are impressive and a useful datapoint in how to build a DNN-based recommender.  \n- The dense re-feeding technique seems to be novel with incremental (but meaningful) benefits.  \n\nCons:\n- Experimental results on only one dataset. \n- Difficult to know if the results are generalizable.\n\n",

            "review": "This paper presents a deep autoencoder model for rating prediction. The autoencoder takes the user’s rating over all the items as input and tries to predict the observed ratings in the output with mean squared error. A few techniques are applied to make the training feasible without layer-wise pre-training: 1) SELU activation. 2) dropout with high probability. 3) dense output re-feeding. On the Netflix prize dataset, the proposed deep autoencoder outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches. \n\nOverall, the paper is easy to follow. However, I have three major concerns regarding the paper that makes me decide to reject it.\n\n1. Lack of novelty. The paper is essentially a deeper version of the U-AutoRec (Sedhain et al. 2015) with a few recently emerged innovations in deep learning. The dense output re-feeding is not something particularly novel, it is more or less a data-imputation procedure with expectation-maximization — in fact if the authors intend to seek explanation for this output re-feeding technique, EM might be one of the interpretations. And similar technique (more theoretically grounded) has been applied in image imputation for variational autoencoder (Rezende et al. 2014, Stochastic Backpropagation and Approximate Inference in Deep Generative Models). \n\n2. The experimental setup is also worth questioning. Using a time-split dataset is of course more challenging. However, the underlying assumption of autoencoders (or more generally, latent factor models like matrix factorization) is the all the ratings are exchangeable (conditionally independent given the latent representations), i.e., autoencoders/MF are not capable of inferring the temporal information from the data, Thus it is not even a head-to-head comparison with a temporal model (e.g., RNN in Wu et al. 2017). Of course you can still apply a static autoencoder to time-split data, but what ends up happening is the model will use its capacity to try to explain the temporal signal in the data — a deeper model certainly has more extra capacity to do so. I would suggest the authors comparing on a non-time-split dataset with other static models, like I(U)-AutoRec/MF/CF-NADE (Zheng et al. 2016)/etc.  \n\n3. Training deep models on recommender systems data is impressive. However, I would like to suggest we, as a community, start to step away from the task of rating predictions as much as we can, especially in more machine-learning-oriented venues (NIPS, ICML, ICLR, etc.) where the reviewers might be less aware of the shift in recommender systems research. (The task of rating predictions was made popular mostly due to the Netflix prize, yet even Netflix itself has already moved on from ratings.) Training (and evaluating) with RMSE on the observed ratings assumes all the missing ratings are missing at random, which is clearly far from realistic for recommender systems (see Marlin et al. 2007, Collaborative Filtering and the Missing at Random Assumption). In fact, understanding why some of the ratings are missing presents a unique challenge for the recommender systems. See, e.g., Steck 2010, Training and testing of recommender systems on data missing not at random, Liang et al. 2016, Modeling user exposure in recommendation, Schnabel et al. 2016, Recommendations as Treatments: Debiasing Learning and Evaluation. A model with good RMSE in a lot of cases does not translate to good recommendations (Cremonesi et al. 2010, Performance of recommender algorithms on top-n recommendation tasks\n). As a first step, at least start to use all the 0’s in the form of implicit feedback and focus on ranking-based metrics other than RMSE. ",

And it would be better to show the performance of the model on implicit rating data, since it is more desirable in practice, since many industry applications have only implicit rating (e.g. whether the user watches the movie or not.).",
