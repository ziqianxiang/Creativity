They build primarily on the work\nof normalizing flows from Rezende and Mohamed (2015). They derive an\ninteresting objective based on a sequence of sub-optimization\nproblems, following a variational formulation of the Fokker-Planck\nequations.\n\nI reviewed this paper for NIPS with a favorable decision toward weak\nacceptance; and the authors also addressed some of my questions in\nthis newer version (namely, some comparisons to related work; clearer\nwriting).\n\nThe experiments are only \"encouraging\"; they do not illustrate clear\nimprovements over previous methods. However, I think the work\ndemonstrates useful ideas furthering the idea of continuous-time\ntransformations that warrants acceptance.",

            "review": "The authors propose the use of first order Langevin dynamics as a way to transition from one latent variable to the next in the VAE setting, as opposed to the deterministic transitions of normalizing flow. The extremely popular Fokker-Planck equation is used to analyze the steady state distributions in this setting. The authors also propose the use of CTF in density estimation, as a generator of samples from the ''true'' distribution, and show competitive performance w.r.t. inception score for some common datasets.\n\nThe use of Langevin diffusion for latent transitions is a good idea in my opinion; though quite simple, it has the benefit of being straightforward to analyze with existing machinery. Though the discretized Langevin transitions in \\S 3.1 are known and widely used, I liked the motivation afforded by Lemma 2. \n\nI am not convinced that taking \\rho to be the sample distribution with equal probabilities at the z samples is a good choice in \\S 3.1; it would be better to incorporate the proximity of the langevin chain to a stationary point in the atom weights instead of setting them to 1/K. However to their credit the authors do provide an estimate of the error in the distribution stemming from their choice.   \n\nTo the best of my knowledge the use of CTF in density estimation as described in \\S 4 is new, and should be of interest to the community; though again it is fairly straightforward. Regarding the experiments, the difference in ELBO between the macVAE and the vanilla ones with normalizing flows is only about 2%; I wish the authors included a discussion on how the parameters of the discretized Langevin chain affects this, if at all.\n\nOverall I think the theory is properly described and has a couple of interesting formulations, in spite of being not particularly novel. I think CTFs like the one described here will see increased usage in the VAE setting, and thus the paper will be of interest to the community.",

I do not understand proposition (1). I do not think that the proof is correct (e.g. the generator L needs to be applied to a function -- the notation L(x) does not make too much sense): indeed, in the case when the volatility is zero (or very small), this proposition would imply that any vector field induces a volume preserving transformation, which is indeed false.\n\n2. I do not really see how the sequence of minimization Eq(5) helps in practice. The Wasserstein term is difficult to hand.\n\n3. in Equation (6), I do not really understand what $\\log(\\bar{\\rho})$ is if $\\bar{\\rho}$ is an empirical distribution. One really needs $\\bar{\\rho}$ to be a probability density to make sense of that.",
