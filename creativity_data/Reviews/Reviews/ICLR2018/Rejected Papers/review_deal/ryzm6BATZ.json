        "comment": "The paper received borderline-negative scores (6,5,5) with R1 and R2 having significant difficulty with the clarity of the paper. Although R3 was marginally positive, they pointed out that the experiments are \"extremely weak\". The AC look at the paper and agrees with R3 on this point. Therefore the paper cannot be accepted in its current form. The experiments and clarity need work before resubmission to another venue.  "

The model is then trained with CelebA under different parameters settings and results are analyzed.\n\nQuality and significance:\nThis is quite a technical paper, written in a very compressed form and is a bit hard to follow. Mostly it is hard to estimate what is the contribution of the model and how the results differ from baseline models.\n\nClarity:\nI would say this is one of the weak points of the paper - the paper is not well motivated and the results are not clearly presented. \n\nOriginality:\nSeems original.\n\nPros:\n* Interesting energy formulation and variation over BEGAN\n\nCons:\n* Not a clear paper\n* results are only partially motivated and analyzed",

            "review": "This paper proposed some new energy function in the BEGAN (boundary equilibrium GAN framework), including l_1 score, Gradient magnitude similarity score, and chrominance score, which are motivated and borrowed from the image quality assessment techniques. These energy component in the objective function allows learning of different set of features and determination on whether the features are adequately represented. experiments on the using different hyper-parameters of the energy function, as well as visual inspections on the quality of the learned images, are presented. \n\nIt appears to me that the novelty of the paper is limited, in that the main approach is built on the existing BEGAN framework with certain modifications. For example, the new energy function in equation (4) larges achieves similar goal as the original energy (1) proposed by Zhao et. al (2016), except that the margin loss in (1) is changed to a re-weighted linear loss, where the dynamic weighting scheme of k_t is borrowed  from the work of Berthelot et. al (2017). It is not very clear why making such changes in the energy would supposedly make the results better, and no further discussions are provided.  On the other hand, the several energy component introduced are simply choices of the similarity measures as motivated from the image quality assessment, and there are probably a lot more in the literature whose application can not be deemed as a significant contribution to either theories or algorithm designs in GAN.\n\nMany results from the experimental section rely on visual evaluations, such as in Figure~4 or 5; from these figures, it is difficult to clearly pick out the winning images. In Figure~5, for a fair  evaluation on the performance of model interploations, the same human model should be used for competing methods, instead of applying different human models and different interpolation tasks in different methods. \n ",

            "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold",
            "review": "Summary: \nThe paper extends the the recently proposed Boundary Equilibrium Generative Adversarial Networks (BEGANs), with the hope of generating images which are more realistic. In particular, the authors propose to change the energy function associated with the auto-encoder, from an L2 norm (a single number) to an energy function with multiple components. Their energy function is inspired by the structured similarity index (SSIM), and the three components they use are the L1 score, the gradient magnitude similarity score, and the chromium score. Using this energy function, the authors hypothesize, that it will force the generator to generate realistic images. They test their hypothesis on a single dataset, namely, the CelebA dataset. \n\nReview: \nWhile the idea proposed in the paper is somewhat novel and there is nothing obviously wrong about the proposed approach, I thought the paper is somewhat incremental. As a result I kind of question the impact of this result. My suspicion is reinforced by the fact that the experimental section is extremely weak. In particular the authors test their model on a single relatively straightforward dataset. Any reason why the authors did not try on other datasets involving natural images? As a result I feel that the title and the claims in the paper are somewhat misleading and premature: that the proposed techniques improves the training and evaluation of energy based gans. \n\nOver all the paper is clearly written and easy to understand. \n\nBased on its incremental nature and weak experiments, I'm on the margin with regards to its acceptance. Happy to change my opinion if other reviewers strongly think otherwise with good reason and are convinced about its impact. ",
