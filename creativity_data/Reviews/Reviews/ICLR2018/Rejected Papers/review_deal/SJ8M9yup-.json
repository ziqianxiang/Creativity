            "review": "This paper considers the following model of a signal x = W^T h + b, where h is an m-dimensional random sparse vector, W is an m by n matrix, b is an n dimensional fixed bias vector. The random vector h follows an iid sparse signal model, each coordinate independently have some probability of being zero, and the remaining probability is distributed  among nonzero values according to some reasonable pdf/pmf. The task is to recover h, from the observation x via the activation functions like Sigmoid or ReLU. For example, \\hat{h} = Sigmoid(W^T h + b).\n\nThe authors then show that, under the random sparsity model of h, it is possible to upper bound the probability P(||h-\\hat{h}|| > \\delta. m) in terms of the parameters of the distribution of h and W and b. In some cases noise can also be tolerated. In particular, if W is incoherent (columns being near-orthonormal), then the guarantee is stronger. As far as I understood, the proofs make sense - they basically use Chernoff-bound type argument. \n\nIt is my impression that a lot of conditions have to be satisfied for the recovery guarantee to be meaningful. I am unsure if real datasets will satisfied so many conditions. Also, the usual objective of autoencoders is to denoise  - i.e. recover x, without any access to W. The authors approach in this vein seem to be only empirical. Some recent works on associative memory also assume the sparse recovery model - connections to this literature would have been of interest. It is also not clear why compressed sensing-type recovery using a single ReLU or Sigmoid would be of interest: are their complexity benefits?",

            "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection",
            "review": "*Summary*\nThe paper studies recovery guarantees within the context of auto-encoders. Assuming a noise-corrupted linear model for the inputs x's, the paper looks at some sufficient properties (e.g., over the generating dictionary denoted by W) to recover the true underlying sparse signals (denoted by h). Several settings of increasing complexity are considered (from binary signals with no noise to noisy continuous signals). Evaluations are carried out on synthetic examples to highlight the theoretical findings.\n\nThe paper is overall difficult to read. Moreover, and importantly, no algorithmic perspectives are presented in the paper, in the sense that we do not know whether practical procedures would lead to W's satisfying the appropriate properties (unlike (not-mentioned) recent results for dictionary learning/ICA; see detailed comments). Also, assumptions are made (e.g., knowledge about expectations of h and x) for which it is unclear to see how practical/limiting they are. Finally (and as further discussed below), the paper does not sufficiently discuss related work.\n\n(note: I have not reviewed the appendix and supplementary material)\n\n*Detailed comments*\n\n-I think there is an insufficient literature review about recent recovery results in the context of sparse coding, dictionary learning and ICA (see some references at the bottom of the review). I think this is all the more important as the paper tries to draw connections with ICA (see Sec. 4.4).\nGiven that the paper positions itself on a theoretical level, detailed comparisons with existing sample complexities obtained in previous work for related models (e.g., sparse coding, dictionary learning and ICA) must be provided.\n\n-To the best of my understanding of the paper, the guarantees are about h_hat and the true h. It therefore seems that the paper's approach is very close to standard sparse inverse problems, up to the difference due to the (non-identity) activation function. If this is indeed the case, the paper should discuss its results when the activation is identity to see whether known results are recovered. \n\n-\"...we consider linear activation s_d because it is a more general case.\": Just after this statement, it is mentioned that non-linear activations are used in practice. Could this statement be therefore clarified?\n\n-Sec. 2 is unclear. For instance, it is not easy to see how one go from (1) to (2). Moreover, the concept of \"AE framework\" is not well defined.\n\n-In the bottom of page 3, why are p_i and (1-p_i) discarded?\n\n-In practice, how can we set the appropriate value of b_i?\n\n-What is the practical sense of being able to have access to E_h[x], E_x[x], and E_h[h]?\n\n-In Proposition 1 and 2, if the noise e is indeed random, it means the right-hand sides are also random variables. Then, what does the probability statement Pr mean on the left-hand side? Is is conditioned on the draw of e? Some clarifications are required.\n\n-Typo page 7: \"...that used to generate the data.\" --> \"... used to generate the data.\"\n-Typo page 9: \"...data are then generate...\" --> \"...data are then generated...\"\n\n-In Sec. 5.3, to match W_hat and W, the Hungarian algorithm can probably be used.\n\n*References*\n\n(Arora2012) Arora, S.; Ge, R.; Moitra, A. & Sachdeva, S.
