        "comment": "This work presents a strong baseline model for several NLP-ish tasks such as document classification, sentence classification, representation learning based NLI, and text matching. In terms of originality, reviewers found that \"there is not much contribution in terms of technical novelty\" but that \"one might also conclude that we need more challenging dataset\". There was significant discussion about whether it \"sheds new lights on limitations of existing methods\" or whether the results were \"marginally surprising\". In terms of quality, reviewers found it to be an \"insightful analysis\" and noted that these \"SWEMs should be considered a strong baseline in future work\".\n\nThere was significant discussion with the AC about the signficance of the work. In the opinion of the AC reviewers did were too quick to accept the authors novelty claims, and did not push them enough to include other baselines in their tables that were not overly deep model. In particular the AC felt that important numbers were left out of the experiment tables, for document classification that muddied the results. The response of the authors was:\n\n\"Moreover, fasttext and our SWEM variants all belong to the category of simpler methods (with parameter-free compositional functions). Since our motivation is to explore the necessity of employing complicated compositional functions for various NLP tasks, we do not think it is necessary for us to make any comparisons between fasttext and SWEM.\"\n\nIn addition when a reviewer pointed out the lack of inclusion of FOFE embeddings, the authors noted something similar\n\n\"Besides, we totally agree that developing sentence embeddings that are both simple and efficient is a very promising research direction (FOFE is a great work along this line).\"\n\nThe reviewer correctly pointed out related work that shows a model very similar to what the author's propose. In general this seems like evidence that the techniques are known, not that they are significant and novel. "

            "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold",
            "review": "This paper empirically investigates the differences realized by using compositional functions over word embeddings as compared to directly operating the word embeddings. That is, the authors seek to explore the advantages afforded by RNN/CNN based models that induce intermediate semantic representations of texts, as opposed to simpler (parameter-free) approaches to composing these, like addition. \n\nIn sum, I think this is exploration is interesting, and suggests that we should perhaps experiment more regularly with simple aggregation methods like SWEM. On the other hand, the differences across the models is relatively modest, and the data resists clear conclusions, so I'm not sure that the work will be very impactful. In my view, then, this work does constitute a contribution, albeit a modest one. I do think the general notion of attempting to simplify models until performance begins to degrade is a fruitful path to explore, as models continue to increase in complexity despite compelling evidence that this is always needed.\n\nStrengths\n---\n+ This paper does highlight a gap in existing work, as far as I am aware: namely, I am not sure that there are generally known trade-offs associated with different compositional models over token embeddings for NLP. However, it is not clear that we should expect there to be a consistent result to this question across all NLP tasks.\n\n+ The results are marginally surprising, insofar as I would have expected the CNN/RNN (particularly the former) to dominate the simpler aggregation approaches, and this does not seem borne out by the data. Although this trend is seemingly reversed on the short text data, muddying the story. \n\nWeaknesses\n---\n- There are a number of important limitations here, many of which the authors themselves note, which mitigate the implications of the reported results. First, this is a small set of tasks, and results may not hold more generally. It would have been nice to see some work on Seq2Seq tasks, or sequence tagging tasks at least. \n\n- I was surprised to see no mention of the \"Fixed-Size Ordinally-Forgetting Encoding Method\" (FOFE) proposed by Zhang et al. in 2015, which would seem to be a natural point of comparison here, given that it sits in a sweet spot of being simple and efficient while still expressive enough to preserve word-order information. This actually seems like a pretty glaring omission given that it meets many of the desiderata the authors put forward. \n\n- The interpretability angle discussed seems underdeveloped. I'm not sure that being able to identify individual words (as the authors have listed) meaningfully constitutes \"interpretability\" -- standard CNNs, e.g., lend themselves to this as well by tracing back through the filter activations. \n\n- Some of the questions addressed seem tangential to the main question of the paper -- e.g., word vector dimensionality seems an orthogonal issue to the composition function, and would influence performance for the more complex architectures as well.\n\nSmaller comments\n---\n- On page 1, the authors write \"By representing each word as a fixed-length vector, these embeddings can group semantically similar words, while explicitly encoding rich linguistic regularities and patterns\", but actually I would say that these *implicitly* encode such regularities, rather than explicitly. \n\n- \"architecture in Kim 2014; Collobert et al. 2011; Gan et al. 2017\" -- citation formatting a bit weird here.\n\n\n*** Update based on author response *** \n\nI have read the authors response and thank them for the additional details. \n\nRegarding the limited set of problems: of course any given work can only explore so many tasks, but for this to have general implications in NLP I would maintain that a standard (structured) sequence tagging task/dataset should have been considered. This is not about the number of datasets, but rather than diversity of the output spaces therein.\n\nI appreciated the additional details regarding FOFE, which as the authors themselves note in their response is essentially a generalization of SWEM. \n\nOverall, the response has not changed my opinion on this paper: I think this (exploring simple representations and baselines) is an important direction in NLP, but feel that the paper would greatly benefit from additional work.\n\n",

Do the authors have any sense on whether this is because of the difficulty in training an RNN/CNN model for long documents or whether compositions are not necessary since there are multiple predictive independent cues in a long text?\n- It would be useful to include a linear classification model that takes the word embeddings as an input in the comparison (SWEM-learned).\n- How crucial is it to retrain the word embeddings on the task of interest (from GloVe initialization) to obtain good performance?",

            "rating": "7: Good paper, accept",
            "review": "This paper presents a very thorough empirical exploration of the qualities and limitations of very simple word-embedding based models. Average and/or max pooling over word embeddings (which are initialized from pretrained embeddings) is used to obtain a fixed-length representation for natural language sequences, which is then fed through a single layer MLP classifier. In many of the 9 evaluation tasks, this approach is found to match or outperform single-layer CNNs or RNNs.\n\nThe varied findings are very clearly presented and helpfully summarized, and for each task setting the authors perform an insightful analysis.\n\nMy only criticism would be the fact that the study is limited to English, even though the conclusions are explicitly scoped in light of this. Moreover, I wonder how well the findings would hold in a setting with a more severe OOV problem than is perhaps present in the studied datasets.\n\nBesides concluding from the presented results that these SWEMs should be considered a strong baseline in future work, one might also conclude that we need more challenging datasets!\n\nMinor things:\n- It wasn't entirely clear how the text matching tasks are encoded. Are the two sequences combined into a single sequence before applying the model, or something else? I might have missed this detail.\n\n- Given the two ways of using the Glove embeddings for initialization (direct update vs mapping them with an MLP into the task space), it would be helpful to know which one ended up being used (i.e. optimal) in each setting.\n\n- Something went wrong with the font size for the remainder of the text near Figure 1.\n\n** Update **\nThanks for addressing my questions in the author response.\n\nAfter following the other discussion thread about the novelty claims, I believe I didn't weigh that aspect strongly enough in my original rating, so I'm revising it. I remain of the opinion that this paper offers a useful systematic comparison that goes sufficiently beyond the focus of the two related papers mentioned in that thread (fasttext and Parikh's).\n",
