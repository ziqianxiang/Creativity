        "comment": "This paper proposes training binary-values LSTMs for NLP using the Gumbel-softmax reparameterization.  The motivation is that this will generalize better, and this is demonstrated in a couple of instances.\n\nHowever, it's not clear how cherry-picked the examples are, since the training loss wasn't reported for most experiments.  And, if the motivation is better generalization, it's not clear why we would use this particular setup."

            "review": "This paper propose a new \"gate\" function for LSTM to enable the values of the gates towards 0 or 1. The motivation behind is a  flat region of the loss surface is likely to generalize well. It shows the experimental results are comparable or better than vanilla LSTM and much more robust to low-precision approximation and low-rank approximation.\n\nIn section 3.2, the paper claimed using a smaller temperature cannot guarantee the outputs to be close to the boundary. Is there any experimental evidence to show it's not working? It also claimed pushing output gate to 0/1 will drop the performance. It actually quite interesting because there are bunch of paper claimed output gate is not important for language modeling, e.g. https://openreview.net/pdf?id=HJOQ7MgAW . \n\nIn the sensitive analysis, what if apply rounding / low-rank for all the parameters? \n\nHow was this approach compare to binarynet https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02830 ? Applying the same idea, but only for forget gate/ input gate. Also, can we apply this idea to the binarynet? \n\nOverall, I think it's an interesting paper but I feel it should compare with some simple baseline to binarized the gate function.  \n\nUpdates: Thanks a lot for all the clarification. It do improve the paper quality but I'm still thinking it's higher than \"6\" but lower than \"7\". To me, improve ppl from \"52.8\" to \"52.1\" isn't very significant. For WMT, it improve on DE->EN but not for EN->DE (although it improve both for the author's own baseline). So I'm not fully convinced this approach could improve the generalization. But I feel this work can have many other applications such as \"binarynet\". ",

            "review": "The paper argues for pushing the input and forget gate’s output toward 0 or 1, i.e., the LSTM tends to reside in flat region of surface loss, which is likely to generalize well. To achieve that, the sigmoid function in the original LSTM is replaced by a function G that is continuous and differentiable with respect to the parameters (by applying the Gumbel-Softmax trick). As a result, the model is still differentiable while the output gate is approximately binarized.  \n\nPros:\n-\tThe paper is clearly written\n-\tThe method is new and somehow theoretically guaranteed by the proof of the Proposition 1\n-\tThe experiments are clearly explained with detailed configurations\n-\tThe performance of the method in the model compression task is promising \n\nCons:\n-\tThe “simple deduction” which states that pushing the gate values toward 0 or 1 correspond to the region of the overall loss surface may need more theoretical analysis\n-\tIt is confusing whether the output of the gate is sampled based on or computed directly by the function G  \n-\tThe experiments lack many recent baselines on the same dataset (Penn Treebank: Melis et al. (2017) – On the State of the Art of Evaluation in Neural Language Models; WMT: Ashish et.al. (2017) – Attention Is All You Need) \n-\tThe experiment’s result is only slightly better than the baseline’s\n-\tTo be more persuasive, the author should include in the baselines other method that can “binerize” the gate values such as the one sharpening the sigmoid function. \n\n\nIn short, this work is worth a read. Although the experimental results are not quite persuasive, the method is nice and promising. \n",
