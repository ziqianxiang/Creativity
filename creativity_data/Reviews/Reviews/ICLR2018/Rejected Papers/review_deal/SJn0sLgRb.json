        "comment": "The paper proposes a data augmentation technique for image classification which consists in averaging two input images and using the label of one of them. The method is shown to outperform the baseline on the image classification task, the but evaluation doesn’t extend beyond that (to other tasks or alternative augmentation mechanisms); theoretical justification is also lacking."

The experiments show\nthat this strategy allows to reduce the risk of overfitting especially in the case of a limited amount of training \nsamples or in experimental settings with a small number of categories.\n\n+ The paper is easy to read: the method and the experiments are explained clearly.\n\n- the method is presented as a heuristic technique. \n1) The training process has some specific steps with the Sample Pairing intermittently disabled. \nThe number of epochs with enabled or disabled Sample Pairing changes depending on the dataset.\nHow much si the method robust/sensitive to variations on these choices?\n2) There is no specific analysis on the results besides showing the validation and training errors: would it\nbe possible to see the results per class? Would the confusion matrices reveal something more about the\neffect of the method?  Does Sample Pairing help to differentiate similar categories even if they are mixed\nat trainign time?\n3)  Would it be possible to better control the importance of each sample label rather\nthan always choosing one of the two as ground truth? \n\nThe paper misses an in-depth analysis of the proposed practical strategy.\n\n",

The paper is also straightforward to read and clear, which is positive. Overall i think the finding is of sufficient interest for acceptance.\n\nThe paper would benefit from adding some speculation on reasons why this phenomenon occurs.\nThere are a couple of choices that would benefit from more explanation / analysis:  a) averaging, then forcing the classifier to pick one of the two classes present; why not pick both? b) the choice of hard-switching between sample pairing and regular training - it would be interesting if sample-pairing as an augmentation meshed better with other augmentations implementation-wise, so that it could be easier to integrate in other frameworks.",

            "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold",
            "review": "The paper investigates a method of data augmentation for image classification, where two images from the training set are averaged together as input, but the label from only one image is used as a target.  Since this scheme is asymmetric and uses quite unrealistic input images, a training scheme is used where the technique is only enabled in the middle of training (not very beginning or end), and in an alternating on-off fashion.  This improves classification performance nicely on a variety of datasets.\n\nThis is a simple technique, and the paper is concise and to the point.  However, I would have liked to see a few additional comparisons.\n\nFirst, this augmentation technique seems to have two components:  One is the mixing of inputs, but another is the effective dropping of labels from one of the two images in the pair.  Which of these are more important, and can they be separated?  What if some of the images' labels are changed at random, for half the images in a minibatch, for example?  This would have the effect of random label changes, but without the input mixing.  Likewise, what if both labels in the pair are used as targets (with 0.5 assigned to each in the softmax target)?  This would mix the images, but keep targets intact.\n\nSecond, the bottom of p.3 says that multiple training procedures were evaluated, but I'd be interested to see the results of some of these.  In particular, is it important to alternate enabling and disabling SamplePairing, or does it also work to mix samples with and without it in each minibatch (e.g. 3/4 of the minibatch with pairing augmentation, and 1/4 without it)?\n\nI liked the experiment mixing images from within a restricted training set composed of a subset of the CIFAR images, compared to mixing these images with CIFAR training set images outside the restricted sample (p.5 and Fig 5).  This suggests to me, however, that it's possible the label manipulations may play an important role.  Or, is an explanation why this performs not as well that the network will train these mixing images to random targets (that of the training image in the pair), and never see this example again, whereas by using the training set alone, the mixing image is likely to be repeated with its correct label?  Some more discussion on this would be nice.\n\nOverall, I think this is an interesting technique that appears to achieve nice results.  It could be investigated deeper at some key points.\n",
