            "review": "This paper introduced a new network called deep croise scattering network (DCSN) which generalizes the scattering network (SN). It replaces the standard scalogram of SN with a 3D tensor by including wavelet families so that the network can extract more features form data. An empirical risk was introduced and was used to determine the thresholding operator to handle noise in the data. The proposed DCSN and SDCSN significantly outperform the SN, and the proposed thresholding is particularly effective on relatively small data sets. One concern I have is that it is unclear how the proposed method compare with existing deep learning methods. The only comparisons made were with SN. Furthermore, there are some notation in Section 2 of the paper that are not clearly explained, which makes some part of the section hard to understand. Also, the idea of using a family of wavelets seems quite straightforward.",
