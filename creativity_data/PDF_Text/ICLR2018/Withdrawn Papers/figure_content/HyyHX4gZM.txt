Figure 1: (a) A circle centered at (8, 8), radius 3, and with 100 points, is deformed as follows: foreach point xi a random value drawn from a uniform distribution with range (-ηi, ηi), ηi = 0.05, isadded along the radius. (b) 1000 points of clutter are added by sampling from a uniform distributioninside a box of size 9 × 9, with corners at points: (4,4), (4,13), (13,4), (13,13).
Figure 2: (a) A circle centered at (8, 8), radius 3, and with 100 points, is deformed with η = 0.5.
Figure 3: (a) Two overlapping circles deformed with η = 0.5, radius r = 3 and with 100 pointseach. The circle centers are at (8, 8) and (7.2, 7.2). (b) The Bayesian method (showing the proba-bility value). The radius is fed to the method. The method mixes all data yielding the highest proba-bility approximately in the ”middle” of both centers and no suggestion of two peaks/circles/centersexists. (c) The Hough method with α = 2.769 estimated to include all circle points that have beendeformed. The method yields a probability that is more diluted and includes the correct centers, butdoes not suggest two peaks.
Figure 4: Quantum Probability depicted for input shown in figure 2a and figure 3a, respectively. Theparameters used where T = 1, ~ = 0.12. The quantum method outperform the classical methods, asthe center detection shown in (a) is more peaked than in the Hough method and in (b) the two peaksemerge. These are results of the interference phenomena, as cancellation of probabilities (negativeterms on the probability equation 6) contribute to better resolve the center detection problem.
