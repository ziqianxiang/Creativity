Figure 1: The loss surface corresponding to a piecewise multilinear form. In (a): Local minimaare located in the interior of the flat cells Ω(3) and Ω(5) (type I), on the boundary between cellsΩ ⑴ and Ω ⑵(type II) and the boundary between cells Ω ⑷ and Ω ⑸(type II). In (b): Parameterspace Ω = R2 decomposes into a partition of five cells. The loss L on each cell is a SUm ofmultilinear forms. In (c): A rotation of (a) shows the saddle-like surface of the nontrivial forms oncells Ω⑴，Ω⑵ and Ω(4).
Figure 2: Three different local minima of the loss L(ω) for a network with two hidden neurons.
