Figure 1: Overview of attribute-aware recommender systems. Attributes can be appended to users,items or ratings (feedback).
Figure 2: Graphical interpretation of discriminative probabilistic matrix factorization whose at-tributes X, Y , Z are observed for ratings and latent factors. User and item-relevant attributes X, Ycould affect the generation of latent factors W , H or ratings R, while rating-relevant attributes Ztypically determines the rating prediction R.
Figure 3: Graphical interpretation of generative probabilistic matrix factorization whose attributesX , Y , Z together with ratings are generated by latent factors. Rating-relevant attributes Z is likelyto result from both W and H . For models of this class, some of the gray arrows are removed torepresent their additional independence assumptions about attribute generation.
Figure 5: Graphical interpretation of Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (PMF). User or item latentfactors W, H are put to generate observed ratings R. Parameters σW, σH, σR control the certaintyin the generation process.
