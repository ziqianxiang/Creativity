Figure 1: The convolutional neural networks used in this work: (a) a single-task CNN. The encodercomponent takes the sentence as input and outputs a fixed-length sentence embedding vector; theclassifier component predicts class labels with the sentence embedding. (b) the evaluation on transferperformance from task i to j, where the encoder of task i was taken to encode task j’s sentences andthen predict task j’s labels (dashed arcs).
Figure 2: Overview of the idea of our Robust Clustering method with multi-task learning as anexample application. (a) an illustration of the sparse cross-tasks transfer-performance matrix withunobserved entries (white blocks) and unreliable values (top-right and bottom-left corners), where redcolors indicate positive transfer and blue colors indicate negative transfer; (b) the constructed binarypartially-observed matrix with low-rank constraint for matrix completion and clustering (see Section3.2 for the detailed mathematics); (c) a multi-task Convolutional Neural Network (MTL-CNN)architecture trained on a task cluster (tasks 1, 2 and 3 in the example).
