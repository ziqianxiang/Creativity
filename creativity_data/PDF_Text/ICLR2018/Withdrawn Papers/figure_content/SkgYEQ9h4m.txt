Figure 1: The effect of downsampling (red arrows) and upsampling (green arrows) on 3D facemeshes. The reconstructed face after upsampling maintains the overall structure but most of thefiner details are lost.
Figure 2: The architecture of the Convolutional Mesh Autoencoder. The red and green arrowsindicate downsampling and upsampling layers respectively. The output space of each of the layersin denoted under it. Faces in intermediate layers are only for visualization.
Figure 3: Qualitative results for mesh reconstruction on test set of interpolation experiment.
Figure 4: Cumulative Euclidean error between PCA model and Mesh Autoencoder for Interpola-tion(a) and Extrapolation(b) experiments.
Figure 5: Qualitative results on test set of extrapolation experiments. The expression of the test setwas completely excluded from all subjects.
