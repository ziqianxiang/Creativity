Figure 1: The proposed dense transformer networks. A pair of dense transformer modules areinserted into each of the encoder and decoder paths. In the spatial transformer module, values atpoints A, B, C, and D are given from the previous layer, and we need to estimate value for point P.
Figure 2: Sample segmentation results on the PASCAL 2012 segmentation data set. The first andsecond rows are the original images and the corresponding ground truth, respectively. The third andfourth rows are the segmentation results of U-Net and DTN, respectively.
