Figure 1: Visual analogy between image captioning task and our model. By grouping a note and itsproperties as a 'word', We generate melody as a 'sentence'.
Figure 2: Comparison of our model for musical representation with previous model. Most of theprevious models used a frame-level time granularity, which can easily lead to a model over-fittingon the repetition of the previous time step. Our proposed model of word representation alleviatesthis problem by encoding the time information (duration and position).
