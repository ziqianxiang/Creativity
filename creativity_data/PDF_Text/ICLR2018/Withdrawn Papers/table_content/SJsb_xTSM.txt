Table 1: Results for models trained on en-de language pair. *no-mono means no monolingual datawas used in training. Dim column gives the dimension of the sentence embeddings. We compare ourmodel to: BiCVM-add+ Hermann & Blunsom (2014), BiCVM-bi+ Hermann & Blunsom (2014),BiSkiP-UnsUPAlign LUong et al. (2015) and para_doc Pham et al.(2015a).
Table 2: We compare our JMT-Sent-LSTM model trained on three languages to one trained on twolanguages.
Table 3: JMT models show big gains when comparing Sent-add and Sent-LSTM trained on just100k parallel sentences.
