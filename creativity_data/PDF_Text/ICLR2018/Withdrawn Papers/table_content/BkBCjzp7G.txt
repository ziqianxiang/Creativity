Table 6: Accuracy of ResNet50 using the iterative two-pass decomposition (%)Accuracy	Iteration 1	Iteration 2	Iteration 3	OPtimize ∣ Fine-tune	OPtimize ∣ Fine-tune	OPtimize ∣ Fine-tuneIn-Order	91.40 I 91.42	90.84 I 90.90	90.32 I 90.513.3	DiscussionAstrid & Lee (2017) suggests that freezing layers make the fine-tuning greedy, which might causethe optimization to be stuck in a local minimal. However, our approach works efficiently by iter-atively decomposing a group of layers with previously layers frozen. The attempt also makes theoptimization converge faster and prevents from the gradient explosion.
