Table 1: Comparison of average accuracies on two datasets: UIUC-Sports dataset (UIUC) and asubset of LabelMe dataset (LM). Methods include SVM with a polynomial kernel , Softmax classi-fier, Fully connected network (FC), Bagging, Adaboost, SnapShot Ensembling (SnapShot) and theproposed InterBoost method (Ours). Each method except for SVM runs 60 rounds, and the meanvalues of classification accuracies are reported in the Table.
