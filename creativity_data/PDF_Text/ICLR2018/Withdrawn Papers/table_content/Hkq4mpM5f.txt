Table 1: (a) The average faithfulness, orthogonality, and locality for different approaches in 30 categoriesselected randomly. The column Z represents the average locality computed over all the dimensions of Z,the 4096-dimensional first fully-connected layer of the deep network. This is obtained by separately runningExcitationBP on each dimension of Z and evaluating the resulting heatmaps. (b) A preliminary human studycomparing SRAE with Lasso.
Table 2: (a) The average faithfulness for Lasso with different Î±; (b) The average classification accuracy forimages masked by our method and ExcitationBP so that only highlighted areas are shown to the classifier.
Table 3: The average classification accuracy on images masked by our method and ExcitationBP, respectively.
