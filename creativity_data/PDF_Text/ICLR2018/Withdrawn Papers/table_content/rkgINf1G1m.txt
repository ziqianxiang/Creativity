Table 1: The structure of our network for the experiment of MNIST. It is similar to LeNet LeCunet al. (1998), but we add some filters and reduce the number of neurons in the last hidden layer to 2.
Table 2: Comparison of three methods. We train these three methods for several trials on MNIST.
Table 3: Classification results.
Table 4: Classification accuracy on MNIST and CIFAR-10 for adversarial attacking. The adversarialsamples are produced with the fast gradient sign method (FGSM) with different .
