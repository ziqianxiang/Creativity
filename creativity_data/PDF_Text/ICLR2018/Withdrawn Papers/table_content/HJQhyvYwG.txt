Table 1: Statistics regarding the Self and ParaphraseRCDatasetsTREC Question Type Distribution (%)Figure 2: Analysis of the Question TypesWe refer to this combined dataset containing a total of 186,089 instances as DuoRC. Fig. 2 shows thedistribution of different Wh-type questions in our dataset. Some more interesting statistics about thedataset are presented in Table 1 and also in Appendix B.

Table 6: QA for Big Jake14Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2018Appendix B	Data AnalysisWe conducted a manual verification of 100 question-answer pairs where the SelfRC and ParaphraseRCwere different or the latter was marked as non-answerable. As noted in Fig. 3, the chief reason behindgetting No Answer from the Paraphrase plot is lack of information and at times, need for an educatedguesswork or missing general knowledge (e.g. Philadelphia is a city) or missing movie meta-data(e.g. to answer questions like ‘Where did Julia Roberts’ character work in the movie?’). On the otherhand, SelfRC and ParaphraseRC answers are occasionally seen to have partial or no overlap, mainlybecause of the following causes; phrasal paraphrases or subjective questions (e.g. Why and Howtype questions) or different valid answers to objective questions (e.g. ‘Where did Jane work?’ isanswered by one worker as ‘Bloomberg’ and other as ‘New York City’) or differently spelt names inthe answers (e.g. ‘Rebeca’ as opposed to ‘Rebecca’).
