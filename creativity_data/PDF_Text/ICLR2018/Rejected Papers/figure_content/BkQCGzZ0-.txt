Figure 1: Architecture of the autoencoding function c(s). We write convsk==ba to denote a 1D con-volutional layer with kernel size a and stride b. See text for more details.
Figure 2: Comparison of a standard language model and our autoencoder-augmented model. Thearchitecture for c(s) is presented in Figure 1 and the arrows from si to s<i depict dependence.
Figure 3: Decoding from baseline and autoencoder-enhanced sequence-to-sequence models.
