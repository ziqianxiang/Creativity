Figure 4: Columns 1 and 3: comparison of inter-onset lengths distribution and KL divergence fromthe source distribution for a texture generation example as the effective receptive field increasesin time. Columns 2 and 4: mean local autocorrelation plots showing the increase in hierarchicalrhythmic structure of the audio without any significant increase in the maximum cross-correlationvalue, max(Î¦XY ).
Figure 5: Comparison of the error with different content-based representations for a task where thecontent and style audio is exactly the same except for key. The x-axis represents varying semi-toneoffsets in musical representation. The first point on the left of 0 semi-tone offset represents theidentity style transfer task, where both content and style are exactly the same signals. We plot theerror in the log-magnitude STFT representations to show the overall signal error.
