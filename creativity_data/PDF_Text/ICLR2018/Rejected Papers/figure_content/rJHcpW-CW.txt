Figure 1: Illustration of proposed PGANvergence are controlled by two discriminators. Durugkar et al. (2016) propose a multi-discriminatormodel, where weak discriminators are trained using parts of the data, and the gradients from all thediscriminators are passed to the generator.

We have constructed the generator, the discriminator and the adjustmentcomponent as three layer fully connected neural networks. The capacity is large enough for thedemonstration.
