Figure 1:	PCA plots of latent representations for different number of classes K of discrete variabley. Increasing K , imposes a different structure on the model, encouraging it to learn and separatedifferent manifolds. E.g. setting K = 4 the model successfully separates the 4 different cell popu-lations present in the data (lymphocytes, monocytes, granulocytes and destroyed red blood cells).

Figure 3: PCA plots of latent representations for experiments on both patient data sets for HCD-VAE. Red indicates healthy cells. Blue indicates pathological cells. For clarity only minibatchescontaining pathological cells are shown. Best viewed in color.
