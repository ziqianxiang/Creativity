Figure 1: Illustration of the proposed method. A circle stands for a vector, and a square stands for alayer with parameters. The dashed line means a cross entropy operation. The square labeled “neuralnetwork” can be CNN, ResNet, Seq-to-Seq, and so on.
Figure 2: Error rate curve for CIFAR-100, CIFAR-10, and MNSIT. 20 times experiments (the lightcolor curves) are conducted for credible results both on the baseline and our proposed model. Theaverage results are shown as deep color curves.
