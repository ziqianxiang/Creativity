Figure 1: A slice of one layer of the Image Transformer, recomputing the representation q0 of asingle channel of one pixel q by attending to a memory of previously generated pixels m1 , m2, .
Figure 2: The two different conditional factorizations used in our experiments, with 1D and 2D localattention on the left and right, respectively. In both, the image is partitioned into non-overlappingquery blocks, each associated with a memory block covering a superset of the query block pixels.
