Figure 4: Cosine similarity between greedypaired rows of W and W for continuous (left)and binary (right) recovery. The upper, mid andlower bar denotes the 95th, 50th and 5th per-centile.

Figure 6: Coherence of orthogonal and Gaussian weight matrix with varying dimensions.
Figure 7: Cosine similarity between greedy paired rows of W and W for noisy binary (upper) andcontinous (lower) recovery. From left to right the noise stand deviations are 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2,respectively. The upper, mid and lower bar represent the 95th, 50th and 5th percentile.
