Figure 1: Graphical representation of BPTT, truncated BPTT and ARTBP. Blue arrows representforward propagations, red arrows backpropagations. Dots represent either internal state resetting orgradient resetting.
Figure 2: Influence balancing dynamics, 1 positive influence, 3 negative influences.
Figure 3: ARTBP and truncated BPTT on influence balancing, n = 13, p = 10. Note the log scaleon the y-axis.
