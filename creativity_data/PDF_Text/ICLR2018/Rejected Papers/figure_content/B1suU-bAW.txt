Figure 1: The effects of conditioning on covariates (covariates are discussion forums, described inSection 3). Left: baseline embedding with some possible word embedding positionings. Middle,right: embedding under effect of covariates: for example, “hillary” and “crooked” are pushed closertogether under effects of TheDonald, and “healthcare” pushed closer to “universal” and “free”under effects of SandersForPresident. Context vectors and random walk transitions also shown.
Figure 3: Histogram, sizes of weights in covariate vectors for politics dataset. Smallest bucket iszero (< 10-10). Sparsity of covariates in book dataset deferred to appendix.
Figure 4: Histogram, sizes of weights in covariate vectors of book data.
