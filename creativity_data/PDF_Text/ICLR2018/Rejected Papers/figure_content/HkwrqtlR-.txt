Figure 1:	Samples drawn from the generator network trained over the MNIST and 1-MNISTdatasets.
Figure 2:	200 samples drawn from the generator network trained over CIFAR-10 dataset.
Figure 3: We represent the n1-MNIST→GAN(i) and n1-MNIST→1-MNIST(i) profiles computed for 6739images sampled at random from the generator network and for the 6739 images in the 1-MNISTtraining set.
Figure 4: We represent the n1-MNIST→GAN(i) profile computed for 105 images sampled at randomfrom the generator network using the two NNs of each image.
Figure 5: In (b), we represent the two images that are furthest from their neighbors within theMNIST training set. In (b), we represent the two images that are furthest from their neighbors inartificial set of images sampled from the generative network.
Figure 6: In (a), we represent nMNIST→GAN (i) and nMNIST→MNIST(i) computed for MNIST with60,000 images. In (b), we reproduce the experiments for CIFAR with 50,000 images.
