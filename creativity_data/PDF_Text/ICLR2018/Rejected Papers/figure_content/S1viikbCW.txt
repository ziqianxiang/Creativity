Figure 1: Where each of the CAVs are learned. Accuracy at each layer for CAV. Simple concepts(e.g., colors) achieve high performance in all layers than more abstract concepts (e.g. persons,objects)Figure 2: Deepdreamed fibrous texture, knitted texture, corgis and Siberian huskey CAVs.

Figure 3: Deepdreamed CAV texture concepts for each layer (each row) in inception. We canidentify textures better in the mid-layer (mixed4d), then later layers.

Figure 5: Top and bottom 3 similar pictures of each conceptWhen using TCAV, in order to ensure that the provided examples were sufficient to learn CAV, werecommend users to perform this qualitative test by checking cosine similarity with each conceptsto the class.
Figure 6: Testing Relative Importance of Concepts4.3	Gaining insightsIn this section, we show results that confirm common-sense intuitions about training images, as akind of sanity check that TCAV provides valid results. We then describe results that surprised us,but lead to insights about the dataset that we did not initially have.
