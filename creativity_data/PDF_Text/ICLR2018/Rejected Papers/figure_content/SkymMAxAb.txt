(2015) demonstrated that pollutant concentration is significantlyaffected by meteorological conditions, hence we feed the meteorological condition at every timesteps as the control information. Preliminarily, we found the LSTM outperformed the ReducedL-STM and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). We chose PM2.5 as the forecasting object of the air pol-lutant, and selected October 5, 2016, to January 3, 2017 data, as the training dataset, and January3, 2017, to February 2, 2017,data as the validation dataset. As there is one data point every threehours, and we predict air pollutant concentration for 5 days, we sliced each dataset into 40 timesteps length segment, allowing overlaying segments. In total, 680(90 * 8 - 40) matrix samples in thetraining dataset, and 200(30 * 8 - 40) matrix samples in the validation dataset were obtained, respec-tively. Because the methods of LSTM and ReducedLSTM did not use the spatial relationship, weshuffle our data on the locational dimension. For better precision, we chose the data points logged atmonitor station in the HuaBei area and got 91120(for every matrix we got 134 stations) samples fortraining and 26800 samples for validation. The test dataset was set from October 5, 2015, to January3, 2016.
