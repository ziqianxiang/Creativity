Figure 1: An overview of our synthesizer. The synthesizer is an RNN, which generates the programin an autoregressive fashion.
Figure 2: In the following figure we step through a BF program that reverses a given list. The targetlist is loaded into the input buffer, and the programs output will be written to the output buffer. Eachrow depicts the state of the program and memory before executing that step. Purple indicates thatsome action will be taken when the current step is executed. We skip some steps which are easy toinfer. Vertical ellipses indicate the continuation of a loop until its completion.
