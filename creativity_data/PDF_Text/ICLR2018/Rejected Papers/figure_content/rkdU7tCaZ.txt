Figure 1: Illustration of dynamic evaluation. The model evaluates the probability of sequencesegments s%. The gradient VL(Si) with respect to the log probability of Si is used to update the modelparameters θli-1 to θli before the model progresses to the next sequence segment. Dashed edges arewhat distinguish dynamic evaluation from static (normal) evaluation.
Figure 2: Average losses in bits/char of dynamic evaluation and static evaluation plotted againstnumber of characters processed; on sequences from the Hutter Prize test set (left) and EuropeanParliament dataset in Spanish (right), averaged over 500 trials for each. Losses at each data point areaveraged over sequence segments of length 100, and are not cumulative. Note the different y-axisscales in the two plots.
