Figure 1: The first line shows original and correctly classified MNIST test data images. In thesecond line are the corresponding adversarial BIM attacks on a single classifier ( = 0.2, α = 0.025,n = 8) which predicts (from left to right): 6, 8, 1, 5, 9, 3, 0, 2, 2, and 4. Analogously, the third linecorresponds to correctly predicted examples of the CIFAR-10 test data set. In the bottom line are thecorresponding adversarial BIM attacks on a single classifier ( = 0.02, α = 0.0025, n = 8) whichpredicts (from left to right): deer, cat, deer, ship, bird, deer, deer, frog, automobile, and automobile.
Figure 2: Visual comparisons of the accuracies presented in Table 2. Compared are the MNIST (toprow) and CIFAR-10 (bottom row) data sets on the FGSM (left column) and the BIM (right column)attacks. Grad. 1 Single refers to attacks based on Grad. 1 on single classifiers, Grad. 1 Ensemblerefers to attacks based on Grad. 1 on ensembles, Grad. 2 Ensemble refers to attacks based on Grad. 2on ensemble classifiers, No Attack Single refers to single classifier on unperturbed data, and finallyNo Attack Ensemble refers to ensemble classifiers on unperturbed data.
