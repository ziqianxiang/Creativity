Figure 1: Example input images from the Vi-sual Arithmetic tasks. Top: Input imagesfor any of the 4 Single Operation tasks (Sum,Prod, Max, Min). Correct answer depends onwhat task they are being used in. For example,when solving the Sum task, correct answersfrom left to right are: 13, 21, 18, 16. Bottom:Combined task, correct answers from left toright are: 2, 5, 27, 10.
