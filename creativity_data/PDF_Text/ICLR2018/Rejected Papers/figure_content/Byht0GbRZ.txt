Figure 1: Example span alignments of a sentence pair, where different colors indicate matchingspans. Note that some spans overlap, which cannot happen in a single tree; our model considers allpossible span comparisons, weighted by the spans, marginal likelihood.
Figure 2: CKY charts showing marginalized span probabilities for two sentences in the SNLI testset. Each cell uses depth of the color to represent the probability of the span from the i-th word tothe j -th word forming a proper constituent. Both trees capture the correct linguistic structure of thesentence.
