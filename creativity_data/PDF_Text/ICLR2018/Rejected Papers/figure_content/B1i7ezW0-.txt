Figure 1: Reconstruction of the studied DNN models for Resnet2-32 test set samples. The columnsfrom left to right correspond to: the original image, mean-pooling reconstruction, max-poolingreconstruction, inhibitor connections.
Figure 2: Top: Accuracy for Bird10 baseline (α = 1, β = 0), versus regularized networks. BottomLeft: Learning curves of the baseline model. Bottom Right: Learning curve of the best test (α = 0.7,β = 0.3).
Figure 3: Reconstruction of the studied DNN models, from top to right : LargeUCNN (α = 0.5, β =0.5), SmallUCNN (0.6,0.5), Resnet2-32 (0.3,0.5), Resnet3-16 (0.6,0.5) on the same test set samples.
