Figure 1: The overview of proposed DTC. The input signal is encoded into a latent space by a con-volutional autoencoder followed by a BI-LSTM, as described in the Section 3.1. The convolutionalautoencoder and the BI-LSTM constitute a temporal autoencoder (TAE). The latent representationof the BI-LSTM is then fed to a temporal clustering layer (Section 3.2), generating the cluster as-signments. The dashed lines indicate the heatmap generating network (Section 3.4).

Figure 3: Localization of the event by the heatmap. The top panel in each column represents theinput time series, where examples with one event (left panel), two events (center panel), and non-event (right panel) are shown. The events have a bipolar signature. DTC network learns to separatesequences containing events from non-event sequences unsupervised. The bottom panels show thecorresponding heatmaps. Higher value in a heatmap corresponds to higher likelihood of event local-ization. The heatmap is found to correctly mark the time location of events. In the case of non-event(right panels), the heatmap amplitude is low as expected.
Figure 4: Performance of our algorithm compared to the baseline metrics. The mean ROC and standard errorbars are shown.
