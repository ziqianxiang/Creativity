Figure 1: Example binary tree for ( a + b ) * c.
Figure 2: This is an explicit example of the neural tree transducer model (NTT) binary tree for ( a+ b ) * c. xp are the random variables, and hp are the hidden states. p corresponds to the derivationnumber, so x2 is the second generated random variable, who’s realization is the symbol +. Theset LS5 = {x2, x3, x4}, and P5 = {x1} The hidden state h5 is a function of the encoded left subtreehLS5 = H(LS5)) , h2 and the parent hidden state, hP= h1. The reader should note that the predictedPr(x2 | x1) = g(x2 = + | h2), while Pr(x5 | x1,x2,x3,x4) = g(x5 = c | h2,hLS5),so the difference inthe prediction of x2 and x5 is due to the dependence on the left sibling subtree. Finally, h1 = enc(S )where S is the source tree to be transduced.
Figure 3: a) Simple relabeling example where 1 → a, 2 → b, and so on. b) subtree reordering wherenodes labeled 4 and 5 swap. c) full reordering of subtree where left and right subtrees of the rootnode swap, and d) subtree deletion where the subtree of node 2 is replaced be the node labelled 6.
