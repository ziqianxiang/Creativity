Figure 1: Two-layer graph convolutional networks, and the receptive field of a single vertex.
Figure 2:	Comparison of training loss with respect to number of epochs without dropout. TheCV+PP curve overlaps with the Exact curve in the first four datasets.
Figure 3:	Comparison of validation accuracy with respect to number of epochs. NS converges to0.94 on the Reddit dataset and 0.6 on the PPI dataset.
Figure 4: Comparison of the accuracyof different testing algorithms. The y-axis is Micro-F1 for PPI and accuracyotherwise.
Figure 5: Bias and standard deviation of the gradient for different algorithms during training.
Figure 6: Comparison of validation accuracy with respect to number of epochs for 3-layer GCNs.
Figure 7: Average feature and neighbor correlations in a 10-layer GCN.
