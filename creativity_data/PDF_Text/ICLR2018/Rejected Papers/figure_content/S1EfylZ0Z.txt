Figure 1: An illustration of ADGAN. In this example, ones from MNIST are considered normal.
Figure 2: ROC curves for one-versus-all prediction of competing methods, averaged over all classes.
Figure 3: Starting from the top left, the first three rows show samples contained in the LSUNbedrooms validation set which, according to ADGAN, are the most anomalous (have the highestanomaly score). Again starting from the top left corner, the bottom rows contain images deemednormal (have the lowest score).
Figure 4: Scenes from LSUN showing conference rooms ranked by ADGAN. The top rows containanomalous samples, the bottom rows scenes categorized as normal.
Figure 5: Additional scenes from LSUN that show images of bridges. The first rows show anoma-lous samples, the lower rows those deemed normal.
Figure 6: Images of churches, taken from LSUN. The first three rows show samples with highanomaly scores, the last three rows samples with a low score.
Figure 7: Scenes from LSUN that show restaurants. The first rows contain samples with highanomaly scores, the last rows those with low scores.
Figure 8: Each three rows, samples from a different class in the CIFAR-10 test set are shown. On theleft, images deemed anomalous by ADGAN. The right column holds images considered canonical.
