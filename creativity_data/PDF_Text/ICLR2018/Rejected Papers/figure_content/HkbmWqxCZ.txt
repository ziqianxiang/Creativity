Figure 1: The mutual autoencoder maximizes the likelihood log pθ (x) while constraining modelfamily P by ensuring that the latent variable z and the observables x share a desired mutual infor-mation M = Ipm. The purple lines denote level sets of the likelihood Eχ [logpθ (x)].
Figure 2: The mutual autoencoder learns codes ranging from independent to deterministic.
Figure 3: Reconstruction ability grows with M .
