Figure 3: Top-1 validation error on CIFAR-10. With appropriate hyperparameters, using partialpushing and partial pulling, the algorithms can still have low validation error and converge faster atthe same timefactor of 0.1 at the 30th and 60th epochs. We also use a weight decay of 0.0001 and momentum of0.9. We use top-1 validation error to measure the performance.
Figure 4: Top-1 validation error on CIFAR-10 with Simulated Delay. Compared to the naivesynchronous SGD, training time can be reduced by nearly 17% using partial pushing, and reduced bynearly 30% using partial pushing and partial pulling.
