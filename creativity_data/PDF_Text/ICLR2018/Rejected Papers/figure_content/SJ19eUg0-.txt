Figure 1: Performance comparison for a deep feedforward autoencoder on MNIST. The early epochsof Adam have reconstruction error greater than 10, while all models are run until the test errorincreases or for 1000 epochs.
Figure 2: Performance comparison for a 3-layer stacked LSTM on the sequential MNIST (7 Ã— 7)classification task. The early epochs of Adam have loss greater than 2, while all models are run untilthe test accuracy decreases or for 1000 epochs.
Figure 3: Performance comparison for a simplified residual CNN on the CIFAR-10 image classifica-tion task. The early epochs of Adam have loss greater than 1.5, while all models are run until the testaccuracy decreases or for 1000 epochs.
