Figure 1:	The point (a) where our CarliniWagnerShell makes a wrong prediction, and is consistenton the original test point and the perturbed one. We show the original image (a), CarliniWagnerShellperturbation of the image (b), and for comparison, a frog image (c) that the model is confident about.
Figure 2:	The images (a) and (e) are the points where our CarliniWagnerShell makes a wrongprediction. We show the original image on the first column, CarliniWagnerShell perturbations ofthe original images on the second column, adversarial perturbed images on the third column, andCarliniWagnerShell perturbations of the adversarial examples on the fourth column. Example shipimages are presented on the last row for comparison.
