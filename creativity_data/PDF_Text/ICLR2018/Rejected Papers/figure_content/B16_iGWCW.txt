Figure 1: The relation between λεt and λεt(1 - λεt). The domain with respect to λ is 2 < λ < 2^,so εt < λεt < 1 (yellow shaded region).
Figure 2: The comparison of class AP(average precision) on MNIST with MLP. The x-axis (classID) is sorted according to the test APs (average pricision) per class in the weak learner #1.
Figure 3: Comparison of lambda selection on CIFAR-100 datsets with ResNet56 model. Class IDsare sorted w.r.t the class APs of iteration #1. Top 1 errors (left plot) are generated on test datasets.
Figure 4: The change of validation APs from the classes with low APs in the iteration # 1 forResNet56 (left) and DenseNet-BC(k=12) (right) on CIFAR-100. APs are all calculated from valida-tion sets which would be used for the update of weights in the proceeding iteration. Class IDs aresorted by the APs of weak learner #1 and selected for those with small class IDs.
