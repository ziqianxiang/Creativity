Figure 1: Summary of main results in the LQG setting. The population optimal GAN solutionis PCA when the discriminator is unconstrained and when the discriminator is constrained to bequadratic. But the convergence to the population optimal is exponentially faster under a quadraticconstraint on the discriminator.
Figure 3: Generalization errors of constrained quadratic GAN (ML) and WGAN under the LQGsetup.
Figure 4: The GAN architecture that achieves maximum likelihood estimation for the zero-meanGaussian model: a linear generator and a quadratic discriminator. On the training data, the generatorminimizes over G and the adversary maximizes over A.
