Figure 2: Test set MSE for each machine on the adding problem with sequence lengths of T = 200(top), T = 400 (middle), and T = 750 (bottom).
Figure 3: Test accuracy for unpermuted and permuted MNIST over time. All scoRNN models andonly the best performing models for each other architectures are shown.
