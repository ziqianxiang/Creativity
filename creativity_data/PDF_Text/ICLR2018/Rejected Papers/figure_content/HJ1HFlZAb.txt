Figure 1: Representation of test accuracy when τ increases on fashion-MNIST (MNIST in appendix)with different amounts of training data.
Figure 2: Representation of the data augmentation capacity of each generative models. For eachnumber of training example we show the maximum accuracy a generative model can achieve bytuning τ . We also show results when tuning hyper-parameter for data augmentation method.
Figure 3: This figure presents samples from VAEs when trained with different amounts of data.
Figure 4: Relative accuracy improvement between the baseline trained on original data and theaccuracy with generated or noise data augmentation in training. τ is the ratio between the numberof generated data and the total number of data used for training.
Figure 5: Test accuracy on each model for different values of τ and different amounts of trainingdata.
Figure 6: Test accuracy when τ increases with different amounts of training data on MNIST.
