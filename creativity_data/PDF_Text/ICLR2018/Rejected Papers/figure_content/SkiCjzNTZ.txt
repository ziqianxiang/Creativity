Figure 1: The characteristics of the loss rate with spontaneous symmetry breaking. The dashed linecorresponds to the symmetric phase, while the solid line corresponds to the broken phase. Only atw = 0 the reflection symmetry w(Q) = ±w is respected. Here, w = σ.
Figure 2: The loss after spontaneous symmetry breaking from othogonal group O(3) to O(2). Thesymmetry transformations of O(2), which are 1-D rotations, form the degenerate minima.
