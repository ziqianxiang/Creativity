Figure 1: Comparison between complete dot product (CDP) and incomplete dot product (IDP) wherex% DP implies only x% of filters are used to compute the corresponding output channel. Since onlyx% filters are unused, the resulting output is an approximation of the output under CDP.

Figure 3: Performance comparisons by a MLP model over the MNIST datasetTESLA versus original IDP. We compare TESLA and the original IDP design under various pro-files. Figure 3(a) shows that at 20% DP, the original IDP achieves 80%, 63% and 55% accuracyfor the harmonic, all-one, and linear profiles respectively but TESLA keeps at least 88% accuracyfor all profiles at 20% DP and reaches average accuracy of 94.7% using the linear profile. Mostimportantly, compared to the original IDP, TESLA performs only about 1% worse in accuracy at100% DP but gains a significant improvement from 50% to 90% in accuracy at 10% DP, which isan acceptable trade-off under practical applications.
