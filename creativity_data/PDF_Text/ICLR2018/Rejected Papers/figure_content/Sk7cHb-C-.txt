Figure 1: Left, the general diagram of the architecture, where a prior of Zt+1 is generated from thecurrent state through the transition model At generated from St (dynamics level). The predictedobservation is denoted as P (Xt+1 |Zt+1) (observation level). Right, the prediction process and theupdate of Z and S from prediction error.
Figure 2: Left, the general description of the update process, where a prediction is generated and themeasured error is used to update Zt . On the right, the same process is unrolled in time as a recurrentnetwork.
Figure 3: Two sets of examples comparing the results achieved with our method and with the VAE.
Figure 4: The values of μst over time and alignd frames depicting the corresponding actions.
Figure 5: The values of μst over time and the actions given as the ground truth rescaled to fit in thesame graph.
