Figure 1: Nodes a and b have similar local structural roles even though they are distant in the graph.
Figure 2: Barbell graph. The graph has 8 distinct classes of structurally equivalent nodes as indicatedby color (A). 2D PCA projection of structural signatures as learned by RolX (B), struc2vec (C) andGRAPHWAVE (D). Projections in B-D contain the same number of points as there are nodes in thebarbell graph. Identical signatures have identical projections, resulting in overlapping points in B-D.
Figure 3: A cycle graph with attached “house” shapes (A). 2D PCA projection of GRAPHWAVE’sstructural signatures. The representation of structurally equivalent nodes overlap, and GraphWaveperfectly recovers the 6 different node types (B). Empirical characteristic function for the distributionof the wavelet coefficients (C). Color of a node/curve indicates structural role.
