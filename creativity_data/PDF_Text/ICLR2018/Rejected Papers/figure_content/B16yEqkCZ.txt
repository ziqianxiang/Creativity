Figure 1: In experiments, we consider two toy environments (a,b) and the Atari games Seaquest (c),Asteroids (d), and Freeway (e)state st, T(st+1 ∣st, at) gives successor state st+1 - st + .01 ∙ at + η where η 〜 N(0, .012). Thereward at each turn is equal to st (proportional to height). The player falls off the hill, entering thecatastrophic terminating state, whenever st+1 > 1.0 or st+1 < 0.0.
Figure 2: Catastrophes and reward/episode for DQNs and Intrinsic Fear. On Adventure Seeker, allIntrinsic Fear models cease to “die” within 14 runs, giving unbounded (unplottable) reward thereafter.
