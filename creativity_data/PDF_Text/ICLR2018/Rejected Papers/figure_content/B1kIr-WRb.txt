Figure 1: Word classification task performance vs. % training data8Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2018At this task, we notice that when 100% of the training data is presented, SGNS outperforms all otherembeddings at this task. Since this task is a measure of quality of syntactic information encodedin an embedding, these results are an indication that perhaps SGNS encodes the most amount ofsyntactic information of all the embeddings presented here.
