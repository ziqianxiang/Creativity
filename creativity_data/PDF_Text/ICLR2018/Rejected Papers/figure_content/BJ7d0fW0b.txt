Figure 1: High level view of our agent. Our agent has two key components, a sub-goal extractorand an action value estimator. The sub-goal extractor provides sub-goals and guidance rewards tothe action value estimator and the action value estimator learns a sub-goal conditioned action valueestimator to interact with the environment.
