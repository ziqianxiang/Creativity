Figure 1: Answering a table question by synthesizing a query and executing it on the provided table.
Figure 2: Model overview for the example in Figure 1. The model encodes table columns as well asthe user question with a bidirectional LSTM and then decodes the hidden state with a typed LSTM,where the decoding action for each cell is statically determined.
Figure 3: Ablation test results showing the syntax accuracy (on the filtered dev set) for each setting.
