Figure 1: Generic feature representation hi of vertex i on a graph RNN (a) and a graph convNet (b).
Figure 2: Graph learning tasks.
Figure 3:	Subgraph matching: First row studies shallow networks w.r.t. noise. Second row investi-gates multilayer graph networks. Third row reports graph architectures w.r.t. budget.
Figure 4:	Influence of hyper-parameter T on RNN architectures. Left figure is for graph matching,middle figure for semi-supervised clustering, and right figure are the batch time for the clusteringtask (same trend for matching).
Figure 5: Semi-supervised clustering: First row reports shallow networks w.r.t. noise q. Second rowshows multilayer graph networks w.r.t. L. Third row is about graph architectures w.r.t. budget B.
Figure 6: Learning speed of RNN and ConvNet architectures. Left figure is for graph matching andright figure semi-supervised clustering.
