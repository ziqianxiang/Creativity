Figure 1: Workflow for the incorporation of affect information into the process of learning wordembeddings.
Figure 2: t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) visualizations of a subset of En-glish words and their normalized valence scores. Incorporating valence information in word vectorsseparates the positive valence words from the negatives.
