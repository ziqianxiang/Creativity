Figure 1: Medical time series to concept annotations.
Figure 2: Ground truth and predicted concept annotation comparison. In 2(a) white block corresponds toabsence of a concept and black block corresponds to presence of a concept. In 2(b), darker gray value indicateshigher chance for presence of a concept. X-axis represents time steps, Y-axis corresponds to different patients.
