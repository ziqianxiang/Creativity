Figure 3: Actual vs Predicted PricePlates are grouped by their predicted priceand actual price, in bins of HK$1,000($128.2). The size of the circle represent thenumber of plates in a given bin.
Figure 4:	Performance FluctuationsThe histogram represents the best model’s test RMSEdistribution. The red line is the kernel density estimateof the distribution. The two vertical lines indicate thevalidation RMSE of the comparison models.
Figure 5:	Impact of Retraining Frequency5.4 Model StabilityUnlike hedonic regressions, which give the same predictions and achieve the same performance inevery run, a neural network is susceptible to fluctuations due to convergence to local maxima. Thesefluctuations can be smoothed out by combining the predictions of multiple runs of the same model,although the number of runs necessary to achieve good results is then a practical concern.
Figure 6: Estimated Density at Selected Predicted PricesBars and line represent the distribution of realized prices and the estimated density from the Mixture DensityNetwork respectively.
