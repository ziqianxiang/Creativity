Figure 1: A cat-and-mouse game of FGSM attacks and adversarial training for MNIST. The upperred points are the error rates after adversarial training, and the lower green points are the error ratesafter FGSM attack (η = 0.3). After 160 iterations, the error rate is still oscillating between 0 and0.5.

Figure 5: Cat and mouse game of FGSM attacks and adversarial training for CIFAR-10. The uppergreen points are the error rates after adversarial training, and the lower orange points are the errorrates after FGSM attack. After 160 iterations (η = 0.3), the error rate is still oscillating.
