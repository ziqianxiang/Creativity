Figure 1: The average output signal of the stochastic ASN (left) as a function of its incoming PSC I,where the error bars indicate the standard deviation of the spiking simulation, and the correspondingAAN curve. The shape of the ASN curve is well described by the AAN activation function, Equation6. The ASN firing rate (Hz) for different values of input signal (right).
Figure 2: An overview of the construction of an Adaptive Analog LSTM (left) and an AdaptiveSpiking LSTM cell. This compares to an LSTM with only an input gate.
Figure 3: A simulation to illustrate how the analog CEC integrates its input signal with the samespeed as an ASN with t§ = ∞ provided that the input signal does not change and that 1 analog timestep corresponds to ∆t = 200ms (middle). In the right panel, the spiking output signal approximatesthe analog output, in particular for high values of current.
Figure 5: The Q-Values of the analog (left) and spiking (right) network for the noisy T-Maze task. Inthe last 200ms it correctly selects the right action (blue line).
Figure 4: The output values of the analog (left) and spiking (right) network for the noise-free SequencePrediction task. Only the last 6 input symbols of the series are shown. The last symbol y (brown) iscorrectly predicted either in the last time step (analog) and in the last 200ms (spiking).
Figure 6: The values of the analog CECS and spiking CECS for the noise-free Sequence Prediction(left, only one CEC cell was used) and noise-free T-maze (right, three CEC cells were used) tasks.
