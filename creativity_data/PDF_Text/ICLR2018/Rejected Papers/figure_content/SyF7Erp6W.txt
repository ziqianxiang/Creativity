Figure 2: Image processing on BreakoutFigure 3: Scores for BreakoutResults7 are presented in table 2 for a training time of 10 000 frames (less than 3 minutes), whichis 20 000 times less frames than the average training standard reported in Mnih et al. (2015). Whilethe DQN achieves better results with millions of training frames, our AI reaches decent scores withcomparatively much fewer frames, as plotted for Breakout on figure 3.
