Figure 1: Architecture for predicting out-comes under design shift. A re-weightingfunction w is fit jointly with a representa-tion Φ and hypothesis h of the potential out-comes, to minimize a bound on the targetrisk. Dashed lines are not back-propagatedthrough. Regularization penalties not shown.

Figure 3: Error in CATE estimation on IHDP as a function of re-weighting regularization strengthλw (left) and source prediction error (right). We see in the left-hand plot that a) for small imbalancepenalties α, re-weighting (low λw) has no effect, b) for moderate α, less uniform re-weighting(smaller λw) improves the error, c) for large α, weighting helps, but overall error increases. In theright-hand plot, we compare the ratio of CATE error to source error. Color represents α (see left)and size λw. We see that for large α, the source error is more representative of CATE error, but doesnot improve in absolute value without weighting. Here, α was fixed. Best viewed in color.
