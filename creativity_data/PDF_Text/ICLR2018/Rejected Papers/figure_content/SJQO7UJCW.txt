Figure 1: Overview of the proposed system for semi-supervised semantic segmentation. With afully-convolution discriminator network trained using the loss LD, we optimize the segmentationnetwrok using three loss functions during the training process: cross-entropy loss Lce, adversarialloss Ladv , and semi-supervised loss Lsemi .

Figure 3: Visualization of the confidence maps. Given the probability maps generated by thesegmentation network, the confidence maps is then obtained from the discriminator. In the confidencemaps, the brighter regions indicate that they are close to the ground truth distribution.
