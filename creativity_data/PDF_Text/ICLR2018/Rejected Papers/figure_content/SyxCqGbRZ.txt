Figure 1: For the 1388 patients in the test set We show the expected returns as computed by SARSA,against 30-day mortality among patients with similar Q-values. Our model appears to be well cali-brated, as higher returns are associated with lower mortality.
Figure 2: Comparison of physician actions with the actions that would have been taken by theMGP-DRQN policy, with actions separated according to the 3 types of treatments considered.
Figure 3: Empirical mortality rates as a function of how much the MGP-DRQN policy's actionsdiffered from the observed physician actions. Minimal mortality is observed for all 3 treatmenttypes at 0, where the physicians and MGP-DRQN agreed.
Figure 4: Top: clinical data from a patient who acquired sepsis, decompensated in the IntensiveCare Unit while progressing to septic shock, and ultimately did not survive. Bottom: shaded sym-bols denote treatments that the learned MGP-DRQN policy would have recommended, while opensymbols denote the treatment actions actually taken by physicians caring for this patient.
