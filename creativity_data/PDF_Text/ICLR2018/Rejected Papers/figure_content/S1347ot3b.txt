Figure 1: Distribution of cosine similarity scores between each sentence vector and their corre-sponding document vector, for all four vector functions.
Figure 2: Cosine Similarity to the Document Vector for non-optimal (blue) and optimal (green)sentences. Figure on the right shows Cosine Similarity adjusted for sentence word count.
Figure 3: Correlation of ROUGE scores and Cosine Similarity scores per sentence. ROUGE scorestransformed with r0 = log(1 + r), to account for zero values. Some high-leverage points have beenexcluded for Paragraph Vectors and Skipthought.
