Figure 1: Output of GANs trained on data sampled according to T (x)P(x). Simulation plots PDFsare computed using NumPyâ€™s random normal sampler, mixed to create the appropriate mode ratios.
Figure 2: Data used to train the GANs, and simulations from GANs trained using unweighted andweighted MMD.
Figure 3: Proportion of images classified as ones, over time, for a network initially learned using thestandard MMD estimator. The loss function switches to the weighted MMD estimator at iteration10000, leading to an increase in the proportion of images classified as ones.
