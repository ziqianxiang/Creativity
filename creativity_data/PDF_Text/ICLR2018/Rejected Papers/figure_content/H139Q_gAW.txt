Figure 2: How to construct subsampled CIFAR datasets: (a) is an example image from CIFARdataset. (b) is the subsampled pixels map. The blue points indicate which points are sampled. (c) isthe image after sampling, where the black points are those being sampled out.
Figure 3: Inception ModuleA.2 Implementation Details of Time Series PredictionFirstly, we will give the formal definition of the time series forecasting, that is, spatiotemporalregression problem. We formulate the the spatiotemporal regression problem as a multivariate timeseries forecasting task with the sensors’ location as the input. More formally, given a series oftime series signals observed from sensors Y = {y1, y2, ∙ ∙ ∙ , yτ} where yt ∈ Rn and n are thenumber of sensors, and the locations of sensors L = {l1, l2, ∙ ∙ ∙ , ln} where li ∈ R2 and indicatesthe coordinate of the sensor, the task is to predict a series of future signals in a rolling forecastingfashion. That being said, to predict yT+h where h is the desirable horizon ahead of the current timestamp T, we assume {y1 , y2, ∙ ∙ ∙ , yT} are available. Likewise, to predict the signal of the nexttime stamp yT+h+1, we assume {y1, y2, ∙ ∙ ∙ , yT, yT+1} are available. In this paper, we follow thesetting of the autoregressive model. Define a window size p which is a hyper-parameter firstly. Themodel input at time stamp T is XT = {yT-p+1, ∙ ∙ ∙ , yT} ∈ Rn×p. In the experiments of thispaper, the horizon is always set as 1.
