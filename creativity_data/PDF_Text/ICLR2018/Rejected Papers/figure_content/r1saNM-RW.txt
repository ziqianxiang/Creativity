Figure 1: The relative error of query evaluations with respect uniform and coreset subsamples forthe 4 data sets.
Figure 2: The relative error of query evaluations with respect to coreset running time and Pegasosrunning time for the 4 data sets.
Figure 3: The estimator variance of query evaluations. We note that due to the use of a judicioussampling distribution based on the points’ sensitivities, the variance of our coreset estimator is lowerthan that of uniform sampling for all data sets.
