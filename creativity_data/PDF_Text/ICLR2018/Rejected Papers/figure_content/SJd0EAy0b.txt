Figure 1: GEN: A Graph Embedding Model3	Approach and Model ArchitectureMost of the prevalent semantic knowledge databases are built upon the Resource Description Frame-work (RDF) , in which the facts are represented and stored in the form of SPO (Subject, Predicate,Object) triples. Following the convention, we will use the symbol (h, r, t) to represent a unit of facts,in which h, r and t denote the head entity, the relation, and the tail entity, respectively.
