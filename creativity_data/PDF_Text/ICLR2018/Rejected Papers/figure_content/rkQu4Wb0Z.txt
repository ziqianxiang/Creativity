Figure 1: Histogram ofa sample nueronâ€™s activation values over test dataset. The sample was chosenfrom h5 . Compared to baseline, cw-VR clearly shows non-overlapping distributions for differentlabels. L1-rep shows a similar distribution shape as in the baseline, but only a single label is activatedin this example. Best viewed in color.
Figure 2: Scatter plot of activation values of randomly chosen two units from h5 . Compared tobaseline, CR has clearly less correlation indicating less co-adaptation. cw-CR also shows low co-adaptation, but it has smaller ball shapes per label because of the low class-wise variance. Bestviewed in color.
Figure 3: Histograms of activation values for 10 regularizers. Best viewed in color.
