Figure 1: Decision tree learned by C+VAEon the MNIST dataset. Each internal node indicateswhich of the 50 latent dimensions is tested. The bottom line of each node is the number of generatedinstances of each class that fell to that node. The majority class of each leaf is printed next to thatleaf.
Figure 2: Varying dimension 21, other dimensions set to μ6 (top) and μ4 (bottom). From left to right,green indicates pixels Which are fading, While magenta indicates pixels that are intensifying.
Figure 3: Varying dimension 21, other dimensions set to mean of class means.
Figure 4: Varying dimension0, other dimensions set tomean of class means.
Figure 5:	Varying dimension26, other dimensions set tomean of class means.
Figure 6:	Varying dimension45, other dimensions set tomean of class means.
Figure 7: Sample MNIST digits generated by C+VAE. Each set of digits is generated from one classprior, but the mixture may be sampled from with one extra step.
