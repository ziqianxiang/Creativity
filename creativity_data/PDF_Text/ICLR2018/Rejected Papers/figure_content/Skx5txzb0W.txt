Figure 1: (a) & (b) Distribution of test accuracies of 74 instances of Resnet evaluated on CIFAR100, 370 instances of the ASReader model with fixed hyperparameters and 197 with random hyperparameters trained and evaluated on CBT CommonNouns. (c) Relationship between the test and validation accuracies of the AS Reader for random hyperparameter search andfor fixed hyperparameters.
Figure 2: Averages and 95% confidence intervals of test performance for three ways of aggregating results of multipleexperiments for various numbers of experiments run. Each confidence interval was constructed using smoothed11 Bootstrapsampling from our pool of 75 for Resnet and 197 experiments for the AS Reader with fixed and random hyperparametersrespectively. Since we strongly encourage researchers to provide confidence intervals for their results, we provide andoverview of how to construct them using the Bootstrap in Appendix D.1.
Figure 3: Empirical comparison of the variances of the non-parametric and Gaussian parametric Boon estimators. The datacome from experiments with the AS Reader on CBT with fixed hyperparameters.
