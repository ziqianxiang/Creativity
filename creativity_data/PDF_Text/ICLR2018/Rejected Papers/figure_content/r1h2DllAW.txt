Figure 1: (a) Overview of real-valued vs. discrete-valued NNs and Bayesian vs. non-Bayesian NNs.
Figure 2: (a) Example discretized GaUSSian with mw = 0.3 and √∕VW = 0.3. The red bars showthe unnormalized probabilities of the corresponding weight values. (b) Classification errors (CE) ofBayesian averaging over several NN samples W 〜q(W). The CES of the probabilistic forwardpass (PfP) are shown as horizontal lines. (c) Test CE of Bayesian averaging using NN samples W 〜q(W) and averaging using the greedy forward selection strategy. (d) Histogram over activations ofthe same model once trained with dropout and once trained without dropout.
