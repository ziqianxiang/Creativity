Figure 1: Schematic of error plots, phase diagrams, and the process of adding noise to input data andthen adjusting algorithm knobs for our new VSDL model of classification in DNN learning models.
Figure 2: Learning curves for classification problems, using three types of network architectures, allexhibiting qualitatively similar continuous-then-discontinuous generalization behavior.
