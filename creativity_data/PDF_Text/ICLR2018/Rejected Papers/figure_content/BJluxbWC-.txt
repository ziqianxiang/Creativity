Figure 1: Overall framework: Open Classification Network (OCN), Pairwise Classification Network(PCN) and auto-encoder are on the left and a hierarchical clustering process is on the right. The left 3components are jointly trained. Data in red color and blue color are training data and testing datarespectively. Rejected images are testing data that are rejected by OCN as unseen class examples andthen rejected image pairs are fed into PCN to compute distances for hierarchical clustering.
