Figure 1: General overview of our privacy-preserving method for deep learning. Encrypted inputsare fed into our hybrid model on the server-side, and this produces encrypted outputs.
Figure 2: Simplified example of FHE.
Figure 3: More detailed example of FHE. After performing FHE operations, ciphertexts may bebootstrapped, so that they can be used for subsequent operations. However this operation is costly.
Figure 4: Output of various logic gates, along with equivalent gates where one input is unknown.
Figure 5: Typical half adder (left) and full adder (right).
Figure 6: The four core components of the Hybrid Full Adder.
Figure 7: N-bit adder optimized to reduce the number of gates needed, and a hybrid variant.
Figure 8: Baugh-Wooley matrix. A chain of Hybrid Full Adders can handle this efficiently.
