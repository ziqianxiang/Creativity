Figure 1: Illustration of the proposed variational graph autoencoder in its conditional form. Startingfrom a discrete attributed graph G = (A, E, F) on n nodes (e.g. a representation of propyleneoxide), stochastic graph encoder qφ(z∣G) embeds the graph into continuous representation z. Givena point in the latent space, our novel graph decoder pθ (G|z) outputs a probabilistic fully-connectedgraph G = (A, E, F) on predefined k ≥ n nodes, from which discrete samples may be drawn. Theprocess can be conditioned on label y for controlled sampling at test time. Reconstruction ability ofthe autoencoder is facilitated by approximate graph matching for aligning G with G.
