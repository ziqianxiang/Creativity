Table 1: Error rates of ResNets with different depths on CIFAR 10. SGDM* indicates the resultsreported in He et al. (2015) with the same experimental setups as ours, where only ResNet-110 hasmultiple runs.
Table 2: Error rates of ResNets with different depths on CIFAR 100. Note that He et al. (2015) didnot run experiment on CIFAR 100.
