Table 1: Experimental results for the error rates (lower is better) and relative improvements over thevanilla GAN training without self-training (higher is better) for different counts of labelled data: 5,10 and 20 labelled examples per class for each of the first, second and third columns respectively.
Table 2: Experimental results for the error rates (lower is better) and relative improvements over thevanilla GAN for CIFAR-10 (higher is better) for a count of 400. All experiments averaged over 2different seeds and the mean is shown with the error bounds being one standard deviation.
