Table 1: Speedup of different specialized model cascades over ResNet-18 at the 99.5% and 99.7% accuracymark (baseline of ResNet-18 achieves accuracy of 99.8%).
Table 2: Specialized model performance on classification tasksWe also evaluated task-aware distillation using the Kaggle cat vs dog dataset (Elson et al. (2007)),containing 25,000 images (evenly split between cats and dogs), of which 1,000 were used as avalidation set. We repeated the same setup as above, except we used the Kaggle dog vs cat dataset forfine-tuning and testing, and we used a ResNet18 as the baseline because this model already achievedan accuracy of 99.8%. We show the speedups achieved in Table 1 at two accuracy levels: 99.5%and 99.7%. We can see that even when compared to a smaller model (ResNet18 vs ResNet152),specialized models can achieve up to a 5Ã— speedup with only a 0.1% loss in accuracy.
