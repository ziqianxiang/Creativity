Table 1: Comparison of test error rate(%) with boosted model on MNIST datasets.
Table 2: Single crop test error rate(%) along iterations with boosted models. * indicates updatingweights with λ = 0.7, while the others λ = 1. Blue indicates the use of pre-trained model fromTorchVision. () indicates top 5 error rate.
