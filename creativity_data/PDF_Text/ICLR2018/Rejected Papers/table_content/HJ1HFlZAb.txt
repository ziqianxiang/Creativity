Using generated samples as data augmentation in order to improve a discriminativemodel is a well known technique. However, assessing the quality of a generative model with adiscriminative model seems to have been less explored. As we have shown, this evaluation is mean-ingful to measure how well the generative model can sample data points that are probable under thetrue distribution we want to approximate. In this paper we applied this method on images samples.
