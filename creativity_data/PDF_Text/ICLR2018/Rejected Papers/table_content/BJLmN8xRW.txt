In the context of DGA detection, optimizing the trainingtime is of particular importance, as the models need to be retrained on a regular basis to stay currentwith respect to new, emerging malware.
Table 2: Results on test data from July 2017. Accuracy, TPR, FPR are w.r.t. a threshold that gives aFPR of 0.001 on the validation data.
Table 3: Examples of domain names that were either misclassified by the Random Forest or by thedeep neural networks. For the malicious domain names, the name of the malware family is shownbetween parentheses.
Table 4: Results on test data from December 2017. Accuracy, TPR, FPR are w.r.t. a threshold thatgives a FPR of 0.001 on the validation data.
Table 5: Comparison of complexity and efficiency of classifiers for DGA detection. The complexityrefers to the number of parameters that have to be learned in the deep learning architectures. Thetraining time is reported in terms of seconds needed for an epoch times the number of epochs. Thescoring time is the time in seconds needed to label 200K domain names by an already trained model.
