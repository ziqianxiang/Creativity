Table 1: Improvement of test likelihoods of environment models over a baseline model (standardvariational autoencoder, VAE), on 4 different ALE domains. Stochastic models with state uncer-tainty (RAR, sSSM) outperform models without uncertainty representation. Furthermore, state-space models (dSSM, sSSM) show a substantial speed-up over auto-regressive models. Results aregiven as mean ± standard deviation, in units of 10-3 ∙ nats ∙ pixel-1.
