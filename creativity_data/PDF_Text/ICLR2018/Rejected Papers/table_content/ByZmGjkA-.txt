Table 1: Agent hyperparameters that are fixed throughout our experimentation but otherwise notspecified in the text.
Table 2: Agent hyperparameters that randomly sampled in order to yield different replicas of ouragents for training. uniform(x, y) indicates that values are sampled uniformly from the range [x, y].
