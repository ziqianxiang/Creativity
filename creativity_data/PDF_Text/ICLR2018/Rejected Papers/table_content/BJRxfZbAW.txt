Table 1: Table showing classification accuracy (out of 100%) by digit and rotationpairs. We synthesize 250 samples of a given digit in a given rotation by generatingdata sets conditioned on each pair, as in Figure 3. The generated samples are thenadjusted to the correct orientation and classified by a pre-trained network.
