Table 1: Our model, CyCADA, may use pixel, feature, and semantic information during adaptationwhile learning an invertible mapping through cycle consistency.
Table 2: Unsupervised domain adaptation across digit datasets. Our model is competitive withor outperforms state-of-the-art models for each shift. For the difficult shift of SVHN to MNIST wealso note that feature space adaptation provides additional benefit beyond the pixel-only adaptation.
Table 3: Adaptation between GTA5 and Cityscapes, showing IoU for each class and mean IoU, freq-weighted IoU and pixel accuracy. CyCADA significantly outperforms baselines, nearly closing thegap to the target-trained oracle on pixel accuracy. *FCNS in the wild is by Hoffman et al. (2016). Wecompare our model using two base semantic segmentation architectures (A) VGG16-FCN8s (Longet al., 2015) base network and (B) DRN-26 (Yu et al., 2017).
Table 4: Adaptation between seasons in the SYNTHIA dataset. We report IoU for each class andmean IoU, freq-weighted IoU and pixel accuracy. Our CyCADA method achieves state-of-the-artperformance on average across all categories. *FCNs in the Wild is by Hoffman et al. (2016).
