Table 1: Performance on conditional and unconditional QM9 models evaluated by mean test-time reconstruction log-likelihood (logpθ(G∣z)), mean test-time evidence lower bound (ELBO),and decoding quality metrics (Section 4.2). Baselines CVAE (Gomez-Bombarelli et al., 2016) andGVAE(Kusner et al., 2017) are listed only for the embedding size with the highest Valid.
Table 2: Mean accuracy of matching ZINC graphs to their noisy counterparts in a synthetic bench-mark as a function of maximum graph size k .
Table 3: Performance on conditional and unconditional QM9 models with implicit node probabili-ties. Improvement with respect to Table 1 is emphasized in italics.
