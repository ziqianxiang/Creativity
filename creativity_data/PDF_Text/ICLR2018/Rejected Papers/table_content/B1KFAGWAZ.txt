As analyzed above, one key differencebetween our MS-MARL model and CommNet is that we explicitly facilitate an independent mas-ter agent reasoning with its own state and messages from all slave agents. From this plot, ourMS-MARL model clearly enjoys better, faster and more stable convergence, which highlights theimportance of such a design facilitating independent thinking.
