Table 1: Comparison on user data6	Discussions & ConclusionIn this paper we revisited the problem of posterior inference in Latent LSTM models as introducedin Zaheer et al. (2017). We generalized their model to accommodate a wide variety of state spacemodels and most importantly we provided a more principled Sequential Monte-Carlo (SMC) al-gorithm for posterior inference. Although the newly proposed inference method can be slower, weshowed over a variety of dataset that the new SMC based algorithm is far superior and more stable.
