Table 1: Summary of inception score statistics across 100 architecturesAlgorithm	Final score		Area under curve		QUaL score	Mean	Std	Mean	Std	TotalVanilla GAN	2.91	1.44	277.72	126.09	^9Î£5DRAGAN-	3.70	1.71	312.15	135.35	157.5WGAN-GP~~	3.49	1.30	300.09	100.96	-To demonstrate that our algorithm performs better compared to vanilla GAN training and WGAN-GP,we created 100 such instances of hard games. Each instance is trained using these algorithms onCIFAR-10 (under similar conditions for a fixed number of generator iterations, which gives a slightadvantage to WGAN-GP) and we plot how inception score changes over time. For each algorithm,we calculated the average of final inception scores and area under the curve (AUC) over all 100instances. The results are shown in Table 1. Notice that we beat the other algorithms in both metrics,which indicates some improvement in stability and modeling performance.
