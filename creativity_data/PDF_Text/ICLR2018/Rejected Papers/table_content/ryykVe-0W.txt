Table 1: Maximum correlation results on all tasks for the synthetic data. A ‘g’ in the suffix of themodel name indicates that a separate generator network was used instead of the resampling method.
Table 2: Maximum correlation results on all tasks for the audio data. A ‘g’ in the suffix of the modelname indicates that a separate generator network was used instead of the resampling method. Twoscores separated by a ‘/’ indicate that the first score was obtained using the model selection describedin Section 6.1 while the second score is simply the best score a posteriori. Parentheses refer containthe standard deviation of the scores multiplied with 10-4.
