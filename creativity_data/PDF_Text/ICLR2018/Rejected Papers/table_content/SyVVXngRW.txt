Table 1: Performance of the baselines and our asymmetric multi-task feature learning models. We report theRMSE for regression and mean classification error(%) for classification, along with the standard error for 95%confidence interval. Performance of AMTL on AWA-A is not available, since multi-label classification is notimplemented in provided codes.
Table 2: Average per-class error (%) of baseline deep networks and our deep asymmetric multi-task featurelearning models.
Table 3: Classification error(%) of the baselines and our model on the transfer learning task. Source networksdenote types of networks that is trained on the source dataset with 40 classes, and Target accuracy is the accuracyof the softmax classifier on 10 target classes trained on the representations obtained at the layer just below thesoftmax layer of the source network.
