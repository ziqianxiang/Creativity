Table 1: Existing generic data-based methods classified according to our taxonomy. Tablecolumns are described in Section 3.
Table 2: Existing domain-specific data-based methods classified according to our taxonomy.
Table 3: Methods based on network architecture, and rough description of assumptions thatthey encode. There are partial overlaps between some listed methods. For example, Residuallearning uses Skip-connections. Many noise-based methods also fit Table 1 (cf. Appendix A).
Table 4: Regularization terms, with dependencies marked by M. Methods that dependon ∂E∕∂x implicitly depend on targets t and thus can be considered part of the errorfunction (Section 5) rather than regularization term (Section 6).
