Table 1: Comparison of test accuracy of three Resnet models at epoch 100,000Furthermore, we plot the mean of the gradient variance, calculated for each feature across onebatch, as a function of the residual block index at epochs 1, 25,000 and 50,000 in Figs. 8, 9 and 10,respectively, where the performance of Resnet-99, Resnet-33 and Resnet-9 is compared. We observethat the gradient variance does not change much across a batch as it passes through the residualblocks present at the far end of a scale in Resnet-99. For Resnet-33, there are fewer resnet blocks atthe far end of a scale that stay dormant. We can also see clearly the gradient variance changes more8Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2018sharply during gradient backpropagation in resnet-9. Hence, the residual blocks present at the endof a scale have a slowly varying gradient passing through them in Resnet-99, compared to Resnet-33and Resnet-9. These figures show stronger learning performance of shallower but wider resnets.
