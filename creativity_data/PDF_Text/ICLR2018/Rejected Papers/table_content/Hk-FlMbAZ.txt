Table 1: Results from testing the goodness property of base models. Each batch has 30 randomsamples. For each column, we record the number of samples that we can successfully find attacksof confidence at least p = 0.9 against the model corresponding to the column.
Table 2: Summary of the experimental results. Among the 150 test points where the base model iscorrect. For 56 of them the base model is vulnerable to CW attacks. Applying CarliniWagnerShelldoes not introduce new vulnerable points. And for 53 of the 56 vulnerable points, CarliniWagner-Shell is both correct and robust against the attacks that are successful on the base model. For oneof the remaining three points, CarliniWagnerShell is incorrect but robust. For the remaining twoCarliniWagnerShell is both incorrect and not robust.
