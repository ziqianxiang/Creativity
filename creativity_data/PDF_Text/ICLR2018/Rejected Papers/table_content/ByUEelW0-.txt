Table 1: Performance comparison on the bAbI dataset. Values are % average accuracy on test setÂ±standard deviation taken from training each model 10 times. For each of the trained models thetest accuracy is taken for the epoch with the best validation accuracy (picked from epoch numbers1, 11, 21, 31, 40 since we only evaluated on the test set for those).
