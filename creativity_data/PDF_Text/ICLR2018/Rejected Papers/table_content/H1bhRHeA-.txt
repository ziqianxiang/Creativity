Table 1: Datasets with a summary of their properties. Where the number of classes, dimension ornumber of examples has been altered, the original value is displayed in brackets.
Table 2: Tuned initial learning rates for each algorithm on each dataset. The learning rate in100,±1,±2,±3 with the lowest log-loss after 50 epochs using only 10% of the data is displayed.
Table 3: Relative log-loss. The values for each dataset are normalized by dividing by the corre-sponding Implicit SGD log-loss. The lowest log-loss for each dataset is in bold.
