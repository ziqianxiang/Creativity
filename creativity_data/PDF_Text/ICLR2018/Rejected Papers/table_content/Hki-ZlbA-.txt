(2017). While these results naturally hold only for the networks we used and theinputs we tested, we believe they provide some intuition as to how well the tested attack and defensetechniques perform in general. We intend to make our data publicly available, and we encourageothers to (i) evaluate new attack techniques using the ground-truth examples we have already dis-covered; and (ii) use this approach for evaluating new defensive techniques.
