Table 1: Summary of the effects of using different possible loss term formulations. We find thatusing both of our proposed content and style loss formulations improves the example quality fromthe simple STFT architecture proposed in Ulyanov & Lebedev (2016) for many examples. The tablereferences specific song pairs for content and style in musical transfer examples found at the URLgiven previously.2Content	Style RepresentationsRepresentations	STFT	STFT + Mel (1 Layer, Many Channels)	STFT + Mel (1 Layer + 2 Residual Layers, Many Channels) + CQT (1 Layer + 3 Residual Layers, Many Channels)STFT	(1) Fastest, works well for examples where content and style are highly similar (See “Imperial March”/“Star SPangled Banner”)	(2) Works well on most examPles where key is aligned (See “Ghostbusters”/“Get Lucky” and “In Da Club”/“Africa”)	(3) Needed when very long-term musical information is considered (See “Bohemian RhaPsody”/“Scary Monsters and Nice SPrites”)Mel (1 Layer, Few Channels) & CQT (1 Layer, 2x1 Max Pooling)	(4) Works best for singing style transfer (e.g. to a caPella) (See “God Only Knows”/“Isn’t She Lovely”)	(5) Works well on almost all examPles, imProves some examPles from 2 (See “Love- shack”/“Psychosocial”)	(6) Works best for most difficult examPles, where 1-5 fail (See “S.O.S.”/“I Love It”)We notice that using Mel spectrogram representations for achieving a larger receptive field in timegreatly helps transfer style in certain cases where the long-term nature of the style audio is complex,and important to recognizing the nature of the musical style. Using both Mel and CQT representationsfor content greatly helps for cases where the nature of the content and style audio are very differentfrom each other, even in cases where the content and style are in the same key. The abstracted contentrepresentation is better able to re-implement content with the musical attributes of the style audiowithout simply laying 2 different sounding examples over each other. This increase in performanceis best displayed in examples of singing style transfer. Using a higher number of Mel channels andresidual blocks will give the behavior similar to a “mash-up” of 2 audio examples, where portionsof the style audio are placed over the content audio. Simply reducing the number of Mel channels
