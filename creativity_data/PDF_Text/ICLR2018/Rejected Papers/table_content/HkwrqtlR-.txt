Table 1: In (a), we use the Kernel Two-Sample Test with real images and samples drawn from thegenerator network. In (b), we use instead real images taken from two disjoint sets on the MNISTand CIFAR-10 test datasets.
Table 2: Top-30 most frequent passwords present on the dataset used to train PassGAN. The firstcolumn shows passwords from the RockYou training dataset; the second column reports the numberof occurrences of each password in the training dataset; the third column shows the correspondingfrequency; and the forth column illustrates the frequency estimated by the GAN.
Table 3: Top-30 most frequent passwords produced by PassGAN after generating 1010 samples. Thefirst column shows the passwords; the second column presents the number of occurrences of eachpassword generated by the GAN; the third column provides the frequency of each password; and thefourth colum shows the corresponding frequency of each password in the RockYou training dataset.
