Table 1: Results of binary optimization in max1 layer and max2 layer of MNIST classifier. For eachCoI (class of interest), optimization of unit selection was implemented three times. The holdingrates and number of units are recorded in tables above.
Table 2: Results of selecting units in max1 and max2 layers simultaneously. For the well-trainedMNSIT classifier, we selected units in the max1 layer and max2 layer at the same time. We listresults of experiments for three classes (0, 1, and 8) here.
