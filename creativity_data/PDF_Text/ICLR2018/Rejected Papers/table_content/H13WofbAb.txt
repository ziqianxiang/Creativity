Our implementation is based on MXNET (Chen et al., 2015). We run90 epochs for each experiment. The learning rate is set as 0.02 X è•Š,where d is the number ofresponding workers, n is the minibatch size of a single worker. The learning rate will decrease by a5Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2018Time (minutes)(b) Top-1 error vs. timeFigure 3: Top-1 validation error on CIFAR-10. With appropriate hyperparameters, using partialpushing and partial pulling, the algorithms can still have low validation error and converge faster atthe same timefactor of 0.1 at the 30th and 60th epochs. We also use a weight decay of 0.0001 and momentum of0.9. We use top-1 validation error to measure the performance.
