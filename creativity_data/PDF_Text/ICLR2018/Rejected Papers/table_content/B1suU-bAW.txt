How-ever, our topic-specific weighting scheme for the covariate weight vectors implies that sparsity isdesirable in the weights. The weight sparsity resulting from our algorithm was experimentally veri-fied through many runs of our embedding method, as well as across different optimization methods.

Firstly, while there is some clearnoise, specific topic meanings do seem to appear in certain coordinates (which we infer in the tableabove). It is reasonable that meaning would appear out of coordinates which are sparsely weightedin some covariate, because this means that it is a topic that is relevant in other discussion forumsbut purposely ignored in some specific forum, so it is likely to have a consistent theme. When weperformed this task for coordinates which had low variance in their weights between covariates, theresulting words were much less consistent.
