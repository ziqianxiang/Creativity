Table 1: The clustering adjust Rand index with k-means.
Table 2: The clustering adjust Rand index with k-means. The neighbor-encoder representation islearned using feature space neighbor definition.
Table 3: The clustering adjust Rand index with k-means. The neighbor-encoder representation islearned using side information neighbor definition. The side information is added to the autoencoderby adding the contrastive loss to the objective function.
Table 4: The clustering adjust Rand index with k-means. Both vanilla and denoising k-neighbor-encoder outperforms their autoencoder counterparts while all the variational variants performspoorly.
