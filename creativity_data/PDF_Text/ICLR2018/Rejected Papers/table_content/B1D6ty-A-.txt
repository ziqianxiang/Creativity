Table 1: Classification accuracies usingReLU autoencoder features on differentdatasetsautoencoder, a leakiness parameter of 0.01 for the leaky ReLU, a learning rate of 0.001, and aminibatch size of 500. The results are shown in Figure 2b. The results for ReLU showed animprovement, and DANTE was marginally better than back-prop SGD across the iterations (as shownin the figure).
