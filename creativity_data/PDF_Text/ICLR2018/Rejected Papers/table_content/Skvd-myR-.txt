Table 1: Network architectures. Fully connected layers (FC-{filters}) are always followed by aReLU layer except for the last one. Training: 22.5 million pairs. Validation: 7.5 million pairs.
Table 2: mAP when using different training configurations and âˆ† (in brackets) values.
Table 3: mAP results for different state-of-the-art methods. Dim corresponds to the dimensionalityof the feature representation. Similarity is the similarity function.
Table 4: mAP when training different parts of the image retrieVal pipeline. In blue, the modules thatare fine-tunned in eVery experiment.
