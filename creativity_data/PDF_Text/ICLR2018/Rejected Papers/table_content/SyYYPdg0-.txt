Table 1: Semantic Segmentation Average Precision: We report average precision (area underprecision-recall curve) on pixel-wise classification for four object categories. Our approach cansegment images without supervision better than baselines. Moreover, the model can be fine-tunedwith a little bit of labeled data to further improve results. We note that the unsupervised models stillhave access to scene labels.
