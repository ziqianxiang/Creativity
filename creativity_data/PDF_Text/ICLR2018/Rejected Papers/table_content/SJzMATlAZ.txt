Table 1: Clustering accuracy of DCC and 12 baselines, measured by AMI. Higher is better. Methodsthat do no use deep networks are listed first, followed by deep clustering algorithms that use fully-connected autoencoders (including the fully-connected configuration of DCC) and deep clusteringalgorithms that use convolutional autoencoders (including the convolutional configuration of DCC).
Table 2: Importance of joint optimization. This table shows the accuracy (AMI) achieved by runningprior clustering algorithms on a low-dimensional embedding of the data. For reference, DCCresults from Table 1 are also listed. Top: The embedding is performed using the same autoencoderarchitecture as used by fully-connected DCC, into the same target space. However, dimensionalityreduction and clustering are performed separately. Clustering accuracy is much lower than theaccuracy achieved by DCC. Bottom: Here clustering is performed in the reduced space discoveredby DCC. The performance of all clustering algorithms improves significantly.

Table 4: Clustering accuracy of DCC and 12 baselines, measured by ACC. Higher is better. This isthe ACC counterpart to Table 1.
Table 5: Clustering accuracy of DCC and 12 baselines, measured by NMI. Higher is better. This isthe NMI counterpart to Table 1.
