Table 1: The performance of our algorithm compared to the baseline metrics. Each entry representsthe AUC averaged over 5 trials. Baseline metrics AUCâ€™s are averaged over 10 runs using bootstrapsampling. The first column indicates dataset size N , time series length L and class distributionr = no Pos Class and P is the pooling size used for DTC.
