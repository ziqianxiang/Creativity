Table 1: Wasserstein distances using critics trained on (a) the VCTK dataset (b) the CSLU dataset.
Table 2: (a)[CSLU dataset] Wasserstein distances using an alternate critic that is pre-trained on held-out data for 15 accents. This measures the average Wasserstein distance of samples generated byAccentGAN from ground truth samples, as we increase the number of accents we train on.
