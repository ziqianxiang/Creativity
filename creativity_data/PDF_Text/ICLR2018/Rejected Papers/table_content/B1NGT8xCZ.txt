Table 1: Classification accuracies on 16 tasks between No-Adapt, DANN and DAuto. S → T meansthat S is the source domain and T is the target domain. Improvements over baselines are highlighted.
Table 2: Classification accuracy on the digits experiment from No-Adapt, DANN, ADDA and DAuto.
Table 3: CTC loss on 9 tasks from LSTM (No-Adapt), DANN and DAuto. A lower loss indicates abetter speech model. Improvements over baseline method are highlighted in green, and decreases inperformance are shown in red. Table best viewed in color.
Table 4: Sentiment classification (positive/negative) accuracies on 16 tasks of 5 models: MLP, Ladder,mSDA, DANN and DAuto. S → T means that S is the source domain and T is the target domain.
Table 5: p-value matrix between different domain adaptation algorithms. Each entry in the matrixcorresponds to the mean p-value under a paired t-test on 16 domain adaptation tasks.
