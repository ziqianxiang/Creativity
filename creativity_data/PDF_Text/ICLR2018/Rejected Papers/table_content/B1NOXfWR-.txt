Table 1: Generalization performance on unseen and larger taskgraphs. The task graphs in D1 have the same graph structure astraining set, but the graph was unseen. The task graphs in D2,D3, and D4 have (unseen) larger graph structures. NTS-RPropoutperforms other compared agents on all the task.
Table 2: Parameters for generating task including task graph parameter and episode length.
Table 3: Task graph parameters for training set and tasks D1 ã€œD4.
Table 4: Task graph parameters for analysis of task graph components.
