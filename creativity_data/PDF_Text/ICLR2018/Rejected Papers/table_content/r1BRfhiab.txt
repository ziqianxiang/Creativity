Table 1: Results on Single Logit classification, using the different loss functions. In almost all cases,loss functions that are aligned with the Principle of Logit Separation (under the dashed line) yielda relative improvement of 20%-35% in the different performance measures, while also yielding asmall improvement in classification performance.
