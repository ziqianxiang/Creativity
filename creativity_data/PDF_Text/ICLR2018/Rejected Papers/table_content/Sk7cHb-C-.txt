Table 1: Log-likelihood of reconstructionsMethod Log-likelihoodOurs	-0.466VAE	-1.344.2 Dynamic input and predictionTo test the complete model, including the dynamics level, video sequences of a person performingdifferent actions are used. The aim is to determine if the changes in S over time correspond to thevariations in motion patterns of the person being observed. We use a dataset where a person sittingat a table passes an object to other persons, or place it on defined points on the table. The dataset hasbeen introduced by Schydlo et al.. The scenario is a table with four marked spots on the table, andfour participants are sat around it. Only one participant is fully visible, and is the one performingthe actions. That person performs six different actions that consist os sequences of sub-action ashanding a ball to someone else, placing the ball on a marked spot, or resting the hand on the table.
