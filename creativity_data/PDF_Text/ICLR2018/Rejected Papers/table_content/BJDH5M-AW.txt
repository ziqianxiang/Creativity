Table 1: Evaluation of 1000 2D adversarial examples with random targets. We evaluate eachexample over 1000 randomly sampled transformations to calculate classification accuracy and ad-versariality (percent classified as the adversarial class).
Table 2: Evaluation of 200 3D adversarial examples with random targets. We evaluate each exampleover 100 randomly sampled poses to calculate classification accuracy and adversariality (percentclassified as the adversarial class).
Table 3: Quantitative analysis of the two adversarial objects, over 100 photos of each object overa wide distribution of viewpoints. Both objects are classified as the adversarial target class in themajority of viewpoints.
