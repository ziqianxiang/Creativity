Table 1: Summary of the results. For the Sequence Prediction tasks the number of iterations corresponds to thenumber of episodes (shown for the original Hochreiter & Schmidhuber (1997) and current implementation);while for the T-Maze tasks it corresponds to the total number of steps Bakker (2002). ASN accuracy (%), totalnumber of spikes per task and firing rate (Hz) are also reported. Note that the firing rate for both the sequenceprediction tasks are computed without taking into account the input and output neurons not active in a specifictime frame.
