Table 1: Scores obtained by a convolutional neural network when: a)trained and tested on real data, b) trained on synthetic and tested onreal data, and c) trained on real and tested on synthetic. In all cases,early stopping and (in the case of the synthetic data) epoch selectionwere determined using a validation set.
Table 2: TSTR results on eICU tasks using normal (a) and differentially private (b) training. Inboth cases, epoch from which data is generated was selected using a validation set, consideringperformance on a subset of the tasks (SpO2 < 95, HR > 100, and RR < 13, denoted in italics). Fordetails on the differentially private setting, see section 7.
