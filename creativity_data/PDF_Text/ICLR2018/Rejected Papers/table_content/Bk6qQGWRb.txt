Table 1: The first column presents the score ratio after last column steps. The second column is thescore ratio of BDQN after the number of steps in the last column compared to the score of DDQN*,the reported scores of DDQN in Van Hasselt et al. (2016) after running for 200M samples duringevaluation time, and the third column is with respect to Human score reported at Mnih et al. (2015).
Table 2: Comparison of scores and sample complexities(scores in the first two columns are averageof 100 consecutive episodes). SC represents the number of samples the BDQN requires to bit thehuman score (Mnih et al., 2015)(“ - ” means BDQN could not bit) and SCt is the number number ofsamples the BDQN requires to bit the score of DDQN t.
