Table 1: Comparing the test error of different learning methods on 100 test tasks (average ± STD)Method	Average STDScratch-standard	2.27%	0.16%Scratch-stochastic	2.8%	0.16%Warm-start-transfer	1.43%	0.12%Oracle-transfer	0.802%	0.06%LAP-M	1.04%	0.1%LAP-S	0.856%	0.08%LAP-PL	61.3%	15.9%LAP-KLD	91.0%	6.06%Averaged-Prior	2.89%	0.19%MAML	0.931%	0.06%As can be seen in Table 1, the best results are obtained with the “oracle” method. Recall that theoracle method has the “unfair” advantage of a “hand-engineered” transfer technique which is basedon knowledge about the problem. In contrast, the other methods must automatically learn the taskenvironment by observing several tasks.
