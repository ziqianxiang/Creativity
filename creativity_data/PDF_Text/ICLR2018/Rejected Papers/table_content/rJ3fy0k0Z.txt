Table 1: Summary of how much times more CPU-time GAIL required to achieve the expert’sperformance than that of our algorithm. The number of the expert’s trajectories given as dataset isdenoted by ds. The CPU-time was measured when satisfying either two criteria - (a) PRR achievedto be greater than or equals to 1.0. (b) PRR marked the highest number.
Table 2: Description of each task, an agents performance with random policy, and the performance ofthe experts.. dim(S) and dim(A) denote dimensionality of state and action spaces respectively.
