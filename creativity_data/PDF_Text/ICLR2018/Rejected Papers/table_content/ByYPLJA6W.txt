Table 4: DRN network architecture for the models presented in Fig. 4a. The network architectureis denoted as such: Eg. 1 - 4x3 - 1: 1 input node, followed by 4 layers each having 3 nodes, and 1output nodeNo. of model parameters	L2 test loss	DRN network architecture85	069	1-4x3-1340	0.45	1-4x8-1624	042	1-5x10- 12044	037	1 - 5x20 - 13484	-	0.37	1- 8x20 - 1	ä¸€C Comparison of prediction timesWe compare the mean prediction time per data for DRN and the baseline methods. All runs wereconducted on the CPU. For the synthetic dataset, we have shown the test loss for varying parametersizes. For a fair comparison of runtime, for each method we chose a model size which gave a testL2 loss of about 0.37. For all the datasets, MLP has the fastest prediction time, followed by DRNand then 3BE.
