Table 1: Comparison between different cyclical training schedules (cycle length and learning rateare optimized using a grid search). Discrete schedules perform similarly, or slightly better thantriangular. Additionally, discrete S schedule leads to much wider minima for similar loss. Hessiannorm is approximated on 1 out of 6 repetitions and measured at minimum value (usually endpointof training).
