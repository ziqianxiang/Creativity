Table 1: Channel used in the experiments. Note that age = CUrrenUick - unit_build_tick. Age isbinned into [200, 500, 1000, 2000, 5000, 10000] (7 bins). Resource is binned into [50, 100, 150, 200](5 bins). All models have the same number of parameters. BuildHistory includes all Vanillafeatures,PrevSeen includes all BuildHistory features. Features that are not included in the model are 0.
