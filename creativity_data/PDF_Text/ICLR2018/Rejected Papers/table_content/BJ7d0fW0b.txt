Table 1: Performance (game scores) of our agents and the DQN baseline. The average game scoresare evaluated on the best-performing learned model in learning. The numbers in parentheses arestandard errors.
Table 2: Performance of the learned policy in different drop rate setting. The rows correspond todifferent remaining percentage of expert state sequences. The first row is the learned policy withoutany expert state sequence dropping. The numbers in parentheses are standard errors.
