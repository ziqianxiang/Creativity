Table 1: The behavior of the G and the performance of the D are presented in case of different newtarget values.
Table 2: Training -, validation - and test datasets of experiments setting.
Table 3: The AUC socres of various models are shown in the table. All the models are tested in threedatasets: MNIST(9) + MNIST(0-8), MNIST(9) + CIFAR10, MNIST(9) + Noise. Within MNIST(9)images are inliers, and other images are outliers. CorGAN, CorGAN2 and CorGAN3 are describedin section 5.2.
