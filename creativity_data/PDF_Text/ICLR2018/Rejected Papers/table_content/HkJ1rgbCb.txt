Table 1: Results of different models on the 12 Tox21 datasets using AUC as the metric. We run ourbase convolutional model (Mol-CNN) on the multi-task setting to compare with the top-performingsystem, DeepTox. To compare the results of our reinforcement learning algorithm (RL-CNN), werun our model in a single-task setting. Here, we report the results of the Mol-CNN, RL-CNN and alogistic regression (LR) baseline.
Table 2: Results of different models on the hERG dataset using AUC as the metric. The first 4models are baselines from Li et al. (2017) and use molecular fingerprints as input to random forest(RF), support vector machine (SVM), k nearest neighbors (KNN) and associative neural networks(ASNN). For each of their models, we take the average performance for the same model run withdifferent input features.
Table 3: Synthetic experiment results for the Tox21 challenge dataset. To test if our model is ableto pick up specific signals when they are present, we altered training and test labels for moleculeswith known substructure (highlighted in green) to be always positive. The results show how wellthe model isolates these substructures as rationales for test molecules. The baseline LR model wasevaluated analogously.
