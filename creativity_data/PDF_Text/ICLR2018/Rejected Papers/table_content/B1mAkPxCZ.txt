Table 1: The classification accuracy of one-shot learning on three dataset. “Number of instancesaugmented” indicates how many virtual instances are generated from one training instance in eachtype of data augmentation method. The standard deviation is 0.5 〜1.3%.
Table 2: The results of combining different types of data augmentation in our framework.
Table 3: One-shot Learning Performance on AwA dataset w.r.t number of training instancesper category. NN, LR, Near-N and SVR indicate neural network, logistic regression, nearestneighbour and support vector regressor for classification and feature mapping. The chance rate is 2.5.
Table 4: Few-shot learning performance on AwA dataset w.r.t number of training instances percategory. NN, LR, and SVR indicate neural network, logistic regression, and support vector regressorfor classification and feature mapping. The standard deviation is 0.5 〜1.3%.
