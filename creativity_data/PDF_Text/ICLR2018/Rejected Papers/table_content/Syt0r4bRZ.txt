Table 1:	Reslut of TranslationTable 2:	Robustness AnalysisWe also test the robustness of our model against the baseline. For each sentence, we replace oneword randomly in the original text with a word randomly chosen in the dictionary, and evaluate thedifference of the output to test the robustness. We use the reduction proportion of Bleu1 and Bleu2scores to evaluate the robustness of translation. The result is shown in Table 2, from which wecan see that Tree2Tree LSTM are more stable than LSTM. We will prove this property in theory inSection 5.
