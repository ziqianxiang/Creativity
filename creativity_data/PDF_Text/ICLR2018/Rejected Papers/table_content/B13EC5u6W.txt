Table 1: Comparison AUC results for ChestX-ray8 datasetWe apply our method to the MNIST dataset and demonstrate class switching between digits from 9to 4 and 3 to 2. Figure 8. demonstrates the visual rationales for why each digit has been classifiedas a 9 rather than a 4, as well as the transformed versions of each digit. As expected, the top hor-izontal line in the digit 9 is removed to make each digit appear as a 4. Interestingly, the algorithm7Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2018failed to convert several digits into a 4 and instead converts them into other digits which are presum-ably more similar to that instance, despite the addition of the weighted term encouraging the latentrepresentation to prefer the target class.
