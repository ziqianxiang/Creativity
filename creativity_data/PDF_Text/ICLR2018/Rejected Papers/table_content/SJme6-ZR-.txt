Table 1: C-index (%) for clusters from different methods with K = 2, 3, 4 where K is the numberof clusters. The proposed approach is more robust with lower values of standard deviations than thecompeting methods.
Table 2: Different neural network architectures that we experiment with in our experiments. Whilevarying the value of a set of parameters, we keep the other parameters fixed to the default value.
Table 3: C-index (%) over different NN architectures for the proposed approach with Kuiper loss(learnt exponential) and K = 2.
Table 4: C-index (%) over different learning rates and batch sizes for the proposed NN approachwith Kuiper loss (with learnt exponential) and K = 2.
