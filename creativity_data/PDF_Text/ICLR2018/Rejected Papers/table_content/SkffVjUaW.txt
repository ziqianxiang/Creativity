Table 1: Mean error and standard deviation and number of parameters (in millions) for architecturestrained five times using the original reference and automatically expanded architectures respectively.
Table 2: Two experiments with all-convolutional Alexnet on the large scale Imagenet dataset com-paring the reference implementation with our expanded architecture.
