Table 2: Privacy, practicality, and fairness comparison of advanced methods.Encrypting the modelis impractical in the case of large models that are deployed, thus the high fairness hypothesis is notapplicable. Encrypting the data has data leakage that is specific to the model, which is marked asmedium.

Each of the testing technique require yet anew operation on the data; if we want the data to remain encrypted, each of these testing frameworkswould need to be hand-crafted to accommodate.
