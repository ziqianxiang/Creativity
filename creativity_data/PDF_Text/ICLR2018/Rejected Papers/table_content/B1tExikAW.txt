Table 2: Confidence scores (p=1) for additive perturbation attacks of types: Independent, Poisoning,Poisoning+ClassData Samples	Independent	Poisoning	Poisoning+ClassOriginal smile	0.80	0.80	0.80Smile reconstruction	0.87	0.78	0.80No smile → smile	0.94	0.98	0.98Original no smile	0.93	0.93	0.93No smile reconstruction	0.87	0.91	0.89Smile → No smile	0.96	0.91	0.96same time as learning the VAE to switch between “no smile” and “smile”. Similarly, with the resultsobtained with L2 regularization on ∆z, the more successful attack - in terms of stealth - is to gofrom “no smile” to “smile” for all attack types.

These images highlight the effect of the adversarial perturbation - applied to the latentspace - in the data space.
