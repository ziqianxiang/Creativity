The goal is to generate graphs that are similar in their properties tothe input graph - while not trivially copying the input network. We randomly hide 15% of the edges(which are used for the stopping criterion; see Sec. 3.2) and train GraphGAN and DC-SBM on theremaining graph. We then sample graphs from the trained models and compare their properties withthe input graph. We report the results for Cora-ML here, and for Citeseer in the appendix.
Table 2: Comparison of graph statistics between the original Cora-ML graph and graphs gener-ated by GraphGAN and the baselines, averaged over 5 trials. Marked in bold and italics are theresults that are closest and second-closest to the input graph, respectively. * indicates values for theconfiguration model that by definition exactly match the input graph.

Table 5: GraphGAN with recurrent vs convolutional discriminator. We train GraphGAN with therecurrent and convolutional discriminator variants five times each and measure their link predictionscores on the Cora-ML dataset to evaluate which variant is suited better for our task.

Marked in bold and italic are the resultsthat are closest and second-closest to the ground truth graph, respectively, except for edge overlap,where lower can be considered better.
