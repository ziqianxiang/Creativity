Table 1: Hyper-parameter configuration of three models. To ensure the fairness of the comparison,we deliberately reduce the capacity of the encoder for modelb1 and modelb2 to match the totalnumber of parameters of modela .
Table 2: Fifteen abnormalities and their AUCs, including the average AUC over all abnormalities.
Table 3: Test set performance on negative log-probability (NLL), DICE, per-example sensitivity(PESS) at a threshold 0.5 and per-class sensitivity and specificity (PCSS) at a threshold of 0.5.
