Figure 1: Degradation of Nematus (Sennrich et al., 2017) and char2char (Lee et al., 2017)performance as noise increases.
Figure 2: Variances of CharCNN weights when trained on only Key, Natural, Random noiseand on a mix of all three are shown in red, green, blue, and white, respectivelyare not mutually-beneficial. Models trained on one do not perform well on the others. In particular,only models trained on natural noise can reasonably translate natural noise at test time. We find thisresult indicates an important difference between computational models and human performance,since humans can decipher random letter orderings without explicit training of this form.
