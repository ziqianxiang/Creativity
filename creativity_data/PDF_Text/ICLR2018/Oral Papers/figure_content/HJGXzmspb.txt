Figure 1: Four operators QW(∙), Qa(∙), Qg(∙), Qe(∙) added in WAGE computation dataflow toreduce precision, bitwidth of signed integers are below or on the right of arrows, activations areincluded in MAC for concision.
Figure 2: Quantization methods used in WAGE. The notation P, x, [∙] and「•] denotes probability,vector, floor and ceil, respectively. ShiftG) refers to Equation 4 with a certain argument.
Figure 3: Training curves of WAGE variations and a vanilla CNN on CIFAR10.
Figure 4: Left are histograms of errors e for same layer in vanilla network and WAGE-2888 network.
Figure 5: Layerwise histograms of a trained VGG-like network with bitwidth configuration: 2-8-8-8 and learning rate η equals to 8. The Y-axis represents for probability in W-plots and G-plots,and logarithmic probability in A-plots and E-plots, respectively. In A-plots histograms are one-layerahead so the first figure shows the quantized input data.
