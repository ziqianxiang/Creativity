Figure 1: Any planar projec-tion of a spherical signal will re-sult in distortions. Rotation of aspherical signal cannot be emu-lated by translation of its planarprojection.
Figure 2: Spherical correlation in the spectrum. The signal f and the locally-supported filter ψare Fourier transformed, block-wise tensored, summed over input channels, and finally inversetransformed. Note that because the filter is locally supported, it is faster to use a matrix multiplication(DFT) than an FFT algorithm for it. We parameterize the sphere using spherical coordinates α, β,and SO(3) with ZYZ-Euler angles α, β, γ.
Figure 3: ∆ as a function of the resolution and thenumber of layers.
Figure 4: Two MNIST digits projected onto thesphere using stereographic projection. Mappingback to the plane results in non-linear distortions.
Figure 5: The ray is cast from the surface of the sphere towards the origin. The first intersection withthe model gives the values of the signal. The two images of the right represent two spherical signalsin (α, β) coordinates. They contain respectively the distance from the sphere and the cosine of theray with the normal of the model. The red dot corresponds to the pixel set by the red line.
