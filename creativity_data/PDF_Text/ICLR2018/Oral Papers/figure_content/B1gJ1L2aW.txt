Figure 1: This example shows how density measures can fail to characterize the spatial propertiesof adversarial regions. The Gaussian kernel with bandwidth 0.2 is used for KD.
Figure 2: The left-hand figure shows the LID scores (at the softmax layer) of 100 normal (blue),noisy (green), and Opt attack (red x-cross) examples from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The scores havebeen scaled to the interval [0,1] using min-max normalization. The blue and green lines appearsuperimposed due to similarities in the LID scores for normal and noisy examples. The right-handfigure shows the detection performance (AUC) based on LID scores computed at different layers.
Figure 3: Top row: tuning bandwidth Ïƒ for KD using a grid search over the range [0, 10) in log-space, separately for each dataset. Bottom row: tuning k for LID using a grid search over the range[10, 100) for minibatch size 100, separately for each dataset. The vertical dashed lines denote theselected parameter choice.
Figure 4: The plots show the normalized LID scores of 100 randomly selected normal (blue), noisy(green) and Opt attack (red x-cross) examples. The noisy and adversarial examples were generatedfrom the normal examples. The left-hand plot shows the scores (at the pre-softmax layer) of MNISTexamples, while the right-hand plot shows LID scores (at the softmax layer) of SVHN examples.
Figure 5: The detection AUC score of LID estimated using different neighborhood sizes k with alarger minibatch size of 1000. The results are shown for the detection of Opt attacks on the MNIST,CIFAR-10 and SVHN datasets.
