Table 1: Evaluation of models. SeenProjTest refers to the test set containing projects that havefiles in the training set, UnseenProjTest refers to projects that have no files in the training data.
Table 2: Ablation study for the GGNN model on SeenProjTest for the two tasks.
Table 3: Performance of GGNN model on VarMisuse per number of type-correct, in-scopecandidate variables. Here we compute the performance of the full GGNN model that uses subtokens.
Table 4: Projects in our dataset. Ordered alphabetically. kLOC measures the number of non-emptylines of C# code. Projects marked with Devwere used as a development set. Projects marked with^ were in the test-only dataset. The rest of the projects were split into train-validation-test. The datasetcontains in total about 2.9MLOC.
