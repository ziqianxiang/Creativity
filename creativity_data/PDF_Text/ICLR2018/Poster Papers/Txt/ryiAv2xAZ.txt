The problem of detecting whether a test sample is from in-distribution (i.e., train-
ing distribution by a classifier) or out-of-distribution sufficiently different from it
arises in many real-world machine learning applications. However, the state-of-art
deep neural networks are known to be highly overconfident in their predictions,
i.e., do not distinguish in- and out-of-distributions. Recently, to handle this is-
sue, several threshold-based detectors have been proposed given pre-trained neu-
ral classifiers. However, the performance of prior works highly depends on how
to train the classifiers since they only focus on improving inference procedures.
In this paper, we develop a novel training method for classifiers so that such in-
ference algorithms can work better. In particular, we suggest two additional terms
added to the original loss (e.g., cross entropy). The first one forces samples from
out-of-distribution less confident by the classifier and the second one is for (im-
plicitly) generating most effective training samples for the first one. In essence,
our method jointly trains both classification and generative neural networks for
out-of-distribution. We demonstrate its effectiveness using deep convolutional
neural networks on various popular image datasets.
1	Introduction
Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on many classifi-
cation tasks, e.g., speech recognition (Hannun et al., 2014), image classification (Girshick, 2015),
video prediction (Villegas et al., 2017) and medical diagnosis (Caruana et al., 2015). Even though
DNNs achieve high accuracy, it has been addressed (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017; Guo et al.,
2017) that they are typically overconfident in their predictions. For example, DNNs trained to clas-
sify MNIST images often produce high confident probability 91% even for random noise (see the
work of (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2016)). Since evaluating the quality of their predictive uncertainty
is hard, deploying them in real-world systems raises serious concerns in AI Safety (Amodei et al.,
2016), e.g., one can easily break a secure authentication system that can be unlocked by detecting
the gaze and iris of eyes using DNNs (Shrivastava et al., 2017).
The overconfidence issue of DNNs is highly related to the problem of detecting out-of-distribution:
detect whether a test sample is from in-distribution (i.e., training distribution by a classifier) or out-
of-distribution sufficiently different from it. Formally, it can be formulated as a binary classification
problem. Let an input x ∈ X and a label y ∈ Y = {1, . . . , K} be random variables that follow a
joint data distribution Pin (x, y) = Pin (y|x) Pin (x). We assume that a classifier Pθ (y|x) is trained
on a dataset drawn from Pin (x, y), where θ denotes the model parameter. We let Pout (x) denote
an out-of-distribution which is ‘far away’ from in-distribution Pin (x). Our problem of interest is
determining if input x is from Pin or Pout, possibly utilizing a well calibrated classifier Pθ (y|x).
In other words, we aim to build a detector, g (x) : X → {0, 1}, which assigns label 1 if data is from
in-distribution, and label 0 otherwise.
There have been recent efforts toward developing efficient detection methods where they mostly
have studied simple threshold-based detectors (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2016; Liang et al., 2017) uti-
lizing a pre-trained classifier. For each input x, it measures some confidence score q(x) based on a
pre-trained classifier, and compares the score to some threshold δ > 0. Then, the detector assigns
1

label 1 if the confidence score q(x) is above δ, and label 0, otherwise. Specifically, (Hendrycks
& Gimpel, 2016) defined the confidence score as a maximum value of the predictive distribution,
and (Liang et al., 2017) further improved the performance by using temperature scaling (Guo et al.,
2017) and adding small controlled perturbations to the input data. Although such inference methods
are computationally simple, their performances highly depend on the pre-trained classifier. Namely,
they fail to work if the classifier does not separate the maximum value of predictive distribution
well enough with respect to Pin and Pout . Ideally, a classifier should be trained to separate all
class-dependent in-distributions as well as out-of-distribution in the output space. As another line of
research, Bayesian probabilistic models (Li & Gal, 2017; Louizos & Welling, 2017) and ensembles
of classifiers (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017) were also investigated. However, training or inferring
those models are computationally more expensive. This motivates our approach of developing a
new training method for the more plausible simple classifiers. Our direction is orthogonal to the
Bayesian and ensemble approaches, where one can also combine them for even better performance.
Contribution. In this paper, we develop such a training method for detecting out-of-distribution
Pout better without losing its original classification accuracy. First, we consider a new loss function,
called confidence loss. Our key idea on the proposed loss is to additionally minimize the Kullback-
Leibler (KL) divergence from the predictive distribution on out-of-distribution samples to the uni-
form one in order to give less confident predictions on them. Then, in- and out-of-distributions are
expected to be more separable. However, optimizing the confidence loss requires training samples
from out-of-distribution, which are often hard to sample: a priori knowledge on out-of-distribution
is not available or its underlying space is too huge to cover. To handle the issue, we consider a
new generative adversarial network (GAN) (Goodfellow et al., 2014) for generating most effective
samples from Pout. Unlike the original GAN, the proposed GAN generates ‘boundary’ samples in
the low-density area of Pin. Finally, we design a joint training scheme minimizing the classifier’s
loss and new GAN loss alternatively, i.e., the confident classifier improves the GAN, and vice versa,
as training proceeds. Here, we emphasize that the proposed GAN does not need to generate explicit
samples under our scheme, and instead it implicitly encourages training a more confident classifier.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method using deep convolutional neural networks
such as AlexNet (Krizhevsky, 2014) and VGGNet (Szegedy et al., 2015) for image classification
tasks on CIFAR (Krizhevsky & Hinton, 2009), SVHN (Netzer et al., 2011), ImageNet (Deng et al.,
2009), and LSUN (Yu et al., 2015) datasets. The classifier trained by our proposed method dras-
tically improves the detection performance of all threshold-based detectors (Hendrycks & Gim-
pel, 2016; Liang et al., 2017) in all experiments. In particular, VGGNet with 13 layers trained by
our method improves the true negative rate (TNR), i.e., the fraction of detected out-of-distribution
(LSUN) samples, compared to the baseline: 14.0% → 39.1% and 46.3% → 98.9% on CIFAR-10
and SVHN, respectively, when 95% of in-distribution samples are correctly detected. We also pro-
vide visual understandings on the proposed method using the image datasets. We believe that our
method can be a strong guideline when other researchers will pursue these tasks in the future.
2	Training confident neural classifiers
In this section, we propose a novel training method for classifiers in order to improve the perfor-
mance of prior threshold-based detectors (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2016; Liang et al., 2017) (see Ap-
pendix A for more details). Our motivation is that such inference algorithms can work better if the
classifiers are trained so that they map the samples from in- and out-of-distributions into the output
space separately. Namely, we primarily focus on training an improved classifier, and then use prior
detectors under the trained model to measure its performance.
2.1	Confident classifier for out-of-distribution
Without loss of generality, suppose that the cross entropy loss is used for training. Then, we propose
the following new loss function, termed confidence loss:
min EPin(xb,yb)	- log Pθ	(y	= yb|xb)	+βEPout(x)	KL	(U (y)	k	Pθ	(y|x)) ,	(1)
θ
where KL denotes the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, U (y) is the uniform distribution and
β > 0 is a penalty parameter. It is highly intuitive as the new loss forces the predictive distribution

We generate the out-of-distribution samples from (a) 2D box [-50, 50]2, and show (b) the corre-
sponding decision boundary of classifier. We also generate the out-of-distribution samples from (c)

on out-of-distribution samples to be closer to the uniform one, i.e., zero confidence, while that
for samples from in-distribution still follows the label-dependent probability. In other words, the
proposed loss is designed for assigning higher maximum prediction values, i.e., maxy Pθ (y|x), to
in-distribution samples than out-of-distribution ones. Here, a caveat is that adding the KL divergence
term might degrade the classification performance. However, we found that it is not the case due
to the high expressive power of deep neural networks, while in- and out-of-distributions become
more separable with respect to the maximum prediction value by optimizing the confidence loss
(see Section 3.1 for supporting experimental results).
We remark that minimizing a similar KL loss was studied recently for different purposes (Lee et al.,
2017; Pereyra et al., 2017). Training samples for minimizing the KL divergence term is explicitly
given in their settings while we might not. Ideally, one has to sample all (almost infinite) types of out-
of-distribution to minimize the KL term in (1), or require some prior information on testing out-of-
distribution for efficient sampling. However, this is often infeasible and fragile. To address the issue,
we suggest to sample out-of-distribution close to in-distribution, which could be more effective in
improving the detection performance, without any assumption on testing out-of-distribution.
In order to explain our intuition in details, we consider a binary classification task on a simple ex-
ample, where each class data is drawn from a Gaussian distribution and entire data space is bounded
by 2D box [-50, 50]2 for visualization. We apply the confidence loss to simple fully-connected
neural networks (2 hidden layers and 500 hidden units for each layer) using different types of out-
of-distribution training samples. First, as shown in Figure 1(a), we construct an out-of-distribution
training dataset of 100 (green) points using rejection sampling on the entire data space [-50, 50]2 .
Figure 1(b) shows the decision boundary of classifier optimizing the confidence loss on the corre-
sponding dataset. One can observe that a classifier still shows overconfident predictions (red and
blue regions) near the labeled in-distribution region. On the other hand, if we construct a training
out-of-distribution dataset of 100 points from [-20, 20]2, i.e., closer to target, in-distribution space
(see Figure 1(c)), a classifier produces confident predictions only on the labeled region and zero
confidence on the remaining in the entire data space [-50, 50]2 as shown in Figure 1(d). If one
increases the number of training out-of-distribution samples which are generated from the entire
space, i.e., [-50, 50]2, Figure 1(b) is expected to be similar to Figure 1(d). In other words, one need
more samples in order to train a confident classifier if samples are generated from the entire space.
However, this might be impossible and not efficient since the number of out-of-distribution training
samples might be almost infinite to cover its entire, huge actual data space. This implies that training
out-of-distribution samples nearby the in-distribution region could be more effective in improving
the detection performance. Our underlying intuition is that the effect of boundary of in-distribution
region might propagate to the entire out-of-distribution space. Our experimental results in Section
3.1 also support this: realistic images are more useful as training out-of-distribution than synthetic
datasets (e.g., Gaussian noise) for improving the detection performance when we consider an image
classification task. This motivates us to develop a new generative adversarial network (GAN) for
generating such effective out-of-distribution samples.
2.2	Adversarial generator for out-of-distribution
In this section, we introduce a new training method for learning a generator of out-of-distribution
inspired by generative adversarial network (GAN) (Goodfellow et al., 2014). We will first assume
3
Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2018
that the classifier for in-distribution is fixed, and also describe the joint learning framework in the
next section.
The GAN framework consists of two main components: discriminator D and generator G. The
generator maps a latent variable z from a prior distribution Ppri (z) to generated outputs G (z), and
discriminator D : X → [0, 1] represents a probability that sample x is from a target distribution.
Suppose that we want to recover the in-distribution Pin (x) using the generator G. Then, one can
optimize the following min-max objective for forcing PG ≈ Pin :
mGin mDax EPin(x)logD(x) +EPpri(z) log(1 - D (G (z))) .	(2)
However, unlike the original GAN, we want to make the generator recover an effective out-of-
distribution Pout instead of Pin . To this end, we propose the following new GAN loss:
min max β EPG (x) KL(U (y) k Pθ (y|x))
G D '---------------------{Z--------------}
(a)
+EPin(x)logD(x) +EPG(x)log(1-D(x)),	(3)
X----------------------{----------------------}
(b)
where θ is the model parameter of a classifier trained on in-distribution. The above objective can be
interpreted as follows: the first term (a) corresponds to a replacement of the out-of-distribution Pout
in (1)’s KL loss with the generator distribution PG. One can note that this forces the generator to
generate low-density samples since it can be interpreted as minimizing the log negative likelihood
of in-distribution using the classifier, i.e., Pin(x) ≈ exp (KL (U (y) k Pθ (y|x))) . We remark that
this approximation is also closely related to the inception score (Salimans et al., 2016) which is
popularly used as a quantitative measure of visual fidelity of the samples. The second term (b) cor-
responds to the original GAN loss since we would like to have out-of-distribution samples close to
in-distribution, as mentioned in Section 2.1. Suppose that the model parameter of classifier θ is set
appropriately such that the classifier produces the uniform distribution for out of distribution sam-
ples. Then, the KL divergence term (a) in (3) is approximately 0 no matter what out-of-distribution
samples are generated. However, if the samples are far away from boundary, the GAN loss (b) in (3)
should be high, i.e., the GAN loss forces having samples being not too far from the in-distribution
space. Therefore, one can expect that proposed loss can encourage the generator to produce the
samples which are on the low-density boundary of the in-distribution space. We also provide its
experimental evidences in Section 3.2.
We also remark that (Dai et al., 2017) consider a similar GAN generating samples from out-of-
distribution for the purpose of semi-supervised learning. The authors assume the existence of a pre-
trained density estimation model such as PixelCNN++ (Salimans et al., 2017) for in-distribution,
but such a model might not exist and be expensive to train in general. Instead, we use much simpler
confident classifiers for approximating the density. Hence, under our fully-supervised setting, our
GAN is much easier to train and more suitable.
2.3 Joint training method of confident classifier and adversarial generator
In the previous section, we suggest training the proposed GAN using a pre-trained confident classi-
fier. We remind that the converse is also possible, i.e., the motivation of having such a GAN is for
training a better classifier. Hence, two models can be used for improving each other. This naturally
suggests a joint training scheme where the confident classifier improves the proposed GAN, and vice
versa, as training proceeds. Specifically, we suggest the following joint objective function:
min max min	EPin(xb,yb)	- log Pθ	(y =	yb|xb)	+β EPG (x)	KL	(U (y)	k	Pθ	(y|x))
GDB X-----------------------7---------------} X----------------V---------------}
(c)	(d)
+EPin(bx) logD (xb) + EPG (x) log(1 - D (x)) .	(4)
X----------------------{-------------------------}
(e)
The classifier’s confidence loss corresponds to (c) + (d), and the proposed GAN loss corresponds
to (d) + (e), i.e., they share the KL divergence term (d) under joint training. To optimize the above
objective efficiently, we propose an alternating algorithm, which optimizes model parameters {θ}
of classifier and GAN models {G, D} alternatively as shown in Algorithm 1. Since the algorithm
monotonically decreases the objective function, it is guaranteed to converge.

3 Experimental Results
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method using various datasets: CIFAR
(Krizhevsky & Hinton, 2009), SVHN (Netzer et al., 2011), ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009), LSUN
(Yu et al., 2015) and synthetic (Gaussian) noise distribution. We train convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) including VGGNet (Szegedy et al., 2015) and AlexNet (Krizhevsky, 2014) for classifying
CIFAR-10 and SVHN datasets. The corresponding test dataset is used as the in-distribution (pos-
itive) samples to measure the performance. We use realistic images and synthetic noises as the
out-of-distribution (negative) samples. For evaluation, we measure the following metrics using the
threshold-based detectors (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2016; Liang et al., 2017): the true negative rate
(TNR) at 95% true positive rate (TPR), the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
(AUROC), the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPR), and the detection accuracy, where
larger values of all metrics indicate better detection performances. Due to the space limitation, more
explanations about datasets, metrics and network architectures are given in Appendix B.1

the ROC curve of a model trained by optimizing the naive cross entropy loss, whereas other ones
correspond to the ROC curves of models trained by optimizing the confidence loss. The KL diver-
gence term in the confidence loss is optimized using explicit out-of-distribution datasets indicated
in the parentheses, e.g., Confident loss (LSUN) means that we use the LSUN dataset for optimizing
the KL divergence term.
3.1 Effects of confidence loss
We first verify the effect of confidence loss in (1) trained by some explicit, say seen, out-of-
distribution datasets. First, we compare the quality of confidence level by applying various training
losses. Specifically, the softmax classifier is used and simple CNNs (two convolutional layers fol-
lowed by three fully-connected layers) are trained by minimizing the standard cross entropy loss on
SVHN dataset. We also apply the confidence loss to the models by additionally optimizing the KL
divergence term using CIFAR-10 dataset (as training out-of-distribution). In Figure 2(a) and 2(b),
we report distributions of the maximum prediction value in softmax scores to evaluate the separation
quality between in-distribution (i.e., SVHN) and out-of-distributions. It is clear that there exists a
better separation between the SVHN test set (red bar) and other ones when the model is trained by
the confidence loss. Here, we emphasize that the maximum prediction value is also low on even un-
trained (unseen) out-of-distributions, e.g., TinyImageNet, LSUN and synthetic datasets. Therefore,
it is expected that one can distinguish in- and out-of-distributions more easily when a classifier is
trained by optimizing the confidence loss. To verify that, we obtain the ROC curve using the baseline
detector (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2016) that computes the maximum value of predictive distribution
on a test sample and classifies it as positive (i.e., in-distribution) if the confidence score is above
some threshold. Figure 2(c) shows the ROC curves when we optimize the KL divergence term on
various datasets. One can observe that realistic images such as TinyImageNet (aqua line) and LSUN
(green line) are more useful than synthetic datasets (orange line) for improving the detection perfor-
mance. This supports our intuition that out-of-distribution samples close to in-distribution could be
more effective in improving the detection performance as we discussed in Section 2.1.
We indeed evaluate the performance of the baseline detector for out-of-distribution using large-
scale CNNs, i.e., VGGNets with 13 layers, under various training scenarios, where more results on
AlexNet and ODIN detector (Liang et al., 2017) can be found in Appendix C (the overall trends
of results are similar). For optimizing the confidence loss in (1), SVHN and CIFAR-10 training
datasets are used for optimizing the KL divergence term for the cases when the in-distribution is
CIFAR-10 and SVHN, respectively. Table 1 shows the detection performance for each in- and
out-of-distribution pair. When the in-distribution is SVHN, the classifier trained by our method
drastically improves the detection performance across all out-of-distributions without hurting its
original classification performance. However, when the in-distribution is CIFAR-10, the confidence
loss does not improve the detection performance in overall, where we expect that this is because
the trained/seen SVHN out-of-distribution does not effectively cover all tested out-of-distributions.
Our joint confidence loss in (4), which was designed under the intuition, resolves the issue of the
CIFAR-10 (in-distribution) classification case in Table 1 (see Figure 4(b)).

3.2 Effects of adversarial generator and joint confidence loss
In this section, we verify the effect of the proposed GAN in Section 2.2 and evaluate the detection
performance of the joint confidence loss in (4). To verify that the proposed GAN can produce the
samples nearby the low-density boundary of the in-distribution space, we first compare the gener-
ated samples by original GAN and proposed GAN on a simple example where the target distribution
is a mixture of two Gaussian distributions. For both the generator and discriminator, we use fully-
connected neural networks with 2 hidden layers. For our method, we use a pre-trained classifier
which minimizes the cross entropy on target distribution samples and the KL divergence on out-of-
distribution samples generated by rejection sampling on a bounded 2D box. As shown in Figure
3(a), the samples of original GAN cover the high-density area of the target distribution while those
of proposed GAN does its boundary one (see Figure 3(b)). We also compare the generated samples
of original and proposed GANs on MNIST dataset (LeCun et al., 1998), which consists of hand-
written digits. For this experiment, we use deep convolutional GANs (DCGANs) (Radford et al.,
2015). In this case, we use a pre-trained classifier which minimizes the cross entropy on MNIST

training samples and the KL divergence on synthetic Gaussian noises. As shown in Figure 3(c)
and 3(d), samples of original GAN looks more like digits than those of proposed GAN. Somewhat
interestingly, the proposed GAN still generates some new digit-like images.
We indeed evaluate the performance of our joint confidence loss in (4) utilizing the proposed GAN.
To this end, we use VGGNets (as classifiers) and DCGANs (as GANs). We also test a variant of con-
fidence loss which optimizes the KL divergence term on samples from a pre-trained original GAN
(implicitly) modeling the in-distribution. One can expect that samples from the original GAN can be
also useful for improving the detection performance since it may have bad generalization properties
(Arora et al., 2017) and generate a few samples on the low-density boundary as like the proposed
GAN. Figure 4 shows the performance of the baseline detector for each in- and out-of-distribution
pair. First, observe that the joint confidence loss (blue bar) outperforms the confidence loss with
some explicit out-of-distribution datasets (green bar). This is quite remarkable since the former
is trained only using in-distribution datasets, while the latter utilizes additional out-of-distribution
datasets. We also remark that our methods significantly outperform the baseline cross entropy loss
(red bar) in all cases without harming its original classification performances (see Table 2 in Ap-
pendix C). Interestingly, the confidence loss with the original GAN (orange bar) is often (but not
always) useful for improving the detection performance, whereas that with the proposed GAN (blue
bar) still outperforms it in all cases.
Finally, we also provide visual interpretations of models using the guided gradient maps (Sprin-
genberg et al., 2014). Here, the gradient can be interpreted as an importance value of each pixel
which influences on the classification decision. As shown in Figure 5, the model trained by the
cross entropy loss shows sharp gradient maps for both samples from in- and out-of-distributions,
whereas models trained by the confidence losses do only on samples from in-distribution. For the
case of SVHN in-distribution, all confidence losses gave almost zero gradients, which matches to
the results in Figure 4(a): their detection performances are almost perfect. For the case of CIFAR-
10 distribution, one can now observe that there exists some connection between gradient maps and
detection performances. This is intuitive because for detecting samples from out-of-distributions
better, the classifier should look at more pixels as similar importance and the KL divergence term
forces it. We think that our visualization results might give some ideas in future works for developing
better inference methods for detecting out-of-distribution under our models.
4 Conclusion
In this paper, we aim to develop a training method for neural classification networks for detecting
out-of-distribution better without losing its original classification accuracy. In essence, our method
jointly trains two models for detecting and generating out-of-distribution by minimizing their losses
alternatively. Although we primarily focus on image classification in our experiments, our method
can be used for any classification tasks using deep neural networks. It is also interesting future
directions applying our methods for other related tasks: regression (Malinin et al., 2017), network
calibration (Guo et al., 2017), Bayesian probabilistic models (Li & Gal, 2017; Louizos & Welling,
2017), ensemble (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017) and semi-supervised learning (Dai et al., 2017).

A	Threshold-based detectors
In this section, we formally describe the detection procedure of threshold-based detectors
(Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2016; Liang et al., 2017). For each data x, it measures some confidence
score q(x) by feeding the data into a pre-trained classifier. Here, (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2016) de-
fined the confidence score as a maximum value of the predictive distribution, and (Liang et al., 2017)
further improved the performance by processing the predictive distribution (see Appendix C.3 for
more details). Then, the detector, g (x) : X → {0, 1}, assigns label 1 if the confidence score q(x) is
above some threshold δ, and label 0, otherwise:
1 if q(x) ≥ δ,
0 otherwise.
For this detector, we have to find a score threshold so that some positive examples are classified
correctly, but this depends upon the trade-off between false negatives and false positives. To handle
this issue, we use threshold-independent evaluation metrics such as area under the receiver operating
characteristic curve (AUORC) and detection accuracy (see Appendix B).
B	Experimental setups in Section 3
Datasets. We train deep models such as VGGNet (Szegedy et al., 2015) and AlexNet (Krizhevsky,
2014) for classifying CIFAR-10 and SVHN datasets: the former consists of 50,000 training and
10,000 test images with 10 image classes, and the latter consists of 73,257 training and 26,032 test
images with 10 digits.2 The corresponding test dataset are used as the in-distribution (positive)
samples to measure the performance. We use realistic images and synthetic noises as the out-of-
distribution (negative) samples: the TinyImageNet consists of 10,000 test images with 200 image
classes from a subset of ImageNet images. The LSUN consists of 10,000 test images of 10 different
scenes. We downsample each image of TinyImageNet and LSUN to size 32 × 32. The Gaussian
noise is independently and identically sampled from a Gaussian distribution with mean 0.5 and
variance 1. We clip each pixel value into the range [0, 1].
Detailed CNN structure and training. The simple CNN that we use for evaluation shown in Figure
2 consists of two convolutional layers followed by three fully-connected layers. Convolutional layers
have 128 and 256 filters, respectively. Each convolutional layer has a 5 × 5 receptive field applied
with a stride of 1 pixel each followed by max pooling layer which pools 2 × 2 regions at strides of
2 pixels. AlexNet (Krizhevsky, 2014) consists of five convolutitonal layers followed by three fully-
connected layers. Convolutional layers have 64, 192, 384, 256 and 256 filters, respectively. First and
second convolutional layers have a 5 × 5 receptive field applied with a stride of 1 pixel each followed
by max pooling layer which pools 3 × 3 regions at strides of 2 pixels. Other convolutional layers
have a 3 × 3 receptive field applied with a stride of 1 pixel followed by max pooling layer which
pools 2 × 2 regions at strides of 2 pixels. Fully-connected layers have 2048, 1024 and 10 hidden
units, respectively. Dropout (Hinton et al., 2012) was applied to only fully-connected layers of the
network with the probability of retaining the unit being 0.5. All hidden units are ReLUs. Figure
6 shows the detailed structure of VGGNet (Szegedy et al., 2015) with three fully-connected layers
and 10 convolutional layers. Each ConvReLU box in the figure indicates a 3 × 3 convolutional layer
followed by ReLU activation. Also, all max pooling layers have 2 × 2 receptive fields with stride 2.
Dropout was applied to only fully-connected layers of the network with the probability of retaining
the unit being 0.5. For all experiments, the softmax classifier is used, and each model is trained by
optimizing the objective function using Adam learning rule (Kingma & Ba, 2014). For each out-of-
distribution dataset, we randomly select 1,000 images for tuning the penalty parameterβ, mini-batch
size and learning rate. The penalty parameter is chosen from β ∈ {0, 0.1, . . . 1.9, 2}, the mini-batch
size is chosen from {64, 128} and the learning rate is chosen from {0.001, 0.0005, 0.0002}. The
optimal parameters are chosen to minimize the detection error on the validation set. We drop the
learning rate by 0.1 at 60 epoch and models are trained for total 100 epochs. The best test result is
reported for each method.
Performance metrics. We measure the following metrics using threshold-based detectors:
2We do not use the extra SVHN dataset for training.

•	True negative rate (TNR) at 95% true positive rate (TPR). Let TP, TN, FP, and FN de-
note true positive, true negative, false positive and false negative, respectively. We measure
TNR = TN / (FP+TN), when TPR = TP / (TP+FN) is 95%.
•	Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). The ROC curve is a
graph plotting TPR against the false positive rate = FP / (FP+TN) by varying a threshold.
•	Area under the precision-recall curve (AUPR). The PR curve is a graph plotting the
precision = TP / (TP+FP) against recall = TP / (TP+FN) by varying a threshold. AUPR-IN
(or -OUT) is AUPR where in- (or out-of-) distribution samples are specified as positive.
•	Detection accuracy. This metric corresponds to the maximum classification proba-
bility over all possible thresholds δ: 1 - minδ Pin (q (x) ≤ δ) P (x is from Pin) +
Pout (q (x) > δ) P (x is from Pout) , where q(x) is a confident score such as a maxi-
mum value of softmax. We assume that both positive and negative examples have equal
probability of appearing in the test set, i.e., P (x is from Pin) = P (x is from Pout) = 0.5.
Note that AUROC, AUPR and detection accuracy are threshold-independent evaluation metrics.

Figure 6: Detailed structure of VGGNet with 13 layers.
Generating samples on a simple example. As shown in Figure 3(a) and Figure 3(b), we compare
the generated samples by original GAN and proposed GAN on a simple example where the target
distribution is a mixture of two Gaussian distributions. For both the generator and discriminator, we
use fully-connected neural networks with 2 hidden layers and 500 hidden units for each layer. For
all layers, we use ReLU activation function. We use a 100-dimensional Gaussian prior for the latent
variable z. For our method, we pre-train the simple fully-connected neural networks (2 hidden layers
and 500 ReLU units for each layer) by minimizing the cross entropy on target distribution samples
and the KL divergence on out-of-distribution samples generated by rejection sampling on bounded
2D box [-10, 10]2. The penalty parameter β is set to 1. We use ADAM learning rule (Kingma &
Ba, 2014) with a mini-batch size of 400. The initial learning rate is set to 0.002, and we train for
total 100 epochs.
Generating samples on MNIST. As shown in Figure 3(c) and Figure 3(d), we compare the gener-
ated samples of original and proposed GANs on MNIST dataset, which consists of greyscale images,
each containing a digit 0 to 9 with 60,000 training and 10,000 test images. We expand each image
to size 3 × 32 × 32. For both the generator and discriminator, we use deep convolutional GANs
(DCGANs) (Radford et al., 2015). The discriminator and generator consist of four convolutional
and deconvolutional layers, respectively. Convolutional layers have 128, 256, 512 and 1 filters, re-
spectively. Each convolutional layer has a 4 × 4 receptive field applied with a stride of 2 pixel. The
second and third convolutional layers are followed by batch normalization (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015).
For all layers, we use LeakyReLU activation function. Deconvolutional layers have 512, 256, 128
and 1 filters, respectively. Each deconvolutional layer has a 4 × 4 receptive field applied with a
stride of 2 pixel followed by batch normalization (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015) and ReLU activation.
For our method, we use a pre-trained simple CNNs (two convolutional layers followed by three
fully-connected layers) by minimizing the cross entropy on MNIST training samples and the KL
divergence on synthetic Gaussian noise. Convolutional layers have 128 and 256 filters, respectively.
Each convolutional layer has a 5 × 5 receptive field applied with a stride of 1 pixel each followed by
max pooling layer which pools 2 × 2 regions at strides of 2 pixels. The penalty parameter β is set
to 1. We use ADAM learning rule (Kingma & Ba, 2014) with a mini-batch size of 128. The initial
learning rate is set to 0.0002, and we train for total 50 epochs.

Table 2 reports the classification accuracy of VGGNets on CIFAR-10 and SVHN datasets under
various training losses shown in Figure 4. One can note that all methods do not degrade the original
classification performance, where the differences in classification errors of across all tested single
models are at most 1% in our experiments.

C.2 Calibration effects of confidence loss
We also verify the calibration effects (Guo et al., 2017) of our methods: whether a classifier trained
by our method can indicate when they are likely to be incorrect for test samples from the in-
distribution. In order to evaluate the calibration effects, we measure the expected calibration error
(ECE) (Naeini et al., 2015). Given test data {(x1, y1) , . . . , (xn, yn)}, we group the predictions into
M interval bins (each of size 1/M). Let Bm be the set of indices of samples whose prediction
confidence falls into the interval (mM-1, M]. Then, the accuracy of Bm is defined as follows:
acc(Bm )
1 X 1
|B | / 1 1{yi=arg max Pθ(y∣Xi)},
|Bm | i∈Bm	y
where θ is the model parameters of a classifier and 1A ∈ {0, 1} is the indicator function for event
A. We also define the confidence of Bm as follows:
Conf(Bm) = iB-∣ X q(Xi),
|Bm | i∈Bm
where q(xi) is the confidence of data i. Using these notations, we measure the expected calibration
error (ECE) as follows:
M |B |
ECE = T----------^aCC(Bm) - conf(Bm)∣.
n
m=1
One can note that ECE is zero if the confidence score can represent the true distribution. Table
3 shows the calibration effects of confidence loss when we define the confidence score q as the
maximum predictive distribution of a classifier. We found that the ECE of a classifier trained by our
methods is lower than that of a classifier trained by the standard cross entropy loss. This implies
that our proposed method is effective at calibrating predictions. We also remark that the temperature
scaling (Guo et al., 2017) provides further improvements under a classifier trained by our joint
confidence loss.

C.3 Experimental results using ODIN detector
In this section, we verify the effects of confidence loss using ODIN detector (Liang et al., 2017)
which is an advanced threshold-based detector using temperature scaling (Guo et al., 2017) and
input perturbation. The key idea of ODIN is the temperature scaling which is defined as follows:
Pθ (y = b|x; T)
eχpfb(X)/T)
Py eχp(fy (x)/T),
where T > 0 is the temperature scaling parameter and f = (f1 , . . . ,fK ) is final feature vector of
neural networks. For each data x, ODIN first calculates the pre-processed image xb by adding the
small perturbations as follows:
x0 = x - εsign (- 5x logPθ(y = yb|x; T)) ,
where ε is a magnitude of noise and yb is the predicted label. Next, ODIN feeds the pre-
processed data into the classifier, computes the maximum value of scaled predictive distribution,
i.e., maxy P§(y∣x0; T), and classifies it as positive (i.e., in-distribution) if the confidence score is
above some threshold δ.
For ODIN detector, the perturbation noise ε is chosen from {0, 0.0001, 0.001, 0.01}, and the tem-
perature T is chosen from {1, 10, 100, 500, 1000}. The optimal parameters are chosen to minimize
the detection error on the validation set. Figure 7 shows the performance of the OIDN and baseline
detector for each in- and out-of-distribution pair. First, we remark that the baseline detector using
classifiers trained by our joint confidence loss (blue bar) typically outperforms the ODIN detec-
tor using classifiers trained by the cross entropy loss (orange bar). This means that our classifier
can map in- and out-of-distributions more separately without pre-processing methods such as tem-
perature scaling. The ODIN detector provides further improvements if one uses it with our joint
confidence loss (green bar). In other words, our proposed training method can improve all prior
detection methods.

tive the better results. For each in-distribution, we minimize the KL divergence term in (1) using
training samples from an out-of-distribution dataset denoted by “seen”, where other “unseen” out-
of-distributions were also used for testing.
D Maximizing entropy
One might expect that the entropy of out-of-distribution is expected to be much higher compared to
that of in-distribution since the out-of-distribution is typically on a much larger space than the in-
distribution. Therefore, one can add maximizing the entropy of generator distribution to new GAN
loss in (3) and joint confidence loss in (4). However, maximizing the entropy of generator distribu-
tion is technically challenging since a GAN does not model the generator distribution explicitly. To
handle the issue, one can leverage the pull-away term (PT) (Zhao et al., 2017):
-H (PG (x)) wPT (PG (x))
1 X X G G (Zi)> G (Zj) !
M(M -1)=幺 UG(Zi)IlIlG(Zj)∣∣)
where H (∙) denotes the entropy, Zi, Zj 〜Ppri (z) and M is the number of samples. Intuitively,
one can expect the effect of increasing the entropy by minimizing PT since it corresponds to the
squared cosine similarity of generated samples. We note that (Dai et al., 2017) also used PT to
maximize the entropy. Similarly as in Section 3.2, we verify the effects ofPT using VGGNet. Table
5 shows the performance of the baseline detector for each in- and out-of-distribution pair. We found
that joint confidence loss with PT tends to (but not always) improve the detection performance.
However, since PT increases the training complexity and the gains from PT are relatively marginal
(or controversial), we leave it as an auxiliary option for improving the performance.

E Adding out-of-distribution class
Instead of forcing the predictive distribution on out-of-distribution samples to be closer to the uni-
form one, one can simply add an additional “out-of-distribution” class to a classifier as follows:
min EPin(xb,yb) - log Pθ (y = yb|xb) +EPout(x) - log Pθ (y = K + 1|x) ,	(5)
θ
where θ is a model parameter. Similarly as in Section 3.1, we compare the performance of the
confidence loss with that of above loss in (5) using VGGNets with for image classification on SVHN
dataset. To optimize the KL divergence term in confidence loss and the second term of (5), CIFAR-
10 training datasets are used. In order to compare the detection performance, we define the the
confidence score of input x as 1 - Pθ (y = K + 1|x) in case of (5). Table 6 shows the detection
performance for out-of-distribution. First, the classifier trained by our method often significantly
outperforms the alternative adding the new class label. This is because modeling explicitly out-of-
distribution can incur overfitting to trained out-of-distribution dataset.
