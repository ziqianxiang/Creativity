Table 1:	Evaluation of DisC and recent unsupervised word-level approaches on standard classificationtasks, with the character LSTM of Radford et al. (2017) shown for comparison. The top three resultsfor each dataset are bolded, the best is italicized, and the best word-level performance is underlined.
Table 2:	Performance of DisC and other recent approacheson pairwise similarity and classification tasks. The top threeresults for each task are bolded and the best is Underlined.
Table 3: The performance of an l2-regularized logit classifier over Bag-of-n-Grams (BonG) vectorsis generally similar to that of Bag-of-n-Cooccurrences (BonC) vectors for n = 2, 3 (largest differ-ences bolded). Evaluation settings are the same as in Section 6. Note that for unigrams the tworepresentations are equivalent.
Table 4: Performance comparison of element-wise product (DisC) and circular convolution forencoding local cooccurrences (best result for each task is bolded). Evaluation settings are the sameas in Section 6. Note that for unigrams the two representations are equivalent.
