Table 1: Average embedding error (equation 1) on held-out data. Results are averaged over forward,backward, and loop sequences. Errors are relative to a chance error of 1: values lower than 1 indicatethat equivalent (inequivalent) motions are close together (far apart) in the embedding space.
Table 2: Linear regression from the learned embedding to the translation and rotation of the KITTIodometry dataset consistently performs better than chance (guessing the mean value). Table entriesshow mean squared error Â± standard error (percent improvement).
Table 3: Interpolation distances on KITTI (as in Figure 4), averaged across test data. Distances areconsistently lower for the true frame than for visually similar frames (inside sequence) and dissimilarframes (outside sequence) when using the embedding, but not the Euclidean distance.
