Table 1: Results on digits datasets. Please note that ↑ means the result obtained using a few labeled targetsamples for validation. The reported accuracy of our method is obtained from C0. ENT is our proposed entropyminimization baseline, described in the appendix. MNIST(P1) and MNIST(P2) indicate different experimentalsettings used in Tzeng et al. (2017) and Bousmalis et al. (2017) respectively.
Table 2: Results on Visda2017 classification datasets (Peng et al. (2017)). DANN and MMD are distributionalignment methods proposed by (Ganin & Lempitsky (2014)) and (Long et al. (2015b)) respectively. Ours(retrain classifier) means the classifier retrained for our proposed generator as we mentioned in Sec 3.3. Ourproposed method shows much better performance than existing methods.
Table 3: Results on adaptation from GTA5 → Cityscapes. DANN and FCN Wild denote methods proposedby (Ganin & Lempitsky (2014)) and (Hoffman et al. (2016) respectively.
Table 4: Comparison with state-of-the-art methods on two benchmark datasets. Only methods with-out data augmentation are included. We used the same critic architecture as used in ImpGAN.
