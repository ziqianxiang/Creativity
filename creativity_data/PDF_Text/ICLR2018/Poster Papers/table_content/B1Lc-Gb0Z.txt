Table 1: The best top-1 test accuracy for each network over all epochs when trained with sign, qReLU, andfull-precision baseline activations on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet. The hard-threshold activations are trained withboth ftprop-mb with per-layer soft hinge losses (FTP-SH) and the saturated straight-through estimator (SSTE).
