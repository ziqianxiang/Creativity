Table 1: Average score and average time on test data. Average score is calculated using the meansquare error metric (MSE), time is in seconds. The regularization coefficients for our model havebeen set using a validation set with λdiv = 1, λmagn = -0.03 and λgrad = 0.4.
Table 2: Evaluation of our model’s spatial generalization ability. We train our model on two distinctregions and calculate the MSE on both regions for each trained model.
