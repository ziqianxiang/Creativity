Table 1: Z-diff score Higgins et al. (2017), the proposed SAP score and reconstruction error (perpixel) on the test sets for 2D Shapes and CelebA (β1 = 4, β2 = 60, λ = 10, λ1 = 5, λ2 = 500 for2D Shapes; β1 = 4, β2 = 32, λ = 2, λ1 = 1, λ2 = 80 for CelebA). For the results on a wider rangeof hyperparameter values, refer to Fig. 1 and Fig. 2.
Table 2: Attribute classification accuracy on CelebA: A classifier wk = 反.}=, Pxryk=I μφ(xj -∣x .∙yl=0∣ PXryk=0 μφ(xi) is computed for every attribute k using the training set and a bias is learnedby minimizing the hinge loss. Accuracy on other attributes stays about same across all methods.
