Table 1: Classification accuracy on hypernym relationship test set from WordNet.
Table 2: KL(column||row). Cells in boldface indicate true WORDNET hypernym relationships(column row). Our model predicts a synset pair as a hypernym if the KL less than 1900, where thisvalue is tuned based on the validation set. Most relationship pairs are correctly predicted except forthe underlined cells.

Interestingly, we found that α → 1 (KL) offers the best result for both prediction accuracy andHYPERLEX . It is possible that α = 1 is sufficiently asymmetric enough to distinguish hypernym directionality,but does not have as sharp penalty as in α > 1, which can help learning.
