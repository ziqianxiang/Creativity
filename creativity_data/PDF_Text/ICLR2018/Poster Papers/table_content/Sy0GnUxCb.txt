Table 1: The effect of opponent sampling. E[Loss] and E[Win] are the expected loss and win-ratesfor agents trained with a particular δ as described in 5.4. For humanoid δ = 0.5 gives highestwin-rate and lowest loss, whereas for Ant δ = 0 was best.
Table 2: Average number of steps before agent falls. Sumo Agent refers to the agent trained in Sumoenvironment whereas Walker Agent refers to the agent trained to walk in a single agent environment.
