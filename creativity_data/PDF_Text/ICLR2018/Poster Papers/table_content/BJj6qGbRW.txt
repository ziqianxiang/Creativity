Table 1: Few-Shot Learning — Omniglot accuracies. Siamese Net results are extracted from Vinyalset al. (2016) reimplementation.
Table 2: Few-shot learning — Mini-Imagenet average accuracies with 95% confidence intervals.
Table 3: Semi-Supervised Learning — Omniglot accuracies.
Table 4: Semi-Supervised Learning — Mini-Imagenet average accuracies with 95% confidenceintervals.
Table 5: Omniglot (left) and Mini-Imagneet (right), average accuracies are shown at both tables, theGNN-AL is the learned criterion that performs Active Learning by selecting the sample that willmaximally reduce the loss of the current classification. The GNN - Random is also selecting onesample, but in this case a random one. Mini-Imagenet results are presented with 95% confidenceintervals.
