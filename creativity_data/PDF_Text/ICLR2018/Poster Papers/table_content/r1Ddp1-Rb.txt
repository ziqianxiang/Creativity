Table 1: Validation errors for ERM and mixup on the development set of ImageNet-2012.
Table 2: Results on the corrupted label experiments for the best models.
Table 3: Classification errors of ERM and mixup models when tested on adversarial examples.
Table 4: ERM and mixup classification errors on the UCI datasets.
Table 5: Results of the ablation studies on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Reported are the median test errorsof the last 10 epochs. A tick (âœ“) means the component is different from standard ERM training,whereas a cross (X) means it follows the standard training practice. AC: mix between all classes. SC:mix within the same class. RP: mix between random pairs. KNN: mix between k-nearest neighbors(k=200). Please refer to the text for details about the experiments and interpretations.
