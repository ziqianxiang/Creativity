Table 1: Hyperparameter values used in experiments. TT=target task, SP=self-playC	MazebaseThe agent has full visibility of the maze when the light is on. If light is off, the agent can only seethe light switch. In self-play, Bob does not need to worry about things that are invisible to him. Forexample, if Alice started with light “off” in reverse self-play, Bob does not need to match the stateof the door, because it would be invisible to him when the light is off.
