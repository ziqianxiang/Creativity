Table 1: 5-way and 20-way, 1-shot and 5-shot classification accuracies on Omniglot, with 95%confidence intervals where available. For each task, the best-performing method is highlighted, alongwith any others whose confidence intervals overlap.
Table 2: 5-way, 1-shot and 5-shot classification accuracies on mini-ImageNet, with 95% confidenceintervals where available. For each task, the best-performing method is highlighted, along with anyothers whose confidence intervals overlap.
Table 3: Results on multi-arm bandit problems. For each, we highlighted the best performing method,and any others whose performance is not statistically-significantly different (based on a one-sidedt-test with p = 0.05). Except for SNAIL and MAML, we report the results from Duan et al. (2016).
Table 4: Performance on tabular MDPs, scaled by the average reward achieved by value iteration.
Table 5: Average time to find the goal on each episode in the small and large mazes. SNAIL solvesthe mazes the fastest, and improves the most from the first to second episode.
Table 6: The ablations we conducted on the few-shot classification task. From these, we concludethat (i) both TC and attention are essential for the best performance, and (ii) SNAILâ€˜s improvedperformance cannot be entirely explained by the deeper embedding.
