Table 1: Experimental results of the adaptive data generation algorithm. Here, ` denotes the numberof iterations. The first four rows are sequences of means and standard deviations of (Θ('), Φ(')),compared with the true label distribution (Θ?, Φ?). The last row is for the validation/test errors.
Table 2: Comparison of the state of the arts on the MPIIGaze dataset. The error is the mean angleerror in degrees. The parameter α denotes the learning rate used for training the predictor. Inthe second and third columns, ‘R’ denotes ‘Real’, ‘S’ denotes ’Synthetic’, ‘RS’ denotes ‘RefinedSynthetic’, and ‘RR’ denotes ‘Refined Real’. Our approaches with hyperparameters (` = 2, λcyc =10, λfeature = 0.5) achieve the state-of-the-art performances.
Table 3: Test results with different pairs of regularization parameters λcyc and λfeature.
Table 4: Experimental results of the adaptive data generation algorithm with a different reductionmethod. Here, ` denotes the number of iterations.
