Table 1: Comparison between the baseline DQN, Dueling and A3C and their NoisyNet versionin terms of median and mean human-normalised scores defined in Eq. (18). We report on the lastcolumn the percentage improvement on the baseline in terms of median human-normalised score.
Table 2: Comparison between the baseline DQN, Dueling and A3C and their NoisyNet version interms of median and mean human-normalised scores defined in Eq. (18). In the case of A3C weinculde both factorised and non-factorised variant of the algorithm. We report on the last column thepercentage improvement on the baseline in terms of median human-normalised score.
