Table 1: Accuracy and average speed-up of NGDS vs. baseline methods. Accuracies are computedon a test set of 73 tasks. Speed-up of a method is the geometric mean of its per-task speed-up (ratioof synthesis time of PROSE and of the method) when restricted to a subset of tasks with PROSE’ssynthesis time is ≥ 0.5 sec.
Table 2: Accuracies, mean speed-ups, and % of branches taken for different ablations of NGDS.
Table 3: Generalization accuracy and performance of RobustFill for different beam sizes and numbersof training examples.
Table 5: Generalization accuracy and speed-up of NGDS variants vs. PROSE where all methods usea machine learning based ranking function from Gulwani & Jain (2017).
