Table 1: Pairwise marginal distribution for select label pairs when Causal Controller is trainedon G1 in plain text, its completion cG1[square brackets], and the true pairwise distribution(inparentheses). Note that G1 treats Male and Young labels as independent, but does not completelyfail to generate a reasonable (product of marginals) approximation. Also note that when an edge isadded Y oung → M ale, the learned distribution is nearly exact. Note that both graphs contain theedge Male → Mustache and so are able to learn that women have no mustaches.
Table 2: Marginal distribution of pretrained Causal Controller labels when Causal Controller istrained on CelebA Causal Graph (PG1) and its completion(PcG1), where cG1 is the (nonunique)largest DAG containing G1 (See appendix).

Results are obtained by sampling the joint labeldistribution 1000 times and forming a histogram of the scalar outputs corresponding to any label.
