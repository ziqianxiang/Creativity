Table 1: Accuracy of a separate model trained to classify attributes from images, evaluated on testdata and generated images. We condition and evaluate the generated images on the same labels asthe test data. For comparison, the results of a similar task using invertible CGANs for generation(Perarnau et al., 2016) are provided. However, since the full list of salient attributes was not given inthe paper, we emphasize that they are not directly comparable as the two experiments use a slightlydifferent set of attribute labels. We also measure the distance in latent space that prior samples areshifted, weighted by 1∕σz2. Actors trained with a latent distance penalty λdist have slightly worseaccuracy, but find latent points much closer to the prior samples and produce a greater diversityof images (see supplemental Figures 7 and 8). Interestingly, an actor trained without a distancepenalty achieves higher classification accuracy than the test set itself, possibly by generating imageswith more exaggerated and distinctive features than real data. A ”small model” CGAN with 85xfewer parameters (3 fully connected layers of 256 units) generates images (supplemental Figure 14)of comperable quality. Due to the smaller capacity, the model finds more local solutions (smallerzMSE) that have slightly less attribute accuracy, but are more visually similar to the prior samplewithout an explicit regularization term.
Table 2: Average rewards and constraint satisfaction rates (in parentheses) for unconditional (Prior)and conditional generation. Samples from the prior receive low rewards, on average, and near zerosatisfaction rates from both the pitch class (C Major) and note density (≥ 192 notes) constraints. Af-ter applying an actor optimized only for the C Major scale (GP=CMaj,d=0), the pitch class constraintis fully satisfied 70.8% of the time with only a minor effect on density. The average value close to1 also indicates that when the constraint is not satisfied, it is typically off by only a few notes. Ap-plying an actor function optimized for the C Major scale and high density (GP=CMaj ,d=192) causesboth constraints to be satisfied at high rates, with a slightly larger shift in latent space.
