(2014) developed Shooter, an approach of using a tree-structured feature ex-pansion to identify pairwise and higher-order multiplicative interactions in a L1 regularized logisticregression model. This approach is special because it relaxes our hierarchical hereditary assump-tion, which requires subset interactions to exist when their corresponding higher-order interactionalso exists (Section 3). Specifically, Shooter relaxes this assumption by only requiring at least one(d - 1)-way interaction to exist when its corresponding d-way interaction exists.
