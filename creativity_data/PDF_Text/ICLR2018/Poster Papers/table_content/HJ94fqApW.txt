Table 1: Comparisons between different pruned networks and the base network.
Table 2: Comparisons between ResNet-20 and its two pruned versions. The last columns are thenumber of channels of each residual modules after pruning.
Table 3: Attributes of different versions of ResNet and their single crop errors on ILSVRC2012benchmark. The last column means the parameter size of pruned model vs. the base model.
Table 4: mIOU reported on different test datasets for the base model and the pruned model.
