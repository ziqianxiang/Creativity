Table 1: Example behavior of a soft order layer. For each task t, and at each depth d, the effectof increasing the activation of of this particular layer is to expand the left side of the “4” in a mannerappropriate to the functional context (e.g., the magnitude of the effect decreases with depth). Resultsfor other layers are similar, suggesting that the layers implement functional primitives.
