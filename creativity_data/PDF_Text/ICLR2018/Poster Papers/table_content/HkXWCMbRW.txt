Table 1: Structure of the ResNet and the cResNet architectures in terms of of residual block types,their number, and their associated spatial dimension. Numbers are reported for ResNet-networkswith RGB images of spatial dimensions 224 × 224 as input, and for cResNet-networks with com-pressed representations of spatial dimensions 28 × 28 as inputs. For a detailed description of theblocks see Appendix A.3Network	root conv2_x 56 × 56		conv3_x 28 × 28	conv4_x 14×14	conv5_x 7×7	FLOPs [×109]ResNet-50	yes	3	4	6	3	3.86ResNet-71	yes	3	4	13	3	5.38CResNet-39	no	none	4	~~~6~~	_	_	3一	—2.95^cResNet-51	no	none	4	10	3	3.83cResNet-72	no	none	4	17	3	5.361We obtain the bpp of an operating point by averaging the bpp of all images in the validation set.
Table 2: Image classification accuracies after 28 epochs for the 3.75× training rate schedule em-ployed and image segmentation performance for the Deeplab training rate schedule. For each op-erating point the inputs to ResNet-networks are reconstructed/decoded RGB images and inputs tocResNet-networks are compressed representations. For comparison we show the results with thesame training settings, but starting from the original RGB images, in the top row.
Table 3: Structure of the ResNet and the cResNet architectures. The numbers reported are forResNet-networks where the inputs are RGB images with a spatial dimensions 224 × 224 and forcResNet-networks where the inputs are compressed representations with spatial dimensions 28 × 28.
