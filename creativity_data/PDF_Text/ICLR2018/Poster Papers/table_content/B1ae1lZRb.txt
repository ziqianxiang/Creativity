Table 1: Top-1 validation set error rate (%) on ImageNet-1K for ResNet-18 stu-dent network as precision of activations (A) and weight (W) changes. The lastthree columns show error rate when the student ResNet-18 is paired with ResNet-34,ResNet-50 and ResNet-101.
Table 2: Top-1 validation set error rate (%) on ImageNet-1K for ResNet-34 stu-dent network as precision of activations (A) and weight (W) changes. The lastthree columns show error rate when the student ResNet-34 is paired with ResNet-34,ResNet-50 and ResNet-101.
Table 3: Top-1 validation set error rate (%) on ImageNet-1K forResNet-50 student network as precision of activations (A) andweight (W) changes. The final two columns show error rate whenthe student ResNet-50 is paired with ResNet-50 and ResNet-101.
Table 4: Top-1 ImageNet-1K validation set error rate (%) with scheme-A and scheme-C forResNet-34 and ResNet-50 student networks with ternary and 4-bits precision.
