Table 1: Inception Score and AM Score Results. Models in the same column share the same networkstructures & hyper-parameters. We applied dynamic / predefined labeling for models that requiretarget classes.
Table 2: The maximum value of mean MS-SSIM of various models over the ten classes on CIFAR-10.
Table 3: Inception Score comparison on CIFAR-10. Splitting GAN uses the class splitting techniqueto enhance the class label information, which is orthogonal to AM-GAN.
