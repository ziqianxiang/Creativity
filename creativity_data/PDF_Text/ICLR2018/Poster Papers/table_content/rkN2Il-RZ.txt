Table 1: Quantitative results comparing the accuracy and diversity of visual samples produced through sym2imginference by SCAN and three baselines: a SCAN with unstructured vision (SCANU, lower Î² means more visualentanglement), a SCAN with a reverse grounding KL term for both the model itself and its recombination operator(SCANR) and two recent joint multimodal embedding models, JMVAE and TrELBO. Higher accuracy and lowerdiversity indicate better performance. Test values can be computed either by directly feeding the ground truthsymbols (test symbols), or by applying trained recombination operators to make the model recombine in thelatent space (test operators).
