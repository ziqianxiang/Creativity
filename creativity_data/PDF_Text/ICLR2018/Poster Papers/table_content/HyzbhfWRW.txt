Table 1:	CIFARs: Top-1 classification errors.
Table 2:	Fine-grained recognition: Top-1 errors.
Table 3: Cross-domain classification: Top-1 accuracies using models trained on CIFAR-10/100.
Table 4: Summary of datasets used for experiments across different tasks (C: classification, C-c:classification cross-domain, S: segmentation).The natural images span from those of objects in plainbackground to cluttered indoor and outdoor scenes. The objects vary from simple digits to humansinvolved in complex activities.
