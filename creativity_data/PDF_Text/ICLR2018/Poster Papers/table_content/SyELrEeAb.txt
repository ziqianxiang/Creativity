Table 1: Precision accuracy over an extensive set of configurations and methods; we average over100 simulations for a grand total of 4,400 fitted models. The setting a in PSD and Spatial determinesthe amount of sparsity in the latent population structure: lower a means higher sparsity. ICM issignificantly more robust to spurious associations, outperforming other methods by up to 45.3%.
Table 2: Number of significant loci at genome-wide significance (p < 7.2 Ã— 10-8) for each of theten traits from NFBC data. The counts for GCAT are obtained from Song et al. (2015, Table 1);counts for LMM, PCA, and uncorrected are obtained from Kang et al. (2010, Table 2). The implicitcausal model (ICM) captures causal relationships comparable to previously work.
