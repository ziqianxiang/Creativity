Table 1: Previous results on automated shift cipher cracking with limited ciphertext length.
Table 2: Average proportion of characters correctly mapped in a given sequence. The “Freq. Anal-ysis” column is simple frequency analysis applied to the same corpus our model observes. ForVigenere we also show the score if the key were known (note: the key is left unknown to ourmodel).
