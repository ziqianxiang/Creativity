Table 1: Model Runtimes (seconds) for different placements (lower is better). OOM: Out Of Memory.
Table 2: Best, median and worst runtimes for 10 trials each with a different randomized grouping ofoperations. These results demonstrate that the Hierarchical Planner, which uses learned groupingsrather than random ones, is able to significantly reduce runtime.
