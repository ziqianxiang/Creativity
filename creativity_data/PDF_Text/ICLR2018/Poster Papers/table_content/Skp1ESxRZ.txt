Table 1: LL machine instruction semanticsThe third class, including only FINAL, is an instruction to terminate the machine’s execution andproduce the final result. This instruction should be included in any non-differentiable machine design.
Table 2: The numbers of correct instruction traces and instruction type traces for each example in theAM training set. The two numbers are provided in the column of “# of correct traces" in the form ofn(m), where n (outside the brackets) indicates the number of instruction traces, and m (inside thebrackets) indicates the number of instruction type traces.
Table 3: Experimental results on While-Lang and Lambda-Lang dataset. We evaluate our approach(ours), seq2seq (Vinyals et al., 2015b), seq2tree (Dong & Lapata, 2016), with Stack LSTM, QueueLSTM and DeQue LSTM from (Grefenstette et al., 2015). “Std-10" indicates the standard training setwith 10,000 samples of length 10, “Std-50” indicates the standard training set with 1,000,000 samplesof length 50, and “Curriculum" indicates the specially designed learning curriculum. “Test-LEN"indicates the testset including inputs of length LEN.
