Table 1: Reconstructing Accuracy and Prior Validity estimated using Monte Carlo method. Ourproposed method (SD-VAE) performance significantly better than existing works.
Table 2: Predictive performance using encoded mean latent vector. Test LL and RMSE are reported.
Table 3: Diversity as statistics from pair-wise distances measured as 1 - s, where s is one of thesimilarity metrics. So higher values indicate better diversity. We show mean Â± stddev of 1020 pairsamong 100 molecules. Note that we report results from GVAE and our SD-VAE, because CVAEhas very low valid priors, thus completely only failing this evaluation protocol.
Table 4: Interpolation between two valid programs (the top and bottom ones in brown) where eachprogram occupies a row. Programs in red are with syntax errors. Statements in blue are with se-mantic errors such as referring to unknown variables. Rows without coloring are correct programs.
