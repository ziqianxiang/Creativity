Table 1: Comparison between standard learning and our BC learning. We performed K -fold cross validationusing the original fold settings. We performed cross-validation 5 times for the ESC-50 and ESC-10 datasets,and show the standard error. BC learning improves the performance of all models on all datasets, even whenwe use a strong data augmentation scheme. Our EnvNet-v2 trained with BC learning performs the best andsurpasses the human performance on ESC-50.
Table 2: Ablation analysis. We trained EnvNet on ESC-50using various settings. The results show that the trainingdata variation is not the only matter.
