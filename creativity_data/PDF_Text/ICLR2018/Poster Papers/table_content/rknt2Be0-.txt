Table 1: (ToP) Messages used by both agents when sPeaking about any object in round 40. (Middle)Ten moSt frequent meSSageS uSed by each agent to deScribe a red sphere in round 6, 940. (Bottom)MeSSageS moSt often uSed by both agentS for each object tyPe in round 16, 760. BracketS indicate thevariation often Seen at the laSt character. UnderScoreS indicate blankS.
Table 2: (Top) Potential composition analysis of the messages from round 16,760 (bottom of Table 1).
Table 3: Potential analysis of the messages observed in the zero-shot test. Gray cells indicateobject types unseen during the training phase. Italic symbols are used to specify shapes and romansymbols to specify colors. b indicates deleting a single prefix b. e indicates deleting a single prefix e.
Table 4: Communication accuracy when agents were given objects not seen during the training.
Table 5: Meaning vectors are composed of (a) subject vectors and (b) predicate vectors. (c) shows 10out of 100 possible meaning vectors.
Table 6: (Top) Messages used by a majority of the population for each of the given meanings.
Table 7: Accuracy when each object type is given to the speaker.
Table 8: Messages most often used by the two agents when speaking about a given object. Shadedcells indicate the objects not seen during the training. Brackets indicate the variation often seen at thelast character.
