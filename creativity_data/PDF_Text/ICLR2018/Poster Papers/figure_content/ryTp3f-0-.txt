Figure 1: Workflow-guided exploration (WGE). After inducing workflow lattices from demonstra-tions, the workflow policy πw performs exploration by sampling episodes from sampled workflows.
Figure 2: From each demonstration, we induce a workflow lattice based on the actions in thatdemonstration. Given a new environment, the workflow policy samples a workflow (a path in thelattice, as shown in bold) and then samples actions that fit the steps of the workflow.
Figure 3: Success rates of different approaches on the MiniWoB tasks. DOMnet+WGE outper-forms Shi17 on all but two tasks and effectively solves a vast majority.
Figure 4: Comparison between DOMnet+BC+RL and DOMnet+WGE on several of the mostdifficult tasks, evaluated on test reward. DOMnet+WGE trained on 10 demonstrations outper-forms DOMnet+BC+RL even with 1000 demonstrations.
Figure 5: The architecture of the neural policy πn . The inputs from the state are denoted in blue,while the outputs are denoted in red. Q = query vector; M = memory matrix.
