Figure 1: Observational and interventional samples from CausalBEGAN. Our architecture canbe used to sample not only from the joint distribution (conditioned on a label) but also from theinterventional distribution, e.g., under the intervention do(M ustache = 1). The two distributionsare clearly different since P(M ale = 1|M ustache = 1) = 1 and P(Bald = 1|M ale = 0) = 0 inthe data distribution P.

Figure 5: Intervening/Conditioning on Mouth Slightly Open label in CelebA Causal Graph withCausalGAN. Since Smiling → M outhSlightlyOpen in CelebA Causal Graph, we do not ex-pect do(Mouth Slightly Open = 1) to affect the probability of Smiling = 1, i.e., P(Smiling =1|do(Mouth Slightly Open = 1)) = P(Smiling = 1) = 0.48. However on the bottom row, condi-tioning on Mouth Slightly Open = 1 increases the proportion of smiling images (From 0.48 to 0.76in the dataset), although 10 images may not be enough to show this difference statistically.

Figure 7: Intervening/Conditioning on Narrow Eyes label in CelebA Causal Graph withCausalBEGAN. Since Smiling → Narrow Eyes in CelebA Causal Graph, we do not ex-pect do(Narrow Eyes = 1) to affect the probability of Smiling = 1, i.e., P(Smiling =1|do(Narrow Eyes = 1)) = P(S miling = 1) = 0.48. However on the bottom row, condition-ing on Narrow Eyes = 1 increases the proportion of smiling images (From 0.48 to 0.59 in thedataset), although 10 images may not be enough to show this difference statistically. As a rareartifact, in the dark image in the third column the generator appears to rule out the possibility ofNarrow Eyes = 0 instead of demonstrating Narrow Eyes = 1.
Figure 8: The causal graph used for simulations for both CaUsalGAN and CausalBEGAN, calledCelebA Causal Graph (G1). We also add edges (see Appendix Section 8.10) to form the completegraph "cG1". We also make use of the graph rcG1, which is obtained by reversing the direction ofevery edge in cG1.

Figure 12: Intervening/Conditioning on Wearing Lipstick label in CelebA Causal Graph. SinceMale → W earingLipstick in CelebA Causal Graph, we do not expect do(Wearing Lipstick = 1)to affect the probability of Male = 1, i.e., P(M ale = 1|do(Wearing Lipstick = 1)) = P(M ale =1) = 0.42. Accordingly, the top row shows both males and females who are wearing lipstick.
Figure 13: Intervening/Conditioning on Narrow Eyes label in CelebA Causal Graph. SinceSmiling → Narrow Eyes in CelebA Causal Graph, we do not expect do(Narrow Eyes = 1) to affectthe probability of Smiling = 1, i.e., P(Smiling = 1|do(Narrow Eyes = 1)) = P(Smiling =1) = 0.48. However on the bottom row, conditioning on Narrow Eyes = 1 increases the proportionof smiling images (From 0.48 to 0.59 in the dataset), although 10 images may not be enough to showthis difference statistically.
Figure 14: Intervening/Conditioning on Bald label in CelebA Causal Graph. Since Male → Baldin CelebA Causal Graph, we do not expect do(Bald = 1) to affect the probability of Male = 1,i.e., P(M ale = 1|do(Bald = 1)) = P(M ale = 1) = 0.42. Accordingly, the top row shows bothbald males and bald females. The bottom row of images sampled from the conditional distributionP(.|Bald = 1) shows only male images because in the dataset P(M ale = 1|Bald = 1) ≈ 1.

Figure 18: Omitting the nonobvious margin b3 = γ3 * relu(bι) - relu(b2) results in poorer imagequality particularly for rare labels such as mustache. We compare samples from two interventional dis-tributions. Samples from P(.|do(M ustache = 1)) (top) have much poorer image quality comparedto those under P(.|do(M ustache = 0)) (bottom).
