Figure 1: Illustration of the roll-in/roll-out mechanism used in SEARNN. The goal is to obtain a vector of costsfor each cell of the RNN in order to define a cost-sensitive loss to train the network. These vectors have oneentry per possible token. Here, we show how to obtain the vector of costs for the red cell. First, we use a roll-inpolicy to predict until the cell of interest. We highlight here the learned policy where the network passes its ownprediction to the next cell. Second, we proceed to the roll-out phase. We feed every possible token (illustratedby the red letters) to the next cell and let the model predict the full sequence. For each token a, we obtain apredicted sequence ya. Comparing it to the ground truth sequence y yields the associated cost c(a).
