Figure 1: The two-person image description game. Speaker observes an image and generates amessage (i.e. a sequence of discrete symbols). The listener, after observing a separate image and themessage, must correctly decide whether it is seeing the same object as the speaker (left side; output1) or not (right side; output 0).
Figure 2: Example images of the dataset. There are eight colors (blue, red, white, gray, yellow,green, cyan, magenta), and five shapes (box, sphere, cylinder, capsule, ellipsoid), giving us total 40combinations.
Figure 3: Agent model architecture. The visual module processes the image, and the language modulegenerates or consumes messages. The decision module accepts embeddings from both modules andproduces the output. The solid arrows indicate modifying the output from the previous layer. Thedotted arrows indicate copying the output from the previous layer.
Figure 4: Progress during the training (best seen in color). (Top) We plot the training accuracy,training loss, average message length and average message distinctness in each round. (Bottom) Weplot the perplexities and the Jaccard similarity of the messages spoken by both agents in each round.
Figure 5: Ten communication examples when the speaker is given a blue box. Five examples on theleft show when the listener is given blue objects. Five examples on the right show when the listeneris given objects of different colors.
Figure 6: Scatter plots of the image embedding from the agentsâ€™ visual module. T-SNE was used toreduce the dimension to 2D.
