Figure 1: Comparing asymptotics with empirical values of bias and variance on P = Gamma(1, 1)using 100,000 independent evaluations: (a)-(b) shows a simple case, P = Gamma(1, 1), and (c)-(d)shows a challenging case. Observation: (a) the IWAE is negatively biased, underestimating log p(x),with asymptotic expression (10) agreeing very well with empirical bias; (b) empirical and asymptoticvariance (11) in good agreement. (c) for a challenging case, the bias asymptotics match empiricalestimates for K ≥ 10; (d) in the challenging case, the variance asymptotics match empirical estimatesfor K ≥ 10.

Figure 4: Comparing asymptotics with empirical values of bias and variance on P = Gamma(1, 1)using 100,000 independent evaluations: (a)-(b) shows a simple case, P = Gamma(1, 1), and (c)-(d)shows a challenging case. Observation: (a) both DVI and JVI correct for bias efficiently; (b) DVI andJVI variance closely match. (c) for a challenging case, the JVI bias is considerably smaller than theDVI bias; (d) in the challenging case, JVI has a higher variance than both DVI and IWAE.
