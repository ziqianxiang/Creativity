Figure 1: Probabilistic causal model. (left) Variable x causes y coupled with a shared variable β.
Figure 2: (left) Causal graph for GWAS. The population structure of SNPs for each individual (zn)confounds inference of how each SNP (xnm) causes a trait of interest (yn). (right) Implicit causalmodel for gwas (described in § 3.2). Its structure is the same as the causal graph but also placespriors over parameters φ and θ and with a latent variable wm per SNP.
