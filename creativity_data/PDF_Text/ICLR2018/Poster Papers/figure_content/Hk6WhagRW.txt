Figure 1: High-level overview of the negotiation environment that we implement. Agent A consis-tently refers to the agent who goes first.
Figure 2: a) Training curves for self-interested agents learning to negotiate under the various com-munication channels. The results show the mean across 20 different random seeds, as well as boot-strapped confidence intervals via shading (only visible for the linguistic communication case)b) The optimality of the proposed item division as negotiation proceeds for two selfish agents com-municating via the proposal channel, shown with error bars for interquartile range.
Figure 3: a) Unigram statistics of symbol usage broken down by turn and by position within the utter-ance for prosocial agents communicating via the linguistic channel. b) Bigram counts for prosocialagents communicating via the linguistic channel, sorted by frequency.
Figure 4: PCA plot of whitened opponent ID embeddings that was learnt by a fixed agent 1 for avariety of reward schemes and communication channels.
Figure 5: a) Unigram statistics of symbol usage broken down by turn and by position within theutterance for selfish agents communicating via the linguistic channel. b) Bigram counts for selfishagents communicating via the linguistic channel, sorted by frequency.
Figure 6: Bigram usage in all interaction pairs between a fixed prosocial agent A and a communityof 5 prosocial agent Bs. This is the only case where the average joint optimality reward of thenegotiating agents is higher than the no communication baseline.
