Figure 1: Proposed Separated Atomic Predictability (SAP) score and the Z-diff disentanglementscore (Higgins et al., 2017) as a function of average reconstruction error (per pixel) on the test setof 2D Shapes data for β-VAE and the proposed DIP-VAE. The plots are generated by varying β forβ-VAE, and λod for DIP-VAE-I and DIP-VAE-II (the number next to each point is the value of thesehyperparameters, respectively).
