Figure 1: Execution of a Parametrized Hierarchical Procedure (PHP) on the long-hand additiondomain. The highest-level add procedure invokes a lower-level procedure add1 which furtherinvokes write. write takes the elementary action WRITE OUT 2, and returns to add1. add1chooses not to return, incrementing its program counter to 1, and then invoking carry, which inturn takes the elementary action MOVE CARRY LEFT.
Figure 2: Sample complexity in the NanoCraft domain. The accuracy is the fraction of completelycorrect test episodes, as a function of the number of demonstrations annotated with the supervisorâ€™shierarchy. PHP-{16, 32, 64} shows our results for training PHPs from the indicated total number ofdemonstrations. The results for NPL-{64, 128, 256} and NPI were provided by Li et al. (2017).
