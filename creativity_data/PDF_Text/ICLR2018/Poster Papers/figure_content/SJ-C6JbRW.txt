Figure 1: The competitive-collaborative Mechanical TUrker Descent (MTD) algorithm. In eachround Turkers are competitive to produce the best training data. However, in subsequent rounds theyshare all the data from the previous rounds so they are collaborative in the long term. The shareddatasets are omitted here for simplicity.
