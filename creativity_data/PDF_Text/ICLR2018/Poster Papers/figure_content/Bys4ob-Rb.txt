Figure 1: Illustration of the margin function f (x) for a simple two-layer network. (a) Contours off (x) in an 'âˆž ball around x. Sharp curvature near X renders a linear approximation highly inaccu-rate, and f (Afgsm (x)) obtained by maximising this approximation is much smaller than f(Aopt(x)).
Figure 2: Upper bounds on adversarial error for different networks on MNIST.
Figure 3: (a) Upper bound (SDP) and lower bound (PGD) on the adversarial error for differentnetworks. (b) Error of SDP-NN against 3 different attacks.
Figure 4: (a) Weighted and unweighted regularization schemes. The network produced by weightinghas a better certificate as well as lower error against the PGD attack. (b) The dual certificate ofrobustness (SDP dual), obtained automatically during training, is almost as good as the certificateproduced by exactly solving the SDP.
