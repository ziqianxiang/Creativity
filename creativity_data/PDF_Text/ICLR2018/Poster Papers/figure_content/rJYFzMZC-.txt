Figure 1: The process is a narrative of entitystate changes induced by actions. In each sen-tence, these state changes are induced by simu-lated actions and must be remembered.
Figure 2: Model Summary. The sentence encoder converts a sentence to a vector representation, ht. The actionselector and entity selector use the vector representation to choose the actions that are applied and the entitiesthat are acted upon in the sentence. The simulation module indexes the action and entity state embeddings,and applies the transformation to the entities. The state predictors predict the new state of the entities if a statechange has occurred. Equation references are provided in parentheses.

We alsoprovide examples where the model fails to select the correct entities because it does not identify themapping between a reference construct such as “pizza” (Ex. 4) or “dough” (Ex. 5) and the set ofentities that composes it, showcasing the difficulty of selecting the full set for a composed entity.
