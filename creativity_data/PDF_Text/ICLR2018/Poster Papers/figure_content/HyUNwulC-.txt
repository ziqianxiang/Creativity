Figure 1: The structure of the synthetic example and the GILR-LSTM architecture we used to tackleit. We feed in one-hot unit vectors x which are chosen uniformly at random (with replacement). Theclass is determined by the very first vector x0, which has a fixed direction. The sign of x0 determinesthe class. In the diagram, each rounded block indicates a cell of the RNN, whilst the square indicatesa linear unit.
Figure 2: Learning curves for GILR-LSTM and CuDNN LSTM architectures for various sequencelengths. Each plot shows the moving mean and standard deviation of classification accuracy over fivetraining runs, with the exception of a single run for CuDNN LSTM on 1 million sequence length.
