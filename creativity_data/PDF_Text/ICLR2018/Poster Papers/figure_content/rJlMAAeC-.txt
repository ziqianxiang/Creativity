Figure 1: NPI with combinator abstraction.
Figure 2: Pseudo-code for the set of combinators.
Figure 3: Example combinatory program of BSTEP. NOP is special ACT which does nothing.
Figure 4: Example execution of the combinator BSTEP program. SWAP, PLRIGHT and P2_RIGHTare in fact appliers which need to be parsed as COMPSWAP and RSHIFT. We omit this step andtreat them as ACTs in the figure for brevity.
Figure 5: Prediction accuracy on thefull combinator set with 4 callable ar-guments.
