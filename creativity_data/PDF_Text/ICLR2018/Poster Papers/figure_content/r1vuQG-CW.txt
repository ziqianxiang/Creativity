Figure 1: Hexagonal G-CNN. A p6 group convolution is applied to a single-channel hexagonal im-age f and filter ψ1 , producing a single p6 output feature map f ?g ψ1 with 6 orientation channels.
Figure 2: Four candidate coordinate systems for a hexagonal grid. Notice that the cube coordinatesystem uses three integer indexes and both the axial and cube coordinate system may have negativeindices when using a top left origin.
Figure 3: Excess space when storing hexagonal lattices, where gray cells represent non-zero values.
Figure 4: Hexagonal Convolution filters (left) represented in 2D memory (right) for filters of sizethree (blue) and five (blue and green). Standard 2D Convolution using both feature map and filterstored according to the coordinate system is equivalent to convolution on the hexagonal lattice. Notethat for the offset coordinate system two separate planar convolution are required — one for evenand one for odd rows.
