Figure 1: Attributions generated by occluding portions of the input image with squared grey patchesof different sizes. Notice how the size of the patches influence the result, with focus on the mainsubject only when using bigger patches.
Figure 2: Attribution generated by applying several attribution methods to an Inception V3 networkfor natural image classification (Szegedy et al., 2016). Notice how all gradient-based methods produceattributions affected by higher local variance compared to perturbation-based methods (Figure 1).
Figure 3: Comparison of attribution maps and (a-b) and plot of target output variation as somefeatures are removed from the input image. Best seen in electronic form.
Figure 4: Test of Sensitivity-n for several values of n, over different tasks and architectures.
