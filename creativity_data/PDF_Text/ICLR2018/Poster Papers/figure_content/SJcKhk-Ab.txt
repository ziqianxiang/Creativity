Figure 1: Performance of different recurrent architectures on warped and padded sequences se-quences. From top left to bottom right: uniform time warping of length maximum_warping,uniform padding of length maximum_warping, variable time warping and variable time padding,from 1 to maximum_warping. (For uniform padding/warpings, the leaky RNN and gated RNNcurves overlap, with loss 0.) Lower is better.
Figure 2: A task involving pure warping.
Figure 3: Standard initialization (blue) vs. chrono initialization (red) on the copy and variable copytask. From left to right, top to bottom, standard copy T = 500 and T = 2000, variable copyT = 500 and T = 1000. Chrono initialization heavily outperforms standard initialization, exceptfor variable length copy with the smaller T where both perform well.
Figure 4: Standard initialization (blue) vs. chrono initialization (red) on the adding task. From leftto right, T = 200, and T = 750. Chrono initialization heavily outperforms standard initialization.

Figure 6: Standard initialization (blue) vs. chrono initialization (red) on pixel level classificationtasks. From left to right, MNIST and pMNIST.
Figure 7: Standard initialization (blue) vs. chrono initialization (red) on the word level PTB (left)and on the character level text8 (right) validation sets.
