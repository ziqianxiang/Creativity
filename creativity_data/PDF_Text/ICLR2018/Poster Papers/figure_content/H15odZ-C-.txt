Figure 1: Illustration showing the distribution of the mass for a Normal prior distribution. In high-dimensions, most the mass concentrates in the outer shell shown in blue while the middle shown inred is almost massless. Linearly interpolating between 2 points produces the green dotted trajectorythus traversing a region of the space with low probability mass. In contrast, following the greatcircle arc in blue produces samples that are more likely but these paths can also be unstable as theyexhibit higher variance (see main text).
