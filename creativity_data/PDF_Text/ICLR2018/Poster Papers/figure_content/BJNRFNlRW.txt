Figure 1: Performance of a toy example. Figure (a) shows the generated samples for different GANs.
Figure 2: Performance of the proposed algorithm on 2D mixture of Gaussian data. The data samplesare marked in blue and the generated samples are marked in orange.
Figure 3: Examples of generated images using MNIST and CIFAR dataset.
