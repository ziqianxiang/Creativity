Figure 1: Bayesian network to model dependence between label y, domain d, and input x.
Figure 6: Comparing domain embeddings (g) across domains. Each color denotes a domain.
Figure 7: Comparing domain embeddings (g) across labels. Each color denotes a label. Unclustered colorsindicates that label information is mostly absent from g.
