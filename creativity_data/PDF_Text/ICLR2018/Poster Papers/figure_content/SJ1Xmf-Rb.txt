Figure 1: FearNet consists of three brain-inspired modules based on 1) mPFC (long-term storage), 2) HC (recent storage), and3) BLA for determining whether to usemPFC or HC for recall.
Figure 2: iCaRLâ€™s performance dependsheavily on the number of exemplars perclass (EPC) that it stores. Reducing EPCfrom 20 (blue) to 1 (red) severely impairsits ability to recall older information.
Figure 3: The mPFC and BLA sub-systems in FearNet. mPFC is responsible for the long-termstorage of remote memories. BLA is used during prediction time to determine if the memory shouldbe recalled from short- or long-term memory.

Figure S1:	Detailed plots for the multi-modal experiment. The top row is when the base-knowledgewas CIFAR-100, the middle row is when the base-knowledge was AudioSet, and the bottom rowis when the base-knowledge was a 50/50 mix from the two datasets. The left column representsthe mean-class accuracy on the base-knowledge test set and the right column computes mean-classaccuracy on the entire test set.
Figure S2:	FearNet performance as a function of base-knowledge size.
