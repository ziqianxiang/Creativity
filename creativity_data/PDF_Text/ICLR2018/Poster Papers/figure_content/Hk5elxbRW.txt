Figure 1: Examples of images with label confusion, from the validation set of ImageNet. The top-leftimage is incorrectly labeled as “red panda”, instead of “giant panda”. The bottom-left image islabeled as “strawberry”, although the categories “apple”, “banana” and “pineapple” would beother valid labels. The center image is labeled as “indigo bunting”, which is only valid for the lowerbird of the image. The right-most image is labeled as a cocktail shaker, yet could arguably be apart of a music instrument (for example with label “cornet, horn, trumpet, trump”). Such examplesmotivate the need to predict more than a single label per image.
Figure 2: Influence of the temperature τ on the learning of a DenseNet 40-12 on CIFAR-100. Weconfirm that smoothing helps the training of a neural network in Figure 2a, where a large enoughvalue of τ greatly helps the performance on the training set. In Figure 2b, we observe that suchhigh temperatures yield gradients that are not sparse. In other words, with a high temperature, thegradient is informative about a greater number of labels, which helps the training of the model.
