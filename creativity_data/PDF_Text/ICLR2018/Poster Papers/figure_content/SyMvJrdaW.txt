Figure 1: Forward propagation in WarpNet. Left, the original residual network where each blockcorresponds to a residual unit. Middle, the corresponding Warped Network with indices determinedby the architecture ofM. The diagram on the right shows the parallelism allowed in the forward passof WarpNet. Note that F2 shares the same weights with F02 , as they come from the same residualunit in the original network M .
