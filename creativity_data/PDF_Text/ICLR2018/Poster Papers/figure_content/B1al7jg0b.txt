Figure 1: 3D point clouds (black dots) and their corresponding conceptors, represented by ellipsoidswhose axes are the singular vectors of conceptors and the lengths of these axes match the singularvalues of conceptors. Each edge of the plot boxes range from -1 to +1 admitted by neural dynamicswith a tanh nonlinearity; conceptor ellipsiods lie inside the unit sphere.
Figure 2: Geometry of Boolean operations on 2-dimensional conceptors. The OR (resp. AND) op-eration gives a conceptor whose ellipsoid approximately is the smallest (largest) ellipsoid enclosing(contained in) the argument conceptor’s ellipsoids.
Figure 3: Average performance across already learned permuted MNIST tasks using CAB or EWC4	Experiments4.1	Permuted MNIST ExperimentTo test the performance of CAB, we evaluated it on the permuted MNIST experiment (Srivastavaet al., 2013; Goodfellow et al., 2014; Kirkpatrick et al., 2017; Lee et al., 2017), where a sequence ofpattern recognition tasks are created from the MNIST dataset (LeCun et al., 1998). For each task, arandom permutation of input image pixels is generated and applied to all images in MNIST to obtaina new shuffled dataset, equally difficult to recognize as the original one, the objective of each task isto recognize these images with shuffled pixels.
