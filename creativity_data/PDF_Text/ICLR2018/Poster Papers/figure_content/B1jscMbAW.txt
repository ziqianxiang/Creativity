Figure 1: Divide and Conquer Network. The split phase is determined by a dynamic neural networkSθ that splits each incoming set into two disjoint sets: {Xj+1,l, Xj+1,l+1} = Sθ(Xj,m), withXj,m = Xj+1,l t Xj+1,l+1. The merge phase is carried out by another neural network Mφ thatcombines two partial solutions into a solution of the coarser scale: Yj,m = Mφ(Yj+1,l, Yj+1,l+1);see Section 3 for more details.
Figure 2: DiCoNet outputs at test time for n = 50. The colors indicate the partitions at a given scale.
Figure 3: DiCoNet Architecture for the Knapsack problem. A GNN Split module selects a subset ofinput elements until a fraction α of the allowed budget is achieved; then the remaining elements arefed back recursively into the same Split module, until the total weight fills the allowed budget.
