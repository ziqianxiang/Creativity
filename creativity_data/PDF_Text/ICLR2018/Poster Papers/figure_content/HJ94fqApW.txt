Figure 1: Visualization of the number of pruned channels at each convolution in the inceptionbranch. Colored regions represents the number of channels kept. The height of each bar representsthe size of feature map, and the width of each bar represents the size of channels. It is observed thatmost of channels in the bottom layers are kept while most of channels in the top layers are pruned.
