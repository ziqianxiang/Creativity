Figure 1: Pipeline of BC learning. We create each training example by mixing two sounds belonging to differentclasses with a random ratio. We input the mixed sound to the model and train the model to output the mixingratio using the KL loss.
Figure 2: BC learning enlarges Fisher’s criterion in the feature space, by training the model to output the mixingratio between two classes. We hypothesize that a mixed sound mixr (x1, x2) is projected into the point nearthe internally dividing point of f(x1) and f(x2) , considering the characteristic of sounds. Middle: WhenFisher’s criterion is small, some mixed examples are projected into one of the classes, and BC learning gives alarge penalty. Right: When Fisher’s criterion is large, most of the mixed examples are projected into between-class points, and BC learning gives a small penalty. Therefore, BC learning leads to such a feature space.
Figure 3: Visualization of thefeature space using PCA. Thefeatures of the mixed sounds aredistributed between two classes.
Figure 4: BC learning regularizes the positional re-lationship of the classes in the feature space, bytraining the model not to misclassify the mixedsound as different classes. BC learning avoids thesituation in which the decision boundary of otherclass appears between any two classes.
