Figure 11: UnConditional generated sketChes of frogs, Cats, and Crabs at τ = 0.8For more CompliCated Classes of images, suCh as mermaids or lobsters, the reConstruCtion loss metriCsare not as good Compared to simpler Classes suCh as ants, faCes or firetruCks. The models trained onthese more Challenging image Classes tend to draw smoother, more CirCular line segments that do notresemble individual sketChes, but rather resemble an averaging of many sketChes in the training set.
