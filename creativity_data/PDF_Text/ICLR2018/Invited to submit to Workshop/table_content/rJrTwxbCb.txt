Table 1: Counting outliers for matching the number of blobs. Dictionary of table elements: {cov:scale of covariance for inputs, mean&std: of the eigenvalues, nc: number of clusters, gap: largestconsecutive gaps, ratio: largest consecutive ratios, heur: heuristic threshold, cutoff: the value of theheur.}B	The spectrum of the generalized Gaus s -Newton matrixIn this section, we will show that the spectrum of the Generalized Gauss-Newton matrix can becharacterized theoretically under some conditions. Suppose that We can express the scaled gradient(,'i0(fi(W))Vfi(W) from Equation 5) as g = Tx with the matrix T ∈ M X d depending only onthe parameters w - Which is the case for linear models. Then We can Write: G = N1 ∑i∈D gigT =NTXXtTt, where X = {x1,..., xN } is an d × N matrix. Furthermore, without loss of generality,we assume that the examples are normalized such that the entries of X are independent with zeromean and unit variance. One of the first steps in studying G goes through understanding its principlecomponents. In particular, we would like to understand how the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Gare related to the ones of Σ where Σ := E(G) = NTXXTTT = TTt.
