Table 1: Baseline experiments. Runtime, # params, and error rates are averaged over 10 runs (fornneigh = 8) and 30 runs (nneigh = 1) runs, respectively. nsteps = 5 in all experiments.
Table 2: Results for CIFAR-10. For our methods the stated resources, # parameters and errors areaveraged over all runs. ”Resources spent” denotes training costs in case of the handcrafted models.
