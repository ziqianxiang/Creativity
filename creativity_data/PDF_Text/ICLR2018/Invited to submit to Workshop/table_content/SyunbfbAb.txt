Table 1: Synthetic Data Parameters, the color set column indicates the set used for training.
Table 2: Question Types.
Table 3: Performance of our baselines on the validation and test sets with the alternated colorscheme.
Table 4: Performance of CNN+LSTM, RN and our human annotators on a subset of the test set withthe alternated color scheme.
Table 5: CNN+LSTM, RN and human accuracy (in percent) per figure type on a subset of the testset with the alternated color scheme.
Table 6: CNN+LSTM, RN and human accuracy (in percent) per question type. The reported accu-racies are both computed on the same subset of the test set with alternated color scheme.
Table 7: Performance of our RN baselines trained with early stopping on val1 (using the samecolor-to-plot-type assignments as in the training set) and with early stopping on val2 (with swappedcolors). We show performances of both on test1 (with the same color assignments) and test2 (withswapped colors).
