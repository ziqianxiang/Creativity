Table 1: Predictor models with different time-decayPredictor models	PreciSion@1	PCC@1Default model (3)	-0.072	-0.018with ConV time decay (4)	0.074	-0:016with parametrical time decay (5)	0.075	—	0.0173.5 NN based recommender with combined predictor and auto-encoder modelsOn Figure 3 we observe that predictor model has highest precision@K but lower PCC@K. The rea-son for lower PCC lies in the method of splitting the training data as we train the model to predictmore recent purchases from the past week. As a result NN model cannot predict products which7Workshop track - ICLR 2018were purchased only one month ago because they were never seen in training output data Y . Predic-tor model is recommending personalized popular products. It captures short term preferences andrecommend products which are popular now. One of the methods of increasing PCC is to use auto-encoder neural network (Hinton & Salakhutdinov, 2006), which learns representations of the inputdata X by learning to predict itself in the output. By training the representation and reconstructingall of a user’s purchases, it can capture static customer preferences and predict products purchasedat any time in the past. As a result, we can expect an increase in PCC in auto-encoder compared topredictor model since the diversity of products over a two year period learned by an auto-encoder ismore than a one week period learned by a predictor.

Preci-sion@K and PCC@K are calculated in October and Christmas week and shown on Figure 8. As canbe seen, Christmas recommendations has higher Precision@K and lower PCC@K, in comparisonwith October recommendations. There is an acceptable temporal variation in the accuracy metrics,so we can confirm that out NN model is adapting to seasonality changes. At the time of this test ourmodel was not in production yet, so our recommendations did not impact customer consumptionpattern.
