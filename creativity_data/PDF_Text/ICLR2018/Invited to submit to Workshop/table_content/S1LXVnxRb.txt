Table 1: Main characteristics of the corpora. Two corpora are divided in subcorpora. The sizes ofthe training and test corpora are reported in term of number of sentences (sent.) and relationships(rel.). EU-ADR, ADR-EXT and reACE have no proper test corpus.
Table 2: Impact of cross-corpus training in terms of precision (P), recall (R) and f-measure (F). ÏƒFis the standard deviation of the f1-score.
