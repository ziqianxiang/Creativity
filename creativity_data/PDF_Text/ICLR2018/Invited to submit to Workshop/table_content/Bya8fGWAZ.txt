Table 1: Average performance at the end of training of all tested models on the static grid-worlds with90% confidence value, across 5 different training runs (with random seeding). v16x16 correspondto the maps sampled from VINâ€™s 16x16 grid test dataset, while the rest of the maps are sampleduniformly from our generator using the same parameters employed at training time. The distance tothe optimal path is averaged only for successful episodes.
