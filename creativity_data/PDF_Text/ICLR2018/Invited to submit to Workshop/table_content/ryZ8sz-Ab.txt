Table 1: Summary of our results: We compare our model to a complete reading baseline and apartial reading (PR) baseline on four datasets and three different syntactic levels. Here we reportthe speedups of our model compared to whole-reading baseline at the same accuracy level. Also wereport the relative performance of the partial reading baseline with the same computational cost asour model.
Table 2: Summary of our results: We compare our model to (Yu et al., 2017), showing the relativeFLOPs necessary to achieve the same accuracy on two datasets used in both theirs and this paper.
