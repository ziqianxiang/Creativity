Figure 2: LM-architecture is an efficient structure that enables ResNet to achieve same level ofaccuracy with only half of the parameters on CIFAR10.
Figure 3: Training and testing curves of ResNext29 (16x64d, pre-act) and and LM-ResNet29(16x64d, pre-act) on CIFAR100, which shows that the LM-ResNeXt can achieve higher accura-cy than ResNeXt.
