Figure 1: Visualization of our method. Based on the current best model, new models are generatedand trained afterwards. The best model is than updated.
Figure 2: The best model found by Algorithm 1 tracked over time (in terms of hill climbing itera-tions). With (red) and without (blue) using SGDR for the training within the hill climbing (line 17).
