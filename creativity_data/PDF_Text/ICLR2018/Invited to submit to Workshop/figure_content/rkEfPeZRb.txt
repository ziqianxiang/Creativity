Figure 1: Basic algorithm of our variance-based compression. C and α are hyperparam-eters. Recommended value for C is 0.999.
Figure 2: Hybrid algorithm of our variance-based compression and Strom’s method. τ isa user-defined threshold required in Strom’smethod. Other parameters and notations arethe same with Fig. 1.
Figure 3: Scatter plots of relation between accuracy and compression ratio. The four plots cor-respond to the configurations on datasets and optimization methods as follows: (a) CIFAR-10 andAdam, (b) CIFAR-10 and MomentumSGD, (c) ImageNet and Adam, (d) ImageNet and Momen-tumSGD. No compression denotes the case where we do not use any compression methods. Varianceis a method described in Sec. 4.1 and 4.2. Hybrid is a combination of variance based compressionand Strom’s algorithm. Some outliers are not plotted. Upper right of these figures is desirable forall compression algorithms.
