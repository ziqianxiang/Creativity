Figure 1: concept. (a) shows conceptual network structure of Dropmax for fine-grained recognition. (b)shows classification boundary of existing models (up) and of Dropmax (bottom).
Figure 2: Contour plots of softmax and dropmax with different retain probabilities. For dropmax,we sampled the Bernoulli variables for each data point with fixed probabilities.
Figure 3: Convergence plot5.2	Qualitative AnalysisWe further perform qualitative analysis of our model to see how exactly it works and where theaccuracy improvements come from.
Figure 4: Visualization of class dropout probabilities for example test instances from MNIST dataset. (a)and (b) shows estimated Class retain probability for easy and diffiCult test instanCes respeCtively, where the lastcolumn of (b), yB are the predictions from the baseline model. (c) shows generated retain masks from (b). (d)shows the average retain probability per Class for hard instanCes. (e) shows examples from CIFAR-100 datasetwith top-4 and bottom-2 retain probabilities. Red color denotes base model predictions.
