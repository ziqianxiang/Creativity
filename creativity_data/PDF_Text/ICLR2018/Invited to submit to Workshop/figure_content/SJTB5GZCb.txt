Figure 1: From the point of view of biological plausibility, the symmetry of connections in theHopfield model is a major drawback (1b). The model that we study here is, like a biological neuralnetwork, a directed graph (1a).
Figure 2: Input x is clamped. Neurons h include “hidden layers” h2 and h1, and “output layer”h0 that corresponds to the layer where the prediction is read. Target y has the same dimension ash0. The clamping factor β scales the “external force” —β ∂h that attracts the output h0 towards thetarget y.
Figure 3: Example system trained on the MNIST dataset, as described in Appendix C. The objectivefunction is optimized: the training error decreases to 0.00% in around 70 epochs. The generaliza-tion error is about 2%. Right: A form of symmetry or alignment arises between feedforward andfeedback weights Wk,k+ι and Wk+ι,k in the sense that tr(Wk,k+ι ∙ Wk+ι,k) > 0. This architectureuses 3 hidden layers each of dimension 512.
