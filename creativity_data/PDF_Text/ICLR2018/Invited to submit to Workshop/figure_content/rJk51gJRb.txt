Figure 1: Hex board (left) and neural network design (right)6Workshop track - ICLR 2018Hex is challenging to play primarily because of its large and near-uniform branching factor and thedifficulty of constructing a reliable evaluation function. One character that makes Hex simpler isthat perfect play can sometimes be achieved whenever winning virtual connections are found byH-Search (Anshelevich, 2002).
