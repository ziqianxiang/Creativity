Figure 2: Manipulating illumination factors on the Multi-PIE dataset. From left to right, the siximages in a row are: original images A with light illumination and B with the dark illumination,newly generated images A2 and B2 by swapping the illumination-relevant piece in disentangledrepresentations, and reconstructed images A1 and B1.
Figure 3: The experimental results of TD-GAN and IcGAN on CelebA dataset. Three rows indicatesthe swapping attributes of Bangs, Eyeglasses and Smiling. For each model, the four images in a roware: two original images, and two newly generated images by swapping the attributes. The thirdimage is generated by adding the attribute to the first one, and the fourth image is generated byremoving the attribute from the second one.
Figure 4: The interpolation results of DNA-GAN. Figure 4a, 4b and 4c display the disentangledattribute subspaces spanned by any two attributes of Bangs, Eyeglasses and Smiling. Figure 4dshows the attribute subspaces spanned by several Bangs feature vectors. Besides, the top-left imagein Figure 4d is outside the CelebA dataset.
