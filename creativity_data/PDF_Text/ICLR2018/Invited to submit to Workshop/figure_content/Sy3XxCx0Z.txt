Figure 1: A high-level view of our neural inference networks. Given two sentence, i.e., the premise“The child is getting a pedicure”, and the hypothesis “The kid is getting a manicure”, the modelneeds to predict the relationship among them: entailment, contradiction, or neutral.
Figure 2: Accuracies of the models usingdifferent components of external knowledge,varies the training set size among 0.8%, 4%,20% and the whole training set.
Figure 3: Accuracies of the models using dif-ferent size of external knowledge. More ex-ternal knowledge, higher accuracies.
