Figure 1: A schematic illustration of reward distribution models in MARL. (a) Centralized rewarddistribution model (Agogino & Tumer, 2006; Sukhbaatar et al., 2016; Foerster et al., 2016; 2017).

Figure 3: Left: Learning curve for ViZDoom multi-agent task. The proposed NaaA-based methodoutperformed the other two methods (baseline and Comm DQNs). Right: Visualizing reward fromthe main player to the cameramann shows us what is important information for the main player: (a)The pistol. (b) The point at which the enemy appeared and approached.
Figure 4: NaaA leads agents to enter a cooperative relationship. First, the two agents face differentdirections, and the cameraman sells their information to the main player (1). The main player (infor-mation buyer) starts to turn right to find the enemy. The cameraman (information seller) starts to turnleft to seek new information by finding the blind area of the main player (2 and 3). After turning, themain player attacks the first, having already identified enemy (4 and 5). Once the main player findsthe enemy, he attacks and obtains the reward (6 and 7). Both agents then return to watching the deadarea of the other until the next enemy appears (8).
