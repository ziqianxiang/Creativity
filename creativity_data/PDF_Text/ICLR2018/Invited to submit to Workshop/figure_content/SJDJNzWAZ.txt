Figure 1: An interval is treated as the "duration" of an idle event.
Figure 2: A time-dependent RNN for event sequence prediction. dt is used to generate time-dependentevent embedding. Next event duration can be used as a regularizer, which can be applied to therecurrent layer and/or any post recurrent layer.

Figure 4: The projection of time learned by TimeJoint with P = 5. The X axis is in seconds and theY axis is the projection of a time in each dimension defined in Equation 5.
