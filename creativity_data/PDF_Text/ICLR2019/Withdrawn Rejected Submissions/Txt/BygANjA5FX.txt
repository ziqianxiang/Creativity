Ab stract
Ensemble learning is a method of combining multiple trained models to improve
model accuracy. We propose the usage of such methods, specifically ensemble
average, inside Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures by replacing
the single convolutional layers with Inner Average Ensembles (IEA) of multiple
convolutional layers. Empirical results on different benchmarking datasets show
that CNN models using IEA outperform those with regular convolutional layers
and advances the state of art. A visual and a similarity score analysis of the features
generated from IEA explains why it boosts the model performance.
1	Introduction
Ensemble learning (Rokach, 2010; Zhou, 2012) is the method of combining multiple models trained
over the same dataset or a random set of datasets to improve the model performance. The methods of
ensemble have been widely used in deep learning (Qiu et al., 2014; Dietterich, 2000; Drucker et al.,
1994) to improve the overall model accuracy. Combining neural networks in ensemble is known to
reduce the variance in prediction, in other words, it helps the network to generalize more than the
usage of one network (Krogh & Vedelsby, 1995; Geman et al., 1992; Zhou et al., 2002). The work by
Stahlberg & Byrne (2017) proposed a method of combining multiple models where it unfolds the
ensemble into a larger network. Lee et al. (2015) discussed the power of ensemble in training CNN
and proposed a method for training ensemble by a specific loss function rather than averaging the
predictions of the models.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) (Lecun et al., 1998) are extremely successful architectures
that are widely used in different areas such as computer vision (Krizhevsky et al., 2012), text analysis
(dos Santos & Gatti, 2014; Lai et al., 2015), and even general temporal sequence problems (Bai
et al., 2018). CNN is a biologically inspired simulation of the cats visual cortex (Hubel & Wiesel,
1968). Usually, CNN is composed of a convolutional layer followed by a pooling layer. Alternating
convolutional layers and pooling layers are stacked to introduce more depth to the model being
constructed. We call the connection of convolutional layers and pool layers a features extraction head.
The features extraction head may or may not be connected to a fully-connected layer based on the
application of the deep model. One important feature of convolutional layers that the weights are
shared for creating the features. By having this feature of shared weights, convolutional layers do
not strongly contribute to the total parameter size of the deep model unlike the contribution of the
fully-connected layer.
In this work, we show empirically, visually and through similarity score analysis that replacing
ordinary convolutional layer by an Inner Ensemble Average (IEA) of convolutional layers in a CNN
can reduce the variance of this model. We propose it as a convenient technique to improve the
performance of CNN predictive models.
This work is organized as follows, section 3 defines IEA mathematically. Section 4 shows the
experiments performed on different benchmark datasets including MNIST (LeCun, 1998), rotated-
MNIST (Larochelle et al., 2007), CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 (Krizhevsky & Hinton, 2009) using
well-known deep CNN architectures. We show the results of convolutional-layer-only models, IEA
of convolutional layers models and ensemble of both techniques. In section 5, a visual analysis of the
features generated by IEA is performed. Section 5 also introduces a metric to measure the similarity
between the features generated from IEA and convolutional layers.

2	Related Work
Ensemble is one of the meta-algorithms that combines a set of independently trained networks
into one predictive model in order to improve performance. Other methods include bagging and
boosting that reduce predictive variance and bias (Opitz & Maclin, 1999). Ensemble by averaging
several models is one of the most common approaches and extensively adopted in modern deep
learning practice, especially in related contests (Russakovsky et al., 2015; Rajpurkar et al., 2016).
One variation is to ensemble the same model at different training epochs (Qiu et al., 2014). Though
inspired by ensemble methods that average independent networks, the proposed IEA structure is
fundamentally different in that a) it replicates small units, namely convolutional layers, within CNN
structures and b) the replications are trained jointly.
Our work is reminiscent of Maxout (Goodfellow et al., 2013), which replicates weight matrices
and take the maximum from the features produce by those linear layers. Maxout can be considered
as a special activation method that behaves as a learnable piecewise-linear function. IEA differs
from Maxout since IEA averages convolutional layers after non-linearity layers (Figure 1). While
Maxout is designed to approximate any activation function, our intuition is as follows: an ensemble
of models are used essentially to reduce variance in other terms to increase models generalization.
We hypothesize that the overall variance of the model can be decomposed into sub-layers within the
model and each layer contributes somehow into this variance. If we used inner ensemble average we
will reduce the sub-variances of each layer resulting in an overall variance reduction. Therefore, we
primarily explore the averaging method in our setting.
ResNet (He et al., 2015) and its variants (Huang et al., 2017; Szegedy et al., 2017) have become
standard for recognition tasks. One can argue that the concept of IEA bears some similarity with the
additive behaviors of ResNet and variants (He et al., 2016). Wide Resnet (Zagoruyko & Komodakis,
2016) explores the idea that convolutional layers can have larger dimension while reducing the overall
model depth. ResNext (Xie et al., 2017) also makes the model wider by introducing complicated
pathways within Resnet blocks and achieved competitive results with more shallow networks. IEA
further exploits the possibility of increasing block width by simply plugging into existing models,
replicating any convolutional layers within IEA. In our paper, Wide ResNet and ResNext with IEA
are intensively experimented and analyzed in comparison with regular ones. Some other widely-used
CNN architectures are also explored.
3	Inner Ensemble Average (IEA)
The IEA concept can be applied to a CNN architecture by replacing any convolutional layer (Clayer)
with average ensemble of several replications of a convolutional layer (along with the following batch
normalization (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015) and activation layer, which means averaging is performed
after the non-linearity). In any deep CNN architecture to use the IEA concept the Clayer is replaced
by CIEA . The CIEA is defined as follows:
m
m (X Clayer=i
CIEA
(1)
i=1
where m = {x | x ∈ N+ - {1}} is the number of inner convolutional layers which is a design choice.
An illustration of IEA concept within a CNN is found in Figure 1.
When using IEA, the same settings of the replaced convolutional layer are applied to each IEA
element individually.
4	Experiments and Analysis
In the following section, we empirically evaluate the performance of IEA convolutional layers versus
ordinary convolutional layer. In all tests, the number of inner ensembles is set to m = 3, to speed up
computations. We also compare the results of an ensemble of models trained using convolutional
layer and an ensemble of models trained using IEA of convolutional layers. The ensemble of IEA of
convolutional layers can be described as an outer and inner ensemble in a CNN.

4.1	MNIST AND ROTATED-MNIST DATASETS
The MNIST dataset is one of the earliest datasets in computer vision and machine learning. The
MNIST dataset contains 60,000 training set examples and a test set of 10,000 examples of handwritten
digits. The rotated-MNIST dataset contains 62000 randomly rotated handwritten digits. The rotated-
MNIST dataset is split into a training and test sets of size 50000 and 12000 respectively.
We assembled several vanilla CNN models and trained on both datasets. Each model contains one
to three layers. We define a convolutional layer as composition of a weight matrix that applies a
2D convolution over an input signal, the following batch normalization layer and rectified linear
unit (ReLU) activation function (Hahnloser et al., 2000). Then a max-pooling layer is stacked after
each convolutional layer. Finally, an average-pooling layer is connected before plugging into a
classification head. We then expand these small CNN models by replicating any convolutional layers
by three and adding an average pooling layer, making it an IEA with m = 3. Accordingly, we use
m = 1 to represent regular convolutional layers. Therefore, we have six different models to test on
MNIST/rotated-MNIST datasets.
The models were trained using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) (Bottou, 2010) optimization
algorithm with a momentum (Polyak, 1964) set to 0.9 and weight decay (Krogh & Hertz, 1992) set
to 5e-4. The initial learning rate is 0.1 and it was divided by 10 for every 100 training epochs. The
total number of training epochs is 350. The training datasets were not augmented, and the same
initialization settings were kept the same between the models.
Table 1 describes the results on the MNIST test dataset. The usage of IEA of convolutional layers
leads to an increase in performance over convolutional-layer-only models. It can be seen that the
error rate of the one-layer model decreased by 0.18%. By going deeper with one more layer, the
mean error rate improved by 0.76% with just two IEA layers. We achieve a mean error rate of 0.45%
on the MNIST dataset by just using three layers deep model.
Even with replications inside the architecture, we can still exploit ensemble of several IEA models
to increase the predictive power. Table 2 shows the performance of the average ensemble of three
IEA models versus an ensemble of three convolutional-layer-only models. To distinguish from
inner ensemble, we use k to indicate the number of models in an outer ensemble of identical, yet

independently trained networks. In our case, k is 3. As for the one-layer model, both ensemble of
IEA of convolutional layers and convolutional-layer-only model show the same performance. The
ensemble of IEA models shows a better performance than the ensemble of convolutional layers only
based model when two or three layers are used.

Table 3 describes the rotated-MNIST test dataset results. In this case, the usage of IEA of convo-
lutional layers still leads to significant improvements over convolutional-layer-only models. It can
be seen in the case of the one-layer model that the IEA of convolutional layers model significantly
improves the accuracy compared to convolutional-layer-only models. The performance increases
when more layers are added (deeper model). We can see a drop of the mean error rate by 0.41% in
the case of two layers deep model, and a drop of 0.68% with three layers deep one. These results
show the capability of IEA in decreasing the total model variance. Table 4 shows the case of average
ensemble of three IEA of convolutional layer models and convolutional-layer-only models. In the case
of a one layer deep model, the ensemble of convolutional layer models is better than the ensemble
of IEA of convolutional layer models. When more layers are considered, the ensemble of IEA of
convolutional layer models outperforms the ensemble of convolutional-layer-only models, except in
the case of two layers model were the ensemble of convolutional-layer-only models has a slightly
better performance. We attribute this behavior to the selection of hyper-parameters. Also, an error
rate of 5.33% is achieved using three layers deep model with IEA of convolutional layers.

Networks with 121 layers (DenseNet) (Huang et al., 2017), Wide ResNet (Zagoruyko & Komodakis,
2016), and ResNext (Xie et al., 2017) were trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Note that Wide ResNet
and ResNext are trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset that is augmented using image translation and
mirroring. In these models, the convolutional layers were replaced by IEA layers. The training
was done using non-augmented training samples. The training configuration is the same as the
configurations mentioned in section 4.1. The training and validation curves can be found in the
supplementary materials.
Table 5 shows an overall improvement in classification mean error rates on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
VGG16 had a 0.64% mean error rate improvement by using IEA of convolutional layers. ResNet18
and ResNet101 were improved by 1.0%, 0.52% mean error rates respectively by using IEA compared
to convolutional layer. A significant improvement is seen in MobileNet by 3.09% error rate when
using IEA. DenseNet shows an improvement of 0.13% by using IEA of convolutional layers. Wide
ResNet and ResNext also improves. To test the effect of models ensemble, Table 6 shows an
ensemble of previously mentioned models. We average an ensemble of three models using IEA of
convolutional layers and another three models using convolutional layers only. The ensemble of IEA
of convolutional layers models shows a better performance than the convolutional-layer-only models.

per class. Compared to previously investigated datasets, the CIFAR-100 dataset is much larger and
models can truly manifest their power when benchmarked against it. Note that the CIFAR-100 dataset
here is augmented using image translation and/or mirroring.
In this section, we plug IEA into Wide ResNet and ResNext and train them on the CIFAR-100. In
Table 7, our experiments show that even if our implementation of both networks perform worse than
the original paper, our Wide ResNet and ResNext with IEA achieve considerable results. Spcecifically,
Wide ResNet with IEA decreases the error rate from 18.85% (Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2016) to
18.03% on CIFAR-100. ResNext with IEA achieves performance on par with ResNext (Xie et al.,
2017). Further, we use outer ensemble to combine individual networks and show in Table 8 that
IEA will by no means exhaust the power of variance reduction and outer ensemble can still obtain
considerable performance boost. Our results confirm that IEA can still boost the model performance
on large scale datasets. The training and validation curves can be found in the supplementary
materials.
Also, in order to understand the computational overhead of using IEA table 9 states the inference time
per image in milliseconds over the CIFARA-100 validation data set. It can be seen that m = 3 Wide
ResNet inference time is the same as m = 1 ResNext. Meanwhile, we can tell that IEA introduces
almost m times computational overhead when used and this is a future research point.

5	Visualization and analysis of IEA features
5.1	Visual interpretation of IEA features
To understand how IEA works and produces better results than ordinary convolutional layer, we
visualized the features generated by both. Table 10 shows different features generated by IEA layers
and convolutional layer. It is noticeable that the features generated by IEA tend to be more unique
and different from each other, unlike convolutional layers where some features appear to be identical.
Also, in the first row of Table 10 where the deep model is only 1 layer deep, there exist some IEA
features that are associated with zero weight after training. This demonstrates that IEA removed
some unnecessary features from the model, which helps improving robustness.

1 layer	0.034	2.797
2 layers	0.020	0.025
3 layers	0.020	0.038
5.2	Similarity scores
We use similarity scores λ to validate the visual interpretation of the IEA features. The similarity
score measures how similar an image to another image. If both image of comparison are the same,
the similarity score value will be zero. The more difference between the images the more the value of
similarity score increases till it reaches the maximum value which is 1. Thus, the usage of similarity
score is handful to measure how unique a feature compared to other features produced by the same
layer. We introduce the mean sum of similarity score (mss-Score) μλ as follows: for each n features
f in a layer the mss-score is defined as:
nn
μλ = 1(X X λ(fi,f∙))	⑵
i=1 j=1,i6=j
The higher the mss-score is, the more unique the features produced by the model are. For the
similarity score measurement, we used the similarity score model introduced by (Zhang et al., 2018)

which is proven to outperform any previous similarity score measurements methods. In Table 11,
the IEA and convolutional layer mss-scores were evaluated on a batch of 100 validation samples
from the rotated-MNIST dataset. The IEAs mss-scores are always greater than the convolutional
layer mss-scores. This indicates that the usage of IEA produces more unique features compared to
convolutional layer features, and it confirms our visual analysis.
5.3	Comparison with MaxOut features
To develop the understanding of the features generated by using IEA, we compare IEA features
against the features generated by MaxOut. A one layer vanilla CNN with 48 features channels were
trained using MaxOut, the max parameter of MaxOut is set to 3 leading to a network that is similar
in the parameters size to the IEA one. By setting the max parameter to 3, the 48 features turns into
16 features, this fortifies a fair comparison with the IEA features on the same model. The training
settings were the same as mentioned in section 4.1 but with a lower learning rate set to 0.001 initially.
The trained MaxOut model had an error rate of 21.86% on the rotated-MNIST validation dataset.
Visuallay, we can tell that the MaxOut features are more unique than the Vanilla CNN features but
they have some similarity in between. Also, MaxOut did not produce such a unique set of features like
IEA. One expects that the MaxOut features mss-score to be larger than Vanilla CNN ones, when we
computed it had a value of 0.01084 almost the third of the mss-score value of Vanilla CNN mss-score
obtained from table 11. This was surprisingly to us. To investigate this behavior, We state these two
facts. Firstly, we calculate the mss-score over a validation batch of 100 images. Secondly, because
the MaxOut chooses the max filter between groups this will results in a different model for each
input.This suggest that each input image will have a different similarity score as the model behavior
changes based on the input.This could lead in total to obtain a low mss-score, also it suggests that it
is a drawback of MaxOut compared to IEA.
6	Conclusion
IEA is a concept that is simple but powerful. It helps the CNN architecture to increase its prediction
power by forcing the model to produce more unique features. The cost of using IEA in a CNN is
on the model parameter size, yet it is not a significance cost to the improvement in the performance.
We showed empirically, visually and by using a similarity scores that the usage of IEA improves
the CNN accuracy and produces unique features. Also, the ensemble of IEA of convolutional layers
models outperforms the ensemble of convolutional-layer-only model which is a method of inner
and outer ensemble. We recommend the usage of IEA where it applies, and a further study of other
methods of ensembles shall be conducted.
Our future work also include minimizing the inference time of IEA by finding a criteria for disabling
the non-important features and expanding our tests to other not-vision based domains.
