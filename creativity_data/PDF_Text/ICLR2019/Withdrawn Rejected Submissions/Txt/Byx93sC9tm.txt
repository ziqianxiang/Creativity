Ab stract
In image classification tasks, the ability of deep convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) to deal with complex image data has proved to be unrivalled. Deep CNNs,
however, require large amounts of labeled training data to reach their full poten-
tial. In specialized domains such as healthcare, labeled data can be difficult and
expensive to obtain. One way to alleviate this problem is to rely on active learning,
a learning technique that aims to reduce the amount of labelled data needed for
a specific task while still delivering satisfactory performance. We propose a new
active learning strategy designed for deep neural networks. This method improves
upon the current state-of-the-art deep Bayesian active learning method, which suf-
fers from the mode collapse problem. We correct for this deficiency by making
use of the expressive power and statistical properties of model ensembles. Our
proposed method manages to capture superior data uncertainty, which translates
into improved classification performance. We demonstrate empirically that our
ensemble method yields faster convergence of CNNs trained on the MNIST and
CIFAR-10 datasets.
1	Introduction
The success of deep learning in the last decade has been attributed to more computational power,
better algorithms and larger datasets. In object classification tasks, CNNs widely outperform alter-
native methods in benchmark datasets (LeCun et al., 2015) and have been used in medical imaging
for critical situations such as skin cancer detection (Haenssle et al., 2018), retinal disease detection
(De Fauw et al., 2018) or even brain tumour survival prediction (Lao et al., 2017).
Although their performance is unrivalled, their success strongly depends on huge amounts of anno-
tated data (Bengio et al., 2007; Krizhevsky et al., 2012). In specialized domains such as medicine
or chemistry, expert labelled data is costly and time consuming to acquire (Hoi et al., 2006; Smith
et al., 2018). Active Learning (AL) provides a theoretically sound framework (Cohn et al., 1996)
that reduces the amount of labelled data needed for a specific task. Developed as an iterative pro-
cess, AL progressively adds unlabelled data points to the training set using an acquisition function,
ranking them in order of importance to maximize performance.
Using Active Learning within a Deep Learning framework (DAL) has recently seen successful ap-
plications in text classification (Zhang et al., 2017; Shen et al., 2017), visual question answering
(Lin & Parikh, 2017) and image classification with CNNs (Gal et al., 2017; Sener & Savarese, 2017;
Beluch et al., 2018). One key difference between DAL and classical AL is the sampling in batches,
which is needed to keep computational costs low. As such, developing scalable DAL methods for
CNNs presents challenging problems. Firstly, acquisitions functions do not scale well for high di-
mensional data or parameter spaces, due to the cost of estimating uncertainty measures, which is
the main approach. Secondly, even with scalability not being an issue, one needs to obtain good
uncertainty estimates in order to avoid having overconfident predictions. One of the most promising
techniques is Deep Bayesian Active Learning (DBAL) (Gal, 2016; Gal & Ghahramani, 2016), which
uses Monte-Carlo dropout (MC-dropout) as a Bayesian framework to obtain uncertainty estimates.
However, as mentioned in Ducoffe & Precioso (2018), uncertainty-based methods can be fooled by
adversarial examples, where small perturbations in inputs can result in overconfident and surprising

outputs. Another approach presented by Beluch et al. (2018) uses ensemble models to obtain better
uncertainty estimates than DBAL methods, although there are no result on how it deals with adver-
sarial perturbations. Whereas uncertainty-based methods aim to pick data points the model is most
uncertain about, density-based approaches try to identify the samples that are most representative
of the entire unlabelled set, albeit at a computational cost (Sener & Savarese, 2017). Hybrid meth-
ods aim to trade uncertainty for representativeness. Our belief is that overconfident predictions for
DBAL methods are an outcome of the mode collapse phenomenon in variational inference methods
(Srivastava et al., 2017), and that by combining the expressive power of ensemble methods with
MC-dropout we can obtain ”better” uncertainties without trading representativeness.
In this paper we provide evidence for the mode collapse phenomenon in the form of a highly im-
balanced training set acquired during AL with MC-dropout, and show that ’preferential’ behaviour
is not beneficial for the AL process. Furthermore, we link the mode collapse phenomenon to over-
confident classifications. We compare the use of ensemble models to MC-Dropout for uncertainty
estimation and give intuitive reasons why combining the two might perform better. We present
Deep Ensemble Bayesian Active Learning (DEBAL) which confirms our intuition for experiments
on MNIST and CIFAR-10.
In Section 2 we give an overview of current popular methods for DAL. In Section 3, various acqui-
sition functions are introduced and the mode collapse issue is empirically identified. Further on, the
use of model ensembles is motivated before presenting our method DEBAL. The last part of section
3 is devoted to understanding the cause of the observed improvements in performance.
2	Background
The area of active learning has been studied extensively before (see Settles (2012) for a comprehen-
sive review), but with the emergence of deep learning, it has seen widespread interest. As proved
by Dasgupta (2005) there is no good universal AL strategy, researchers instead relying on heuristics
tailored for their particular tasks.
Uncertainty-based Methods. We identify uncertainty-based methods as being the main ones used
by the image classification community. Deep Bayesian Active Learning (Gal et al., 2017) mod-
els a Gaussian prior over the CNNs weights and uses variational inference techniques to obtain a
posterior distribution over the network’s predictions, using these samples as a measure of uncer-
tainty and as input to the acquisition function of the AL process. In practice, posterior samples are
obtained using Monte-Carlo dropout (MC-dropout)(Srivastava et al., 2014), a computationally inex-
pensive and powerful stochastic regularization technique that performs well on real-world datasets
(Leibig et al., 2017; Kendall et al., 2015) and has been shown to be equivalent to performing vari-
ational inference (Gal & Ghahramani, 2016). However, these approximating methods suffer from
mode collapse, as evidenced in Blei et al. (2017). Another method, Cost-Effective Active Learning
(CEAL) (Wang et al., 2016), uses the entropy of the network’s outputs to quantify uncertainty, with
additional pseudo-labelling. This can be seen as the deterministic counterpart of DBAL, that adds
highly confident samples directly from predictions, without the query process. Kading et al. (2016)
propose a method on the expected model output change principle. This method approximates the ex-
pected reduction in the model’s error to avoid selecting redundant queries, albeit at a computational
cost. Lastly, as this work was being developed, we found the work of Beluch et al. (2018), who
propose to use deterministic ensemble models to obtain uncertainty approximations. Their method
scores high both in terms of performance and robustness.
Density-based Methods & Hybrid Methods. Sener & Savarese (2017) looked at the data selection
process from a set theory approach (core set) and showed their heuristic-free method outperforms
existing uncertainty-based ones. Their acquisition function uses the geometry in the data-space to
select the most informative samples. The main idea is to try to find a diverse subset of the en-
tire input data space that best represents it. Although achieving promising results, the core set
approach is computationally expensive as it requires solving a mixed integer programming optimi-
sation problem. Ducoffe & Precioso (2018), on the other hand, rely on adversarial perturbation to
select unlabeled samples. Their approach can be seen as margin based active learning, whereby
distances to decision boundaries are approximated by distances to adversarial examples. To the best
of our knowledge, the only hybrid method (combining measures of both uncertainty and represen-
tativeness) tested within a CNN-based DAL framework is the one proposed in Wang & Ye (2015).

Although originally not tested on CNNs, this method was shown to perform worse than the core set
approach in Sener & Savarese (2017).
Deep Bayesian Active Learning. Given the set of inputs X = {x1, .., xn} and outputs Y =
{y1, .., yn} belonging to classes c, one can define a probabilistic neural network by defining a model
f (x; θ) with a prior p(θ) over the parameter space θ, usually Gaussian, and a likelihood p(y =
c|x, θ) which is usually given by softmax(f (x; θ)). The goal is to obtain the posterior distribution
over θ:
(θlXY- p(y∣x, θ)p(θ)	(1)
p( | , ) =	p(Y∣X)	()
One can make predictions y* about new data points x* by taking a weighted average of the forecasts
obtained using all possible values of the parameters θ, weighted by the posterior probability of each
parameter:
P(y*∣χ*, x, Y) = / P(y*∣χ, Θ)p(Θ∣x, Y)dθ =Eθ 〜p(θ∣X,Y) [f (x; θ)]	(2)
The real difficulty arises when trying to compute these expectations, as has been previously covered
in the literature (Neal, 2012; Hinton & Van Camp, 1993; Barber & Bishop, 1998; Lawrence, 2001).
One way to circumvent this issue is to use Monte Carlo (MC) techniques (Hoffman et al., 2013;
Paisley et al., 2012; Kingma & Welling, 2013), which approximate the exact expectations using av-
erages over finite independent samples from the posterior predictive distribution (Robert & Casella,
2013). The MC-DroPoUt technique (Srivastava et al., 2014) will replacep(θ∣X, Y) with the dropout
distribution q(θ). ThiS method scales well to high dimensional data, it is highly flexible to accom-
modate complex models and it is extremely applicable to existing neural network architectures, as
well as easy to use.
In DBAL (Gal, 2016), the authors incorporate Bayesian uncertainty via MC-dropout and use acqui-
sition functions that originate from information theory to try and capture two types of uncertainty:
epistemic and aleatoric (Smith & Gal, 2018; Depeweg et al., 2017). Epistemic uncertainty is a
consequence of insufficient learning of model parameters due to lack of data, leading to broad pos-
teriors. On the other hand, aleatoric uncertainty arises due to the genuine stochasticity in the data
(noise) and always leads to predictions with high uncertainty. We briefly describe the three main
types of acquisition functions:
•	MaxEntropy (Shannon, 2001). The higher the entropy of the predictive distribution, the
more uncertain the model is:
H [y|x, θ] = -Xp(y = c|x, θ)logp(y = c|x, θ)	(3)
c
•	Bayesian Active Learning by Disagreement (BALD) (Houlsby et al., 2011). Based on the
mutual information between the input data and posterior, and quantifies the information
gain about the model parameters if the correct label would be provided.
I(y, θ∣x, θ) = H[y|x; X, Y] - Eθ〜p(θ∣χ,γ) ∣H[y|x, θ]]	(4)
•	Variation Ratio (Freeman, 1965). Measures the statistical dispersion of a categorical vari-
able, with larger values indicating higher uncertainty:
VarRatio(x) = 1 - max p(y|x, θ)	(5)
As seen in Gal (2016), for the above deterministic acquisition functions we can write the stochas-
tic versions using the Bayesian MC-Dropout framework, where the class conditional probability
p(y |x, θ) can be approximated by the average over the MC-Dropout forward passes. The stochastic
predictive entropy becomes:
H[y∣χ, θ]
(6)
K corresponds to the total number of MC-Dropout forward passes at test time. Equivalent stochastic
versions can be obtained for all other acquisition functions.

3 Debal: Deep Ensemble Bayesian Active Learning
3.1	Experimental Details
We consider the multiclass image classification task on two well-studied datasets: MNIST (LeCun,
1998) and CIFAR-10 (Krizhevsky & Hinton, 2009). Table 1 contains a summary of the results,
with the acquisition size containing the initial training set with the batch size for one iteration up
to the maximum number of points acquired. At each acquisition step, a fixed sample set from the
unlabelled pool is added to the initial balanced labelled data set and models are re-trained from the
entire training set. We evaluate the model on the dataset’s standard test set. The CNN model archi-
tecture is the same as in the Keras CNN implementation for MNIST and CIFAR-10 (Chollet et al.,
2015). We use Glorot initialization for weights, Adam optimizer and early stopping with patience
of 15 epochs, for a maximum of 500 epochs. We select the best performing model during the pa-
tience duration. We use MC-Dropout with K = 100 forward passes for the stochastic acquisition
functions. In all experiments results are averaged over three repetitions. For the ensemble models
discussed later, each ensemble consists of M = 3 networks of identical architecture but different
random initializations.
3.2	Evidence of Mode Collapse in DBAL
Our experimental results confirmed the performance of Gal (2016) using MC-dropout. However, we
observe a lack of diversity in the data acquired during the AL process. This effect is more extreme
in the initial phase, which is an important factor when dealing with a small dataset classification
problem (see Figure 1).

number of images in training set: 1,000. Bottom: After first 8 acquisition iterations. Total number
of images in training set: 100.
One can argue that the preferential behaviour observed is a desirable one and is arising from the
fact that images belonging to some specific classes are more uncertain and difficult to classify, due
to resemblance of data from other classes. To debunk this hypothesis, we trained a model with the
same architecture on the entire 60,000 sample training set available and used this model to rank the

uncertainty for each sample from the 10,000 samples test set. As can be seen in Appendix Figure 7,
over-represented class labels during the AL experiment do not have high uncertainty. To assess
positive effects of over-sampling, we evaluated how easy models at the end of AL process classified
them and observed no such effect (Appendix Figure 8).
Smith & Gal (2018) argue that the MC-Dropout technique suffers from over-confident predictions.
They are particularly concerned with the interpolation behaviour of the uncertainty methods across
unknown regions (regions of the input space not seen during the model training phase). We per-
formed a similar analysis in order to gain understanding into how these methods behave. Following
their experimental setting, we use a VAE (Kingma & Welling, 2013) to project the MNIST dataset
into a 2-dimensional latent space. Figure 2 allows us to visualize the encodings and decode points
from latent space to image space, together with their associated measures of uncertainty. The large
black regions behind the data suggest that the model is unrealistically over-confident about data
that does not resemble anything seen during training, thus providing further evidence supporting
MC-Dropouts main deficiency: mode-collapse.
3.3	Deep ensembles: a recipe for useful uncertainty estimation
We hypothesize that one of DBALs main deficiencies is its inability to capture the full posterior
distribution of the data (mode collapse). This can prevent the model from learning in an optimal way,
leading to unsatisfactory performance when classifying previously unseen images. As suggested in
Smith & Gal (2018) and Lakshminarayanan et al. (2017), one intuitive fix would be to replace the
single MC-Dropout model in the AL process with an ensemble of MC-Dropout models, with each
member of the ensemble using a different initialization. Since one MC-Dropout model collapses
around a subspace (one, or a few local modes) of the posterior distribution, a collection of such
models, starting from different initial configurations, will end up covering different (and somehow
overlapping) sub-regions of the probability density space. However, one key assumption here, is that
each model member of the ensemble will end up capturing the behaviour around a different local
mode. Beluch et al. (2018) test this idea in a deterministic setting, where the uncertainty resulting
from the use of a deterministic ensemble proved to be more useful for the active learner than the
uncertainty provided from a single MC-Dropout network.
We propose DEBAL, a stochastic ensemble of M MC-Dropout models, with M << K. Each
member of the ensemble is characterized by a different set of weights θm. We use the randomization-
based approach to ensembles (Breiman, 1996), where each member of the ensemble is trained in
parallel without any interaction with the other members of the ensemble. We consider the ensemble
as a mixture model where each member of the ensemble is uniformly weighted at prediction time.
For our task, this corresponds to averaging the predictions as follows:
p(y∣χ; X, Y) = M Xp(y∣χ, θm)	⑺

Equation 7 corresponds to the deterministic ensemble case. Our predictions are further averaged by
a number of MC-Dropout forward passes, giving rise to what we call a stochastic ensemble:
p(y|x; X, Y) = Mm Kk XX p(y|x, θm,k	⑻
mk
θm,k denotes the model parameters for ensemble model member m in the k MC-Dropout forward
pass. Each of the two equations can then be used with acquisitions functions previously described.
In the deterministic ensemble case, we just replace the number of forward passes k with the number
of ensemble classifiers m to obtain expressions for uncertainty. The predictive entropy for our
stochastic ensemble becomes:
H[y|x；χ,Y] = - X (MK XXp(y = c|x,θm,k))log(MKK XXp(y|x,θm,k))⑼
c	mk	mk
For both datasets, DEBAL shows significant improvements in classification accuracy (Figure 3 -
similar results obtained for all other acquisition functions but for sake of clarity we illustrate results
for BALD only). The better performance of the deterministic ensemble method over the single MC-
Dropout one is in agreement with similar results presented in Beluch et al. (2018), and is attributed
to better uncertainty estimates obtained from the ensemble. We hypothesize that the additional
improvement is a result of better uncertainty estimates from the stochastic ensemble.
To validate our claims, we compare the uncertainty behaviour between single network MC-dropout
and DEBAL, as can be seen qualitatively in Appendix Figure 10 by the elimination of ”black holes”
in the latent space of DEBAL. Secondly, we observe how the methods behave on both seen and un-
seen distributions, using the NotMNIST dataset of letters A-J from different fonts (Bulatov, 2011).
BALD uncertainty results for this approach are evidenced in Figure 4. We sample 2,000 balanced
and random images from the MNIST test set and, similarly, 2,000 images from the NotMNIST test
set. For MNIST, we make sure that the randomly selected images did not end up being acquired dur-
ing AL. This corresponds to data unseen during training but originating from the same distribution
source. For the known distribution, both methods produce low uncertainty for the majority of the test
samples, as expected. However, for the single MC-Dropout network the distribution is character-
ized by fatter tails (both extremely confident and extremely uncertain about a significant number of
images). The ensemble method, however, results in a more clustered distribution of the uncertainty.
This further illustrates that ensemble learns a more representative part of the input space.
On the unseen distribution (Figure 4), the broad uniform distribution of uncertainty from the single
network illustrates the presence of images about which the classifier is both extremely certain and

uncertain. This implies that the network learned some specific transferable features that are recog-
nizable in part of the new dataset. For the ensemble, on the other hand, the uncertainty is much
smaller and more centered on a few values. This implies that the features learned during the ini-
tial training on MNIST are more general. This behaviour is a more realistic one to expect when
evaluating a similar but new dataset. Apart from correcting for the mode-collapse phenomena, the
MC-Dropout ensemble also does a better job in identifying and acquiring images from the pool set
that are inherently more difficult to assign to a particular class (Appendix Figure 11).
3.4 Deterministic vs stochastic ensemble
In order to explain the additional improvement in DEBAL, we performed an analysis on both seen
(MNIST) and unseen (NotMNIST) distributions similar to the one presented before. Figure 5 com-
pares the histograms of BALD uncertainty obtained from the two methods using the ensemble mod-
els obtained at the end of the AL process. Additionally, we show the accuracy of the models cor-
responding to each binned subset of the test data. When the images are coming from a known
distribution (MNIST), for both methods the accuracy decreases as the level of uncertainty increases.
This observation suggests that the ambiguity captured by these methods is meaningful. However,
the stochastic ensemble is more confident. Judging by the accuracy along the bins, this additional
confidence seems to reflect meaningful uncertainty.
By observing the uncertainty behaviour on the unseen distribution (Figure 5, right), the stochastic
ensemble is more confident overall than its deterministic counterpart, but at the same time, its un-
certainty is more meaningful, as evidenced by the reduction in classification accuracy as we move
towards the uncertain (right) tail of the distribution. On the other hand, the classification accuracy

of the deterministic ensemble is more uniform, with both tails of the distributions (most and least
certain) seeing similar levels of accuracy. This suggests that the uncertainty produced by the deter-
ministic ensemble is less correlated with the level of its uncertainty and hence less meaningful.
Uncertainty calibration. We used the ensemble models obtained at the end of the AL experiments
to evaluate the entire MNIST test set. We looked whether the expected fraction of correct classifica-
tions matches the observed proportion. The expected proportion of correct classifications is derived
from the models confidence. When plotting expected against observed fraction, a well-calibrated
model should lie very close to the diagonal. Figure 6(left) shows that the stochastic ensemble method
leads to a better calibrated uncertainty. An additional measure for uncertainty calibration (quality) is
the Brier score (Brier, 1950), where a smaller value corresponds to better calibrated predictions. We
find that the stochastic ensemble has a better quality of uncertainty (Brier score: 0.0244) compared
to the deterministic one (Brier score: 0.0297). Finally, we investigated the effect of training the
deterministic ensemble with data acquired by the stochastic one. Figure 6 (right) shows that incor-
porating stochasticity in the ensemble via MC-Dropout leads to an overall increase in performance,
further reinforcing our hypothesis.
4 Conclusion and Future Work
In this work, we focused on the use of active learning in a deep learning framework for the image
classification task. We showed empirically how the mode collapse phenomenon is having a negative
impact on the current state-of-the-art Bayesian active learning method. We improved upon this
method by leveraging off the expressive power and statistical properties of model ensembles. We
linked the performance improvement to a better representation of data uncertainty resulting from
our method. For future work, this superior uncertainty representation could be used to address one
of the major issues of deep networks in safety-critical applications: adversarial examples.
