Table 1: Accuracy rates (%) comparing existing state-of-the-art methods when trained with andwithout our self-binarizing technique. Top-1 and Top-5 results are reported for CIFAR-100 andImageNet. Also, Top-1 results are reported for CIFAR-10. Bw, Ba, and BBN indicate the numberof bits required to represent the values of the weights, activations, and batch normalization outputs.
