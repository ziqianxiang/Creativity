Table 1: Average number of annotations required to reach a predefined quality level.
Table 2: Increasing the number of annotations still using logis-tic regression (first three rows) and using SVM instead of logisticregression as the base classifier (fourth row). We report the aver-age number of annotations required using Rs and the percentagesaved by either Us or OURS.
