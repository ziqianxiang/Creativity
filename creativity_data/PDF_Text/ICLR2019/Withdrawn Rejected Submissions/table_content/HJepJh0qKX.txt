Table 1: The matching rates of easy and hard examples among various CNNs in CIFAR-10 and miniImageNet. Since the values in the tables are symmetric and redundant, we put ”-” on unnecessarytable cells for clarity. We use 10% of examples with the highest and lowest easiness to calculate thematching rate between different CNNs architectures. Random means that we randomly select 10% ofexamples from the datasets.
