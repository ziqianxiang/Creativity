Table 2: Detected periodicities on real DatasetConclusion and future workThis paper describes an algorithm called CFD-Autoperiod detecting periodicities in time series andimproving the autoperiod method proposed in Vlachos et al. (2005). CFD-Autoperiod can be appliedon noisy time series containing multiple periodicities and output raw periodicities that can later berefined by external domain specific knowledge (for instance 24h for human daily activities). Onecase not treated in this study concerns non-stationary series. A possible technique would consists intracking the evolution of the periodicities through time and using a Kalman filter to track the appari-tion, disappearance or evolution of the detected periodicities. Using the confidence of the Kalmanfilter we could decide whether to continue considering the presence of a particular periodicity in8Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2019the signal even if it is not detected for a while. This would strengthen the results obtained by CFD-Autoperiod and give more reliable periodicities. Thus, even more complex machine learning modelscan be built on top of them.
