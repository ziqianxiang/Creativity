Table 1: DeepmindLab TaskD Successor Representation and State GraphsSuccessor Representations encode the information regarding the state connectivity without explicitlymodelling the same. This is advantageous over other methods that work with the graph Laplaciansince building graphs become intractable in very large state spaces. To understand the same, weanalyze the 2-dimensional projections of SRs obtained from grid worlds using t-SNE (Maaten &Hinton, 2008). Figure 9 clearly indicates that the adjacency information of the states are presentin the SR matrix. The number of distinct clusters are highly indicative of the number distinct wellconnected regions present in the environment.
