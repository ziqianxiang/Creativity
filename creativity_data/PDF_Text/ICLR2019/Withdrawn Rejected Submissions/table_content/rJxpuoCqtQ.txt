Table 1: The summary of test errors out of 10 runs. Best results in bold. SH and A1H both succeededto achieve a good log likelihood sufficiently often. The set average A1H however suffered from adivergence in one training instance, showing its potential instability. The traditional cross entropyH fails to converge when the output is presented in a different order in each iteration. Hausdorffdistance failed to converge in all cases.
Table 2: The summary of the success rate for the 10 runs of 16 training scenarios. Best results inbold. SH and A1H both succeeded to reconstruct the binary vectors in the 8 puzzles. The traditionalcross entropy H and the Hausdorff distance H1H both failed to reconstruct the binary vectors.
Table 3: The summary of the success rate for the 10 runs of 16 training scenarios, where the size ofthe set randomly varies from 4 to 9 in the dataset. Best results in bold. The proposed SH achievedthe best success rate overall, A1H comes next, the traditional cross entropy H and the Hausdorffdistance H1H both failed in most cases.
Table 4: The best results of 10 runs. Both SH and A1H successfully converged below the sufficientaccuracy.
Table 5: The best results of 10 runs. Both SH and A1H successfully converged below the sufficientaccuracy.
Table 6: The summary of the rule learning task, 10 runs.
