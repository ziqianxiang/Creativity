Qualitatively, it appears as if ourapproach is most accurate when there is a single target object with little crowding. However, if thetarget object is small and in a crowded region of the image, performance is less reliable.

(2009). We executed a large scale evaluation of our approach by using all images in ImageNetthat are annotated with ground truth localization information. This subset contains 300,916 imagesinvolving 478 object classes. We divided this data set into a training set, a test set, and a validationset by sampling without replacement (i.e., the intersection between each pair of the three sets wasempty). There were 225,687 images (75%) in the training set, and there were 45,137 images in eachof the other two sets.

Our algorithm appears to do well on some objects, such as balls and dogs. One might suspect8Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2019that failures arise in the linear mapping from sensitivity maps to bounding box coordinates, but aperusal of the sensitivity maps, themselves, suggests that the pixel sensitivity values vary in utilityacross different object categories. Still, our method performs fairly well across the classes. Note thatthe IOU does not fall below 0.62 for any class. This suggests that, while some individual imagesmay be problematic, the overall performance for each class is quite good. This universally strongclass-specific performance is also displayed in Table 4.
