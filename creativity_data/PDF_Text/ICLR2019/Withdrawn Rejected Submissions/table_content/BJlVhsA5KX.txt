Table 1: Dataset statistics.
Table 2: Test error rate (%) of different methods on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. The widening factorand the growth rate are denoted next to depth for WRN-based models and DenseNet-based models,respectively. The error rate of our method is median of five runs.
Table 3: Performance of WRN and WRN-SRS on CIFAR-100 with different configurations. Bdenotes mini-batch size. Learning rates decay at the epochs in “LR schedule with” by the factor of“Decay”.
