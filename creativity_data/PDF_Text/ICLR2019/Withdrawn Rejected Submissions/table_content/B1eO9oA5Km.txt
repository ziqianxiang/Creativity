Table 1: Results are on 1M parallel data and 1M monolingual data. 2L represents only using one pairlanguages, (i.e. results en → fr, fr → en are from one experiments) while 3L represents using en, frand es to conduct multilingual translation in one experiment leveraging GLF.
Table 2: Results are on 0.5M parallel data and 0.5M monolingual data. f denotes for RSM.
Table 3: LoW resource results. In this experiment, We only use 10k data on es - fr while 0.5M oneither en - fr and fr - es. f denotes for DQN scheduling. ] denotes for sequential scheduling.
