Table 1: Memory types of networksNetworks	Memory type	VRNN	state memory	internal memoryLSTM	memory of a single compounded event at a time	external memoryNeural stack	memory of multiple events, information of each event should be used sequentially, only one event is accessible at each time step	external memoryNeural RAM	memory of multiple events, all are accessible at each time step, no restriction on how many times they are used	external memory4	Memory Structure AnalysisIn this section, we analyze the memory structures of four popular RNNs: vRNN, LSTM, neural stackand neural RAM. Attention is paid to how their underlying memory organizations lead to differentfeatures and expressive power.

For example, as long as it is a positive word, whetherit is ‘love’‘good’ or ‘like’ is not very important. Hence, multi-slot memory which can store multiplecontents does not have more advantages than the single-slot memory.
