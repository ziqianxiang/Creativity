Table 1: NLL under PL for sets of size k = 20 sampled over the unit square. DPPNET achievescomparable performance to the Dpp, outperforming the other baselines.
Table 2:	NLL (mean ± standard error) under the true DPP of samples drawn uniformly, accordingto the mode of the DppNet, and from the Dpp itself. We sample subsets of size 20; for each classof digits we build 25 feature matrices Φ from encodings of those digits, and for each feature matrixwe draw 25 different samples. Bolded numbers indicate the best-performing (non-Dpp) samplingmethod.
Table 3:	NLLs on CelebA and MovieLens (mean ± standard error); 20 samples of size 20 weredrawn across 20 different feature matrices each for a total of 100 samples per method; DppNet is thenon-Dpp model achieves the best NLLs.
