For this to succeed, the acceleration methods should utilize different types ofredundancy in the network. In this section, we verify that probability layer can be combined with anacceleration method of using spatial redundancy, PerforatedCNN (Figurnov et al. (2016)), to achievehigh speed up while increasing top-1 accuracy.

With no overhead, probability layer can achieve an equivalent or better performancethan transfer learning. An effective class skew detector is provided, serving as the base for probabilitylayer. Further, combining probability layer with existing pruning approaches both increases accuracyand decreases resource consumption. In the future, we will generalize our approach to other tasks,i.e., RCNN for object detection and semantic segmentation, which would be straightforward as longas parts of the architecture is a CNN model.
