Table 1: Categorization of some of existing RNN architectures according to its physical ODEcounterpart. LSTM (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997): long-term short-term memory RNN withL hidden layers. GRU (Cho et al., 2014): gate model recurrent neural network with L hidden layers.
Table 2: Comparison of the LSTM architecture and nth order ORNN structure.
Table 3: Comparison of the representation of linear algebra in quantum and in classical literature.
Table 4: A top-down comparison between QUNN, LSTM, URNN and n-t-ORNN structure.
