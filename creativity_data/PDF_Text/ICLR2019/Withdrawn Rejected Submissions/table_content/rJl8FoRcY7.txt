Table 1: Evidence loWer bound test for uni- and multi-modal setups of the VAEs (higher is better).
Table 2: Various VAE architectures and optimizers for the e-MNIST and MoG experiments. um/mmstand for uni- and multi-modal while fc refers to fully-connected layers.
Table 3: CVAE architecture for each dataset MNIST and fashion-MNIST. The label as one-hot-vector is concatenated after the convolution layers and fed into the fully-connected (fc) layers. Forconvolutional architectures the numbers in parenthesis indicate strides, while padding is alwayssame.
