Table 1: Quantitative results of applying resource-efficient techniques. bold/italics indicatesbest/second-best trade-off.
Table 2: Quantitative results of applying techniques on different parts of the model. We took thebest three derived models given three different budgets and compared them with previous models inTable 3 bold/italics indicates best/second-best trade-off.
Table 3: We extend the table that is provided by Ahn et al. (2018) and compared our best threemodels (in order). For fair comparisons, we do not include models that are much bigger or muchsmaller than our derived models.
Table 4: Quantitative results of applying 8-bit integer quantization in TF-Lite.
Table 5: Quantitative results of applying ternary-Weighted SP convolutions. We omit the use ofgroup convolutions as it leads to worse results. c_out refers to the number of output channels in eachSP convolution layer.
