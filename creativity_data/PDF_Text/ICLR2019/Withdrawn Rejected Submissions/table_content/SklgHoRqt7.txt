Table 1: Average accuracy and fairness violation, together with their 95% error margin with modelstrained with uniform weighting and the proposed MOEW. We consider two approaches: minimizingfairness violation with identical decision threshold across racial groups (Approach 1), and maximizingaccuracy with racial-group-specific thresholds for equal FPR on the training data (Approach 2).
Table 2: Average test metric and 95% error margin with models trained with uniform exampleweights, importance weighting and the proposed MOEW. Larger test metric is better.
