Table 1: Reconstructed sentences from the VAE and AutoGen. Sentences are not “cherrypicked”: these are the first four sentences reconstructed from a grammatically correct inputsentence, between 4 and 20 words in length (for aesthetics), and with none of the sentencescontaining an unknown token (for readability).
Table 2: Results from a blind survey comparing reconstruction quality. Respondents weretold to “choose the best reconstruction”, and where ambiguous, could discard sentence pair.
Table 3: Sentences generated from the prior, Z 〜 N(0,I), for the VAE and AutoGen.
Table 4: Results from a blind survey testing generation quality. Respondents were asked“does this sentence make sense” for a randomized list of sentences evenly sampled from thefour models. Results are split into two sentence lengths L in order to mitigate the bias ofthe VAE models to generate short sentences.
Table 5: Latent variable interpolation. Two sentences (first and last sentences shown) arerandomly selected from the test dataset and encoded into z1 and z2 . Sentences are thengenerated along 10 evenly spaced steps from z1 to z2 . This interpolation was not “cherrypicked”: it was our first generated interpolation using the same filters as in previous tables.
