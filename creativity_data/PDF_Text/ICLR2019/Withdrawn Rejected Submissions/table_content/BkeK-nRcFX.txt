Table 1: Activation functions used in this study with important metrics. See main text for explanationand section E.4 for details.
Table 2: Illustration of the function computed by fully-connected batchnorm-ReLU networks atdifferent depths in the randomly initialized state. Each disc represents a 2D subspace of the inputspace and each color corresponds to a different region of the output space. CIFAR10 was used tocompute the NLC.
