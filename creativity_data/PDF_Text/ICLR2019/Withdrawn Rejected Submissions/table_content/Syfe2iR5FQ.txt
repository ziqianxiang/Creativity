Table 1: Human pose estimation task. Study of the redundancy of each of the modes of theparameter tensor. We compress one dimension at a time by reducing its corresponding rank in theTucker-tensor. Reported accuracy is in terms of PCKh.
Table 2: Human pose estimation task. Comparison between our T-Net and (a) the original network“compressed” by reducing the number of features and (b) the layer-wise decomposition method ofKim et al. (2016). Reported accuracy is in terms of PCKh.
Table 3: Segmentation task. Comparison between our T-Net and a network with the same architec-ture and the same number of features as the compressed one. Our approach is capable of retaining ahigh accuracy even at high compression rates (up to 7x).
