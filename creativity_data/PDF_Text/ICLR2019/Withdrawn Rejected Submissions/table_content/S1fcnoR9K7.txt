Table 1:	Performance of Alrao, of SGD with optimal learning rate from{10-5, 10-4, 10-3, 10-2, 10-1 , 1., 10.}, and of Adam with its default setting. Three convo-lutional models are reported for image classification on CIFAR10, three others for ImageNet, andone recurrent model for character prediction (Penn Treebank). The Alrao learning rates have beentaken in wide a priori reasonable intervals, [ηmin; ηmax] = [10-5; 10] for CNNs (CIFAR10 andImageNet) and [10-3; 102] for RNNs (PTB). Each experiment is run 10 times (CIFAR10), 5 times(PTB) or 1 time (ImageNet); the confidence intervals report the standard deviation over these runs.
