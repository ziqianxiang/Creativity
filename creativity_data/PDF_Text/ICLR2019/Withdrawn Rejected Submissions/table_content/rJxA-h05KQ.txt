Table 1: methods used for benchmarks. Both the base network methods will serve as baselines.
Table 2: Datasets and neural architectures used.
Table 3: Out of distribution detection results. The green colour shows the best results, the red -results worse than any of the baselines.
Table 4: Predictive performance experiment results and computational overhead. Only the baselineand Inhibited Softmax have neither additional parameters nor require multiple forward passes. Thegreen color shows the best results, the red - results worse than the baseline. We compare InhibitedSoftmax and baselines with methods that require more forward passes and/or more params.
Table 5: Wrong prediction detection results (ROC AUC). The green color shows the best results,the red - results worse than any of the baselines.
