Table 1: Classification errors (%) of com-pared methods on two-ring artificial dataset.
Table 2: Classification errors (%) of compared methods on FashionMNIST dataset.
Table 3: Classification errors (%) of compared methods on SVHN / CIFAR-10 dataset.
Table 4: The structure of convolutional neural networks for experiments on CIFAR-10 and SVHN,based on Springenberg et al. (2014); Salimans et al. (2016); Laine & Aila (2016). All the con-volutional layers and fully connected layers are followed by batch normalization except the fullyconnected layer on CIFAR-10. The slopes of all lReLU functions in the networks are 0.1.
