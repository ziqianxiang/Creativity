Table 1: Localization with a varying number of context images. Using attention (‘+att’) and morecontext images leads to better results. Even with no prior on poses, the generative+attention modelresults in better MSE. However the discriminative+attention model assigns higher probability to theground-truth pose since the prior allows it to concentrate more mass near context poses.
