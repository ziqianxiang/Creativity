Table 1: Results of RGC are achieVed by non-quantized RGC method, and results of qRGC areachieVed from quantized RGC method using RedSync. The left table : Accuracy results for Vari-ous networks. Size indicates the model size in MB. GFlop shows Giga Floating-Point Operationsrequired for a forward pass using a single input sample. Accuracy of CNNs was measured as top-1Validation errors, and accuracy of LSTMs is measured as perplexity on Validating dataset. Resultson Cifar10 were measured using 4 nodes with batch-size as 64 for each node. Results on ImageNetwere measured using 6 nodes with batch-size as 32 for each node. Results of LSTM were measuredusing 4 nodes with batch-size as 5 for each node. The right table: Test errors of RCG and SGDmethods under different batch sizes on Cifar10.
