All actor networks are followed by a tanh ∙ max action sizeBCQ. BCQ uses four networks: a perturbation model ξφ (s, a), a critic Qθ (s, a), a value networkVψ(s), and a state-conditioned VAE Gω(s), along with a target value network Vψ0 (s). Each networkin BCQ follows the default architecture (Figure 6) and the default hyper-parameters (Table 1). Forξφ(s, a, Φ), the constraint Φ is implemented through a tanh activation multiplied by I ∙ Φ following
