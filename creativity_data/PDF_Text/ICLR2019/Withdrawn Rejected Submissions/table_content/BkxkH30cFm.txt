Table 1: Prediction performance on Monster Kong. k-m means the k-to-m generalization problem.
Table 2: Performance of long-range prediction on Monster Kong. n-acc means n-error accuracy.
Table 3: Performance of the object dynamics prediction on 1-5 generalization problem on FlappyBird. t and ± indicates training with only 100 and 300 samples.
Table B4: Average motion prediction error in two experiment environments. ↑ and ↑ correspond tothe same sample restriction experiments in Table 1 and 315Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2019Appendix C Implementation details for experimentsObject Detector in the dynamics learning level and Instance Splitter in the dynamic instance seg-mentation level have similar architectures with Object Detector in OODP (Zhu et al., 2018). Toaugment the interactions of instances when training Instance Splitter, we random sample two regionproposals and combine them into a single region proposal with double size.
