Table 1: Statistics of all ten classes of images in CIFAR-10 dataset, trained on VGG16. Column1is class number; column2 is baseline accuracy; column3 is semi-supervised training accuracy; col-umn4 is the difference between column3 and column2; column5 is significance test of column4;column6 is softmax baseline accuracy; column7 is the difference between column6 and column2;column8 is the significance test of column7; column9 is the difference between column3 and col-umn6.
Table 2: Statistics of all ten classes of images in CIFAR-10 dataset, trained on ResNet18.
Table 3: Labeling accuracy of the assembled model. Semi-supervised training technique is appliedon VGG16 network.
Table 4: Mean AP of faster R-CNN model. The model is a VGG16 that is already trained for60,000 iterations. Here “train” stands for semi-supervised training that utilizes part of VOC2012,and “baseline” stands for model only uses VOC2007 training set.
