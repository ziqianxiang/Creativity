By encoding the original images using Convolutional Auto-Encoder (CAE),the negative images become not easily viewable during storage. By using the incremental learningmechanism, only encoded information is kept for future learning once new data is available. Inthe following section we discuss about Convolutional Auto-Encoder (CAE) and presents its use toaddress privacy issues as well as to simulate human brain encoding mechanism.

However, when we reduce the pseudo-exemplar size to 67% performance starts to degrade. The quality of reconstructed images frompseudo-examples is not as good as real images as can be seen in Figure 1. With decreasing pseudo-exemplar size, the reconstructed images becomes more and more blur and edges appear less and lesssharp. However, when we further reduce the pseudo-exemplar size to 16.6% system performanceimproves as we can see in the last row of Table 3 for both pseudo-sample and real test images. As wehave discussed in Section 4.1, pseudo-examples with the size of 16.6% gives reconstructed imageswith sharper edges at the expense of increasing noise. And, shapes and colors of background startto fade (or blend) and object standouts from the background. This makes feature maps of the CNN
