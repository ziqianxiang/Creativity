Table 1: The table shows the averaged success rates, calculated over 100 episodes, in multitaskand zero-shot scenario for the model trained with DQN versus DQN with ACTRCE. The standarddeviations are calculated across 2 seeds. In the Multitask (MT) scenario, the goal for the episodeis sampled from the training set of instructions but with a random environment initialization. ForZero-Shot (ZSL), the instruction is sampled from the held out test instruction set and with a randomenvironment initialization.
