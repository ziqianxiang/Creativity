Table 1: Per-iteration compute and memory costs for gradient descent, standard (vanilla) evolution-ary strategies, and the method proposed in this paper, guided evolutionary strategies. Here, F0 is thecost of a function evaluation, F1 is the cost of computing a surrogate gradient, n is the parameterdimension, k is the subspace dimension used for the guiding subspace, and P is the number of pairsof function evaluations used for the evolutionary strategies algorithms.
