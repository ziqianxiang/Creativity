Table 1: The result table for the experiment on the ALOI dataset.
Table 2: Results for 3D chair 360° view synthesis. The proposed method uses significantly lessparameters during inference, requires the least FLOPs, and yields the fastest inference times. FLOPcalculations correspond to inference for a single image with resolution 256×256×3.
Table 3: Results for simultaneous colorization and attribute modification on synthetic face dataset.
Table 4: Ablation/comparison results using identical encoder, decoder, and training procedure.
