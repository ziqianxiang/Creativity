Table 1: Top-1 Validation accuracy (%) over 10Gbps Ethernet showcasing an additional comparisonwith the AD-PSGD asynchronous doubly-stochastic approach.
Table 2: Average time per iteration (seconds) over 10Gbps Ethernet showcasing an additional com-parison with the AD-PSGD asynchronous doubly-stochastic approach. The average time per itera-tion for the asynchronous method is calculated by dividing the average time per epoch by the totalnumber of iterations per epoch.
