Table 1: Test errors (%) and 95% confidence intervals (%). When two results have overlappingconfidence intervals, they are considered equivalent. Best results are marked in bold. The numbersfollowing the model names indicate the number of hidden layers used. For kMLPFAST, we also include(in parentheses) the portion of centers retained, i.e., the number of training examples randomly chosenas centers for the given layer divided by the size of the training set.
Table 2: Average test error (%) and standard deviation (%) from 20 runs. Results with overlapping95% confidence intervals (not shown) are considered equivalent. Best results are marked in bold. Theaverage ranks (calculated using average test error) are provided in the bottom row. When computingconfidence intervals, due to the limited sizes of the data sets, we pooled the 20 random samples.
