Table 1:	Database task. Storing 5000 elements.
Table 2:	Hyper-parameters considered14Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2019E Experiment DetailsFor the class-based familiarity task, and uniform sampling task, the model was trained on the trainingset and evaluated on the test set. For the class-based task sampling, a class is sampled at random andS is formed from a random subset of images from that class. The queries q are chosen uniformlyfrom either S or from images of a different class.
