Table 1: Neural architecture used for each dataset in Section 4.
Table 2: NMF early stopping for few-shot learning of MNIST digits with only 20 samples. Byobserving the training set accuracy under NMF k = 1 compression, we are able to correctly guessthe gradient of the test set accuracy. Early stopping at the first peak consistently improves accuracy.
