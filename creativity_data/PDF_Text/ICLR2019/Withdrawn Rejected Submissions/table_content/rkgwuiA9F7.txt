Table 1: CWAE achieves similarFID (lower is better) and sharpness(higher is better) to WAE-MMD onthe original WAE architecture (seeAppendix E for details).
Table 2: Comparison between different models output distributions and the normal distribution,together with reconstruction error. All models outputs except AE are similarly close to the normaldistribution. Normality is assessed by comparing Mardiaâ€™s skewness, kurtosis, and the reconstructionerror. For reference FID scores are provided as well (except for MNIST, where it is not defined).
