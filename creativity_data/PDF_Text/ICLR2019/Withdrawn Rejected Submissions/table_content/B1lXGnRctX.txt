Table 1: Table showing object identification test accuracies for training objects given ground truthand predicted haptic forces. There are 11 objects in the training set, many of which were importedfrom ShapeNet (Chang et al. (2015)).
Table 2: Table showing object identification accuracies given different episode lengths on the 11objects imported from Shape-Net.
Table 3: Table showing object identification accuracies given 2, 3 and 5 held-out objects to bediscriminated from. We see that the haptic embedding yields a meaningful increase in classificationaccuracy.
