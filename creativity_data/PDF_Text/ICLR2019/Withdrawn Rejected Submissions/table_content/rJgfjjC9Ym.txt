Table 1: Accuracy Comparisons on CIFAR and ImageNet. On CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, we reporttest set error statistics with ResNet-164 over four models trained with different random seeds. ForImageNet, we report 10-crop Top-5 error on the validation set with ResNet-34 and ResNet-152.
Table 2: Comparison of maximum batch-size and wall-clock time per training example (i.e., trainingtime per-iteration divided by batch size) for different ResNet architectures on CIFAR-10.
