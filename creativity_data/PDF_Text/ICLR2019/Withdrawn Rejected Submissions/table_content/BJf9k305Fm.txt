Table 1: Loss Study. We compare the performance of the original agent with the agent operating onreconstructed frames instead. The original performance represents an upper bound for the score ofthe same agent which is operating on reconstructions instead. Shown are average scores over 20 runs.
Table 2: Synthesizing unseen states. We compare generated samples to their closest neighbor in thetraining set and compute the percentage of pixels whose values differ by at least 25%, e.g. 73% of thesynthesized samples differ in more than 20% pixels in comparison to their closest training sample.
