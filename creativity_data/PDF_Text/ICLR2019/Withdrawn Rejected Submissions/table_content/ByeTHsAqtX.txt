Table 1: Mean overlap results for various cases. FC refers to a fully-connected network with twohidden layers of 100 neurons each and ReLU activations. ConvNet refers to a convolutional networktaken from Chollet et al. (2015). By default, no regularization was used. The regression data set wassampled from one period of a sine function with Gaussian noise of standard deviation 0.1. We usedSGD with a mini-batch size of 64 and Î· = 0.1, unless otherwise specified. All models were trainedfor a few epochs, and the reported overlap is the mean over the last 1,000 steps of training. Plots offtop for many of these experiments are collected in Appendix D.
