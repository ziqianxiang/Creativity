Table 1: A summary of different test cases we classified in this work. Here a(b) ∈ [0, 1] representsthat a(b) follows a uniform distribution in [0,1]. a(b) ≈ 0.25(√^) represents that a(b) follows anormal distribution with mean 0.25(-12), standard deviation 0.05, and which is truncated in [0,1].
Table 2: A summary of maximal success rate when the error rate is exactly 0 for different test caseswe have classified in this work. They were calculated using Eq. 2.7 and obtained theoretically usingmethods mentioned in Section 3.
