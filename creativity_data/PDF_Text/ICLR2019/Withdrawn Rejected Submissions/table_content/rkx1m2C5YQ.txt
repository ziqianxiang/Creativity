Table 1: Qualitative comparison of our approach to re-cent related work.
Table 2: Our approach outperforms the generic LSTM and GRU Baselines. The GRU with m = 8and the LSTM with m = 6 where designed to have roughly the same amount of parameters as theRKN with b = 3. In the case where m = b the RKN uses a full transition matrix. fc stands for fullcovariance matrix, i.e., we do not use factorization of the belief state.
Table 3: Comparison on the image imputation task. The informed models where given a mask ofbooleans indicating which images are valid and which not. The uninformed models where givena black image whenever the image was not valid. E2C and SIN only work in the informed case.
Table 4: Comparison of our approach With the LSTM and GRU Baselines on the Quad Link Pen-dulum. Again the RKN performs significantly better than LSTM and GRU Who fail to performWell.
