We measure probability of correct classification as a function of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)for that dataset. For the Radio-ML dataset our base neural network from which we build the GRN instep 4 of Algorithm 1 is given at the top of Figure 4(b). The black box attack network for Radio-MLis a version of LeNet-5 CNN used in (Oâ€™Shea et al., 2016) and is shown at the bottom of Figure 4(b).
