Table 1: Test accuracies on synthetic datasets from step and hyperparameter setting with best devaccuracy. Results that are within .5% of the best accuracy are bolded. POMP: Position-OracleMatch-Pattern; E: Explicit baseline model; IR: Implicit baseline model; IA: Improved implicit model.
Table 2: Regular expressions used to generate the synthetic datasets, and properties of the synthetic datasets. Edits per replacement (EPR) is the number of editsrequired for a typical replacement of the pattern with the replacement. Average context displacement (ACD) measures the average distance between a regex capturegroup in the pattern and where the characters in that capture group appear in the replacement.
Table 3: Comparing variations of the Improved Implicit models. Table reports test accuracy athyperparameter and step that achieved best dev accuracy. IA-v: Vanilla decoder with sum aggregator;IA-vg: Vanilla decoder with GRU aggregator; IA-a: Analogy decoder with sum aggregator; IA-ag:Analogy decoder with GRU aggregator.
