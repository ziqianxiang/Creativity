Table 1: Model’s performance on the multimodal 5-shot regression with two or three modes. A Gaussiannoise with μ = 0 and σ = 0.3 is applied. The three modes regression is in general more difficult (thus highererror). In Multi-MAML, the GT modulation represents using ground-truth task identification to select differentMAML models for each task mode. MuMoMAML (wt. FiLM) outperforms other methods by a margin.
Table 2: 5-way and 20-way, 1-shot and 5-shot classification accuracy on OMNIGLOT Dataset. For each task,the best-performing method is highlighted. MuMoMAML achieves comparable or better results against state-of-the-art few-shot learning algorithms for image classification.
