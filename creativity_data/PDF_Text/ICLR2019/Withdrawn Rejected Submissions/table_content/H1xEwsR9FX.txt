Table 1: Performance comparison of CRFs on the synthetic benchmark. The speed tests have beendone on a Nvidia GeFore GTX 1080 Ti GPU and an Intel Xeon E5-2630 CPU. The images areprocessed in full resolution. ConvCRF utilize GPU computation while FullCRF inference is computedon CPU. Conv7 denotes a ConvCRF with filter size 7.
Table 2: Performance comparison of CRFs on validation data using decoupled training. +C usesconvolutions as compatibility transformation and +T learns the Gaussian features. The same unarieswere used for all approaches, only the CRF code from DeepLab was utilized.
