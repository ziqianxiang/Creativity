Table 1: Character error rates (CERs %) of mixed speech recognized by the baseline multi-lingualsingle-speaker ASR system.
Table 2: CERs (%) of mixed speech recognized by our proposed multi-lingual multi-speaker ASRsystem.
Table 3: Oracle CERs (%) of isolated speech for each of the utterances appearing in the mixturesused in Tables 1 and 2, recognized by the baseline multi-lingual single-speaker ASR system.
Table 4: Language ID error rates (LERs %) of the baseline, proposed, and oracle systems.
Table 5: Examples of multi-lingual multi-speaker recognition result. The CER of hypotheses HYP1and HYP2 are shown in the parentheses, respectively. Errors are emphasized in red color. “*” is aspecial token inserted to pad deletion and insertion errors for better readibility.
