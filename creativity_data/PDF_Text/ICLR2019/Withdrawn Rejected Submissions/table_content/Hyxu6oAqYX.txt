Table 1: Noise model: probability of an error occurring depends linearly on an input feature. Wereport the class weighted mean f1 score on the noise-free test set along with the standard error.
Table 2: Noise model: probability of an error occurring depends quadratically on an input feature.
Table 3: Noise model: probability of an error occurring depends linearly on the distance from classboundary (which is defined by the clean dataset before noise is synthetically introduced). We reportthe class weighted mean f1 score on the noise-free test set along with the standard error.
Table 4: We compare the label re-weighting scheme of Ren et al. (2018) with our proposed model.
