Table 1: Test errors of ERKNets and IRKNets, evaluated on CIFAR-10 without data augmentation.
Table 2: Test errors evaluated on CIFAR and SVHN. k is growth rate. The multiscale featurestrategy is used in RKNets. A and B represent attentional transition and bottleneck respectively.
Table 3: Classification errors on ImageNet validation set with a single-crop (224Ã—224). The growthrate k is 32 and mk is the initial number of channels in each period in RKNets. mn stands for m inthe nth period. For each RKNet in this table, m0 is 2, m1 is 4 and m2 is 8. B represents bottleneck.
