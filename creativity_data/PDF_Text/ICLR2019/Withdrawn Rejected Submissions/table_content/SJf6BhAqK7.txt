Table 1: ClUstering comparison on5-way 1-shot semi-sUp. Omniglot.
Table 2: Alphabet and character recognition accuracy.
Table 3: Unsupervised clustering byBANDE. BANDE clusters with high purityand normalized mutual information (NMI)across a wide range of unseen classes, whileprior prototypical methods are undefined.
Table 4: Fully-supervised few-shot accuracy using 100% of the labeled data. BANDE performs equalto or better than prototypical networks (Snell et al., 2017). Although BANDE is more general, it canstill recover uni-modal clustering as a special case.
Table 5: Semi-supervised few-shot accuracy on 40% of the labeled data with 5 unlabeled examplesper class and 5 distractor classes. The distractor classes are drawn from the complement of thesupport classes and are only included unlabeled. BANDE achieves equal or better accuracy thansemi-supervised prototypical networks (Ren et al., 2018).
Table 6: Results on Omniglot for different gradient accumulations. Bolded results are not significantlydifferent from each other.
