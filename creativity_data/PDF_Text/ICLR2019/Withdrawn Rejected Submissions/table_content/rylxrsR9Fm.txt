Table 1: Cifar-10 test errors of NHN and other methods. The first block represents handcraftedarchitectures. The second block represents architectures discovered by random search methods. Thethird block represents evolutionary architectures. Note that ”d/o” stands for Dropout, ”s/s” standsfor Shake-Shake regulation, "c/o” stands for Cutout, and “d/p” stands for Drop-path. Score =，(e/2)2 + (n/25)2, where e denotes the test error in percentage and n denotes the number ofparameters in million. Smaller score indicates better overall performance. *The performance ofEvolving DNN on Cifar-10 is reported by Liu et al. (2018).
