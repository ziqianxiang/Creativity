Table 1: Accuracy of all models on SGN & EQA test sets for both Easy & Hard difficulties.
Table 2: Accuracy of all the ablation models trainedwith and without Auxiliary tasks on SGN and EQAtest sets for the Doom EaSy environment.
Table 3: The performance of a trained policy ap-pended with object detectors on instructions con-taining unseen words (‘red’ and ‘pillar’).
Table 4: Instructions and questions for ViZDoom experiments. We used 5 object classes (torch, pillar, keycard,skullkey, armor), 4 colors (red, green, blue, yellow), 2 sizes (tall, short), and 2 superlative sizes (smallest,largest).
Table 5: Accuracy of all the models on the SGN andEQA train and test sets for the House3D Domain.
Table 6: Instructions and questions for House3D experiments. We used 6 object classes (refrigerator, of-fice_chair, fish_tank, fireplace, bed, sofa) and 4 colors (red, green, blue, yellow).
