Table 6: Properties of the datasets. TS, Str, Text, and Img stand for Time-Series, String, text, andImage respectively. Var stands for the number of variables for time-series, word embeddings, andimage SIFT-descriptors while Alpb stands for the size of the alphabet for strings. Note that all datasamples have quite different range of lengths in different datasets.
