Table 1: Statistics of the datasets used in this paper. #ACS: average number of background sentencesper example. *: We split each paragraph into sentences on SQuAD.
Table 2: Experimental results of the OpenQA task on Quasar-T, SearchQA and TriviaQA. We com-pare our results with three state-of-the-art models: Denoise OpenQA (Lin et al., 2018), Re-Ranker(Wang et al., 2018b) and S-Norm (Clark & Gardner, 2018). *: Our aggregation-based OpenQAmodel trained only using the distantly supervised label.
Table 3: Comparison of our sentence discriminator and other baselines. The Distant and Seman-tic model use distantly supervised labels and semantic labels for training respectively.
Table 4: An example on Quasar-T, where sentences are given semantic labels and distantly super-vised labels. We evaluate the sentence by whether it is actually supportive to the question. Text spanin blue is the ground truth answer for the question, while text spans in red are not.
