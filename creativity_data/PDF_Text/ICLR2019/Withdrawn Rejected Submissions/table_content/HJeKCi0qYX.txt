Table 1: Dataset Information5.2	MILE Framework PerformanceWe first evaluate the performance of our MILE framework when applied to different graphembedding methods. Figure 3 summarizes the performance of MILE on different datasetswith various base embedding methods on various coarsening levels2 (exact numbers can beseen in Table 3 of Appendix). Note that m=0 corresponds to original embedding method.

Table 3: Performance of MILE. DeepWalk, Node2Vec, GraRep, and NetMF denotes theoriginal method without using our MILE framework. m is the number of coarsening levels.
Table 4: Comparisons of graph embeddings between MILE and its variants. Except forthe original methods (DeepWalk and NetMF), the number of coarsening level m is set to1 on PPI/Blog/Flickr and 6 on YouTube. Mi-F1 is the Micro-F1 score in 10-2 scale whileTime column shows the running time of the method in minutes. “N/A” denotes the methodconsumes more than 128 GB RAM.
