Table 1: List of datasets, tasks, and models for standard tasks that we compress with LIT.
Table 2: Inception Salimans et al. (2016) and FID Heusel et al. (2017) scores for different versions ofStarGAN. Despite having fewer layers than the teacher, the LIT student model achieves the best scores.
Table 3: Ablation study of LIT. We performed LIT, KD, and three modifications of LIT. The second blockwas used for single IR experiments. As shown, LIT outperforms KD and the modifications, while allthe modifications underperform standard KD. Left: ResNet, Right: ResNeXt.
Table 4:	Effect of intermediate representation loss on student model accuracy. L2 and L1 do notsignificantly differ, but smoothed L1 degrades accuracy. Average of three runs on CIFAR10.
Table 5:	Affect of mixed-precision training on the LIT procedure. Mixed-precision training does notsignificantly affect the accuracy of the LIT procedure. Average of three runs on CIFAR10.
Table 6:	ResNet and ResNeXt types for CIFAR10/100.
