Table 1: Example training sequences for the ConsSent encoders.
Table 2: Performance of ConsSent on the transfer tasks in the SentEval benchmark. SkipThoughtis described in (Kiros et al., 2015), QuickThoughts in (Logeswaran & Lee, 2018) and MultiTaskin Subramanian et al. (2018) and InferSent in Conneau et al. (2017). The other numbers (exceptLangMod) have been taken from Conneau et al. (2018). SK-R and SK-E stand for SICK-R andSICK-E respectively. AVG is a simple average over all the tasks. Bold indicates best result amongour non-ensemble models and underline indicates best overall for unsupervised methods.
Table 3: Performance of ConsSent on the linguistic probing tasks in the SentEval benchmark. Scoresfor QuickThoughts were obtained using the model provided by the authors. The other numbers(except LangMod) have been taken from (Conneau et al. (2018)).
