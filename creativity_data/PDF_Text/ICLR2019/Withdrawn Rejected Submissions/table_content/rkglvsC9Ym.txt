Table 1: Sharpness (larger is better) and FID (smaller is better) on MNIST dataset.
Table 2: Sharpness (larger is better) and FID (smaller is better) on CelebA dataset.
Table 3: Sharpness (larger is better) and FID (smaller is better) on MNIST dataset. All the percent-ages are computed w.r.t squared L2 loss.
Table 4: Sharpness (larger is better) and FID (smaller is better) on CelebA dataset. All the percent-ages are computed w.r.t squared L2 loss.
