Table 1: Comparison with other architecture search methods on CIFAR-10. The notation “+c/o”indicates the cutout (DeVries & Taylor, 2017). The search cost indicates the GPU days for the ar-chitecture search, i.e., without the re-training cost. The result of the architecture randomly sampledfrom our search space is also listed as RANDOM.
Table 2: Comparison of PSNR and SSIM in the inpainting tasks. CE and SII indicate the contextencoder (Pathak et al., 2016) and the semantic image inpainting (Yeh et al., 2017), which are CNN-based methods. E-CAE means the model obtained by the architecture search method using theevolutionary algorithm (Suganuma et al., 2018). BASE is the same depth of the best architectureobtained by E-CAE but having the 64 channels and 3 × 3 filters in each layer with a skip connection.
