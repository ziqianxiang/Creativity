Table 1: Word level natural language modelling results on PTB and WikiText-2. The output di-mensions are 10,000 and 33,278 respectively. The top1, top5 and top10 accuracies is used asmetric.
Table 2: Speedup comparison for neural machine translation on IWSLT English to Vietnamese andthe vocabulary size is 7,709. Bleu score on testing with greedy searching is used as metric.
Table 3: Result on Chinese handwritten character recognition. The accuracy in testing dataset isreported as the performance for each model.
Table 4: Comparison with SVD-softmax on real device latency. The “ms” indicates the latency inmicroseconds. Bold fonts indicate better results.
