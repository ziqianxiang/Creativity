Table 1: Comparison with previous work on collaborative multi-agent communication with continuous vectors.
Table 2: Success rates on 3 different settings of cooperative navigation in the SHAPES environment.
Table 3: Success rates on traffic junction. Our targeted 2-stagecommunication architecture gets a success rate of 97.1% on the‘hard’ variant of the task, significantly outperforming Sukhbaataret al. (2016). Note that 1- and 2-stage refer to the number ofrounds of communication between actions (Equation 4).
