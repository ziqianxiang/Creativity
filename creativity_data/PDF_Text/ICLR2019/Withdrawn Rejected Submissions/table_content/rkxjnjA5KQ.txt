Table 1: The score and number of frames needed for it of: the source task (Source), target task wheninitialized with the source task’ network parameters with no additional training (Target) and the targettask when initialized with the source task’ network parameters where every frame is translated to aframe from the source task (Target with GANs).
Table 2: The scores of the agent on every level of Road Fighter with and without analogy-transfer, aswell as the number of game-interaction frames needed for for the analogy transfer and for achieving asimilar score with RL training.
Table 3: The scores accumulated by an Actor-Critic RL agent using UNIT and Cycle-GAN.
