Table 1: Test results on IWSLT’14 De-En. We observe that the proposed RIL with the fixed role(+Residual) improves the translation quality up to 1 BLEU point over the baseline and 0.5 BLEUover the matched baseline. Both our baselines as well as the model with the proposed RIL clearlybeat the previous state-of-the-art results obtained using comparable setups.

Table 3: Source-side (English) roles discovered by the RIL trained on WMT’14 En-De. The discov-ered roles generally correspond to meaningful, context-dependent of tokens. Frequency is computedover the development set. We omit roles that are rarely used or hard to interpret.
Table 4: The case study of the German BPE token ‘der’ using the IWSLT’14 model. Based on thecontext, different roles are assigned to the single token ‘der’.
Table 5: Source-side (English) roles discovered by the RIL trained on WMT’17 En-Fi. We observethat the discovered roles generally correspond to syntactic roles of tokens and that they are context-dependent. Frequency is computed over the development set. Roles that are rarely used or hard tointerpret are omitted.
