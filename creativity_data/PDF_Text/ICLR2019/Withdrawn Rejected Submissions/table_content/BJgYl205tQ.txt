Table 6:	The generator and discriminator network used for the MNIST dataset. Conv(x, y, z) repre-sents a convolution layer with x filters of kernel size y × y and stride z. ConvTr(x, y, z) representsa transposed convolution layer with x filters of kernel size y × y and stride z. FC(x) represents afully connected layer with x output nodes. BN represents a batch normalization layer, R representsthe reshape operation and LReLU is the LeakyRelu.
