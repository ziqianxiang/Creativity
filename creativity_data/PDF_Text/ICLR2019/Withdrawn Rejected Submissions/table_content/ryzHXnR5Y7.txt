Table 1: Average Top-1 error and standard deviation for 3 runs of different proxy models across arange of subset sizes of the CIFAR10, SVHN, and Amazon Review Polarity datasets. ‘-’ indicatesthat the SVP reached within 1 standard deviation of the average error of the target model trainedover all of the dataset with a smaller subset size, adding more data does not result in significantimprovements and performance plateaus.
