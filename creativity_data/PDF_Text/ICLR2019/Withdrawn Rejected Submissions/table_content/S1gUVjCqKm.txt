Table 1: Other methods have the ground-truth number of classes. UCUC is not given the number ofclasses. Other results are reported in (Shaham et al., 2018).
Table 2: Model Architecture in the MNIST and CIFAR10 experiments.
Table 3: The hyperparameters for the networksA.B Additional Experimental ResultsIn the latent space H, Z, the each class subset has a Gaussian distribution, which implies the subsetis convex. We observed that the connector networks Ci are not identical among the whole classes.
