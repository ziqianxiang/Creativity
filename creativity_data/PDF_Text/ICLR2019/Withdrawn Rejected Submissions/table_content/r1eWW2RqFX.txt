Table 1: Classification accuracy usingPointNet (Qi et al. (2017a)). SG: Train onShapeNet training sets, and test on gen-erated shapes; GS: Train on generatedshapes, and test on ShapeNet testing sets.
Table 2: The comparison on classification accuracybetween our models and other unsupervised methodson ModelNet40 dataset. All the methods train a lin-ear SVM on the high-dimensional representations ob-tained from unsupervised training.
