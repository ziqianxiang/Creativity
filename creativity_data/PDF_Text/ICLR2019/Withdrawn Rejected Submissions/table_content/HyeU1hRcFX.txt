To quantify theseparability, we compute the class-wise KL divergence between the real and the generated digits(for each class) using a nearest neighbor density estimation technique (Duda et al. (2012)), shown inFigure 7. It can be seen that each mode (class) in the generated data has a unique digit with which theKL is least, signifying a digit-wise semantic separation. To quantify the goodness of the generateddata, we compute “Frchet Inception Distance” (FID) which is a measure proposed to capture thecloseness of the generated images to real data Heusel et al. (2017). Table 2 lists the FID obtainedafter 5 runs for NEMGAN and two comparable models, VEEGAN and InfoGAN. It can been seenthat NEMGAN achieves the least FID that is close to the real MNIST digits signifying the goodnessof the images generated.
