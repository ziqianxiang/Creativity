Table 1: Accuracy and rates (R) for each model. Bold indicates the best score in that column. Determdoesn’t have a rate, since it doesn’t have an explicit encoder distribution. The final rate for the otherfour models is reported, as well as the peak rate achieved during training. The true mutual informationfor Fashion MNIST is I(X; Y) = 2.3 nats, so achieving R = 2.3 is optimal according to MNI.
Table 2: Results for out-of-distribution detection (OoD). Thrsh. is the threshold score used: H isthe entropy of the classifier; R and Reχ/y are defined in Section 9. Arrows denote whether higher orlower scores are better. Bold indicates the best score in that column for a particular OoD dataset.
Table 3: Results for adversarial example detection (Attack). All attacks are targeting the “trousers”class in Fashion MNIST. CW is Carlini & Wagner (2017b). CW, (C = 1) is CW with an additionalconfidence penalty set to 1. CW, (C = 1) Det. is a custom CW attack targeting CEB’s detectionmechanism, ReX/γ^. L0, L1, L2, L∞ report the corresponding norm (mean ±1 std.) of successfuladversarial perturbations. Higher norms on CW indicate that the attack had a harder time findingadversarial perturbations, since it starts by looking for the smallest possible perturbation. Theremaining columns are as in Table 2. Arrows denote whether higher or lower scores are better. Boldindicates the best score in that column for a particular adversarial attack.
