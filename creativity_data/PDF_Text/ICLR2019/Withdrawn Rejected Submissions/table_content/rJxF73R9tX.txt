Table 1: Comparison of performance of DAC against related work for data corrupted with uniformlabel-noise. The DAC is used to first filter out noisy samples from the training set and a DNN is thentrained on the cleaner set. Each set also shows the performance of the baseline DNN trained withoutremoving noisy data. Also shown is the performance of a hypothetical oracle data-cleaner that hasperfect information about noisy labels. The numbers in parentheses next to the DAC indicate thefraction of training data filtered out by the DAC and the remaining noise level. For the oracle, wereport just the amount of filtered data (remaining nosie level being zero). Lq and truncated Lq resultsreproduced from (Zhang & Sabuncu, 2018); MentorNet results reproduced from (Jiang et al., 2018)The DAC approach is also significantly simpler than the methods based on the mentor-studentnetworks in (Jiang et al., 2018) and (Han et al., 2018), or the graphical model approach discussedin (Vahdat, 2017). In summary, the results in this section not only demonstrate the performancebenefit of a data-cleaning approach for robust deep learning in the presence of significant label noise,but also the utility of the abstaining classifier as a very effective way to clean such noise.
