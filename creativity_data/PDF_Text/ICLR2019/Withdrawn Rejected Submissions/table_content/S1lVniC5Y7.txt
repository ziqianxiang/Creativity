Table 1: Single Model Perplexity on Test set of Penn Tree Bank. Node evolved using GP outper-forms the node discovered by NAS (Zoph & Le, 2016) and Recurrent Highway Network (Zillyet al., 2016) in various configurations.
Table 2: F1 scores computed on Piano-Midi dataset. LSTM outperforms both the evolved nodeand NAS node for language, but not the node evolved specifically for music, demonstrating that theapproach discovers solutions customized for the task.
