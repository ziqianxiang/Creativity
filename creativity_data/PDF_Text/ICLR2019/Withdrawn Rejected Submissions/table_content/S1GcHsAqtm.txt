Table 1: Select pruning results on Penn Treebank using a 4-layer QRNN, along with past resultsdrawn from the original papers. Skip LSTM refers to the four-layer skip LSTM from Melis et al.
Table 2: Select pruning results on WikiText-103 using a 4-layer QRNN, along with past results,drawn directly from the original papers. Note that Rae et al. (2018) primarily explore Hebbiansoftmax; Rae-LSTM refers to their LSTM model without any extensions. Bolded are the best resultsfor each category.
