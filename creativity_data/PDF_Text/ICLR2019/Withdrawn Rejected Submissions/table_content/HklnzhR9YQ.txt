Table 1: Comparison of CNN architectures. “Channel size (Dense FNN case)”: The number ofchannels needed to realize a function represented by a fixed-width dense FNN. “Channel size (β-Holder case)”： The number of Channles needed to approximate a β-H0lder function with accuracyε measured by the sup norm. “Increasing”: The width of layer is monotonically increasing. “Full”:Filter size is as large as the layer width. “Padding”： Whether the theory includes convolution oper-ations with padding.
