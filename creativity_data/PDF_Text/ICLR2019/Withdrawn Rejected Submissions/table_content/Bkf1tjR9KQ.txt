Table 1: Performance of Dvolver and competitive methods on CIFAR-10. NASNet results are the ones wecould reproduce in our setup on the same training conditions as the rest of our results. There are 2 FLOPS for1 Mult-Adds (MACs).
Table 2: Performance of Dvolver and NASNet on ImageNet. NASNet results are the ones we could reproducein our setup on the same training conditions as the rest of our results. It is on par with the median value foundby Ramachandran et al. (2017) but lower than the official results (Top-1 74%) found by Zoph et al. (2017).
Table 3: Performance of Dvolver and other state-of-the-art models on ImageNet. Result for NASNet-A swishis the median found in Ramachandran et al. (2017).
Table 4: Search efficiency for Dvolver and other state-of-the-art related methods. DPP-Net values are for 4layers as described in Dong et al. (2018).
