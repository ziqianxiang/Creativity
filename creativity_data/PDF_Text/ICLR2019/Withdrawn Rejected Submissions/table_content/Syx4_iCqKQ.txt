Table 1: The effect of maximum margin separation and semantic priors for classification inpolar prototype networks. Separation is quantified by the minimum and maximum cosine distanceamong the polar prototypes. We find that an approximate maximum margin separation using ourMonte Carlo or evolutionary algorithm is sufficient for effective classification. Furthermore, we findthat incorporating semantic priors in our evolutionary algorithms results in polar prototypes withlarge margin separation, semantic structure, and effective classification performance.
Table 2: Classification for few training examples onCIFAR-100. Adding semantic priors to our polar pro-totypes aids classification performance when examplesare more limited.
Table 3: Regression performance of polar prototype networks for predicting creation year inpaintings. Shown are the mean absolute error rates. Polar prototype networks largely outperformstandard network regression when using SGD. With Adam, we also report better performance. Polarprototype networks are an effective and robust solution for regression in neural networks.
