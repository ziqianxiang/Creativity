Table 1: Representative scenarios and cases in the threat model from the perspective of a defenderregarding if some information about the attacker is known.
Table 2: Five adversarial example datasets. Source example indices are for each digit class. Methodparameters notations: E is input variation, Î¸ is pixel step size, Y is maximum distortion, max_iter isthe maximum number of iterations, and step is linear search step size.
