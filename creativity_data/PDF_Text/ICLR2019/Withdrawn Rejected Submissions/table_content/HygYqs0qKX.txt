Table 1: Comparison between con-scious inference against standard in-ference on YOLOv3 across iterations.
Table 2: The influence of different perturbations.
Table 3: The trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness of conscious inference on YOLOv3.
Table 4: The influence of different perturbations on COCO. Iter-1 result is reported.
Table 5: The results on PASCAL VOC 2007. Iter-1 result is reported.
Table 6: Comparison of our conscious inference against standard inference using the 6D pose pre-diction baseline Tekin et al. (2018). As customary, 2D reprojection error is the evaluation metric.
