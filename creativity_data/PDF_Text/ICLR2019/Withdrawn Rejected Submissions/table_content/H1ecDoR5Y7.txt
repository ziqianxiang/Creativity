Table 1: List of benchmark WGANs (WGAN and WGAN-GP with non-zero centered gradientpenalty) and 5 penalty measures with a simple gradient penalty term. In this table, WGAN-GPrepresents the previous model proposed by (Gulrajani et al., 2017), which penalizes the WGANwith non-zero centered gradient penalty terms, whereas Î¼GP represents the simple method. In ourexperiment, no additional weights are applied on 5 penalty measures and they are all probabilitydistributions.
Table 2: Benchmark score results obtained based on the CIFAR-10 dataset under DCGAN andResNet architectures. The higher inception score and lower FID indicate the good quality of thegenerated images.
