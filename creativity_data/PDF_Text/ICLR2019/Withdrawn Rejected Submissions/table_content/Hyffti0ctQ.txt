Table 1: The main results for PWH Framework. ’baseline’ means the performance of the originalmodel. ’50% pruned’ in column-4 denotes that compressed model’s channel number is 50% less thanoriginal’s. Results on different network architectures for different tasks demonstrate the superiorityof PWH Framework. Our approach outperforms hints-only and pruning-only for a large margin.
Table 2: The comparison of the reconstructingfeature map error between pruned model andrandom initial model.
Table 3: The effects of iterative operation. ’70%pruned’ in column-4 denotes that compressedmodel’s channel number is 70% less than origi-nal’s.
