Table 1: The number of cases that the absolute correlation value is higher than a certain value (0.9,0.8, 0.7, 0.6, and 0.5) out of all the node pairs.
Table 2: The amount of gradient information flowing through layers during training. The values inthe table are the average value of the absolute value of gradient of all nodes in each layer during thewhole iterations.	____________________________________________	Without Dropout	With DropoutLayer3	9.35E-05	-5.83E-04-Layer2	1.40E-04	6.52E-04Layer1	1.07E-04	5.93E-04gradients to flow easily even when the net is in the saturation areas. Likewise, we believe that dropoutcould increase the amount of gradient in a similar way.
Table 3: The average of net variances in each layer during training with dropout.
Table 4: Experiment results on MNIST. The accuracies and epochs are the average values of fiveexecutions. The numbers in the parentheses are the corresponding standard deviations.
Table 5: Test accuracies (%) on CIFAR and SVHN. The numbers are Top-1 accuracies. Theimprovements achieved by GAAF are presented in the parentheses.
