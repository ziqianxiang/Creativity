Table 1: Theoretical asymptotic compression rates for different compression methods broken downinto components. Only SBC reduces all multiplicative components of the total bitsize (cf. eq. 1).
Table 2: Final accuracy/perplexity achieved on the test split and average compression rate for differentcompression schemes in a distributed training setting with different numbers of clients.
Table 3: Final accuracy achieved on the test split and average compression rate for different compres-sion schemes in a Federated learning setting with different numbers of clients.
Table 4: Hyperparameters used for our experiments in sections 2 and 4.
