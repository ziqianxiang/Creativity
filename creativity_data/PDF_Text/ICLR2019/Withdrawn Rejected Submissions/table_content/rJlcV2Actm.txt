Table 1: Targeted problems of different methods.
Table 2: Comparison of the statistics for mcfsImageNet and previously used datasets. “#c” and “#fdenote the number of coarse classes and fine classes, respectively. “-” means “not applicable”.
Table 3: Different models’ performance of supervised learning (test accuracy) on mcfsImageNet.
Table 4: Comparison w.r.t. the accuracy (%) of different approaches in meta-learning scenario onmcfsImageNet. Test accuracy is reported as the averaged over 600 test episodes along with the cor-responding 95% confidence intervals are reported. In the first row, “n-k” represents n-way (class)k-shot. Mem-1, Mem-2, and Mem-3 indicate 3 different kinds of memory. In 50-way experiments,Relation Net stops to improve after the first few iterations and fails to achieve comparable perfor-mance (more details in Appendix D).
Table 5: Comparison on mcfsOmniglot. Symbols and settings are the same as Table 4.
