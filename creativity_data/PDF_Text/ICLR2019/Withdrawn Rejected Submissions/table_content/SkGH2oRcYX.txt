Table 1: Experiment results in different training setupsTable 1 shows the values obtained for epw and eV GG54 for the different configurations of traininglosses. From the results, we can see that the adversarial loss does not get all the information requiredto properly model the dynamics of the environment. Also, when combining the adversarial loss withthe mutual-information loss Lc, pixel recovering improves, but the content metric eV GG54 does notimprove. Finally, combining all those three losses provides a valuable gain, both in terms of pixelvalues and content recovering.
