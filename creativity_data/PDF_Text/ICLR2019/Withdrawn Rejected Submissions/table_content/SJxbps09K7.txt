Table 1: Dataset properties. See ยง3.1 for Procrustes fit. k-Isospectrality is k-subgraph isospectrality(ยง3.1). Directionality is the variance in the inner products with means (Mimno and Thompson, 2017).
Table 2: Main experiments; average performance and stability across 10 runs. We consider a P@1score below 1% a fail. MUSE is the MUSE system with default parameters. Ablation transforms:M-unit uses unit length normalization to evaluate the impact of shape; M-PCA uses PCA-basedpruning to evaluate the impact of density; M-noise uses 25% random vectors injected in the targetlanguage space to evaluate the impact of noise. M-discr uses discriminator loss for model selection,as a baseline for M-cosine; M-cosine uses our model selection criterion. The macro-averaged errorreduction of M-cosine over MUSE for the Hard languages is 7%; and 4% across all language pairs.
