Table 1: Top-1 success rates(%) of FGSM and IGSM attacks. The row and column denote the source and targetmodels, respectively. For each cell, the left is the success rate of FGSM (ε = 15), while the right is that of IGSM(T = 5, α = 5, ε = 15). The dashes correspond to the white-box cases, which are omitted.
Table 2: Top-1 success rates (%) of attack from the source model (row) to the target model (column). (a) FGSMattack for MNIST with ε = 40 and D denotes the depth of the fully connected network. (b) FGSM attack forCIFAR-10 with ε = 10.
Table 3: Top-1 success rates(%) of non-targeted IGSM and sg-IGSM attacks. The row and column denote thesource and target modesl, respectively. For each cell, the left is the success rate of IGSM (T = 100, α = 1),while the right is the that of sg-IGSM (T = 5, α = 5). In this experiment, distortion level ε = 15.
Table 4: Top-5 success rates (%) of ensemble-based approaches for IGSM (T = 20, α = 15) versus sg-IGSM(T = 20, α = 15). The row and column denote the source and target models, respectively. The Top-1 rates canbe found in Appendix C, which show the same trend as the Top-5 rates.
Table 5: Top-1 success rates (%) of momentum attacks and smoothed gradient attacks. The row and columndenote the source and target model, respectively. Each cell contains three rates corresponding to mIGSM,sg-IGSM and sg-mIGSM attacks, respectively.
Table 6: Top-1 success rates (%) of ensemble-based non-targeted IGSM and sg-IGSM attacks. Therow and column denote the source and target model, respectively. The left is the success rate of IGSM(T = 100, α = 3), while the right is that of sg-IGSM (T = 50, α = 3). The distortion ε = 20.
Table 7: Top-1 success rates (%) of ensemble-based targeted IGSM and sgd-IGSM attacks. The rowand column denote the source and target model, respectively. The left is the success rate of IGSM(T = 20, α = 15), while the right is that of sg-IGSM (T = 20, α = 15). The distortion ε = 20.
