Table 1: Accuracy of different models under white-box adversarial attacks evaluated using MNIST.
Table 2: Accuracy of different models under black-box IFGSM attacks evaluated using MNIST.
Table 3: Test accuracy of different models under white-box adversarial attacks evaluated usingSVHN. The e2SAD models are trained with soft labels while all other models are trained withhard labels. The definitions of all variables are identical to those used in Table 1.
