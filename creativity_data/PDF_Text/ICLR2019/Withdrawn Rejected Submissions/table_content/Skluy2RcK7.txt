Table 1: The percentage of precision, CCMAS and top-class units in each layer at different thresholdcut-offs.
Table 2: Interpretability judgements for AM images. The number of judgments for conv5, fc6 andfc8 were 1332, 10,656 and 5,181, respectively.
Table A1: CCMAS selectivity measures for extreme example units. Across all the tested units,prob.322, fc8.393, fc7.31, fc6.582 and conv5.unit78 were the units with the highest CCMAS mea-sures. Units fc6.1199, fc8.11 and prob.11 were displayed in Figs. 3 & 4.
Table A2: Average CCMAS measures across layers (note that these values are not normally dis-tributed, see figures A2 and A3.
