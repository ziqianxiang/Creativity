Table 1: Hyperparameters used in our PPO and PPO-CMA implementationWe use the same network architecture for all neural networks. Action repeat of 2 means that thepolicy network is only queried for every other simulation step and the same action is used for twosteps. This speeds up training. N is specified in simulation steps. H is used only for PPO-CMA.
