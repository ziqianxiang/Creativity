Table 1: Accuracies of ImageNet models under different noise algorithms using a noise budget of 300.0 inthe I2 norm. Entry (i,j) indicates the accuracy of each model j when evaluated on noise from attack i. Thelast two columns report the mean and max accuracy of the classifiers on a particular attack. We see that NSFWsignificantly outperforms noise generated by an ensemble classifier for all choices of attack algorithms.
Table 2: Classification accuracies for deep learning MNIST models under different noise algorithms. As in theImageNet case, we find that the NSFW algorithm improves upon the performance of state-of-the-art attacks androbustly optimizes over the entire set of classifiers. Moreover, we find that, for all attacks, there is a significantdifference between the average and maximum accuracy of classifiers in C, further highlighting the need todesign noise algorithms that are guaranteed to inhibit the performance of the best possible model.
