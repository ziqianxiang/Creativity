Table 1: Examples of different adversarial inputs. The substituted word is highlighted.
Table 2: Correlation of automatic metrics tohuman judgment of adVersarial source and targetSentences. “*” indicates that the correlation is Sig-nificantly better than the next-best one.
Table 3: Target RDchrF and source chrF scores for all the attacks.
Table 4: Example of CharSwap attacks on the fr-en BiLSTM. The first example is a successfulattack (high source chrF and target RDchrF) whereas the second is not.
Table 5: chrF (BLEU) scores on the original test set before/after adversarial training.
Table 6: Robustness to CharSwap attacks with/without adversarial training. Lower is better.
