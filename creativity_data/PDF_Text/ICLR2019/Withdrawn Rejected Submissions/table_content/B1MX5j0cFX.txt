Table 1: Subspace angles between Top 5 SVD vectors from gradients of test points for each networkand invariant directions (small 2° rotations) respectively.
Table 2: Architectures used for experimentsModel Architectures For the MNIST and Fashion MNIST based experiments we use the 7 layerarchitecture of GCNN similar to Cohen & Welling (2016). The StdCNN architecture is similar tothe GCNN except that the operations are as per CNNs. Refer to Table 2 for details. RotEqNetarchitecture is as given in Marcos et al. (2017). The NN architecture is a 2 layer fully connectedwith 784-50 neurons in the layers with dropout. For the CIFAR10 based experiments we use theResNet18 architecture as in He et al. (2016) and it’s equivalent in GCNN as given in Cohen &Welling (2016). Input training data was augmented with random cropping and random horizontalflips, apart from the specific range of rotation augmentation as needed.
