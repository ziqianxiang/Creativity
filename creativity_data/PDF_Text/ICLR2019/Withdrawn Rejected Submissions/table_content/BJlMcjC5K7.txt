Table 1: Average test perplexity and epochs for best baseline and NRP models with multiple valuesof random index/input vector dimension k embedding size m,hidden units h and dropout probabilitydrop. The number of non-zero entries in the random projections is set fo 4. #p is the approximatenumber of trainable parameters in millions.
