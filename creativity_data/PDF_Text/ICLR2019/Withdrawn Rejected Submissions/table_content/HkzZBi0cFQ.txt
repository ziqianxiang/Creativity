Table 1: Top-1 accuracy loss after 8-bit quantization in various large scale networks trained on theImageNet dataset. No retraining is performed. Reference (Float32) lists baseline accuracies whileall other figures are accuracy losses. Modes for determining the fractional length: MAX (reserveinteger length to include at least the max value), Laplace (optimal fraction length based on Laplacedistribution), S.Cauchy (optimal fraction length based on truncated super Cauchy distribution), PDF-aware (optimal fractional length based on optimum PDF for each channel). Accuracy losses above1.0% point are in bold face.
Table 2: Loss in mean AP after 8-bit quantization in YOLO-v2 (Redmon & Farhadi, 2016). Noretraining performed. ’Reference (Float32)’ lists baseline accuracy while all other figures are accuracylosses. Loss above 1.0% point is in bold face.
