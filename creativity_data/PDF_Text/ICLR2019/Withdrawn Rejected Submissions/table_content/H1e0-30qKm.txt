Table 1: Disentanglement metric scores (Higgins et al., 2017), which measure how strongly andindependently the dataset attributes are captured by a method.
Table 2: CelebA attribute classification accuracy.
Table 3:	Images generated by varying a latent dimension, which corresponds to a semantic property.
Table 4:	Generated images for the 2D Shapes dataset by varying a latent dimension, which corre-sponds to a semantic property (first row: UD-GAN, second row: UD-GAN-G).
Table 5: The architectures of our generator networks.
Table 6: The results of UD-GAN-G using differently guided siamese networks.
Table 7: Correlation between ground truth attributes of the 2D shapes dataset and the calculatedproxies.
Table 8: CelebA attribute classification accuracy.
Table 9: Correlation between embeddings (or latents) with each other (first row) and with CelebAattributes(second row). Negative correlations are inverted for visibility purposes.
