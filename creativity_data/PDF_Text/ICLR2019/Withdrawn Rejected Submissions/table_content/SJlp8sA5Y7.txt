Table 1: Performance of RDRN and other methods for the shifting Gaussian and climate modeldatasets. L2 denotes the L2 loss, T is the optimal number of input time steps and Np is the numberof model parameters used. Lower loss values reflect better regression accuracies. The number in theparentheses is the standard error of the performance measures, over repeated runs.
