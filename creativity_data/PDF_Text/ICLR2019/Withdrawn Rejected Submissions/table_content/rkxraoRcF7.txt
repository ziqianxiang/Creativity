Table 1: Prediction of target factors from learned representations. For Rb-VAE and sRb-VAE onlythe latent variables e are used as feature vectors. All the latent variables are employed for unsuper-vised models. We report accuracy and Mean Absolute Error as evaluation metrics in the AffectNetand MNIST datasets respectively. Two best methods shown in bold, best result in brackets.
