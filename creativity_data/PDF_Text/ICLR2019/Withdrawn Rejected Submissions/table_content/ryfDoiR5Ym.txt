Table 1: The decoding success rate and the damage on samples for the face recognition neuralnetwork and its dataset. The decoder size means the number of convolutions in the decoder. Thebest results are indicated in bold font. The 100% decoding success rate means that the decoder candistinguish non-watermarked and watermarked samples without any mistakes.
Table 2: The decoding success rate and the damage on samples for the speech recognition neuralnetwork and its dataset. The decoder size means the number of convolutions in the decoder.
Table 3: Original target neural network vs. Modified target neural network. They differ only at onepart marked in red.
Table 4: The attack success rate for their original testing samples. Our attack method outperformsthe Trojan attack in all cases. The best results are indicated in bold font.
