Table 1: Differences between the two baseline architectures and SynthNet.
Table 2: Three setups for filter, dilation and number of blocks resulting in a similar receptive field.
Table 3:	Mean RMSE-CQT and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Two baselines are benchmarked forthree sets of model hyperparameter settings (Table 2), all other parameters identical. One secondof audio is generated every 20 epochs (over 200 epochs) and the error versus the target audio ismeasured and averaged over the epochs, per instrument. Total number of parameters and training timeare also given.

Table 4:	RMSE-CQT Mean and 95% CIs. All networks learn 7 harmonic styles simultaneously.
Table 5: Listening MOS and 95% CIs. 5 seconds of audio are generated from 3 musical pieces (Bach‘sBWV 1007, 1008 and 1009), over 7 instruments for the best found models. Subjects are asked tolisten to the ground truth reference, then rate samples from all 3 algorithms simultaneously. 20 ratingsare collected for each file.

We tested the hypothesis that the first causal layer learns fundamental frequencies. Wevalidated this empirically, arriving at the SynthNet architecture which converges faster and produceshigher quality audio.
