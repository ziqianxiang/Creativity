Table 1: BLEU scores of WMT2014 En什De and MultiUN En什Fr translations tasks.
Table 2: Accuracy of translators using different threshold BLEU scores.
Table 3: Experimental Results on MultiUN (2M bilingual data)The experimental results of using 2M bilingual data and 1M monolingual data are shown in Table 3.
Table 4: Experimental Results on MultiUN (0.2M bilingual data)The results of using 0.2M bilingual data plus 1M monolingual data is shown in Table 4. We havethe following observations: (1) Since there are fewer bilingual sentences, the baselines of the sixtranslation tasks are not as good as those in Table 3. (2) For this setting, dual learning can improvethe BLEU scores by 1.93 points on average, which is consistent with the discovery in He et al.
Table 5: NotationsB	Proof of Theorem 1Proof. Consider a random sample x(1) and the translation from x(1) ∈ S1 to S2 . Before duallearning, the accuracy is p12. We analyze the two cases defined earlier in this section.
Table 6: Experimental Results on MultiUN (2M bilingual data)E Derivation of Cycle Dual Learning AlgorithmWe follow the notations used in Appendix D. Let R(x(2)) denote the event that after passing S2 →Sk → S1 → S2, x(2) is reconstructed to x(2). We have thatlog P (R(x(2))) = log P (x(2) |start from x(2); θ2k, θk1, θ12)= X X log P (x(2), x(1), x(k)|start from x(2); θ2k, θk1, θ12)x(k) ∈Sk x(1)∈S1=XXlog P(x(1),x(k) ∣startfrom x(2); θ2k,θki)∙x(k) ∈Sk x(1)∈S1P (x(2) |start from x(2), x(1), x(k); θ2k, θk1, θ12)≥XXP(x(1), x(k) |x(2); θ2k, θk1) log P (x(2)|start from x(2), x(1), x(k); θ2k, θk1, θ12)x(k) ∈Sk x(1)∈S1= X X P (x(1), x(k)|x(2); θ2k, θk1) log P (x(2)|x(1); θ12)x(k) ∈Sk x(1)∈S1= X X P (x(k)|x(2); θ2k)P (x(1)|x(k); θk1) log P(x(2) |x(1); θ12)x(k) ∈Sk x(1)∈S1=Eχ(k)〜P(∙∣x ⑵;θ2k)Eχ(ι)〜P (∙∣χ(k))以ι log P(X ⑵ |x(1)； θ12).
