Table 1: Description of the source domain distribution for the Hopper (Left) and Half-Cheetah(Right) tasks. The values given here specify the means (μ) and standard deviations (σ) for normaldistributions truncated at the low and high points mentioned here. This is equivalent to the proba-bility density of a normal distribution with parameters (μ, σ) being zeroed outside the interval [Low,High], and being normalized so that it integrates to 1.
Table 2: Statistics for the percentiles described in section 6.2 for the Hopper task’s 1-D model en-semble with = 0.1, which are measured every fifth iteration from the 100th to the 150th iterations.
Table 3: Hyperparameters for TRPOAn important difference from EPOpt’s implementation is that we use Generalized Advantage Esti-mation Schulman et al. (2016) instead of subtracting a baseline from the value function. For valuefunction estimation using a critic, we use the same NN architecture as the policy, 2 hidden layers of64 units each.
Table 4: Thompson Sampling HyperparametersThe first two parameters control the amount of exploration performed during Thompson Sampling,whileλ is a regularization parameter for the parameter estimates.
