Table 1: Comparison of mean PSNR and SSIM values achieved by bicubic interpolation, SRGAN,SRIM and the ground truth, where the mean is taken over different images in the test set.
Table 2: Results of human evaluation. Three pairwise tests were performed; for each test, super-resolved images using two different methods were presented side-by-side and participants wereasked to select the image that seemed more realistic. The mean and the standard deviation of theproportion of images generated by each particular method that participants found to be more realisticis shown, where the mean and the standard deviation were computed over the different participants.
