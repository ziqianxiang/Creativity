Table 1: Accuracy (± standard deviation over 5 random seeds) on the datasets between thevarious models.
Table 2: Accuracy (± standard deviation over 5 random seeds, this is not a confidence interval)on the modified MNIST datasets between the various models. The MIMIC results are reportedin terms of AUPR.

Table 5: The residual blocks in the variable capacity Judge and Advocate components. Bothblocks are repeated n times where n is the number of residual blocks for the network. Maxpooling is done after each block. Three additional 2x2 convolutions are performed before theoutput. In the Advocate encoder, this output is given to the decoder. In the Judge, the outputis given to the fully connected layers. In both cases, the architecture remains unchanged fromthe non-residual verison.
