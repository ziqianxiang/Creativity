Table 1: Random samples from two models withclose BLEU scores and considerably different FD.
Table 2: Results of best models obtained with our evaluation procedure. For brevity, we report onlyBLEU4 scores in this table. We have measured scores humans assign to real samples for referenceand obtained a value of 4.27. J means lower is better, â†‘ higher is better.
