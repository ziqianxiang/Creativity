Table 1:	Decoding of the source sentence from Early Modern English (EME) into contemporaryEnglish (CE), and vice versa.
Table 2:	Flipping the meaning and the form embeddings of two sentence from different registers.
Table 3: F1 scores on the task of paraphrase detection using the SentEval toolkit (Conneau et al.,2017)7 ConclusionIn this paper, we presented ADNet, a new model that performs adversarial decomposition of textrepresentation. In contrast to previous work, it does not require a parallel training corpus and worksdirectly on hidden representations of sentences. Most importantly, is does not treat the form as abinary variable (as done in most previously proposed models), enabling a fine-grained change ofthe form of sentences or specific aspects of meaning. We evaluate ADNet on two tasks: the shift oflanguage register and diachronic language change. Our solution achieves superior results, and t-SNEvisualizations of the learned meaning and style embeddings illustrate that the proposed motivationalloss leads to significantly better separation of the form embeddings.
