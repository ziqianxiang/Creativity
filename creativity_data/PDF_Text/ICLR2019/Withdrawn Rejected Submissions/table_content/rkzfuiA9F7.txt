Table 1: Few-shot classification results on Mini-ImageNet using 4-convolutional stages with 95%confidence intervals.
Table 2: Semi-supervised few-shot classification results on the Mini-ImageNet and Tiered-ImageNetwith 40% and 10% labeled data, respectively. We show the classification results with and withoutdistractors. We compare our results to PNon semi-supervised learning (PN-SSL) with soft K-means(non-masked) and masked K-means (masked), as proposed by Ren et al. (2018).
Table 3: Generalization performance of PSN and PN with varying number of way (N) and shot (K)at the test time.
