Table 1: Number of captured modes and Kullblack-Leibler divergence between the training andsamples distributions for ALI (Dumoulin et al., 2016), Unrolled GAN (Metz et al., 2016), Vee-GAN (Srivastava et al., 2017), PacGAN (Lin et al., 2017), WGAN-GP (Gulrajani et al., 2017).
Table 2: Inception scores and FIDs with unsupervised image generation on CIFAR-10. 50000 sam-ples were used to compute Inception Score and FID.
Table 3: Performance on the KDD99 dataset. Values for OC-SVM, DSEBM, Efficient GAN valueswere obtained from Zong et al. (2018). Values for our model are derived from 5 runs. For eachindividual run, the metrics are averaged over the last 10 epochs.
Table 4: Performance on the unsupervised anomaly detection task on MNIST measured by areaunder precision recall curve. Numbers except ours are obtained from (Zenati et al., 2018). Resultsfor our model are averaged over last 10 epochs to account for the variance in scores.
