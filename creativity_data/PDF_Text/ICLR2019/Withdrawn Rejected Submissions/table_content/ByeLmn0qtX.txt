Table 1: Average DISs for three domain adaptation methods employing random hyperparametersearch, which demonstrates DualVAE outperforms several models based on the DIS as the hyperpa-rameter search is not necessary. Typical generated images are shown in the Appendix.

Table 3: The model structures of DualVAE used in our experiment. Conv stands for Convolution,Deconv stands for Deconvolution, FC stands for Full Connected, and numbers in each parenthesisare input and output channels. The kernel sizes of convolution are all 4 Ã— 4, and stride sizes of thatare all two. Also, Batch2d represents batchnormalization in two dimensions, Batch1d representsbatchnormalization in one dimension, and LReLU stands for LeakyReLU.
