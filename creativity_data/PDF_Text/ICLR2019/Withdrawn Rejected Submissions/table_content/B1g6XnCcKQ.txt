Table 1: Attributes classification errors: using attribute labels, we train either a linear or nearest-neighborclassifier on top of existing fixed embeddings. The supervised OCN is trained using labeled positive matches,while the unsupervised one decides on positive matches on its own. All models here are initialized and frozenwith ImageNet-pretrained weights for the ResNet50 part of the architecture (see Fig. 2), while the additionallayers above are random and trainable. Attributes are defined in Sec. 4.1.
Table 2: Object correspondences errors: attribute error indicates a mismatch of a particular attribute of anobject, while an object matching error is measured when the matched objects are not the same instance.
Table 3: Quantitative evaluation on the robot pointing experiment. We report on two attribute errors: ‘class’and ‘container’. See Sec. 5.3 for more information about the experiment.
Table 4: Datasets overview: to train an OCN we use real and synthetic data.
