Table 1: Details of the datasets used in the paper. Please refer Section 6.1 for more details.
Table 2: Performance comparison of several methods for semi-supervised node classification onmultiple benchmark datasets. ConfGCN performs consistently better across all the datasets. Base-line method performances on Citeseer, Cora and Pubmed datasets are taken from Liao et al. (2018);VeliCkovic et al. (2018). We consider only the top performing baseline methods on these datasetsfor evaluation on the Cora-ML dataset. Please refer Section 7.1 for details.
