Table 1: Computing the optical flow representation after various number of CNN layers. Resultsare video classification accuracy on our Tiny-Kinetics and LowRes-HMDB51 datasets using 100iterations to compute the flow representation.
Table 2: Comparison of learning different parameters. The flow was computed after Block 3 using100 iterations.
Table 3: Effect of the number of iterations on our Tiny-Kinetics dataset for learning and not learning.
Table 4: Different fusion methods for flow computed at different locations in the network on ourTiny-Kinetics dataset using 10 iterations and learning flow parameters.
Table 5: Computing the FoF representation. TVL-1 twice provides poor performance, using two flowlayers with a conv. in between provides the best performance. Experiments used 10 iterations andlearning flow parameters.
Table 6: Flow using 3D ResNet-18.	Table 7: Flow using (2+1)D ResNet-18.
Table 8: Comparisons to other CNN-based motion representations, using 10 iterations and learningflow parameters. This is without FcF and two-stream fusion.
Table 9: Comparison to the state-of-the-art action classifications. ‘HMDB(+Kin)’ means that the model was pre-trained on Kinetics before training/testing with HMDB. Missing results are due to those papers not reporting that setting.
