Table 1: Comparison on MNIST. Empirical Wasserstein distance (EWD), and computation timeper generator update for each method. Each metric represents the average and standard deviationover 3 out of 5 trials, excluding the maximum and minimum. Lower is better for EWD. WGAN-TS* represents WGAN-TS without weight scaling. In WGAN-GP, WGAN-SN and WGAN-TS*,training can suddenly deteriorate. Thus, we used early stopping based on EWD.
