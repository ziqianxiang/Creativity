Table 1: Performance according to meta-test accuracy on the miniImageNet 5-way, 1-shot classificationbenchmark from Vinyals et al. (2016). We report further comparisons in Appendix A. a Results reported by Ravi& Larochelle (2017). b We report test accuracy for a comparable architecture. c We report test accuracy for models matching train and test“shot” and “way”.
Table 2: One-shot classification accuracy on the miniImageNet test set, with comparison methods ordered byone-shot performance. All results are averaged over 600 test episodes, and we report 95% confidence intervalswhen available. a Results reported by Ravi & Larochelle (2017). b We report test accuracy for a comparablearchitecture. c We report test accuracy for models matching train and test “shot” and “way”. dWe report testaccuracy for a non-standard architecture with more parameters. eResults reported by Rusu et al. (2018).
