Table 1: The inventory of actions for our incremental text-to-SQL semantic parser. The use ofparameter representations in the decoder is detailed in Section 3.2. p[AGG7→agg] denotes a newparser state identical to p, except that the feature value for AGG is agg in the new state. Finally,|| denotes list concatenation, and COND-1 refers to the last element in the list.
Table 2: Dev and Test accuracy (%) on WikiSQL. Acclf refers to logical form accuracy and Accexrefers to execution accuracy. “+ EG (5) ” indicates execution-guided decoding with beam size of 5.
Table 3: Execution accuracy (%) and decoding speed of our models on the test set of WikiSQL, withvarying decoding beam size. The notation “+ EG (k)” is as in Table 2.
Table 4: Dev and Test accuracy (%) of the models on the reduced ATIS dataset, where Acclf refersto logical form accuracy and Accex refers to execution accuracy.
