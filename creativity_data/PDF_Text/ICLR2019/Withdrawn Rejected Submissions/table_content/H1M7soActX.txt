Table 1: Compared dynamics defined in Eq. (3). For GLD dynamic, GLD diagonal, GLD Hessian and GLD1st eigvec(H), σt are adjusted to make σtt share the same expected norm as that of SGD. For GLD leading,σt is same as in SGD. Note that GLD 1st eigvec(H) achieves the best escaping efficiency as our indicatorsuggested.
