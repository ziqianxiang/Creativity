Table 1: Test set, white-box and PGD-transfer attack accuracies. Each row corresponds to a modeltrained with a different training method, evaluated against the respective white-box (non-bold entries)and PGD-transfer attacks (bold-face entries) indicated above each column (T-PGD refers to targetedattack). The white-box and transfer attack accuracies are averaged over attack strengths in the range∈ [0, 32] for MNIST and ∈ [0, 8] for CIFAR10, i.e. the reported accuracies represent the integratedarea under the attack curve. For the transfer attack accuracies of a training method against itself, wetrained a separate model with the same hyper-parameters to obtain the perturbations.
Table 2: Attack hyper-parameters. wb stands for white-box, t for transfer attacks.
Table 3: Classifier Architectures: CIFAR10 params=[64, 64, 128, 128, 256, 256, 10], MNISTparams= [32, 32, 64, 64, 200, 200, 10]. Our models are identical to those used in (Carlini & Wagner,2017; Papernot et al., 2016b).
