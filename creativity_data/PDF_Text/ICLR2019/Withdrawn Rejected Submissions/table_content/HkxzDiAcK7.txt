In Section 3.1, applications of CNN(convolutional neural networks) in audio area are brieflyreviewed. Noise type and position classifications are presented in details in Section 3.2.1 and Sec-tion 3.2.2, respectively. In Section 3.3, our method is applied to classification of other standard
Table 2:	Accuracy of noise type classifier on TV-set and TS-setMB	HD	HH	CD	VCTV-Set 0.998^^0.989^^0.998^^1.000^^1.000-TS-set 0.992	-	0.992	-	-4.2 Position classification resultsTable 3 shows validation accuracy of the position classifier on TV-set. The first row of the tablerepresents the 9 positions used for generating the TV-set. The second row shows the correspondingvalidation accuracies to the 9 positions. Average of the accuracies is 94.1 %. When the accuraciesare divided into 3 groups by floor, then validation accuracy on 1F is lower than that on 3F.

The second row of the table shows the corresponding testaccuracies to the assumed true labels. Average of the accuracies is 69.6 %. Since positions of theimpact noises in TS-set are different from those in TV-set, the test accuracy can be lower than thevalidation accuracy. If the position classification is changed to floor classification, then the testaccuracy is raised to 98.8 %.

The confusionmatrix at the left is drawn with the validation results. In the confusion matrix, the followings areobserved. Most of the errors are the misclassifications to neighboring positions on the same floor.

In the confusion matrix, confusions be-tween ESC-50 categories can be observed. Also, validation accuracy to each category can be ob-served. The most confusing category is engine. The categories of ESC-50 can be loosely rear-ranged into 5 major categories: Animals, Natural soundscapes & water sounds, Human/non-speechsounds, Interior/domestic sounds, and Exterior/urban noises. The most confusing major categoryis Exterior/urban noises (validation accuracy is 97.6 %).
