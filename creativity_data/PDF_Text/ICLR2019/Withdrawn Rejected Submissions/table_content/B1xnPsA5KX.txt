Table 1: Performance comparison of variational sparse GP (SGP) and deep kernel learning (DKL)on four standard regression benchmarks. SGPt is the GPy implementation. SGP is the SGP modulein MXFusion. The implementation of DKL is shown in Figure 2. The numbers in the parenthesesin the method column show the number of inducing points. Both rooted mean square error (RMSE)and test log-likelihood (TLL) are the mean of measure with 10-fold cross-validation. The numberin the parentheses next to performance measure is its standard deviation.
