Table 1: Classification consistency and classification. Results across blurring filters and training scenarios(without and with data augmentation). We evaluate classification accuracy without shifts (Test accuracy 一None) and on random shifts (Test accuracy - Random), as well as classification consistency. Highlightedfilters Perform consistently well in both metrics and settings, as more easily seen in Fig. 5.
Table 2: Timing analysis We test the aver-age speed of a forward pass on a GTX1080TiNvidia GPU for a batch size of 100 of 32 × 32image with the VGG13 network.
