Table 1: Some standard f -divergences. p(x) is given and q(x) is the model. From Nowozin et al.
Table 2: Learned Gaussian parameters to fit amixture of two Gaussians using forward KL, re-verse KL and Jensen-Shannon divergence. p*(x)is the optimal Gaussian fitted to minimize the ex-act divergence. pUB (x) is the optimal Gaussianfitted to minimize our auxiliary upper bound onthe divergence. pLB(x) is the optimal Gaussianfitted to minimize the Fenchel-conjugate lowerbound on the divergence.
