Table 1: What are the essential parts of the IFcVAE-GAN? This table shows how novel compo-nents of the IFcVAE-GAN loss function affect reconstruction quality, MSE, and the model’s abilityto edit attributes, CSmiling and CNot-Smiling. We used hyper-parameters: {ρ = 0.1, δ = 0.1, α =0.2}. IcGAN reconstruction results are those reported by Lample et al. (2017).

Table 3: What are the essential parts of the IFcVAE-GAN (with residual layers)? This ta-				ble shows how novel components of the IFcVAE-GAN loss function			affect mean	squared (recon-StrUction) error, MSE, and the proportion of edited samples with the desires attribute, CSmiling and				CNot-Smiling . We use hyper-parameters: {ρ	= 0.1, δ	= 0.005, α =	0.005, momentum = 0.5}.	We also show classification accuracy (Acc.) of Ey φ.		IcGAN reconstruction results are those re-		ported by Lample et al. (2017).				*Note that the model of Bao et al. (2017) does not incorporate		a classifier. **Results obtained by Lample et al.		(2017) using humans to evaluate the images.
