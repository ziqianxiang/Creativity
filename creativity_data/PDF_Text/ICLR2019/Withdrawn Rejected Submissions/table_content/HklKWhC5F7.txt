MNIST (LeCun et al., 1998) consists of 60,000 training data and 10,000 testing datafor handwritten digit recognition. CIAFR-10 (Krizhevsky & Hinton, 2009) consists of 60,000 colorimages with 10 classes. STL-10 contains images with higher resolutions, which are acquired fromlabeled examples on ImageNet (Coates et al., 2011). It has 13,000 labeled data in total for 10 classes.
