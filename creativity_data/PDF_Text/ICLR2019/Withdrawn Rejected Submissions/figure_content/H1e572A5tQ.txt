Figure 1: Overview of our multi-agent architecture with targeted communication. Left: At every timestep, eachagent policy gets a local observation Ï‰it and aggregated message cit as input, and predicts an environment actionait and a targeted communication message mit . Right: Targeted communication between agents is implementedas a signature-based soft attention mechanism. Each agent broadcasts a message mit consisting of a signaturekit , which can be used to encode agent-specific information and a value vit , which contains the actual message.

Figure 3: Success rates for 1 ys. 2-stagevs. message size on Hard. Performancedoes not decrease significantly even whenthe message vector is a single scalar, and2 rounds of back-and-forth communicationbefore taking an environment action leadsto a significant improvement over 1-stage.
