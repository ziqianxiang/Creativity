Figure 1:	Visualization of the synthetic task. Especially in the last example, the artefacts from thepermutohedral lattice approximation can clearly be seen at object boundaries.
Figure 2:	Training and validation mIoU over time for decoupled training. +C uses convolutions ascompatibility transformation and +T learns the features for the smoothness kernel.
Figure 3: Visualization of results on Pascal VOC data using a decoupled training strategy. Examples2 and 4 depict failure cases, in which the CRFs are not able to improve the unary.
