Figure 1: Minimization of a scalar field on the sphere S2 . The color map indicates the scalar fieldvalues, where blue is the minimum and red the maximum. The red curve shows the trajectory takenby the Riemannian gradient descent, which converges to a minimum (blue region).

Figure 3: Left: Connectome classification results. Right: Clustermap of the recovered similaritiesusing the Riemannian distance on the SPD Manifold. We note in particular the identification ofseveral clusters (red blocks on the diagonal)of these similarities with geomstats, comparing them further opens research directions for in-depthconnectome analysis.
