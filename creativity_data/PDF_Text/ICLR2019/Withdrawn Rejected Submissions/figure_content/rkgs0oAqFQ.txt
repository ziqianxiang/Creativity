Figure 1: a) Illustration of graph propagation in a GCN (Kipf & Welling, 2017) for node ’Cat’.
Figure 2: DGP is trained to predict classifier weights W for each node/class in a graph. These weightsare extracted from the final layer of a pre-trained ResNet. The graph is constructed from a knowledgegraph and each node is represented by its word embedding (semantic information). The networkconsists of two phases, a descendant phase where each node receives knowledge form its descendantsand an ancestor phase, where it receives knowledge from its ancestors.
