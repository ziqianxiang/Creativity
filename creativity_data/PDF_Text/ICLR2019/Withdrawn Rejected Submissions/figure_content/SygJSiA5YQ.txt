Figure 1:	The red point markers are the roots and spherical surface is the contour is 3D space foreach iteration.
Figure 2:	The first 4 iteration results are drawn to illustrate the procedure of optimization test on theMcCormick function.
Figure 3:	The first 6 iteration results are drawn to illustrate the procedure of optimization test onthe Ackley function.
