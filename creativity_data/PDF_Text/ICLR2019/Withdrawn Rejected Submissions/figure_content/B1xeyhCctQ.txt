Figure 1: A Piecewise linear weight matrix divides the input plane into regions. Without the biasterm, the regions are cones, while with the bias term, the regions are convex polyhedra.
Figure 2: Bias attribution (BBP) on the STL-10 (top) and ImageNet (bottom) datasets compared to gradient-onlyattribution. The label of every image is shown in the leftmost column. The gradient attribution is the element-wiseproduct between the linear model weight W and data point x. The “grad.norm.” and “bias norm.” columns showthe attribution of gradient and bias normalized to the color range (0-255). The “grad.overlay” and “bias.overlay”show the 10% data features with the highest attribution magnitude of the original image. “bias\grad overlay”columns show the data features selected by the bias attribution and not selected by the gradient attribution.
