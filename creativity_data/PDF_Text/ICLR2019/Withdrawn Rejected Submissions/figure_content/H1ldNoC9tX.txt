Figure 1: PCA embeddings of the representations learned by the nnPU and PUbN classifiers for 500samples from the test set in the MNIST learning task where Xbn is uniformly sampled from latentcategories 1, 3 and 5.
Figure 2: Comparison of uPU, nnPU and PUbN\N over the four PU learning tasks. For each task,means and standard deviations are computed based on the same 10 random samplings. Dashed linesindicate the corresponding values of the final classifiers (recall that at the end we select the modelwith the lowest validation loss out of all epochs).
