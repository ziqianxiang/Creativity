Figure 4: Sample generated images from Deli-Fisher GAN6 ConclusionIn sum, the Deli-Fisher GAN presented in our paper is capable of generating better images thanthe DC-GAN, the WGAN, and the Fisher-GAN are, with notable improvements on the quality ofimages as measured by inception scores. Additionally, the model proposed in our paper is still opento improvement such as adding regularization terms to the objective function as those employed inthe experiments of Mroueh & Sercu (2017).
