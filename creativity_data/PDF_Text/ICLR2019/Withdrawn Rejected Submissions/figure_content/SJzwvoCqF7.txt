Figure 1: Panel (a) shows comparison results for thesame VGG19 network trained on CIFAR10 using unitnorm filters. The vertical axis the corresponding boundsin the logarithmic scale. Panel (b) shows the training ac-curacy (red diamond), testing accuracy (blue cross), andthe empirical generalization error using different scalesof the filters listed on the horizontal axes.

Figure 3: Empirical distribution of B\a2 and Qd Bd,2 for the same VGG19 network trained onCIFAR10.	,A.3 DEPENDENCE OF B\JAdC,2 AND Qd Bd,2 ON DEPTHWe further provide an empirical evaluation to see how strong the quantities B\Jadc,2 and Qd Bd,2depend on the depth. Note that we use d as the variable for depth. Using the same setting as above,we provide the magnitude of log B\Jadc,2 and log Qd Bd,2 in Figure 4. We also provide the plotsfor log d and log d2 as reference. We can observe that log Qd Bd,2 has an approximately lineardependence on the depth, which matches with our intuition. In terms of log B\Jadc,2, we can see that ithas a significantly slower increasing rate than log Qd Bd,2. Compared with the reference plots log dand log d2, we can observe even a slower rate than log d2. This further indicates that log B\Jadc,2 mayhas a dependence slower than some low degree of poly(d).
