Figure 1: Inter-BMV warps and fuses the features of enclosing keyframes to generate accuratefeature estimates for intermediate frames, using block motion vectors present in compressed video.
Figure 2: A sample runtime breakdown for a ResNet-101 DeepLab network. F is the optical flownet from Dosovitskiy et al. (2015). W is the warp operator. GPU: Tesla K80. Dataset: Cityscapes.
Figure 3: Accuracy (avg.) vs. throughput for all schemes on CamVid and Cityscapes.
Figure 4: Example segmentations at keyframe interval 7. Column k + i corresponds to outputs iframes past the selected keyframe k. First row: input frames. Second row: prop-flow (Zhu et al.
Figure 5: Accuracy (min.) vs. throughPut for all schemes on CamVid and CityscaPes.
