Figure 2: Overview of our GAN-based clarification ques-tion generation model (refer preamble of § 2)2	Training a Clarification Question GeneratorOur goal is to build a model that, given a context, can generate an appropriate clarification ques-tion. As a running example, we will use the Amazon setting: where the dataset consists of (context,question, answer) triples where the context is the product description, question is clarification ques-tion about that product that (preferably) is not already answered in the description and answer isthe seller’s (or other users’) reply to the question. Representationally, our question generator is astandard sequence-to-sequence model with attention (§ 2.1). The learning problem is: how to trainthe sequence-to-sequence model to produce good question.
