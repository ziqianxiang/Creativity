Figure 1: Metrics of interest and representative weight update distributions for the baseline andsimultaneous training attacks. Figures 1b and 1c show weight update distributions for both benign(left) and malicious agents (right).
Figure 3: Minimum and maximum L2 distancesbetween weight updates. For each strategy, weshow the spread of L2 distances between all thebenign agents and between the malicious agentand the benign agents. Going from the baselineattack to the alternating minimization attack withand without distance constraints, we see that thegap in the spread of distances reduces, making theattack stealthier. The benign agents behave al-most identically across strategies, indicating thatthe malicious agent does not interfere much withtheir training.
