Figure 1: Intersection Graph and Tree-Decomposition of S (D, Φ, `, f )(c)	Fix any data set (JX, Y^) = (j^l, yi )3 ofsize D, with j^l ∈ [-1,1]n and yi ∈ [-1,1]m. There exists a faceFX Y of PSe SUCh that(D ELLφ ∈ argminφ,L(φ, L) ∈ Proj(FXY)φ, L ,)satisfies ID 2D=] ['(f (∙X1, φ*), y^l) - '(f (X]φ), yi)] ∣ ≤ 2β, where φ* ∈ [-1,1]N is an optimal solution tothe ERM problem (1) with input data (X, Y). This means that solving an LP using an appropriate face ofPSe solves the ERM problem (1) within an additive error 2.
Figure 2: Example of graph and valid tree-decompositionA Further definitionsA.1 Complementary discussion on TreewidthThe concept of treewidth is an important concept in the context of solving optimization problems with ‘sparse’structure. An alternative definition to Definition 2.3 of treewidth that the reader might find useful is thefollowing; recall that a chordal graph is a graph where every induced cycle has length exactly 3.
