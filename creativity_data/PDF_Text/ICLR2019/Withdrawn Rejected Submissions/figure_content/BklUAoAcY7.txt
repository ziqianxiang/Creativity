Figure 1:	Performance of ConsSent models on the TREC, MRPC and STSB tasks. The y-values arein percentages. The x-values are k for ConSent-{D,I,R}(k) and k - 1 for ConSent-{C,N,P}(k).
Figure 2:	Performance of ConsSent models on the WordContent, BigramShift and SubjNum tasks.
Figure 3: Average performance of our models over all the 20 tasks in SentEval. The bars in a grouprepresent increasing values of k. The best performing model trained on a single task is ConsSent-R(2) (green with the black stripes) with an average score of 81.9.
