Figure 1: Select Via Proxy (SVP) can be viewed as an additional preprocessing step to an existingtraining pipeline. A small proxy model is trained over all the data available, but only a selectedsubset are used to train the large target model. The training procedure of the target model is notchanged, lowering the overhead of implementing this method.
Figure 2: Top-1 test error on CIFAR10 for varying model sizes (left) and over the course training asingle model (right), demonstrating a large amount of time is spent on small changes in accuracy.
Figure 3: Pearson product-moment correlation of examples ranked by entropy calculated from dif-ferent models on CIFAR10 using ResNet20 and ResNet164 with pre-activation (left), SVHN usingResNet20 and ResNet152 (center), and Amazon Review Polarity using fastText and VDCNN29(right). S1 and S2 represent two separate runs of the small proxy model (e.g., ResNet20), while L1and L2 represent different runs of the large target model (e.g., ResNet164). R gives a random orderof points for reference. On all datasets, ensembling multiple small models together through rankcombination (SC) increases the Pearson product-moment correlation with the large model.
Figure 4: Training curves of ResNet164 with pre-activation on CIFAR10 (left) and ResNet152 onSVHN (right) with and without data selection via proxy. The dashed gray line shows the averageerror of the target model across 3 runs. The dashed red line shows training the proxy model. Thesolid red line shows training the target model on a subset of images selected by the proxy. Thesolid gray shows training the target model on full dataset. The dotted red and gray lines show wheneach training curve gets within 1 standard deviation of the target model’s error on the fully dataset.
Figure 5: Test error of ResNet164 with pre-activation on CIFAR10 (left) and ResNet152 on SVHN(right) with different uncertainty metrics. The dashed gray line is the mean error over 3 runs of thetarget model on all of the dataset. The markers on the solid lines show the mean error over 3 runs ofdifferent selection methods for a given subset size. The shaded area is ±1 standard deviation.
