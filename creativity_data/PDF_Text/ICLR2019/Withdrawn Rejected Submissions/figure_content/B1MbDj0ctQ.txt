Figure 1: (a) st denote discrete switch variables, zt are continuous latent variables, xt continuousobserved variables, ut are (optional) continuous control inputs. (b) By introducing a special latentvariable w used for initial state inference, we want to make explicit that the first step is treateddifferently from the rest of the sequence.
Figure 2: (a) Depicts the inference model. bt is the hidden state of the backward RNN ofqφ(st | x≥t, u≥t). Initial inference of w may be conditioned on the entire sequence of observa-tions, or just a subsequence. We’ve omitted the arrows for sake of clarity for the rest of the graph.
Figure 3: Figures (b) and (c) depict an agent’s position colored by the average value of a single latentvariable s marginalized over all control inputs u and velocities. Figure (d) highlights a representativeactivation for a single transition system for the deterministic treatment of the transition dynamics. Itdoesn’t generalize to the entire maze and stays fairly active in proximity to the wall.
Figure 4:	First row: data, second row: filtered reconstructions, third row: predictions. The first 4steps are used to find a stable starting state, predictions start with step 5.
Figure 5:	(a) Our dynamics model is outperforming even the smoothed KVAE for longer trajectories.
Figure 6: Comparison of actual and predicted 20 step trajectories. The diamond marker denotes thestarting position of a trajectory.
Figure 7: First row: data, second row: reconstructions, third row: predictions. The first 4 steps areused to find a stable starting state, predictions start with step 5.
