Figure 1: TSSM architecture for joint SLU. The orange lines are inputs for semantic similaritynetwork and the green lines represent the inputs for attention network.
Figure 2: Performance comparison under different percentage of training data used in the targetdomain fine-tuning. In each figure, X-axis is the percentage of data used in the target domain, y-axis is the performance (higher is better). The three columns corresponds to intent accuracy (leftcolumn), slot accuracy (middle column) and slot f1 score (right column). The five rows correspondsto different source and target domain pairs. From the top to the bottom are “Restaurant, Laptop,TV, Atis” to “Hotel” “Restaurant, Hotel, Laptop, TV” to “Atis” “Atis” to “Hotel” “Weilidai” to“Weizhongyouzhe” and “Weilidai” to “Huobijijin”.
Figure 3: Performance vs the number of unseen intent/slot in the target domain test set, where 10%of the total target domain data is used. In each figure, X-axis is the number of unseen intent/slots inthe target domain test set, y-axis is the performance (higher is better).
