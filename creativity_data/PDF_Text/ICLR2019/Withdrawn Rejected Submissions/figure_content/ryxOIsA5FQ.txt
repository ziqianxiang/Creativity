Figure 1: Overview of stacking for transfer learning. Firstly, source data and target data are hybridtogether to train the weak learners, then super learner is used to fit the predictions of target data.
Figure 2: Weights of the source samples and target samples change with the iterations in TrAdaboost.
Figure 3: Accuracy of instance-based transfer on mnist vs. usps changed with the iterations andratio of #target.
Figure 4: Training error on source and target data changed with iterations in transfer tasks USPS→mnist, mnist → USPS, COIL1 → COIL2 and COIL2 → COIL1.
Figure 5: Feature visualization of the A→C task under different kernels.
