Figure 1: The exploration progress for count, curiosity, ours+count and ours+cur methods in fourvariants. Lower is better, indicates the distribution of number of visits is more smooth. By in-corporating the count and curiosity baseline, our methods consistently outperforms the baselines,especially when the exploration becomes harder (zigzag shape 3 × 3 rooms). Generally, the countdependent ones (ours+count, count) outperforms its counterpart with curiosity, which is reasonablesince they use oracle information.
Figure 2: The accuracy curves of inverse dynamics models for curiosity and ours+cur method innormal (left) and zigzag (right) shape 3x3 rooms. Our method is more efficient in learning and learnsbetter inverse dynamics models.
Figure 3: The training score of destination task for curiosity, count, ours+count and ours+curmethods in normal (left) and zigzag (right) shape 3x3 rooms. Our method is more efficient to reachthe destination in both environments.
Figure 4: Visualization of the exploration progress in zigzag shape 3x3 rooms using ours+cur method. Thex-axis time or the number of training frames. The top row is the heatmaps of the number of visits for states.
Figure 5:As shown in Figure 5, in both Montezuma’s Revenge and PrivateEye, our method outper-forms the curiosity baseline with a noticeable gap.
