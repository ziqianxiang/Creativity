Figure 1: The probability density function of stochastic variable q used when calculating q-derivatives.
Figure 2:	The density function of q-neurons with q sampled according to eq. (6) for different valuesof λ. The activation is roughly a deterministic function f0(x)x for small λ as shown in table 1. Theactivation is random for large λ. Darker color indicates higher probability density.
