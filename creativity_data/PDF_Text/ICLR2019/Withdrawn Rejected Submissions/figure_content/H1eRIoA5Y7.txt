Figure 1: Runtime ratio between cudnn’s fully coupled convolution, depth-wise convolution andour implementation of the depth-wise (explicit or implicit) and circular convolutions. Except themeasured parameter, the default parameters for all tests are: batch size: 64, image size: 642, numberof channels: 256, kernel size 3 × 3.
