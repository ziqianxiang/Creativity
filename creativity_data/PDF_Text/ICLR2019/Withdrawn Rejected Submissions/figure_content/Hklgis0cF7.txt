Figure 1: Placing radial basis transformation blocks in a CNN network. 0 shows concatenationoperation. Fl is the output of convolution layer l.
Figure 2: Detailed diagram of the proposed radial basis transformation block G(Fl). In the figure,i = 1 : n, j = 1 : m where n × m × k(o) is the width, height, and the number of channels of theinput (output) feature map.
