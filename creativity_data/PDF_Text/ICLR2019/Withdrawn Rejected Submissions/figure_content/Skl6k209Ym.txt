Figure 1: Tier 1 of the matching system uses two CNN encoders used to generate the point-wisematching costs C(It, Is). The second tier computes the net alignment costs to select the matchinglabel.
Figure 2: Three points sampled uniformly from the test image (columns 1, 4,7) are mapped tothe reference image (columns 2,5,8) using the MNIST dataset (left) and Omniglot dataset (right).
