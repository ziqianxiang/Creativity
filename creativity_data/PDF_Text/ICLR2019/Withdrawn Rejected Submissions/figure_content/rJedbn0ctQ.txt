Figure 1: An illustration of GEM algorithm. ToP middle: The sentence to encode, with words wι town. And the contextual window of word Wi is inside the dashed frame. Bottom middle: Form Sifor wi, compute qi and novelty score an (Section 2.1 and Section 2.2). Bottom left: Compute theSVD ofSi and significance score αs (Section 2.3). Bottom right: Re-rank and select from principalcomponents (orange blocks) and compute uniqueness score αu (Section 2.4).
Figure 2: Sensitivity tests on four hyper-parameters, the window size m in contextual window ma-trix, the number of candidate principal components K , the number of principal components to re-move h, and the exponential power of singular value in coarse sentence embedding.
