Figure 1: Motivation of PWH Framework. The pruning and hints are complementary to each other.
Figure 2: The pipeline of PWH Framework. The whole framework is composed of three steps.
Figure 4: The comparison for different selec-tions of teacher model in PWH Framework. Theteacher model in this experiment is set as theoriginal model at the beginning of training orthe pruned model in the previous iteration.
Figure 3: The relationship between the per-formance of pruned model and the number ofpruned channelswork. We use the standard SGD with momentum set to 0.9. The standard weight decay is set to1e-4. VGG-16 Simonyan & Zisserman (2015) network with BatchNorm Ioffe & Szegedy (2015),ResNet18 He et al. (2016) and ResNet18 with FPN Chen et al. (2018) are used for CIFAR-10,ImageNet and COCO respectively.
Figure 5: The experiment on verifying the ef-fectiveness of reconstructing step. The Figureshows comparison of using and without usingreconstructing step for accuracy.
Figure 6: The relationship between the perfor-mance of network and the number of prunedchannels using different methods. We conductexperiment iteratively and for each iteration weprune 256 channels.
