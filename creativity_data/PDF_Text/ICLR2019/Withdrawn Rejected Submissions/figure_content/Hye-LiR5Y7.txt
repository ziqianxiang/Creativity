Figure 1: SOSELETO applied to a synthetic noisy labels problem. (a) A binary classification prob-lem with points split by the y-axis. Input labels are marked as diamonds and triangles. 20% of theinput labels are noisy (have the wrong label). SOSELETO assigns a weight per instance. (b) Allcorrectly labeled input points are assigned high weights. (c) Most noisy points are assigned a lowweight. (d) Mean weight of clean and noisy instances throughout training. (e) High accuracy andhigh recall are achieved for a broad range of weight thresholds.
Figure 2: Noisy labels on CIFAR-10: Effect of α-values chosen by SOSELETO. Blue is 30% noise,green is 40% noise, red is 50% noise. See accompanying explanation in the text.
