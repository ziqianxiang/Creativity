Figure 1: Representative program synthesis tasks from the NAPS dataset.
Figure 2: Top: An overview of PATOIS. A miner 1 extracts common idioms from the programsin a given dataset. The dataset programs are 2 compressed by replacing AST subtrees of idiomoccurrences with new idiom operators. The compressed dataset 3 is used to train a neural generativemodel. At inference time, the model 4 generates programs with named idioms, which are inlinedbefore program execution. Notice that idioms involve named subexpressions, may be repeated,and may occur at any program level. For clarity, we typeset idioms using an operator-like syntaxIj('Î¹,..., 'k), although they are actually represented as AST fragments with no syntax. Bottom:AST fragment representation of the idiom I2 in the NAPS dataset grammar. Here sans-serif nodesare fixed non-terminals, monospaced nodes are fixed terminals, boxed nodes are named arguments.
