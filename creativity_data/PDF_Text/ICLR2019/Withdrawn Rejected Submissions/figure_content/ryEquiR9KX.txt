Figure 1: Left: R2 -score as a function of the latent dimension Q for different kernel functions.
Figure 2: Left: R2 -score of the predicted values as a function of the latent dimension Q. Right:The average absolute deviation of suggested return to the real return evaluated by Leaving-one-outcross-validation. Historical mean is indicated by “mean” and is Q-independent.
