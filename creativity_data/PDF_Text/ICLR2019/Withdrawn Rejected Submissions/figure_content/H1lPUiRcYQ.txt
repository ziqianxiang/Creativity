Figure 1: Diagram of neural network structure with feature layer. The feature layer consists of collectivevariables information. The connection between the input and feature layers is determined by the definition ofthe collective variables, whereas the feature layer and the first hidden layer are fully connected.
Figure 2: Left: The green filled contours indicate the committor function qm computed using FEM at kBT =10. Middle and right: The 1/2-isosurfaces (projected onto the (x1 , x2) plane) of the committor function qθobtained using the neural network and that obtained from the FEM calculation at kBT = 10. The two panelsdepict the numerical results using the 10-20-1 network (i.e. 1 hidden layer with 20 nodes; middle panel) and the10-20-20-1 network (i.e. 2 hidden layers with 20 nodes on each layer; right panel), respectively. The discretepoints show the sampled 100 transition states.
Figure 3: Left: Schematic representation of the alanine dipeptide (CH3-CONH-CHCH3 -CONH-CH3). Right:The adiabatic energy landscape of alanine dipeptide, which is obtained by minimizing the potential energy ofthe molecule with (φ, ψ) fixed. The red rectangle indicates the transition state region from earlier studies.
Figure 4: Distribution of the data sampled from the Langevin dynamics of alanine dipeptide at the temperatureT = 300K (left) and T 0 = 800K (right).
Figure 5: Distribution of committor values for the 100 states sampled on the 1/2-isosurface of qθ. Thecommittor values are computed from direct Monte Carlo simulation. Left: 66-18-30-30-1 network; Right:66-18-20-20-20-1 network.
