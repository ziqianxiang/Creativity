Figure 1:	The leftmost panel illustrates the connection between probabilistic nodes. The remainingfour panels show how a forward-backward iteration for the likelihood term âˆ† is done.
Figure 2:	An illustration of the nested parameter structure. The policy network (a) has four lay-ers while the recognition network (b) is a 2-layer CNN. Input to the policy network is state s.
Figure 3: (a/b) The accuracy distribution of 100 randomly sampled binary networks for differentSnapQuant settings, on CIFAR-10/100. (c/d) Testing set error curves of different SnapQuant settingson CIFAR-10/100. Each data point corresponds to the performance of a randomly sampled networkat that epoch. Note these four figures are better viewed electronically for a full resolution.
