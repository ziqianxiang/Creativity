Figure 1: (a-c) Relation between α and the magnitude of the gradient with respect to the embeddingsof “correct” (centroid and boundary) and “incorrect” samples. The gradients are sampled from modelstrained on the Car196 dataset (Krause et al., 2013). (d) Illustration of our ‘heating-up” strategy.
Figure 2: 2(a)-2(b): Embedding and normalized embedding of a classifier trained without `2 normal-ization. 2(c): Embedding obtained with a classifier trained with `2 normalization and α = 4.
Figure 3: Relation between the norm of the feature and the magnitude of the gradient with respect to“correct” (centroid and boundary) and “incorrect” samples for SM model. The green dashed linedcorrespond to a small feature norm, the red one to an intermediate feature norm and the blue one to alarge feature norm. The gradients are sampled from models trained with Car196 dataset.
Figure 4: Embeddings trained with '2-normalization and different α values on Car196 dataset.
