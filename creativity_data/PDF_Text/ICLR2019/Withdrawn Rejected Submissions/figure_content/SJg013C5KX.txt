Figure 1: Overview of the iterative machine teaching procedures using CCL and ICL schemes onlearner fθ . a). show the situations where CCLs and ICL normally perform. CCL increases difficultythreshold λ to incorporete more training examples (training weight wλ(z) constantly increases);ICL builds up a teacher-learner communication protocol by training weight w(z; θ) to facilitate thealternative updating of teacher and learner. b). show our T2T where CCLs and ICL perform byinteracting with a structured dark knowledge cycle (Section.3.2 ). Then CCL and ICL determine theirteaching decisions based on not only the curricula but also the structured knowledge instructions.
Figure 2: Overview of three comparison settings for CLs. The first evaluates PC+SDK by comparingthe original PC, random teaching (No CL) and anti-curriculum (Anti-PC, weights inversely proceedsaccorinding to PC). The second and third evaluate SDKs acting on ICL methods, e.g., SPL and L2T.
