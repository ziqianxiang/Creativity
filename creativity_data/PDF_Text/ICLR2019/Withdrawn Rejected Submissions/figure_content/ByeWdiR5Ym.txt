Figure 1: One adaptive kernel created by the convolution of the input image with a matrix of kernels.
Figure 2: A single resulting pixel output from the convolution of the input image and the high orderkernel that generates a dynamic kernel which is convolved with the input image again.
Figure 3: A) A single kernel generated in different positions of the input image. B)Every inputwindow is convolved by a different filter generated on the fly using the input image.
Figure 4: Accuracy vs parameter reduction with standard and adaptive models, training (top) andtesting (bottom).
