Figure 1: A schematic illustration of our recurrent neural network, where the recursion considers theconsistency constraints defined by χ, χ.
Figure 2: Discrete gra-dients: sub-differentialsbetween predictionsusing two differentmeshes.
Figure 3: Changing the resolution of meshes imposes consistency con-straints on the values and two-dimensional sub-differentials betweenpredictions. Shown is the transition between three meshes of differentresolution and the potential difference between the sub-differentials offigure 2.
