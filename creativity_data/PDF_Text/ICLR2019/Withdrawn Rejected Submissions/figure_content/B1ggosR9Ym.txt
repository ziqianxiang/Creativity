Figure 1: Examples of 2D NMR spectra, molecular “fingerprints.”In this paper, we apply deep siamese convolutional neural networks to this problem. For comparisonpurposes, we also apply previously used techniques, Probabilistic Latent Semantic Indexing (PLSI)and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Hofmann, 2001; Blei et al., 2003).
Figure 2: Precision-recall curves for PLSI, LDA, and the Siamese network. Panel (a) is a demonstra-tion that our implementation of PLSI obtains results similar to those in their paper with a similar-sizeddataset.
Figure 3: Many NMR spectra projected into a learned metric space of K=3. Matching colors indicatethe same compound family, but some of the colors have been repeated for different families.
Figure 4: Chemical structures for Aphanamixoids and Turrapubins, respectivelywhereas β-furan is directly linked to cyclopentane derivatives in the other two cases. These resultsindicate that our system is capable of associating unknown compounds to their known analogues inour training dataset, consistent with human judgment.
