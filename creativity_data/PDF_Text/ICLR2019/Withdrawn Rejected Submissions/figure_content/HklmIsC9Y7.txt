Figure 1: Diagram of the proposed methodLoss function: The proposed network is trained with combination of two loss functions. The firstone measures the difference between the ground truth Igt and the interpolated frame I10 .5 generatedby Interpolator network 1. On the other hand, the second loss function computes the differencebetween the ground truth Igt and the interpolated frame Iï¼›.5 estimated by Interpolator network 2.
Figure 2: Visual Comparison of Interpolated Frames on HCD Dataset4.2	Performance AnalysisLoss function: The two loss functions are used for training in the proposed frame interpolationneural networks. In order to evaluate the effect of the interpolator network 1 on the second branch,7Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2019Table 2: Objective comparisons on HCD datasetSequences	MDPFlow2		Phase-based		SepConv		Proposed		PSNR	SSIM	PSNR	SSIM	PSNR	SSIM	PSNR	SSIMSubtitle 1	33.98	0.987	29.97	0.976	34.26	0.988	35.00	0.989Subtitle 2	32.84	0.992	26.14	0.969	33.12	0.992	34.23	0.992Subtitle 3	36.71	0.990	34.64	0.985	37.18	0.991	37.11	0.991Occlusion 1	30.80	0.963	24.13	0.831	32.60	0.974	33.24	0.975Occlusion 2	41.16	0.990	39.47	0.985	42.67	0.992	42.73	0.991Halo	29.38	0.960	24.87	0.866	29.76	0.964	31.25	0.971Average	34.15	0.9803	29.87	0.9353	34.93	0.9835	35.59	0.9848the first term in the loss function is removed.
