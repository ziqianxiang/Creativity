Figure 1: The Deepstrom network architecture involves a usual convolutional part, ConV , includingmultiple convolutional blocks, and a Deepstrom layer which is then fed to (eventually multiple)standard dense layers up to the classification layer. The Deepstrom layer computes the kernel betweenthe output of the conv block for a given input and the corrsponding representations of the trainssamples in the subsample L.
Figure 2:	Accuracy of models as a function of the number of parameters (conv part not included)for various kernels on MNIST (top-left), SVHN (top-right), CIFAR10 (bottom-left) and CIFAR100(bottom-right) datasets.
Figure 3:	Comparison of Multiple Kernels that combines RBF kernels with various values of thebandwidth hyper-parameter. Multiple kernels performance is shown as an horizontal line while singlekernel using one specific value of the bandwidth hyper-parameter σ. Plots correspond to a subsamplesize equal to 2 (left), 4 (middle) and 8 (right).
Figure 4: 2-dimensional φnys representation of 1000 randomly selected test set samples, obtainedwith a subsample set of size 2 and a linear kernel (left) or Chi2 kernel (right).
