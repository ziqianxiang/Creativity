Figure 1: (a) is the schematic diagram for the proof of Lemma 1. (b) and (c) are for the proof ofTheorem 2. (b) is for the assumptions of the theorem are satisfied. While if the shape f is strangeand the data is not dense enough, the theorem will not hold as shown in (c). In (c), there are twodata points t and s may take place y and connect with x. Then the optimization will stop at x.

Figure 4:	MIPS experimental results. The first row is for Yelp data learned by MF. The second rowis for Amovie data learned by MF. The third row is for Yelp data learned by DMF. The fourth row isfor Amovie data learned by DMF. Columns are for results by varying the amount of top labels (i.e.,Top-1, 10, 50 and 100).
