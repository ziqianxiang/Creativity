Figure 1: Illustration of a stochastic super net. Nodes represent data tensors and edges represent op-erators. Edges are executed stochastically following the distribution Pθ. θ denotes the architectureparameter and W denotes network weights. The stochastic super net is fully differentiable.
Figure 2: One layer of a super net for mixed precision quantization of a ConvNet. Nodes in thesuper net represent feature maps, edges represent convolution operators with different bit-widths.
Figure 3: Visualization of all searched architectures for ResNet110 and CIFAR10 dataset. x-axis isthe compression rate of each model. y-axis is the accuracy.
