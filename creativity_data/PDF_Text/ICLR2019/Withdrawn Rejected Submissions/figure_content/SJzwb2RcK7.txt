Figure 1: Overview of ADNet. Encoder encodesthe inputs sentences into two latent vectors m andf . The Generator takes them as the input andproduces the output sentence. During the train-ing, the Discriminator is used for an adversar-ial loss that forces m to do not carry any informa-tion about the form, and the M otivator is usedfor a motivational loss that encourages f to carrythe needed information about the form.
Figure 2: Transfer strength vs Content preservation (see subsection 5.1) for different combination ofthe size of the meaning and form vectors. Each point is labeled with ”[meaning vector size3 1formvector size%”.
