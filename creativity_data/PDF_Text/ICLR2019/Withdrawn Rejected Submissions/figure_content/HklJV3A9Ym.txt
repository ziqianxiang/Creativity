Figure 1: Example of JSON document,adapted from https://github.com/vaadin/fitness-tracker-demoThe variability exemplified above by "workouts" and "speedData" is the defining feature of Multi-instance learning (MIL) problems (also called Deep Sets in Zaheer et al. (2017)), where it is intuitiveto define a sample as a collection of feature vectors. Although all vectors within the collection havethe same dimension, their number can differ from sample to sample. In MIL nomenclature, a sampleis called a bag and an individual vector an instance. The difference between sequences and bags isthat the order of instances in the bag is not important and the output of the classifier should be thesame for an arbitrary permutation of instances in the vector.
