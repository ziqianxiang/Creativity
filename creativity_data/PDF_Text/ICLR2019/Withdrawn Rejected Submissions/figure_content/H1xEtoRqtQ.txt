Figure 1:	Schematic illustration of the problem of model completion: Find the fastest retrainingprocedure T 0 that recovers a loss that is at least as good as the loss from the original model (b).
Figure 2:	Hardness of model completion for AlexNet on ImageNet under retraining procedure T1.
Figure 3: Hardness of model completion for ResNet50 on ImageNet under retraining procedureT1 (top) and T2 (bottom). The x-axis shows experiments that retrain different parts of the modelwhere S corresponds to a ResNet section and B corresponds to a block in that section. S4 B1 -W isthe same as S4 B1 except that the skip connection does not get reinitialized.
Figure 4: A3C on Atari, trained for 50m steps. For each of 10 sseeds MC-hardness is averaged over44 Atari games.
Figure 6: IMPALA on DeepMind Lab with retraining procedure T1. Each of 5 seeds shows theMC-hardness of a single agent jointly trained on 28 DeepMind Lab levels for a total of 1 billion steps.
