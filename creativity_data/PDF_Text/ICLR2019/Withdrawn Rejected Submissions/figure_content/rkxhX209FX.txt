Figure 1: Performance as a function of torso mass for = 0.1 for the Hopper (Left) and Half-Cheetah (Right) tasks. The bands indicate the confidence intervals of the performance measuredacross 5 runs of the entire training procedure.
Figure 2: Performance as a function of torso mass and ground friction on the Hopper (Top row) andHalf-Cheetah (Bottom row) tasks for = 0.1 for one run or EffAcTS-EPOpt. In each row, Left:NC =30, NB=30. Right: NC=30, NB=50.
Figure 3: The banditâ€™s operation in the 115th iteration of training in the Hopper task. Individualtrajectories are shown as dots or crosses, with the position indicating the parameter value and thereturn obtained.
