Figure 1: Feature and semantic spaces of seen and unseen classes. We can see that a large ofportion of instances from unseen classes is wrongly labeled as seen classes (FP). TN: True Negative;TP: True Positive; FN: False Negative; FP: False Positive.
Figure 2: (a) Illustration of Our Domain Division Algorithm: The initial boundary of the knowndomain is estimated by bootstrapping. We can further divide an uncertain domain by K-S Test.
