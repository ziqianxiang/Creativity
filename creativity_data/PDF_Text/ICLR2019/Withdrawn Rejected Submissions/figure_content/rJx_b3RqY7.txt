Figure 1: This graphical model struc-ture is shared with GAN and VAE.
Figure 2: Reconstruction comparison between our proposed model AIM (first row) and ALI (BiGAN) (secondrow) on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CelebA. In each of the figures, the odd columns are original samples from thetest set and the even columns are their reconstructions.
Figure 3: Comparison of our proposed model AIM (first row) with ALI (second row). The ALI’s result shownhere is the selected best-covering result reported in their original paper. And to follow the same settings withALI, the number of points shown in column (b,c,d) is 10,000 which is 10% of the points shown in column (a).

Figure 6: AIM’s CelebA reconstructions. The odd columns are original samples from the CelebA test set andthe even columns are their reconstructions.
Figure 7: ALICE’s CelebA reconstructions with different hyper-parameter λ (reported in Pu et al. (2017)). Thefirst column is the original samples from test set, and the following columns are reconstructions correspondingto different values of λ.
Figure 8: The MSE changes with epochs.
Figure 9: Conditionally generated samples (unsupervised). The first column consists of original images.
