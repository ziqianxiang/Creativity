Figure 1: An overview for our GraphSeq2Seq model by combining Graph2Seq (Gildea et al., 2018)and Seq2Seq (Bahdanau et al., 2014).
Figure 2: A variant for the encoder part of GraphSeq2Seq model. It encodes the features separatelywith three different Bi-LSTMs, while the original model is to encode the features by using only oneBi-LSTM.
