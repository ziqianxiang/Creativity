Figure 1: Weight coefficient vs. pairwise cosine similarity. The solid green lines show the weightassigned for positive pairs, the dotted blue for negative pairs.
Figure 2: Valid triplet based hard mining: for any anchor point, every positive pair is compared withthe hardest negative pair, and vice versa.
