Figure 1: Training and testing procedures of the DNNs with softmax and WNLL functions as the lastactivation layer. (a) and (b) show the training and testing steps for the standard DNNs, respectively;(c) and (d) illustrate the training and testing procedure of the WNLL activated DNNs, respectively.
Figure 2:	Samples from CIFAR-10. Panel (a): from the top to the last rows show the original,adversarial images by attacking ResNet-56 with FGSM, IFGSM, CW-L2 ( = 0.02); and attackingthe ResNet-56 with WNLL as output activation. Panel (b) corresponding to those in panel (a) with= 0.08. Charts (c) and (d) corresponding to the TV minimized images in (a) and (b), respectively.
Figure 3:	Training and testing epochs v.s. accuracy of ResNet-56 on CIFAR-10. (a): without theadditional FC layer; (b): with the additional FC layer.
Figure 4:	Visualization of the features learned by DNNs with softmax ((a), (b), (c), (d)) and WNLL((e), (f), (g), (h)) activation functions. (a) and (b) plot the 2D features of the original and adversarialtesting images; (c) and (d) are the first two principle components of the 64D features for the originaland adversarial testing images, respectively. Charts (e), (f) plot the first two components of thetraining and testing features learned by ResNet-56 with WNLL activation; (g) and (h) show the twoprinciple components of the adversarial images and TV minimized adversarial images for the testset.
Figure 5: Attack strength v.s. accuracy without defense, and defending by WNLL activation, TVMand augmented training. (a), (b), (c) plot results for FGSM, IFGSM, and CW-L2 attack, respectively.
