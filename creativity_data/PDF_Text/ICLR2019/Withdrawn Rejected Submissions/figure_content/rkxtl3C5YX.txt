Figure 1: Empirical CDF of the avg queue size.
Figure 2: Avg queue size vs. different loads.
Figure 3: An input-queued switch, and two example matchings of inputs to outputs. Packets arrivingat input k destined for output' are stored at input port k, in queue Qk,', thus With three input portsand three output ports, there are N = 9 queues in total.
