Figure 1: The proposed multilingual NMT model along with the two training objectives. CE standsfor the cross-entropy loss associated with maximum likelihood estimation for translation betweenEnglish and other languages. Align represents the source language invariance loss that we imposeon the representations of the encoder. While training on the translation objective, training samples(x, y) are drawn from the set of parallel sentences, Dx,y. For the invariance losses, (x, y) could bedrawn from Dx,y for the cosine loss, or independent data distributions for the adversarial loss. Bothlosses are minimized simultaneously. Since we have supervised data only to and from English, oneof x or y is always in English.
