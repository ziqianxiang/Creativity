Figure 1: The design of Dopamine. Blue boxes are software components. Yellow boxes indicate thefile names composing the software components; directed arrows indicate class inheritance, while thenumbers in parentheses indicate the number of non-comment Python lines.
Figure 2: A few lines from the DQN gin-config file implementing the default Dopamine settings.
Figure 3: Comparing results of the published settings against the default settings, averaged over 5runs. In each game, note that the y-scales between published and default settings are different; thisis due mostly to the use of sticky actions in our default setting. The relative dynamics between thedifferent algorithms appear unchanged for SpaceInvaders, but quite different in Seaquest.
Figure 4: Effect of terminating episodes on Life Loss or Game Over, averaged over 5 runs; thischoice can have a dramatic difference in reported performance, although less so for DQN.
Figure 5: Training and evaluation scores, averaged over 5 runs. For our default values of trainingand evaluation , there is a minimal difference between the two settings.
Figure 6: Effect of sticky vs. non-sticky actions. Sticky actions affect the performance of bothRainbow and DQN, but preserve the qualitative differences in performance between the two.
