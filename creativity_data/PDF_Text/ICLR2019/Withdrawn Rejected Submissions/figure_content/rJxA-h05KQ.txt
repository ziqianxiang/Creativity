Figure 1: Visualisation of uncertainty measures: Inhibited Softmax (top) and Monte Carlo Dropout(bottom) on the VAE’s latent space. The shade of grey represent the normalised uncertainty on thesamples generated from the latent space. The lighter the more uncertainty. The points represent theencoded test set and the colours are the classes. The axes show coordinates in the latent space. Notethe similarity in the regions between the methods.
Figure 2: Results of ablation experiments. The plots show the wrong prediction experiment’s ROCAUC, out of-distribution experiment’s ROC AUC and accuracies on MNIST and CIFAR datasets.
Figure 3: Visualisation of the images generated from the grid in the latent space (right) next to theuncertainty measure visualisation (left).
