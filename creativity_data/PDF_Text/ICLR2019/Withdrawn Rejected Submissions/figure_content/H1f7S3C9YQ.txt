Figure 1: Overview of the proposed model SynonymNet. The diamonds are entities. Each circleis associated with a piece of context in which an entity appears. SynonymNet learns to minimizethe loss calculated using multiple pieces of contexts via bilateral matching with leaky units.
Figure 2: Synonym discovery during the inference phase with SynonymNet. (1): Obtain entityrepresentations WEMBED from the corpus D. (2): For each query entity e, search in the entity em-bedding space and construct a candidate entity set ENN. (3): Retrieve contexts for the query entitye and each candidate entity eNN âˆˆ ENN from the corpus D, and feed the encoded contexts intoSynonymNet. (4): Discover synonym entities of the given entity by the output of SynonymNet.
