Figure 1: Basic module in (a) CNN and (b-e) PolyCNN (both early fan-out and late fan-out). Wl and Wl(encircled in red dashed line) are the learnable weights for CNN and PolyCNN respectively. (b-c) Early fan-outPolyCNN, single-seed and multi-seed cases. (d-e) Late fan-out PolyCNN, single-seed and multi-seed cases.
