Figure 1: Geometric modeling of signals as points that lie close to one or more linear subspaces.
Figure 2: The Bayesian nonparametric mixture of factor analyzers (BNP-MFA) from (Chen et al.,2010) which is our building block for estimating the union of subspaces. The tunable hyperpa-rameters are the Dirichlet process (DP) concentration parameter which influences the number ofmixtures/subspaces and the Beta process (BP) parameters which influence the dimensionality of eachsubspace.
Figure 3: Matrix of ten plots (one for each of the ten CIFAR-10 classes) showing the negative squaredMahalanobis distance for each cluster of the class conditional input space pdf in (6) for a single imageconfuser sample from a Carlini-Wagner attack compared to the original unperturbed image. We seethat the adversarial attack has almost no influence on the pdf components.
