Figure 1: For each out channel, parameters (the first row) are fed into a generator function (thesecond row), and generate a kernel (the third row). Then, kernels are concatenated to get the convo-lution kernel in the first convolutional layer. In the second row, G(∙) is Gabor kernel function, S(∙) isSChmid kernel function, and I(∙) is identity mapping.

Orthopedists usually use X-ray images to diagnose fractures. With the developmentof artificial intelligence technology, many scholars use Convolutional Neural Networks to assistdoctors in determining whether a bone image reveals a fracture (Chung et al., 2018).
