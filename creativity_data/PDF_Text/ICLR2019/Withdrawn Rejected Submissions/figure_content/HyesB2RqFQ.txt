Figure 1: Above each of the models we indicate the type of transition and emission cells used. Hfor HMM, R for RNN/Elman and F is a novel Fusion defined in ยง3.3. It is particularly important tounderstanding this work to track when a vector is a distribution (resides in a simplex) versus in theunit cube (e.g. after a sigmoid non-linearity). These cases are indicated by 4ci and ci, respectively.
Figure 2: This plot shows how perplexities change under our transformations, and which lead themodels to converge and pass each other.
Figure 3: Tagging accuracies (right) areplotted against perplexities from Table 1.
