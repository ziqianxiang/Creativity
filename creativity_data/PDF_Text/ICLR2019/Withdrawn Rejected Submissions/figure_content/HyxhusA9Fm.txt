Figure 1: Example of the Talk The Walk task: two agents, a “tourist” and a “guide”, interact witheach other via natural language in order to have the tourist navigate towards the correct location.
Figure 2: We show MASC values of two action sequences for tourist localization via discrete com-munication with T = 3 actions. In general, we observe that the first action always corresponds tothe correct state-transition, whereas the second and third are sometimes mixed. For instance, in thetop example, the first two actions are correctly predicted but the third action is not (as the MASCcorresponds to a “no action”). In the bottom example, the second action appears as the third MASC.

Bottom row: example of false negative(left) and many false positives (right)12	Landmark ClassificationWhile the guide has access to the landmark labels, the tourist needs to recognize these landmarksfrom raw perceptual information. In this section, we study landmark classification as a supervisedlearning problem to investigate the difficulty of perceptual grounding in Talk The Walk.
