Figure 1: Negative curvaturehelps gradient descent. Red:“slow region” of small gradientaround a saddle point. Green: sta-ble manifold associated with thesaddle point. Black: points thatflow to the slow region. Left: globalnegative curvature normal to thestable manifold. Right: positivecurvature normal to the stable man-ifold - randomly initialized gradientdescent is more likely to encounterthe slow region.
Figure 2: Left: Theseparable ob jective forn = 3. Note thesimilarity to the dictio-nary learning objective.
Figure 3: Negative curvature and efficient gradient descent. The union of the lightblue, orange and yellow sets is the set C . In the light blue region, there is negative curvaturenormal to ∂C , while in the orange region the gradient norm is large, as illustrated by thearrows. There is a single global minimizer in the yellow region. For the separable ob jective,the stable manifolds of the saddles and maximizers all lie on ∂C (the black circles denote thecritical points, which are either maximizers "a", saddles "", or minimizers "`"). The reddots denote ∂Cζ with ζ = 0.2.
Figure 4: The projection of the objective of generalized phase retrieval on the (^^, kχk)plane. The full red curves are the boundaries between the sets Si,S2,S3,S4 used in theanalysis. The dashed red line is the boundary of the set Qq。that contains small gradientregions around critical points that are not minima. The maximizer and saddle point areshown in dark green, while the minimizer is in pink.
