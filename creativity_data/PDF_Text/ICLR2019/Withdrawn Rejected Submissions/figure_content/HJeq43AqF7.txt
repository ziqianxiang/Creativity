Figure 1: Example parse trees. Top PRPN-LM prediction, bottom DIORA prediction. DIORAcorrectly chunks the span ‘raised hopes for further interest-rate cuts’.
Figure 2: The inside and outside pass of DIORA for the input 'the cat drank milk'. a) The insidepass: The inside vector for the phrase 'the cat drank' is a weighted average of the compositions forthe two possible segmentations - ((the cat), drank) and (the, (cat drank)).

Bolden token pairs orspans indicate a parse error by PRPN that was correctly attached by DIORA. Some punctuation wasremoved for clarity of printed trees.
