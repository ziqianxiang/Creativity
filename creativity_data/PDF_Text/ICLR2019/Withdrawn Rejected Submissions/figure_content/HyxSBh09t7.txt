Figure 5: Original and generated images for boots of MNIST-fashion data. We assume the graphassociated with the 28 Ã— 28 pixel image. Figure 5a shows samples from the original data, 5b showssamples generated using features encoded by the scattering transform from the same samples, andFigure 5c shows samples generated from random Gaussian noise.
Figure 6:	Original and VAE-generated images for boots of MNIST-fashion data. Figure 6a showssamples from the original data, 6b shows samples generated using features encoded by the VAEfrom the same samples, and Figure 6c shows samples generated from random Gaussian noise usingthe trained VAE.
