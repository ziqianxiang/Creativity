Figure 1: Ride requests for a small region of downtown San Francisco for a typical week day. Eachfigure shows the aggregated ride-locations (red dots) over a period of an hour. Each red dot mayrepresent one or more ride-locations. Ride density varies spatially and temporally.
Figure 2: Weekly ridership (y-axis) pattern of ride requests.
Figure 3: An illustration of how the geographical region of each city is divided into smaller blocksof equal size and trained independently. Note: image above is not drawn to scale.
