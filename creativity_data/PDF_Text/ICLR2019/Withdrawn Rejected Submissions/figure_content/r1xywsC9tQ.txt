Figure 1: PCA representation of animals. Birds are highlighted in orange.
Figure 2: Results of inclusion tests. On the left-hand-side, we show the distribution of correctlyidentified inclusion relations in function of ρ. On the right-hand-side, we show the distribution of(incorrectly) identified inclusion relations in function of ρ.
Figure 3: Two trees underlying the same dag. Notes are labeled with their depth-first index on theleft and their associated interval on the right. Removed edges are drawn as a dotted line.
Figure 4: Tables5.2	Predicates as subspace and the geometry of the feature vector spaceThe task of modeling hyponymy is often used as an oblique way to associate subspaces to nouns(Property 3). Property 3 is an instance of the notion of order-embedding proposed by Vendrovet al. (2015), where we take subspace-inclusion as the underlying order. Vendrov et al. (2015) usesanother concrete order: the intersection of (reverse) order of several scalar spaces.
