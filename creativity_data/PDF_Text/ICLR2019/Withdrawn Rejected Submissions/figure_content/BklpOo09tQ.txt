Figure 1: e2SAD: the proposed efficient two-step adversarial defense method.
Figure 2: Using the loss and cross-entropy dissimilarity at the second step of e2SAD for a three-classclassification problem. Both the clean input and first adversarial example belong to class 1. Greencross: the 1st adversarial point; Red cross: the 2nd adversarial point found by applying FGSM onthe loss value; Yellow cross: the 2nd adversarial point found by applying FGSM on the cross entropydissimilarity with the 1st adversarial point. Only the yellow cross corresponds to a misclassification.
