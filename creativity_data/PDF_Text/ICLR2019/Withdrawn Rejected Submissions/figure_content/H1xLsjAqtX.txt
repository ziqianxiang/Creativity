Figure 1: An illustration of the proposed framework. A selector is designed to select words that arerelevant to the target task. These words are input into the classifier for processing. We aggregateoutput text from different selectors and train the classifier on the aggregated data.
Figure 2: The performance versus the fraction of selected words on Multi-Aspect and IMDBdatasets. We present results using RCNN and LSTM classifier and varying the sparsity, and co-herent hyper-parameters (see Equation 3.2) of the corresponding selector. (C), (S), and (A) denoteclassifier, selector and data aggregation scheme. Results demonstrate that with the data aggregationframework (SAG/WAG), a simple WE selector is competitive with a complex RCNN selector.
