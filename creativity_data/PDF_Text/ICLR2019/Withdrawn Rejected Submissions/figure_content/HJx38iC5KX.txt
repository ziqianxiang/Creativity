Figure 1: The illustration of the domain-class dependency problem. While Li et al. (2018c) focusedon the causal relationship between x and y, we focus on the relationship between y and d becauseit causes the following trade-off problem. (a) When domain and class are independent, domaininvariance and classification accuracy can be optimized at the same time. (b,c) In domain-class de-pendency, there is a trade-off between these two: (b) optimal invariance cannot be achieved whenoptimal classification accuracy is achieved, and (c) vice versa. We propose a method to lead explic-itly to (b) rather than (c), because the primary purpose for domain generalization is classification,not domain-invariance itself.
