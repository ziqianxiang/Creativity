Figure 1: The PEARL architecture includes two modules: an interpretable module with a rule listlearning procedure, and a prediction module with a prototype learning procedure. Two modulesiteratively improves each other during training.
Figure 2: Illustration of the process in which prototypes and rule list learning affect each other viaup-weighting more discriminative samples (shown as bigger red dots). Best viewed in color.

Figure 4: Average Distance between data andprototype during training iterations.
Figure 5: Average rule accuracy on test datasetfor different epochsHere, we study the accuracy of rule during different epochs in Algorithm 1. We conduct 5 indepen-dent trials using different hyperparameter and report their average results. The results are shown inFigure 5. We can find that the accuracy of rules increase with iterative learning and we concludethat the data augmentation does improve the accuracy of rule list learning as well.
