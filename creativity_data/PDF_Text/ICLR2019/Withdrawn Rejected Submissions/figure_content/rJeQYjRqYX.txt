Figure 1: Examples of extracting effective paths.
Figure 2: Class-wise path simi-larity in LeNet.
Figure 3: Density growth whenmerging per-class effective path.
Figure 4: Path similarity for nor-mal and adversarial examples.
Figure 5: Distribution of per-layer similarity for AlexNet on ImageNet. Each line plot represents themean of each kind of adversarial examples’ similarity, with the same-color band around to show thestandard deviation. The dashed line split convolutional layers and FC layers. (a): Rank-1 similarity.
Figure 6: Normal example and perturbations from different attacks. The perturbations are enhancedby 100 times to highlight the differences.

Figure 8: Effective path’s density and class-wise path similarity in the training process.
Figure 9: Per-layer density ofeffective paths in LeNet.
Figure 10: Per-layer density of effective paths in ResNet-50. Layersin ResNet-50 is organized into 3-layer bottleneck blocks, which issplit by dashed lines.
Figure 11: Distribution of per-layer similarity for ResNet-50 on ImageNet. Each line plot representsthe mean of each kind of adversarial examples’ similarity, with the same-color band around to showthe standard deviation. The dashed lines indicate that down-sampling is performed in the next layer.
