Figure 3: Mean Variance vs. log frequency. From left to right: Nations Entity Analysis, NationsPredicate Analysis, WN18RR Entity Analysis and WN18RR Predicate Analysis.
Figure 4: True PositivesFigure 4 displays three true positives from test time predictions. The plots show that the variationalframework can learn high dimensional representations which when projected onto lower (moreinterpretable) dimensions, the distribution over embeddings are shaped to occupy areas at which truefacts lie.
