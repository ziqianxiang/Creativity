Figure 1: Histograms of the number of facts per entity in the training set of two data sets. Note thelog scale of the horizontal axis. The plots show that the distributions are left-skewed. For example,in the FB15K dataset, a third of the entities have less than 25 facts in the whole training set, justifyingthe claim that even large knowledge bases involve small-data problems.
Figure 3: The values of λ at the end of optimization for FB15K-237 dataset and over training epochs.
Figure 4: The average of standard deviations of Gaussian variational distribution for FB15K237 invariational EM algorithm. We see that on average the entities with higher frequencies reach a lowerσ, that means a lower uncertainty.
