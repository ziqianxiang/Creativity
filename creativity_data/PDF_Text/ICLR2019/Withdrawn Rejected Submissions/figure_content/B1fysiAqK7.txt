Figure 1: The discrete Poisson binomial distribution (in green) is approximated by a continuousGaussian distribution (in purple). By applying bdet to a random pre-activation we obtain a binaryactivation distribution.
Figure 2: Max pooling for random variables is performed by taking a single sample from each of theinput distributions. The output random variable for each pooling region is the random variable that isassociated with the maximum sample.
