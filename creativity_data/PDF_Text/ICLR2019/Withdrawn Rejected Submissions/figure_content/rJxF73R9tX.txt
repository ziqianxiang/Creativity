Most of these confident predictions are non-monkeys (g)Comparison against various abstention methods (softmax and SGR) on all the test images (h) Samecomparison, but only on those images on which the DAC abstained. The DAC has a small butconsistent advantage in both cases. All figures are computed on the test set.
Figure 3: Filter visualizations for the DAC. When presented with a smudged image (a,c), the smudgecompletely dominates the feature saliency map (b,d) that cause the DAC to abstain. However for thesame image without a smudge (e), the class features become much more salient (f) resulting in acorrect prediction. For abstention on monkeys (g), the monkey features are picked up correctly (h),which leads to abstentionassociated with the monkey class that result in abstention(Figures 3g, 3h), visually confirming ourhypothesis in Section 3.3 that the DAC has effectively mapped monkey features to the abstentionlabel. Further experiments illustrating the abstention ability of the DAC in the presence of structurednoise are described in Section B of the Appendix.

We also observed (not shown) that for the baseline DNN, the accuracyon the blurred images in the validation set is no better than random.
