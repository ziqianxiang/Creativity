Figure 1: Left diagram: spatial relationships between two contiguous capsule layers (shown in 1D forclarity). If a position is in the receptive field of another position in the higher layer, the two positionsare connected with an arrow pointing to the higher layer. Each capsule at the higher-layer position isa possible parent of capsules at its connected lower-layer position. Right diagram: the assignmentprobabilities and its normalization requirement. Refer to text for more details.
Figure 2: Overall architecture of our Tr-CapsNet. The traceback pipeline, shown as red arrows, is themajor innovation of this paper. GT stands for ground-truth. Refer to text for details.
Figure 3: Illustration of a parents-at-multi-positions scenario. Left: a capsule layer,where each cell represents a capsule. Right:four capsules in the next layer, generated fromthe previous layer (left) through a 3Ã—3 con-volution with stride 1. The capsules in theoverlapping area of the two frames (left) takeboth the red and blue capsules in the higher-level layer (right) as parents.
