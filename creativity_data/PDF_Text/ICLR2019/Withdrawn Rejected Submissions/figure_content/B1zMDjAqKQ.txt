Figure 1: An overview of the proposed model with the audio/visual autoencoder structures and theself-organizing binding layer.
Figure 2: Mean accuracy per class, in percentage, of the reconstructed absent stimuli. We compareaudio and visual reconstruction with the results when training the network with all the samples ofthe training set.
Figure 3: Example of the reconstruction output. The left image displays the audio reconstructionwhen the visual stimulus is perceived. The right image displays the vision reconstruction when theaudio stimulus is perceived.
Figure 4: Examples of reconstructed images for the same perceived auditory stimuli of a networktrained with and another network trained without expectation learning.
