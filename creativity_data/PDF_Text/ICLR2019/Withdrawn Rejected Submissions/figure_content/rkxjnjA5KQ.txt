Figure 1: Various variations of the Breakout game: (a) Standard version, (b) A Constant Rectangle- a rectangle in the same size as the bricks is added to the background in a predefined location, (c)A Moving Square - a square is added to the background and its location changes to one of threepredefined locations every 1000 steps, (d) Green Lines - green lines in different sizes are drawn inthe background, (e) Diagonals - diagonals are drawn in the left side of the background.
Figure 2: A comparison between the different baselines on Breakout. The y-axis on each one of theplots shows the average reward per episode of Breakout during training. The x-axis shows the totalnumber of training epochs where an epoch corresponds to 1 million frames. The plots are averagedon 3 runs with different random seeds. Each curve is the average and its background is the standarddeviation.
Figure 3: Illustration of a frame taken from the target task (left) and its matching frame of thesource task generated with GANs (right) for each one of the Breakout variations. (a)-(d) demonstratesuccesses, while (e) and (f) show failure modes of the unaligned GAN. In (e) the ball in the inputimage is not generated in the output and in (f) not all bricks are generated, and some of the generatedbricks appear smudged.
Figure 4: Road Fighter levels from left to right: Level 1, Level 2, Level 3 and Level 4.
Figure 5: Left: the original frame. Right: GAN generated. Upper row shows the success cases of theGAN while the lower row shows representative failures: in (d) and (f) the only object generated onthe road is the playerâ€™s car and in (e) the diagonal shaped road of level 2 in matched to the startingpoint of level 1.
