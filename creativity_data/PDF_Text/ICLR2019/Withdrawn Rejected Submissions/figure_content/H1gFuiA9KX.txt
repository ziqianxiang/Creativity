Figure 1: Hyperbolic space as the upper sheet of a hyperboloid in Minkowski space.
Figure 2: The probability of a sample being positive (with Î¸ = 3).
Figure 3: The analogue of the word analogy task in hyperbolic space, depicted using the Poincaredisc model. The curved lines are the geodesic line segments connecting the points, and the oppositesides have the equal hyperbolic length. The generalisation of the word analogy task results in eitherof two distinct points Z, Z0, depending on the choice of going via B, or via C, having started at A.
