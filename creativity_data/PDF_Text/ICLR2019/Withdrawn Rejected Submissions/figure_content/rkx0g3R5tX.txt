Figure 1: Learning the conditional distribution for one of the blobs dataset r2 = 0.6. From the topleft to the bottom right: the Popularity based sampling, the Selfplay model (top left) the Softmaxand the CIS model. We see the impact of the CIS model on the learning of the right conditionaldistribution as the distinction between true data (inside the blobs) and negative data is clearer.
Figure 2: Learning the conditional distribution for one of the blobs dataset r3 = 0.75. From the topleft to the bottom right: the Popularity based sampling, the Selfplay model (top left) the Softmax andthe CIS model. Again, on this image, we see the impact of the CIS model on the learning of the rightconditional distribution as the distinction between true data (inside the blobs) and negative data isclearer.
