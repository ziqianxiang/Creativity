Figure 1: Performance on two classification tasks using a logistic loss with a two-norm regulariser((a) and (b)), and two deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) used for recognising imagesof handwritten digits from the MNIST data (c), and classification of the images in the CIFAR-10data (d). Lighter shaded lines indicate individual runs, whereas the darker shaded line indicates theaverage.
