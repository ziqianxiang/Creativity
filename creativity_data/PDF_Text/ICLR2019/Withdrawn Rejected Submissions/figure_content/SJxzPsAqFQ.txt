Figure 1: Left: The hredGAN architecture - The generator makes predictions conditioned on thedialogue history, hi, attention, Aij, noise sample, Zij, and ground truth, Xij+-11. Right: RNN-baseddiscriminator that discriminates bidirectionally at the word level.
Figure 2: The HRED generator with local attention - The attention RNN ensures local relevancewhile the context RNN ensures global relevance. Their states are combined to initialize the decoderRNN and the discriminator BiRNN.
