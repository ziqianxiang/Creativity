Figure 1: Heuristic depiction of class-y manifold. The invariant latent ry will encode global-manifold information, whereas equivariant latent v will encode coordinates of x on the manifold.
Figure 2: Validation-set results for EquiVAE on MNIST. Invariant (left) and equivariant (middle)latent representations are shown reduced to 2D using UMAP. Learning curves are shown (right) withthe ELBO broken down into the sum of the reconstruction and (negative) KL terms, as in Equation 4.
Figure 3: Generated images (left) sampled from the prior p(v) for each ry, (middle) reconstructedfrom equivariant interpolations between the embeddings of same-class digits with fixed ry, and(right) reconstructed from latent pairs (ryi , vj) where (ryi , vi) is an encoded image with y = i.
Figure 4: Latent variables for EquiVAE with 2 dimensional latents. The invariant latent space (left),reconstructions from evenly-spaced variations of ry covering the full space at fixed v = ~0 (middle),and reconstructions from 2-prior-standard-deviation variations of v at fixed ry (right) are shown.
Figure 5: Example of variational encoding of a particular MNIST digit x (from the 6 class) both interms of its invariant representation (top) and its equivariant representation (bottom).
