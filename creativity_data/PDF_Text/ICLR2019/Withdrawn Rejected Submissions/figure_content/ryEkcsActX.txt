Figure 1: Overview of TG-SAGE method. left - Demonstration of an exemplar RDM matrix fora dataset with 8 object categories and 8 object instances per category. right - overview of TG-SAGE method. Correlation between RDMs of candidate and teacher networks, are combined withcandidate network premature performance to form P+TG score for guiding the architecture search.
Figure 2: Comparison of performance and P+TG measures at premature state (epochs=2) as predic-tors of mature performance. (left) scatter plot of premature and mature performance values. (middle)scatter plot of premature P+TG measure and mature performance. (right) Correlation between per-formance, single layer RDMs, and combined P+TG measures with mature performance at varyingnumber of premature training epochs.
Figure 3: Effect of different surrogate measures on architecture search performance. (left) showsthe average C100 performance of the best network architectures found during different stages ofthree runs of RL search in each case (see text). (right) same as the plot on left but displayed withrespect to the total computational cost invested (number of training images × number of epochs ×number of samples).

Figure 5: (left) Comparison of single layer and combined RDMs with premature performance aspredictors of mature performance on NASNet. P+TG was computed using α = 5. (middle) Gain inpredicting the mature performance with varying TG weight. (right) Comparison of combined RDMscores using two alternative teacher models at various stages of training. α values of 1 and 5 wereused for ResNet and NASNet respectively.
