Figure 1: The left and right figures show the graphical models of the first and second stage respec￾tively. Parameters α, θ and φG are specific to Gumbel Attack (Algorithm 2).
Figure 2: Model structure of Gumbel Attack. The same structure is used across three data sets.
Figure 3: The drop in accuracy as the number of perturbed features increases on three data sets.
Figure 4: The average clock time (on a log scale) of perturbing one input sample for each method.
Figure 5: Left and Middle: Transferability results. Solid lines: accuracy on the original models.
