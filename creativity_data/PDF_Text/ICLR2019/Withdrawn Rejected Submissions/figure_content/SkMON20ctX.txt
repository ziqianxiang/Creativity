Figure 2: Learning trajectory of DenseNet on the CIFAR-100 dataset. The markers in the blackdashed lines represent the ideal values of H(y), H(y|y) and ε when ɛ = 0. (a): The dashed linescorrespond to the maximum entropy value. (b): The dashed lines are the upper bound given byFano’s inequality.
Figure 3: Experiments for FCNN and LeNet-5. This figures follow the same format as Figure 2(a).
Figure 4: Experiments for FCNN and LeNet-5. This figures follow the same format as Figure 2(b),with α = 0.85. The shape of the makers differentiate between different values ofp.
