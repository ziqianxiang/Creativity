Figure 1:	Result for direCt integrity attaCk on tWo datasets. The first line Contains the results forFaCebook dataset. The seCond line Contains the results for Cora dataset. The format “Method —Type —DireCtion ” is used to label the eaCh sub-Caption. “Method” refers to embedding methodWhile “Type” refers to adding or deleting edges to poison the graph. “DireCtion” refers to inCreasingor deCreasing the similarity sCore of the target node pair. This notation is also used in Figure 2, 3, 4.
Figure 2:	Result for indireCt integrity attaCk against DeepWalk on tWo datasets Where the aCtion ofattaCker is adding edges.
Figure 3:	Result for direct integrity attack against two methods on two datasets where the action ofthe attack is deleting edges.
Figure 4:	Result for indirect integrity attack against DeepWalk on two datasets where the action ofthe attacker is deleting edges.
Figure 5:	Result for transferability analysis of our attack on two datasets, where the number ofadded/deleted edges is 200. X-axis indicates the method the attack is evaluated on. Y-axis includesthe methods to generate the attack and also the baseline. The format “Dataset — Type ” here is usedto label the each sub-caption. “Dataset” refers to dataset while “Type” refers to attacker’s action.
Figure 6:	Visualization for integrity attack. Green nodes denote authors from ML&DM commu-nity and blue nodes denote authors from Security community. Nodes and their corresponding re-searchers: A: John C. Mitchell; B: Trevor Hastie; c: Susan Landau; d: Michael Lesk; e: HectorGarcia-Molina; f: Jure Leskovec; g: David D. Jensen; h: Thomas G.

Figure 9: Result for transferability analysis of our attack on two datasets, where the number ofadded/deleted edges is 100. X-axis indicates the method the attack is evaluated on. Y-axis includesthe methods to generate the attack and also the baseline. The format “Dataset — Type ” here is usedto label the each sub-caption. “Dataset” refers to dataset while “Type” refers to attacker’s action.
Figure 10: Result for transferability analysis of our attack on two datasets, where the number ofadded/deleted edges is 300. X-axis indicates the method the attack is evaluated on. Y-axis includesthe methods to generate the attack and also the baseline. The format “Dataset — Type ” here is usedto label the each sub-caption. “Dataset” refers to dataset while “Type” refers to attacker’s action.
