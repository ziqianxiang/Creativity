Figure 1: Average test classification accuracy vs. the number of observed tasks in the PermutedMNIST, Split MNIST, Split notMNIST, and Split Fashion-MNIST experiments.
Figure 2: Values of the proposed saliency metric FSM (equation 8) on the 5 tasks in Split MNIST.
Figure 3: Values of the proposed saliency metric FSM (equation 8) on the 5 tasks in Split notMNIST.
Figure 4: Values of the proposed saliency metric FSM on the 5 tasks in Split Fashion-MNIST. Loweris better. The last (bottom right) column displays the average accuracy over all tasks.
Figure 5: Explanations (in the form of saliency maps) of the classification prediction on a test imagefrom a specific task in a particular experiment. Evidence for (against) the predicted class is shownin red (blue). The middle map represents the explanation at the time training has just been finishedfor this task, whereas the map at the right side of each subfigure is the explanation at t = 5.
