Figure 1: ROC curves for each model on the Wi-Fi dataset.
Figure 2: Relative sparsity (number of coefficients equal to zero / total number of coefficients) ofthe obtained MHMM and SpaMHMM models on the Wi-Fi dataset (left) and on the Human3.6Mdataset for different actions (right). Both models for the Wi-Fi dataset have 150 coefficients. Allmodels for the Human3.6M dataset have 396 coefficients.
Figure 3: Assignments of joints to clusters in MHMM (left) and SpaMHMM (right). The differentsymbols (‘o’, ‘△’，‘x’，'+')and the respective colors (blue, green, orange and red) on each jointrepresent the cluster that the joint was assigned to.
