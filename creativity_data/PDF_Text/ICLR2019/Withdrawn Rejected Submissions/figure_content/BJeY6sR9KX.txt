Figure 1: Synergizing machine learning and neuroscience through Brain-Score (top). By quan-tifying brain-likeness of models, we can compare models of the brain and use insights gained toinform the next generation of models. DenseNet, CORnet-S and ResNet architectures are the cur-rent winning models on Brain-Score. Correlation to ImageNet is strong at first, but non-significantfor high-performance models. Green dots represent popular deep neural networks (Table 1) whilegray dots correspond to various simple six-layer models at different stages of their training in orderto demonstrate the relationship between ImageNet performance and Brain-Score on a wider range ofperformances. CORnet-S area architecture (bottom left). The model consists of four areas whichare pre-mapped to cortical areas V1, V2, V4, and IT in the ventral stream. V1cor is feed-forwardand acts as a pre-processor to reduce the input complexity. V2COR, V4COR and ITCOR are recurrent(within area) to reduce the need for many layers and incorporate skip-connections, following theobservation that ResNets and DenseNets are strong models on Brain-Score.
Figure 2:	Brain-Score generalization across datasets: (a) to neural recordings in new subjectswith the same stimulus set, (b) to neural recordings in new subjects with a very different stimulusset (MS COCO), (c) to behavioral responses in new subjects with new object categories, (d) toCIFAR-100 transfer performance.
Figure 3:	Comparison of brain scores on several popular models and CORnet-S. CORnet-Sis comparable to the state-of-the-art models on neural predictivity and a top model on behavioralpredictivity (see Appendix A for numerical results).

Figure 5: CORnet-S circuitry analysis. Each row indicates how ImageNet top-1 performance andBrain-Score change with respect to the baseline model (in bold) when a particular hyperparameteris changed.
Figure 6:	Neural Scores do not depend on number of features. We plot the number of features inmodelsâ€™ highest-scoring layers against their neural (V4 and IT) scores. The number of neurons doesnot appear to be a predictor of better brain-likeness.
Figure 7:	ImageNet top-1 performance vs. behavioral benchmark on various CORnets. Wemanually tried many different configurations of CORnet circuitry. The figure is showing how be-havioral benchmark of Brain-Score is related to ImageNet top-1 performance in 106 CORnet con-figurations. Each dot corresponds to a particular CORnet at a particular point during training. Thecorrelation between ImageNet top-1 performance and CORnet is robust but there is also high vari-ance in this relationship. In particular, notice how some models achieve close to 75% ImageNetperformance but show only a mediocre behavioral score. Thus, optimizing solely for ImageNet isnot guaranteed at all to lead to a good alignment to brain data.
Figure 8: Prediction correlations on early and late spike rates. We compare ImageNet per-formance against pearson correlation of predicted spike rates with neural data binned into early(90-110 ms) and late (190-210 ms). Model mappings are performed separately per bin, layers arechosen based on 70-170 ms scores. Notice how better ImageNet models are better at predicting lateIT responses, but not early ones.
