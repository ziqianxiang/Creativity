Figure 1: Input representation from a neural extractor is investigated for task-specific information.
Figure 2: The relative accuracies of different tasks with increasing number of dimensions given bythe greedy forward selection. Note that in majority of tasks, very few dimensions are required toreach close to the accuracy given by all the dimensions (i.e. 1.0 mark).
Figure 3: A graphical view depicting the transfer-learning (TL) gains for two tasks (SST(f) andTREC). These tasks are trained using pre-trained representations of other tasks, in the order of pre-dictions from our two methods (CFS and Clf. Weight Difference). Each figure shows the maximumTL gain (y-axis) by transfering from the best task explored until that point (x-axis). For comparison,a random baseline gives expected best-TL gain for a random ordering of tasks.
