Figure 1: Distribution of the first 10 filters for standard convolution (a) vs. depthwise convolutionconv2_1/dwise in MObileNet_V2 (b). Figure (a) shows the stable dynamic data range for the first 10filters (also for the entire Weight tensor). Figure (b) shoWs the fluctuant dynamic data range crossfilters. The 6th filter has 50x bigger dynamic range than the other filters.
Figure 2: Concatenation in inception block. Dynamic data range is pretty stable in activations forconcatenation within the range from 1.6x to 2.0x among the topologies in our work.
