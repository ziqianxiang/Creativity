Figure 1: (a) Schematic illustration of the gradient flow of compressible fluid in one-dimension.
Figure 2: Schematic illustration of two applications (a) UnsUPervised density estimation and (b)variational free energy calculation for a statistical mechanics problem. In both cases, we integrateequations 2 and 3 under a parametrized potential function 夕(x), and optimize 夕(x) such that thedensity at the other end matches to the desired one.
Figure 3: (a) The NLL of the training (blue) and the test (orange) MNIST dataset. The horizontallines indicate results obtained with previous flow-based models reported in (Papamakarios et al.,2017). (b) From top to bottom, MOnge-AmPere flow of test MNIST images to the base Gaussiandistribution.
Figure 4: The training loss equation 7 vs the training epoch with (upper panel) and without (lowerpanel) translational and rotational symmetry imposed in the potential. The loss function is thevariational free energy of the Ising model, which is lower bounded by the exact solution indicatedby the horizontal red line (Onsager, 1944; Li & Wang, 2018). Inset shows representative Isingconfigurations generated at epochs 0, 500, 1000, 1500, respectively. Each inset contains a 5 × 5 tileof a 162 Ising model. In the lower panel, the generated samples exhibit two domains because westill impose the Z2 inversion symmetry in the network. Without imposing the inversion symmetrythe model will generate almost all black/white images due to the ferromagnetic correlations.
