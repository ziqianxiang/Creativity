Figure 1: Neuron hierarchical networks as a generalization of various network structures. Each nodein the four graphs indicates an actual neuron in the network. NHN may be derived by performingnetwork pruning (c) on a plain/branching network (a,b), then adding new neurons to break the layerhierarchy (d).
Figure 2: Illustration of discovered layer hierarchy and potential locations for add-on neurons. Blockp denotes the average pooling cell. Block a denotes the location where add-on neurons may occur.
Figure 3: Illustration of location-direction search (LDS). First, search for optimal locations whereadd-on neurons may occur (a). Second, search for optimal direction at each given location (b) thatadd-on neurons point to the existing neurons. White blocks stand for existing layers and neurons.
