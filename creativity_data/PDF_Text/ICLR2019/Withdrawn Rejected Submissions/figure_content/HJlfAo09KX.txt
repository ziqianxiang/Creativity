Figure 2: Fix K = 3. (a) Success rate of converging to the same local minima with respect tothe sample complexity for various d; (b) Average estimation error of gradient descent in a localneighborhood of the ground truth with respect to the sample complexity for various d; (c) Averageestimation error of gradient descent using different objective functions in a local neighborhood of theground truth with respect to the sample complexity when d = 20.
