Figure 1: Dispersion of the Sobol sequence, samples from a k-DPP, and uniform random samples(lower is better). These log-log plots show when d = 1 that Sobol suffers from regular plateausof increasing size, while when d = 2 the k-DPP samples have lower average dispersion and lowervariance.
Figure 2: Average best-found model accuracy by iteration when training a convolutional neuralnetwork on three hyperparameter search spaces (defined in Section 5.1), averaged across 50 trials ofhyperparameter optimization, with k = 20.
Figure 3: Average best-found model accuracy by iteration when training a convolutional neuralnetwork on the “Stable” search space (defined in Section 5.2), averaged across 50 trials of hyperpa-rameter optimization, with k = 5, 10, 15, 20, with 95 percent confidence intervals. The k-DPP-RBFoutperforms uniform sampling, TPE, and the Sobol sequence.
Figure 4: Wall clock time (in seconds, x-axis) for 25 hyperparameter trials of hyperparameteroptimization (each with k = 20) on the “Stable” search space define in Section 5.2. The vertical linesrepresent the average time it takes too find the best hyperparameter assignment in a trial.
Figure 5: Comparison of the Sobol sequence, samples a from k-DPP, and uniform random fortwo metrics of interest. These log-log plots show uniform sampling and k-DPP-RBF performscomparably to the Sobol sequence in terms of distance to the center, but on another (distance to theorigin) k-DPP-RBF samples outperform the Sobol sequence and uniform sampling.
