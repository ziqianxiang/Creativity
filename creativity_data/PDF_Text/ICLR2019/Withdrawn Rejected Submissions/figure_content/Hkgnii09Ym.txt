Figure 1: Diagrams of our attention-based set operations.
Figure 2: Try the task yourself: this is a randomly sampled set of 20 images from the Omniglotdataset. There are 14 different characters inside this set.
Figure 3: Clustering results for 10 test datasets, along with centers and covariance matri-ces. rFF+Pooling (top-left), SAB+Pooling (top-right), rFF+PMA (bottom-left), Set Transformer(bottom-right). Best viewed magnified in color.
Figure 4: Subsampled dataset examples. Each row is one dataset, which is composed of 7 normalimages and 1 abnormal image (red box). Normal images in each subsampled dataset have both twoattributes that are described in the rightmost column of figure. On the other hand, abnormal imagedoes not contain the two attributes.
Figure 5: Runtime of a single SAB/ISAB block on dummy data. x axis is the size of the input setand y axis is time (seconds). Note that the x-axis is log-scale.
Figure 6: Accuracy of ISABn + PMA on the unique character counting task. x-axis is n, the numberof inducing points, and y-axis is accuracy.
