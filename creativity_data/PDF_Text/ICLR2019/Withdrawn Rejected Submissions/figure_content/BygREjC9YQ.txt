Figure 1: The heirarchy of generative models underlying our updates. A Full model for the gradientsfor a single parameter. The current estimate for all the other parameters, μ-i(t) vary SloWly overtime, and give rise to the current optimal value for the ith parameter, w*. The gradient then arisesfrom the current estimate of the ith parameter, μi(t) (which is treated as an input here), and theoptimal value, ith parameter, Wi*. B The graphical model obtained by integrating over trajectoriesfor the other parameter estimates, μ-i(t). In practice, we use a simplified model as reasoning aboutall possible trajectories of μ-i(t) is intractable. C To convert the model in B into a tractable hiddenMarkov model (HMM), We define a neW variable, zi (t), Which incorporates Wi* along With otherinformation about the dynamics.
Figure 2: Comparing RMSprop and BRMSprop on MNIST. The vertical bars represent one standarderror and are based on 30 independent runs. Adam and BAdam both use ηw = 0.1.
