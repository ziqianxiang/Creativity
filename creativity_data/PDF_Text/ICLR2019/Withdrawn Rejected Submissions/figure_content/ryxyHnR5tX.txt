Figure 1:	Performance of vanilla AIHT and accelerated AIHT on the image recovery task; (a)shows a comparison of the execution time at various sizes of images (lower is better), (b) shows acomparison of the magnitude of residuals (lower is better), and (c) visualizes the recovered imagesand the ground truth images.
Figure 2:	Performance of vanilla CoSaMP and accelerated CoSaMP on the image recovery task; (a)shows a comparison of the execution time at various sizes of images (lower is better), (b) shows acomparison of the magnitude of residuals (lower is better), and (c) visualizes the recovered imagesand the ground truth images.
Figure 3:	Performance of vanilla AIHT and accelerated AIHT on the trend detection task; (a) showsa comparison of the execution time at various resolutions of the time series (lower is better), (b)shows a comparison of the magnitude of residuals (lower is better), and (c) visualizes the extractedtrends.
