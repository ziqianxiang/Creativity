Figure 1: The figure shows the proposed NUTS architecture model. The information in a giveninput sentence s is encoded into a vector he1 as the final hidden state of Encoder Es . This hiddenstate vector he1 initializes decoder DI , which generates an indicator vector I. The element-wisemultiplication of I and s is used to construct the masked sentence s0. This masked sentence isencoded into a vector(he2) using Es0. This vector is then used to initialize decoder Ds0 which aimsto reconstruct s from the masked sentence.
Figure 2: The figure shows a detailed flow of the NUTS architecture with an example input.
