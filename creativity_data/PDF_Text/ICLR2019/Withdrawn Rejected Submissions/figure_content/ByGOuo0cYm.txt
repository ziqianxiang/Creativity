Figure 1: Problem Setting for Meta-Learning with Domain Adaptation. Tasks are drawn from τtrain, on whichmeta learning is performed, such that the learner can do effective meta-testing for tasks drawn from a differentdistribution τtest. The images are adapted from the Omniglot dataset (Lake et al., 2011), where the left blockhas some original instances of hand-written characters in the original domain, and in the right block, we have aset of different omniglot characters (or classes) and the data is also in a different domain.
Figure 2: Meta Learning With Domain Adaptation (MLDA): The proposed method for feW-shot learning undertask-level domain shift using adversarial domain adaptation. A task sampled from τtrain in every episode. Thistask is used to update the parameters With the aim of achieving 2 goals: 1) It folloWs a Prototypical NetWorkslearning scheme to acquire feW-shot learning ability, and 2) It styles the task to appear indistinguishable froma task draWn from τtest . Task-level domain invariance is achieved through the usage of a GAN loss and acycle-consistency loss (Lda = LGAN + Lcycle).
