Figure 1: The generation of embeddings of words in a sentence through a latent variable (the se-mantic group). Above we visualize the semantic group space of embeddings (with Di , Dj , Dkrepresenting different semantic groups).
Figure 2: On the left, M1 assumes that both datasets are generated i.i.d. from the same parametricdistribution. On the right, M2 assumes that the datasets are generated i.i.d. from distinct parametricdistributions.
