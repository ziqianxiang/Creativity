Figure 1: Model structures. Each colored arrow denotes a neural network. The common com-ponents are interpreters I(.), adversary A(.), and classifier C(.). In age-indep-autoencoder andage-indep-entropy (Figure 1b), a reconstructor R(.) tries to reconstruct input data from the hiddenrepresentation. In age-indep-consensus-nets (Figure 1c), a discriminator D(.) tells apart from whichmodality the representation originates.
