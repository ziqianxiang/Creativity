Figure 1: Robustness trade-off curves of different regularization methods for VGG11 onCIFAR10. Each plot shows test accuracy Vs adversarial test accuracy for £2-bounded, 40-Step PGD adversaries with a fixed etest. The bottom plots consider PGD-£2 + SN projection,with different values of the constraint radius τ . Different points on a curve correspond totraining with different regularization strengths, with the leftmost points corresponding tothe strongest regularization.
Figure 2: (left) Comparison of lower and upper bound quantities (∣∣ f ∣∣M Vs the product ofspectral norms). (right) CDF plot of normalized empirical margins for the ∣∣Vf ∣∣2 penaltywith different regularization strengths, normalized by ∣∣ f ∣∣M. We consider 1000 fixed trainingexamples when computing ∣∣ f ∣∣M.
Figure 3: £∞ robustness trade-off curves of different regularization methods for VGGn onCIFAR10. Each plot shows test accuracy vs adversarial test accuracy for £∞ bounded 40-StepPGD adversaries with a fixed etest. Different points on a curve correspond to training withdifferent regularization strengths, with the leftmost points corresponding to the strongestregularization.
