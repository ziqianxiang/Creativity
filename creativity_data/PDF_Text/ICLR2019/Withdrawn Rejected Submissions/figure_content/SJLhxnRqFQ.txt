Figure 1: Overview of the unsupervised (AMM) and semi-supervised (SAMM) model with thefirst option (Equation (6)) for the inference distribution. AMM consists of two generators, encoderGz(x,Gy(x)) and decoder Gx(y,z), and a discriminator D(x,y,z). SAMM includes an additionalgenerator for labeled data, Gz(x,y).
Figure 2: Unsupervised clustering of MNIST data with 10 mixture components. (a) Comparing testimage membership and randomly generated digits for each mixture component. (b) Cluster matrix. (c)Reconstructions of input images: original data on the left of each pair. (d) Interpolation between exam-ples: original data samples are shown in the first and last columns with linearly interpolated generationsbetween. (e) t-SNE projection of testing samples, color-coded for the MNIST class labels (0to 9).
Figure 3: Unsupervised clustering of SVHN data with 30 mixture components. (a) Randomly generatedimages for each mixture component, mixture component indices are indicated to the left of each row.
Figure 4: Semi-supervised clustering and classification of SVHN data with 10 mixture components.
