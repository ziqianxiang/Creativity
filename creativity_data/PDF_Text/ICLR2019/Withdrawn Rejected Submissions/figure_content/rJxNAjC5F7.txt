Figure 1: An arc of length θ on the unit hyper-sphere starting from a random point in a randomdirection has probability θ/n for the sign of a par-ticular component to change along its course. Inthe 3D example above, crossing the great circleimplies that the sign of one component differs be-tween Zi and Zj .
Figure 2: The empirical distribution and our binomial approximation of Hamming distance fortwo uniformly random vectors on the n-hypersphere, conditioned on being separated by an angleθ = 15°. From left to right, n = 16,64. Each empirical distribution was calculated from the resultsof 106 trials.
Figure 3: ImageNet precision and recall at different hash lengths for chosen Hamming radii usingHDT + Inception V3. Note that at their target Hamming radii, all models achieve similar recall andprecision.
Figure 4: Comparison of HDT-E and PQ 64-bit codes. Metrics used are SIFT 1M recall@100vs. number of distance comparisons, a measure of query cost. PQ curves are sampled at differentparameters for w ∈ {1, 8, 64}, the number of centroids whose elements to check against the query.
