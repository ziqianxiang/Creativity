Figure 1: Pixel Redrawn concept with MNIST example.
Figure 2: Example of original images and PR images from MNIST dataset. From a pair of an image,the left-hand side is the original image and the right-hand side is the PR image.
Figure 3: The example of the input images for the classifier from MNIST dataset with FGSM( = 0.3), BIM ( = 0.3), MIM ( = 0.3), and L2-CW attack techniques in five cases.
Figure 4: Examples of using PR method and some random noises in MNIST, Fashion MNIST andCIFAR-10 datasets. For every three images from the left, the leftmost one is the original image, themiddle one is the image after adding some random noises, and the rightmost one is the PR image.
