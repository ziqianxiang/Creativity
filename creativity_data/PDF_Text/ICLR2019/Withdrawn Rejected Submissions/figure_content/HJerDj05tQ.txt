Figure 1: Some results based on Wide-ResNet. WRN-d-k denotes a wide residual network that hasd convolutional layers and a widening factor kAbout Drift-SGDM and SGDM, the loss is achieved from the average of two model. The parameterscale of the two model can be different, because they respectively live on Grassmann manifold andOblique manifold. Due to this, the comparing between Drift-SGDM and SGDM is more reasonable.
