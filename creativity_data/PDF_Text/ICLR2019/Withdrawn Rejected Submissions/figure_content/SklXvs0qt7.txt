Then we prioritize the transitions with higher TD-errors for replay. It is known that PER can become very expensive in computational time (Schaulet al., 2015b), especially when the memory size N is very large. The reason is that PER uses TD-

Figure 4:	Pearson correlation between the density P and TD-errors in the middle of trainingInsights: We also investigate the correlation between the complementary trajectory density P andthe TD-errors of the trajectory. The Pearson correlation coefficient, i.e. Pearson’s r (Benesty et al.,2009), between the density P and the TD-errors of the trajectory is shown in Figure 4. The value ofPearson’s r is between 1 and -1, where 1 is total positive linear correlation, 0 is no linear correlation,-1 is total negative linear correlation. In Figure 4, we can see that the complementary trajectorydensity is correlated with the TD-errors of the trajectory with an average Pearson’s r of 0.7. Thisproves that the relatively rare trajectories in the memory buffer are more valuable for learning.
