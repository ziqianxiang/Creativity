Figure 1: Assessment of unsupervised FS algorithms LluFS, Lap, Spec, Mcfs, Ndfs and Ran-DOM: predictive accuracy of 1-nn classifier vs number d of selected features, on datasets MADELON,Allaml, Carcinom, Lung, Orlraws 1 0p, Pixraw 1 0p, Tox1715.1	Comparison on biological and image datasetsFig. 1 displays the performance curve (1-nearest neighbor accuracy) vs the number d of selectedfeatures.3 On datasets Allaml and Tox171 (Fig.1 (a) and (b)), LluFS dominates all other meth-ods over the whole learning curve. On Allaml, both Lap and Ndfs do much better than Mcfs,suggesting that the feature clusters are not much relevant to the classification task. Spec showsa robust performance after sufficiently many features have been selected (d > 50). On TOX171,both Lap and Mcfs do much better than Ndfs, suggesting that the feature set presents a complexcluster structure (captured by Ndfs) misleading to the classification task. Likewise, Spec yieldsgood results after the beginning of the curve (d > 20). In both cases, RANDOM is significantlyoutperformed, suggesting that quite a few feature clusters are irrelevant to the prediction task.
