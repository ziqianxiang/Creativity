Figure 4: Outlier Detection Accuracy on CIFAR-10 Model: Varying kWe evaluate how the input parameter k influences the accuracy of outlier detection. Asdiscussed in Sec. 2, in our IOD-based method, k is used to establish a confidence cut offthreshold that corresponds to the kth smallest maXimum route probability or maXimum16Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2019Threshold(a) CIFAR-10Threshold(b) CIFAR-100Figure 5: Outlier Detection Accuracy on MNIST Model: Varying k100%& 90%ranU< 80%70%Threshold(c) SVHN

While in Deep SVDD and AnoGAN, it correspondsto the kth largest outlierness score among the normal ob jects. In our IOD-based method,given a testing image, if its maximum weighted sum or maximum route probability is smallerthan the cutoff threshold, it is considered as an outlier. In Deep SVDD and AnoGAN, atesting image is considered as an outlier if its outierness score produced by Deep SVDD orAnoGAN is larger than the corresponding cutoff threshold.
