Figure 1: Overall network architecture. Each block in the fully convolutional network is a basic-block module (blue insert), as introduced by He et al. (2016), containing 2 convolutional layers with3 Ã— 3 kernels followed by BatchNorm and ReLU. For all of our experiments, unless explicitly statedotherwise, we used a stack of 4 encoder-decoder sub-networks.
