Figure 1: Model architecture: Skip-Thought Generative Adversarial Network3.2	Generative Adversarial NetworksGenerative Adversarial Networks (Goodfellow et al. (2014)) are deep neural net architectures com-prised of two networks, contesting with each other in a zero-sum game framework. For a given data,GANs can mimic learning the underlying distribution and generate artificial data samples similarto those from the real distribution. Generative Adversarial Networks consists of two players - aGenerator and a Discriminator. The generator G tries to produce data close to the real distributionP(x) from some stochastic distribution P(z) termed as noise. The discriminator Dâ€™s objective is todifferentiate between real and generated data G(z).
