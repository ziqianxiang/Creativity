Figure 1: (a) An intuitive illustration of the inter-class distance. The distance between “Englishfoxhound” and “Irish wolfhound” is 1 and “English foxhound” and “jellyfish” is 5. (b) An intuitiveillustration of the noise transition matrix N used in this paper. Darker color corresponds to higherprobability. When the label of a sample is i, we replace its label with j with probability Nij . Thenumber of cluster can be changed (gray corresponds to 8 and red corresponds to 2).
Figure 2: (a) Conceptual distance matrix between all classes in ImageNet-1k. We use this distanceto cluster the classes into some subgroups for noise generation. (b) Cosine distance matrix betweenvectors in the final fully connected layer. This matrix shows a similar structure to the inter-classdistance matrix. This resemblance means conceptual similarity correlates with visual similarity.
Figure 3:	Class-dependent noise results in less performance decrease than Class-indepednetnoise. Test accuracy with ResNet-50 on ImageNet-1k validation set with class-independent andclass-dependent noise. clusters is the number of clusters for label noise generation described insection 2.2. We report mean and standard deviation of test accuracy along three runs.
Figure 4:	Test accuracy of VGG-19 and DenseNet-121 trained with class-dependent noise, withclass-independent noise and without noise. Class-dependent noise results in less performance de-crease not only on ResNet-50 but on other networks.
Figure 5: CNNs trained on class-dependent label noise learn similar representation of CNNstrained on clean data. ProjeCtion-weighted CCA distanCe between ResNet-50s and a Cleanlytrained ResNet-50 at eaCh Component. These results indiCate Class-independent noise leads CNNsto learn unnatural representation in the final layer. We report mean and std of distanCe along threedifferent models.
Figure 6: Class-independent noise degrades the performance of transfer learning comparedto class-dependent noise. Test accuracy in transfer learning (ResNet-50) on ImageNet-100 andWikiArt. We pre-trained models on ImageNet-1k and replaced the final layers with random ones.
Figure 7: Test accuracy with ResNet-50 on ImageNet-1k validation set with class-independent andclass-dependent noise. Extending Figure 3, we report the results when the number of clusters is 10.
