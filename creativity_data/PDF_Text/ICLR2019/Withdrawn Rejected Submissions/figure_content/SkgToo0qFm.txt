Figure 1: Protein Binding. The BNI1 protein (blue) opens up to bind to Actin (red). While ourmethod is trained only using structures of complexes such as the one at right (sampled from Cr),without any information on how the individual proteins deformed upon binding, we test on pairs ofunbound structures such as those at left (sampled from Cp) with minimal loss in performance.
Figure 2: Protein Interface Prediction via SASNet. We predict which parts of two proteins have thepotential to interact by constructing a binary classifier. To extract training examples for the problem,we start with a pair of proteins in complex sampled from Cr (A, proteins shown in cartoon form),and from there extract all pairs of interacting amino acids (B, atoms shown in stick form). We thensplit these pairs to obtain our positives (C), as well as sampling random non-interacting pairs fromthe complex for our negatives (D). These pairs are then individually voxelized into 4D grids, the lastdimension being the one-hot encoding of the atomâ€™s element type (E, atom channel shown as color).
Figure 3: Model Scaling. Mean CAUROC is reported, with standard deviation marked as error bars.
