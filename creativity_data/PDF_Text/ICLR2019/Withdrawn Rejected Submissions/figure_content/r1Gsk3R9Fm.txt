Figure 1: High level diagram of our layer-wise learning framework using a k = 2-hidden layer. P,the down-sampling (Jacobsen et al., 2018, Fig. 2), is applied at the input image as well as at j = 2.
Figure 2: (Left) Linear and (Right) CNN-p separability as a function of depth for CIFAR-10 models.
Figure 3:	Intermediate Accuracies of models in Sec. 4.3. We note that the k = 1 model is largerthan the k = 2, 3 models.
Figure 4:	Linear separability of differently trained sequential models. We show how the data variesfor the different M, observing similar trends to the aggregated data.
