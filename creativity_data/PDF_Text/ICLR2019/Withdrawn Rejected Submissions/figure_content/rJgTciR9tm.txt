Figure 1: A N -length stochastic dynamical system with corresponding IBH in parallel. We studythe shaded 3-hop process in isolation, i.e., given three consecutive states Xk-1, Xk and Xk+1 of theinput process, the stochastic variables Bk , Bk+1 represent dynamics of the alternatively designedprocess to capture the relevant information.
Figure 2: A comparison among single IB (designed locally) and IBH for various size tuples of(Xk-1, Xk, Xk+1), respectively. The horizontal axis denotes required level of information transfer,while vertical is inversely proportional to compression levels.
Figure 3: Variations of rank(∆) with Lagrange parameters β, λ and γ, when dimension of inputdynamics (Xk-1, Xk, Xk+1) is (40, 30, 20). The rank variation is presented by fixing one parameterin each scenario: (β = 100, λ, γ) in (3a), (β, γ = 10, λ) in (3b), and (β, γ, λ = 0.01) in (3c).
Figure 4: The alignment of three modalities (text, visual and audio) with averaging of visual andaudio features corresponding to the time boundaries obtained from text.
