Figure 1: a) A vanilla search system. The query q0 is given to the system which outputs a resulta0 . b) The search system with a reformulator. The reformulator queries the system with q0 and itsreformulations {q1, ...qN} and receives back the results {a0, ..., aN}. A selector then decides thebest result ai for q0 . c) The proposed system. The original query is reformulated multiple timesby different reformulators. Reformulations are used to obtain results from the search system, whichare then sent to the aggregator, which picks the best result for the original query based on a learnedweighted majority voting scheme. Reformulators are independently trained on disjoint partitions ofthe dataset thus increasing the variability of reformulations.
