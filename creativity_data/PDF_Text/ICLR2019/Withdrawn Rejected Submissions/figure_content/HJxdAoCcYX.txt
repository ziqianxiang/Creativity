Figure 1: Performance of detection on Cora dataset.
Figure 2:	Performance of detection on Citeseer dataset.
Figure 3:	Performance of detection models on synthetic dataset. BA1 denotes the synthetic graphgenerated by Barabasi-Albert algorithms with parameter m = 1; ER1 and ER2 denotes the Erdos-Renyi graph with parameter pi = Innn and p =ç©ºn respectively. BA2 is not in the figure becausethe multi-edges attack fails on the graph.
Figure 4: Performance of detection models on randomly added edges on Cora and Citeseer.
