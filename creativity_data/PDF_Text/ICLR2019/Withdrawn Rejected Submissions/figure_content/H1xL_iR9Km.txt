Figure 1: An illustration of the two experimental settings (digit recognition and action recognition)for multi-source domain and task transfer (MS-DTT). Our method effectively transfers knowledgefrom multiple sources to the target task.
Figure 2: Loss on the hyper-validation set as training proceeds. We define 1 epoch as training for 100mini-batches (gradient descents).
