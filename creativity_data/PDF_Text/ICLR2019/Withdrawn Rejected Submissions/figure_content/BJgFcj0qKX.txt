Figure 1: A typical u-net module with outer residual connection. M is the number of input features.
Figure 2: Dilated SUNet-7-128 network for segmentation at output_stride = 8. For dilation > 1,the feature maps are processed with a varying range of dilation factors inside each u-net module (seeinset). The de-gridding filters smooth out aliasing artifacts that occur during deconvolution.
Figure 3: Visualization of the segmentation output on PASCAL VOC 2012 val set when trainedat an output.stride = 16 using SUNet-7-128 network + MS-COCO. Final row shows couple offailure case which happens due to, ambiguous annotation and inability in detecting low resolutionobjects.
Figure 5: Activation map recorded at the end of each level of the dilated SUNet for an exampleinput image of an ‘Aeroplane’. The activation map with total highest magnitude were selected fromamong all feature map outputs at the corresponding layer. Top to Bottom: output at end of level1 - 6 followed by classification output. The level 6 output is simply a prediction map before bilinearinterpolation.
