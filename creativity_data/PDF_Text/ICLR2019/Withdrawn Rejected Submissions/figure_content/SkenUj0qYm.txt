Figure 1: We jointly train a sentiment classifier with a sentiment- and domain-aware embeddingmodel, using both labeled and unlabeled data. When sentiment label is observed, our model is trainedwith the usual cross entropy and maximum likelihood objectives; for unlabeled data, it uses pseudolabels produced by the sentiment classifier, and a variational Bayes objective.
