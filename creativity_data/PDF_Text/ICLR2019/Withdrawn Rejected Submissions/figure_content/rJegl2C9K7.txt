Figure 1: Overview of the proposed stage-by-stage knowledge transfer approach. Both teacherand student models are divided into K stages, where the number of rectangular bars indicates thedepth of the sub-network. Student is trained to mimic the output feature of teacher at each stage andthe output feature of the K-th stage can be finally applied to different tasks. Note that We do nottransfer the knowledge in the final stage, since teacher and student share the same network structurein this stage. When training a particular stage, as shown in green color, all parameters in previouswell-trained stages are fixed. Red dashed arrow shows the backward propagation. Better viewed incolor.
