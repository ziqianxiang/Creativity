Figure 1: (a) High-resolution, (b) low-resolution, (c) and super-resolution spectrograms. The super-resolution spectrogram corresponds to audio generated by the GAN described in Section 3, trainedonly with an adversarial loss and conventional L2 loss. Training tends to either diverge, or results inaudio with persistent high-frequency tones and alias-like artifacts.

Figure 5:	Spectrograms from the Speaker1 task at R = 2 (top row, Speaker 225), and Speaker99 taskat R = 4 (bottom row, Speaker 360). (a-d) high-resolution, (b-e) super-resolved with U-net8, and(c-f) super-resolved with MU-GAN8. Increased synthesis of high-frequency content by MU-GAN8becomes more pronounced at difficult up-sampling ratios.
