Figure 1:	Results of accuracy and robustness of different neural networks on increasing training dataon CIFAR-10. (ResNet/DenseNet+D represents ResNet/DenseNet models with data augmentation)4.2 Relationship between size of training data, model accuracy and robustnessResults on CIFAR-10, MNIST, STL-10 and Tiny ImageNet are shown in Figs 1-4, respectively. Thex-axis of each figure shows the size of sub-datasets, and the y-axis shows the accuracy or robustnessof the models trained on each sub-dataset.

Thex-axis of each figure shows the size of sub-datasets, and the y-axis shows the accuracy or robustness(measured by adversarial accuracy) of the models trained on each sub-dataset. adv_acc in the figuresrepresents adversarial accuracy. `2 attack shows the adversarial accuracy by CW attack, with thethreshold on '2 distortions. Similarly, '∞ attack shows the adversarial accuracy by I-FGSM attack,with the threshold on '∞ distortions.
