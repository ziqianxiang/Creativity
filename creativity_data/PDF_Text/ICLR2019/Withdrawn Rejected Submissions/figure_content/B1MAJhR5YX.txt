Figure 1: (a) ReLU mapping hli = max{0, gil}; (b) Convex outer approximation on (gil, hli); and (c)If P maps a vertex xP of the input, by convexifying the layer the rest of PQ is infeasible for xP .
Figure 2: Left: averages of the proposed Empirical UB and XOR-k lower bounds with probability95% compared with the Configuration UB and the actual number of regions reported in Serra et al.
Figure 3: Using the same representation as in Figure 1, we illustrate how the projected inequalities(21), (25), (28), and (29) define the convex outer approximation on (gll , hll).
