Figure 1: Different architectures used in our experiments.
Figure 2: Frames from the agent moving at random in a gridworld (outermost cells are walls,see Fig. 2(e)). In each image, the agent’s partial observation is on the left (agent and walls in black,empty spaces in white), the agent’s position and orientation are on the centre, and the predictedposition and orientation are on the right. The diamond-looking shapes result from flattening thebeliefs for each of the four possible orientations in the same cell.
Figure 3: Examples of agent observations for different environments.
Figure 5: Symmetry of the(x, y, θ ) prediction with theframe predictor in room.
Figure 4: Example predictions for terrain. In each im-age, ground truths are on the top, predictions on the bottom,(x, y, θ) (ground truth and predictions) on the left, and past(x, y, θ) on the right. Figs. 4(a) to 4(c) show examples of ac-curate (x, y, θ) predictions, Figs. 4(d) to 4(f) show examplesfor inaccurate (x, y, θ) predictions.
Figure 6: Example predictions for non teleport and teleport. Ground truths are on the top,predictions on the bottom, (x, y, θ) (ground truth and predictions) on the centre, object (x, y) on theright, and frame seen by the agent on the left.
Figure 7: Example predictions for two hallways. Ground truths are on the top, predictionson the bottom, (x, y, θ) (ground truth and predictions) on the centre, past (x, y, θ) on the right, andframe seen by the agent on the left.
