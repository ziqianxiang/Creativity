Figure 1: Document-level representations used in this paper. (a) Bi-HLSTM: the bidirectional hi-erarchical representation, which does not satisfy the uni-directionality constraint. (b) left-to-rightHLSTM (L-to-R-HLSTM): a uni-directional version of bi-HLSTM.
Figure 2: The general procedure of using maskedlanguage model to train any encoders. Note thatmasks are randomly generated. See text for moredetails.
