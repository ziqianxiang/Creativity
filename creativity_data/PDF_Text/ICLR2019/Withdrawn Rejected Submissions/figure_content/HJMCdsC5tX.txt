Figure 1: Periodicity detection methodsHowever, some issues such as multi-periodic signals, spectral leakage or presence of non-stationaryperiodicities are not addressed by the authors.
Figure 2: Illustration of spectral leakageSpectral leakage generates points with a spectral power higher than the threshold provided by the99% confidence method (Figure 2) and therefore generate imprecise periodicity hints. The autocor-relation might filter most of them but every imprecise periodicity hint increase the probability offalse positives, therefore it is interesting to reduce the number of periodicity hints in order to achievea higher precision score.
