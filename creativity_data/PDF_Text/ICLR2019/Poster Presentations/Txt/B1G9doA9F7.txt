Training a model to perform a task typically requires a large amount of data from the
domains in which the task will be applied. However, it is often the case that data are
abundant in some domains but scarce in others. Domain adaptation deals with the
challenge of adapting a model trained from a data-rich source domain to perform
well in a data-poor target domain. In general, this requires learning plausible
mappings between domains. CycleGAN is a powerful framework that efficiently
learns to map inputs from one domain to another using adversarial training and
a cycle-consistency constraint. However, the conventional approach of enforcing
cycle-consistency via reconstruction may be overly restrictive in cases where one or
more domains have limited training data. In this paper, we propose an augmented
cyclic adversarial learning model that enforces the cycle-consistency constraint via
an external task specific model, which encourages the preservation of task-relevant
content as opposed to exact reconstruction. We explore digit classification in a
low-resource setting in supervised, semi and unsupervised situation, as well as high
resource unsupervised. In low-resource supervised setting, the results show that our
approach improves absolute performance by 14% and 4% when adapting SVHN
to MNIST and vice versa, respectively, which outperforms unsupervised domain
adaptation methods that require high-resource unlabeled target domain. Moreover,
using only few unsupervised target data, our approach can still outperforms many
high-resource unsupervised models. Our model also outperforms on USPS to
MNIST and synthetic digit to SVHN for high resource unsupervised adaptation. In
speech domains, we similarly adopt a speech recognition model from each domain
as the task specific model. Our approach improves absolute performance of speech
recognition by 2% for female speakers in the TIMIT dataset, where the majority of
training samples are from male voices.
1	Introduction
Domain adaptation (Huang et al., 2007; Xue et al., 2008; Ben-David et al., 2010) aims to generalize
a model from source domain to a target domain. Typically, the source domain has a large amount
of training data, whereas the data are scarce in the target domain. This challenge is typically
addressed by learning a mapping between domains, which allows data from the source domain to
enrich the available data for training in the target domain. One way of learning such mappings is
through Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs Goodfellow et al., 2014) with cycle-consistency
constraint (CycleGAN Zhu et al., 2017), which enforces that mapping of an example from the source
to the target and then back to the source domain would result in the same example (and vice versa for
a target example). Due to this constraint, CycleGAN learns to preserve the ‘content’1 from the source
domain while only transferring the ‘style’ to match the distribution of the target domain. This is a
powerful constraint, and various works (Yi et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2017; Hoffman et al., 2018) have
demonstrated its effectiveness in learning cross domain mappings.
1Here the content refers to the invariant properties of the data with respect to a task. For example, in
image classification the semantic information of an image would be its class. Thus, different task on the same
data would result in different semantic information. In this paper we use content and semantic information
interchangeably.

Enforcing cycle-consistency is appealing as a technique for preserving semantic information of the
data with respect to a task, but implementing it through reconstruction may be too restrictive when
data are imbalanced across domains. This is because the reconstruction error encourages exact match
of samples from the reverse mapping, which may in turn encourage the forward-mapping to keep
the sample close to the original domain. Normally, the adversarial objectives would counter this
effect; however, when data from the target domain are scarce, it is very difficult to learn a powerful
discriminator that can capture meaningful properties of the target distribution. Therefore, the resulting
mappings learned is likely to be sub-optimal. Importantly, for the learned mapping to be meaningful,
it is not necessary to have the exact reconstruction. As long as the ‘semantic’ information is preserved
and the ‘style’ matches the corresponding distribution, it would be a valid mapping.
To address this issue, we propose an augmented cyclic adversarial learning model (ACAL) for domain
adaptation. In particular, we replace the reconstruction objective with a task specific model. The
model learns to preserve the ‘semantic’ information from the data samples in a particular domain by
minimizing the loss of the mapped samples for the task specific model. On the other hand, the task
specific model also serves as an additional source of information for the corresponding domain and
hence supplements the discriminator in that domain to facilitate better modeling of the distribution.
The task specific model can also be viewed as an implicit way of disentangling the information
essential to the task from the ‘style’ information that relates to the data distribution of different
domain. We show that our approach improves the performance by 40% as compared to the baseline
on digit domain adaptation. We improve the phoneme error rate by 〜5% on TIMIT dataset, when
adapting the model trained on one speech from one gender to the other.
1.1	Related Work
Our work is broadly related to domain adaptation using neural networks for both supervised and
unsupervised domain adaptation.
Supervised Domain Adaptation When labels are available in the target domain, a common
approach is to utilize the label information in target domain to minimize the discrepancy between
source and target domain (Hu et al., 2015; Tzeng et al., 2015; Gebru et al., 2017; Hoffman et al.,
2016; Gupta et al., 2016; Ge and Yu, 2017). For example, Hu et al. (2015) applies the marginal Fisher
analysis criteria and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) to minimize the distribution difference
between source and target domain. Tzeng et al. (2015) proposed to add a domain classifier that
predicts domain label of the inputs, with a domain confusion loss. Gebru et al. (2017) leverages
attributes by using attribute and class level classification loss with attribute consistent loss to fine-tune
the target model. Our method also employs models from both domains, however, our models are used
to assist adversarial learning for better learning of the target domain distribution. In addition, our final
model for supervised domain adaptation is obtained by training on data from target domain as well as
the transfered data from the source domain, rather than fine-tuning a source/target domain model.
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation More recently, various work have taken advantage of the
substantial generation capabilities of the GAN framework and applied them to domain adaptation (Liu
and Tuzel, 2016; Bousmalis et al., 2017; Yi et al., 2017; Tzeng et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2017; Hoffman
et al., 2018). However, most of these works focus on high-resource unsupervised domain adaptation,
which may be unsuitable for situations where the target domain data are limited. Bousmalis et al.
(2017) uses a GAN to adapt data from the source to target domain while simultaneously training
a classifier on both the source and adapted data. Our method also employs task specific models;
however, we use the models to augment the CycleGAN formulation. We show that having cycles
in both directions (i.e. from source to target and vice versa) is important in the case where the
target domain has limited data (see sec. 4). Tzeng et al. (2017) proposes adversarial discriminative
domain adaptation (ADDA), where adversarial learning is employed to match the representation
learned from the source and target domain. Our method also utilizes pre-trained model from source
domain, but we only implicitly match the representation distributions rather than explicitly enforcing
representational similarity. Cycle-consistent adversarial domain adaptation (CyCADA Hoffman
et al., 2018) is perhaps the most similar work to our own. This approach uses both `1 and semantic
consistency to enforce cycle-consistency. An important difference in our work is that we also include
another cycle that starts from the target domain. This is important because, if the target domain is of
low resource, the adaptation from source to target may fail due to the difficulty in learning a good

discriminator in the target domain. Almahairi et al. (2018) also suggests to improve CycleGAN by
explicitly enforcing content consistency and style adaptation, by augmenting the cyclic adversarial
learning to hidden representation of domains.
Our model is different from recent cyclic adversarial learning, due to implicit learning of content
and style representation through an auxiliary task, which is more suitable for low resource domains.
Using classification to assist GAN training has also been explored previously (Springenberg, 2015;
Sricharan et al., 2017; Kumar et al., 2017). Springenberg (2015) proposed CatGAN, where the
discriminator is converted to a multi-class classifier. We extend this idea to any task specific model,
including speech recognition task, and use this model to preserve task specific information regarding
the data.We also propose that the definition of task model can be extended to unsupervised tasks,such
as language or speech modeling in domains, meaning augmented unsupervised domain adaptation.
2	Preliminaries
2.1	Generative Adversarial Network
To learn the true data distribution Pdata (X) in a nonparametric way, Goodfellow et al. (2014)
proposed the generative adversarial network (GAN). In this framework, a discriminator network D(x)
learns to discriminate between the data produced by a generator network G(z) and the data sampled
from the true data distribution Pdata (X), whereas the generator models the true data distribution
by learning to confuse the discriminator. Under certain assumptions (Goodfellow et al., 2014), the
generator would learn the true data distribution when the game reaches equilibrium. Training of GAN
is in general done by alternately optimizing the following objective for D and G.
minmax V (G,D) = Ex 〜Pdata (X) [log D(X)I + Ez 〜Pz(Z) [log (1 - D(G(Z))]	⑴
GD
2.2	CYCLEGAN
CycleGAN (Zhu et al., 2017) extends this framework to multiple domains, PS(X) and PT (X), while
learning to map samples back and forth between them. Adversarial learning is applied such that the
result mapping from GS7→T will match the target distribution PT (X), and similarly for the reverse
mapping from GT 7→S . This is accomplished by the following adversarial objectives:
Ladv (GS→T, DT) = Ex〜PT(X) [log DT(X)] + Ex〜PS (X) [log (I - DT(GS-T(X))]	⑵
Ladv (GT→S, DS) = Ex〜PS (X) [log DS (X)] + Ex〜PT (X) [log (I - DS (GT-S (X))]	⑶
CycleGAN also introduces cycle-consistency, which enforces that each mapping is able to invert the
other. In the original work, this is achieved by including the following reconstruction objective:
LCyC(GS→T, GT→S) = Ex〜PS(X) [kGT→S(GS→T(X)) - Xk1]
+ Ex〜PT(X) [kGS→T(GT→S(X))- Xk1 ]	(4)
Learning the CycleGAN model involves optimizing a weighted combination of the above objectives
2, 3 and 4.

3	Augmented Cyclic Adversarial Learning (ACAL)
Enforcing cycle-consistency using a reconstruction objective (e.g. eq. 4) may be too restrictive
and potentially results in sub-optimal mapping functions. This is because the learning dynamics of
CycleGAN balance the two contrastive forces. The adversarial objective encourages the mapping
functions to generate samples that are close to the true distribution. At the same time, the reconstruc-
tion objective encourages identity mapping. Balancing these objectives may works well in the case
where both domains have a relatively large number of training samples. However, problems may
arise in case of domain adaptation, where data within the target domain are relatively sparse.
Let PS (X) and PT (X) denote source and target domain distributions, respectively, and samples
from PT (X) are limited. In this case, it will be difficult for the discriminator DT to model the actual
distribution PT (X). A discriminator model with sufficient capacity will quickly overfit and the
resulting DT will act like delta function on the sample points from PT (X). Attempts to prevent this
by limiting the capacity or using regularization may easily induce over-smoothing and under-fitting
such that the probability outputs of DT are only weakly sensitive to the mapped samples. In both
cases, the influence of the reconstruction objective should begin to outweigh that of the adversarial
objective, thereby encouraging an identity mapping. More generally, even if we are are able to obtain
a reasonable discriminator DT, the support of the distribution learned through it would likely to be
small due to limited data. Therefore, the learning signal GS7→T receive from DT would be limited.
To sum up, limited data within PT (X) would make it less likely that the discriminator will encourage
meaningful cross domain mappings.
The root of the above issue in domain adaptation is two fold. First, exact reconstruction is a too strong
objective for enforcing cycle-consistency. Second, learning a mapping function to a particular domain
which solely depends on the discriminator for that domain is not sufficient. To address these two
problems, we propose to 1) use a task specific model to enforce the cycle-consistency constraint, and
2) use the same task specific model in addition to the discriminator to train more meaningful cross
domain mappings. In more detail, let MS and MT be the task specific models trained on domains
PS (X, Y ) and PT (X, Y ), and Ltask denotes the task specific loss. Our cycle-consistent objective is
then:
LRCAL(G S-T, Gt→S , MS, MT ) = E(x,y)〜PS (X,Y) [Ltask (MS (Gt→S (Gs→T (x)), y)]
+ E(x,y)〜PT (X,Y) [Ltask (MT(GS→T (GT→ S (X)),y)]	(5)
Here, Ltask enforces cycle-consistency by requiring that the reverse mappings preserve the semantic
information of the original sample. Importantly, this constraint is less strict than when using
reconstruction, because now as long as the content matches that of the original sample, the incurred
loss will not increase. (Some style consistency is implicitly enforced since each model M is trained
on data within a particular domain.) This is a much looser constraint than having consistency in the
original data space, and thus we refer to this as the relaxed cycle-consistency objective.
To address the second issue, we augment the adversarial objective with corresponding objective:
LACAL-Supervised(Gt→S, DS, MS) = Ex〜PS(X) [lθg(DS(x))]
+ Ex 〜PT (X) [log(I- DS (GT→S (X)))]
+ E(x,y)〜PS (x,y) [Ltask (MS (x,y))]
+ E(x,y)〜PT (x,y) [Ltask (MS (GT→S (X),y))]⑹
LACAL-Supervised(GS→T,Dt,Mt) = Ex〜PT(X) [log(DT(X))]
+ Ex〜PS(X) [log(1 - DT(GS→t(x)))]
+ E(x,y)^P>T (x,y) [Ltask (MT(X,y))]
+ E^(x,y)^PSS (x,y) [Ltask (MT (GS-T (X),y))]	(7)
Similar to adversarial training, we optimize the above objective by maximizing DS (DT) and
minimizing GT 7→S (GS7→T) and MS(MT). With the new terms, learning of the mapping functions
G get assists from both the discriminator and the task specific model. The task specific model learns
to capture conditional probability distribution PS(Y |X) (PT (Y |X)), that also preserves information
regarding PS(X) (PT (X)). This conditional information is different than the information captured
through the discriminator DS (DT). The difference is that the model is only required to preserve

useful information regarding X respect to predicting Y , for modeling the conditional distribution,
which makes learning the conditional model a much easier problem. In addition, the conditional
model mediates the influence of data that the discriminator does not have access to (Y ), which should
further assist learning of the mapping functions GT 7→S (GS7→T).
In case of unsupervised domain adaptation, when there is no information of target conditional
probability distribution PT(Y |X), we propose to use source model MS to estimate PT(Y |X) through
adversarial learning, i.e. PT(Y|X) ≈ Ex〜PT(X)[Ms(Gs→t(x))]. Therefore, proposed model can
be extended to unsupervised domain adaptation, with the corresponding modified objectives:
LACAL-unsupervised(GT→S, DS, MS) = Ex〜PS(X) [log(DS(X))]
+	Ex〜PT(X) [log(1 - DS(GT-S(X)))]
+	E(x,y)〜PS(x,y) [Ltask (MS(x,y))]	(8)

+	E(x,y)〜PS (x,y) [Ltask (MT (GS→T (x), y))]	⑼
To further extend this approach to semi-supervised domain adaptation, both supervised and unsuper-
vised objectives for labeled and unlabeled target samples are used interchangeably, as explained in
Algorithm 1.
4	Experiments
In this section, we evaluate our proposed model on domain adaptation for visual and speech recog-
nition. We continue the convention of referring to the data domains as ‘source’ and ‘target’, where
target denotes the domain with either limited or unlabeled training data. Visual domain adaptation is
evaluated using the MNIST dataset (M) Lecun et al. (1998), Street View House Numbers (SVHN)
datasets (S) Netzer et al. (2011), USPS (U) (Hull, 1994), MNISTM (MM) and Synthetic Dig-
its (SD) (Ganin and Lempitsky, 2014). Adaptation on speech is evaluated on the domain of gender
within the TIMIT dataset Garofolo et al. (1993), which contains broadband 16kHz recordings of 6300
utterances (5.4 hours) of phonetically-balanced speech. The male/female ratio of speakers across
train/validation/test sets is approximately 70% to 30%. Therefore, we treat male speech as the source
domain and female speech as the low resource target domain.

4.1	Model Ablations
To get an idea of the contribution from each component of our model, in this section we perform a
series of ablations and present the results in Table 1. We perform these ablations by treating SVHN
as the source domain and MNIST as the target domain. We down sample the MNIST training data
so only 10 samples per class are available during training, denoted as MNIST-(10), which is only
0.17% of full training data. The testing performance is calculated on the full MNIST test set. We
use a modified LeNet for all experiments in this ablation. The Modified LeNet consists of two
convolutional layers with 20 and 50 channels, followed by a dropout layer and two fully connected
layers of 50 and 10 dimensionality.
There are various ways that one may
utilize cycle-consistency or adversarial
training to do domain adaptation from
components of our model. One way is to
use adversarial training on the target do-
main to ensure matching of distribution
of adapted data, and use the task spe-
cific model to ensure the ‘content’ of the
data from the source domain is preserved.
This is the model described in Bousmalis
et al. (2017), except their model is orig-
inally unsupervised. This model is de-
noted as S → T in Table 1. It is also
interesting to examine the importance
of the double cycle, which is proposed
in Zhu et al. (2017) and adopted in our
work. Theoretically, one cycle would be
sufficient to learn the mapping between
domains; therefore, we also investigate
the performance of one cycle only mod-
els, where one direction would be from
source to target and then back, and sim-
ilarly for the other direction. These mod-
els are denoted as (S→T→S)-One Cycle
and (T→S→T)-One Cycle in Table 1, re-
spectively. To test the effectiveness of
Table 1: Ablation study results from SVHN (Source) to
MNIST (Target). See text for more details. Note: The
MNIST domain is limited to only 10 samples per class
(0.17% of full training dataset), denoted as MNIST-(10).
Experiments were performed 4 times with different ran-
dom sampling for MNIST.

the relaxed cycle-consistency (eq. 5) and augmented adversarial loss (eq. 6 and 7), we also test one
cycle models while progressively adding these two losses. Interestingly, the one cycle relaxed and
one cycle augmented models are similar to the model proposed in Hoffman et al. (2018) when their
model performs mapping from source to target domain and then back. The difference is that their
model is unsupervised and includes more losses at different levels.
As can be seen from Table 1, the simple conditional model performed surprisingly well as compared
to more complicated cyclic counterparts. This may be attributed to the reduced complexity, since
it only needs to learn one set of mapping. As expected, the single cycle performance is poor when
the target domain is of limited data due to inefficient learning of discriminator in the target domain
(see section 3). When we change the cycle to the other direction, where there are abundant data in
the target domain, the performance improves, but is still worse than the simple one without cycle.
This is because the adaptation mapping (i.e. GS7→T) is only learned via the generated samples from
GT7→S, which likely deviate from the real examples in practice. This observation also suggests
that it would be beneficial to have cycles in both directions when applying the cycle-consistency
constraint, since then both mappings can be learned via real examples. The trends get reversed when
we are using relaxed implementation of cycle-consistency from the reconstruction error with the task
specific losses. This is because now the power of the task specific model is crucial to preserve the
content of the data after the reverse mapping. When the source domain dataset is sufficiently large,
the cycle-consistency is preserved. As such, the resulting learned mapping functions would preserve
meaningful semantics of the data while transferring the styles to the target domain, and vice versa. In
addition, it is clear that augmenting the discriminator with task specific loss is helpful for learning
adaptations. Furthermore, the information added from the task specific model is clearly beneficial
for improving the adaptation performance, without this none of the models outperform the baseline

model, where no adaptation is performed. Last but not least, it is also clear from the results that using
task specific model improves the overall adaptation performance.
To further evaluate the effectiveness of using task-specific loss with two cycles for low-resource
unsupervised domain adaptation scenario, we comapre our model with CyCADA (Hoffman et al.,
2018), and when no reconstruction loss is used in CyCADA, referred as "CyCADA (Relaxed)".
The latter resembles the (S → T → S)-ACAL in Table 1, but with a different semantic loss. As
shown in Figure 2, CyCADA model and its relaxed variation fail to learn a good adaptation, where
target domain contains few unlabaled samples per class. Additionally, CyCADA models show high
instability in low-resource situation. As described in section 1.1, instability is an expected behvaiour
of CyCADA when having limited target data, because the source to target cycle fails to preserve
consistency, due to weak target domain discriminator. However, ACAL model indicates stable and
consistent performance, due to proper use of source classifier to enforce consistency, rather than
relying on target and source discriminators.
4.2	Visual Domain Adaptation
In this section, we experiment on domain adaptation for the task of digit recognition. In each
experiment, we select one domain (MNIST, USPS, MNISTM, SVHN, Synthetic Digits) to be the
target. We conduct three types of domain adaptation, i.e. low-resource supervised, high-resource
unsupervised, and low-resource semi-supervised adaptation. The evaluation results are based on not
using any data augmentation.
Low-resource supervised adaptation: In this setting, we sub-sample the target to contain only a
few labeled samples per class, and using the other full dataset as the source domain. In this setting, no
unlabeled sample is used. Comparison with recent low resource domain adaptation, FADA (Motiian
et al., 2017) for MNIST, USPS, and SVHN adaptation is shown in Figure 3. To provide more
baselines, we also compared with model trained only on limited target data, and on combination of
both labeled source and limited target domains. As shown in Figure 4, ACAL outperforms FADA
and two other baselines in all adaptations.
High-resource unsupervised adaptation; Here, we use the whole target domain with no label.
Evaluation results on all adaptation directions are presented in Table 2 and Table 7 (Appendix A). It
is evident that ACAL model performance is on par with the state of the art unsupervised approaches,
and outperforms on MNIST→USPS and Syn-Digits→SVHN. It is worth mentioning that Shu et al.

(2018) improved their VADA adversarial model using natural gradient as teacher-student training,
which is not directly comparable to adversarial approaches. Moreover, the source-only baseline
of (Shu et al., 2018) is stronger than the reported unsupervised approaches, as well as our baseline.
Low-resource semi-supervised adaptation: We also evaluate the performance of ACAL algo-
rithm when there are limited labeled and unlabeled target samples in Table 6 (Appendix A). In case
of MNIST→USPS, our model outperforms many high-resource unsupervised domain adaptation in
Table 2 by using < 1000 unlabeled samples only.
4.3	Speech Domain Adaptation
We also apply our proposed model to domain adaptation in speech recognition. We use TIMIT
dataset, where the male to female speaker ratio is about 7 : 3 and thus we choose the data subset from
male speakers as the source and the subset from female speakers as the target domain. We evaluate
performance on the standard TIMIT test set and use phoneme error rate (PER) as the evaluation
metric. Spectrogram representation of audio is chosen for model evaluation. As demonstrated by
Hosseini-Asl et al. (2018), multi-discriminator training significantly impacts adaptation performance.
Therefore, we used the multi-discriminator architecture as the discriminator for the adversarial loss
in our evaluation. Our task-specific model is a pre-trained speech recognition model within each
domain in this set of experiments.
The result are shown in Table 3. We observe significant performance improvements over the baseline
model as well as comparable or better performance as compared to previous methods. It is interesting
to note that the performance of the proposed model on the adapted male (M → F) almost matches
the baseline model performance, where the model is trained on true female speech. In addition, the
performance gap in this case is significant as compared to other methods, which suggests the adapted
distribution is indeed close to the true target distribution. In addition, when combined with more data,
our model further outperforms the baseline by a noticeable margin.

5	Conclusion and Future Work
In this paper, we propose to use augmented cycle-consistency adversarial learning for domain adapta-
tion and introduce a task specific model to facilitate learning domain related mappings. We enforce
cycle-consistency using a task specific loss instead of the conventional reconstruction objective. Addi-
tionally, we use the task specific model as an additional source of information for the discriminator in
the corresponding domain. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach by evaluating
on two domain adaptation tasks, and in both cases we achieve significant performance improvement
as compared to the baseline.

By extending the definition of task-specific model to unsupervised learning, such as reconstruction
loss using autoencoder, or self-supervision, our proposed method would work on all settings of
domain adaptation. Such unsupervised task can be speech modeling using wavenet (van den Oord
et al., 2016), or language modeling using recurrent or transformer networks (Radford et al., 2018).

Appendix A Digit Domain Adaptation Analysis
In this section, We evaluate domain adaptation for MNIST—SVHN for comparison with CyCleGAN, as well as
the relaxed version of the cycle-consistent objective (Relaxed-Cyc, see eq. 5 in section 3). For the former, `1
reconstruction loss is replaced with the model loss in order to encouraging cycle-consistency. We also experiment
with two different task specific models M: specifically, DenseNet (Huang et al., 2017, representing a relatively
complex architecture) and a modified LeNet (representing a relatively simple architecture, see section 4.1).
Table 4 and 5 show the results on augmenting the low resource MNIST and SVHN with the complementary high
resource domain. This approach improves test performance of the target classifier by a large margin, compared
to when trained only using the target domain data. We observe that training a more complicated deep model for
the target domain weakens this effect. As shown in Table 4, using DenseNet as a classifier on MNIST (target)
achieves ≈ 24% lower test classification accuracy than using a variant of LeNet. This difference likely reflects
differences in the two architectures’ degree of overfitting. Overfitting will produce a false gradient signal during
cycle adversarial learning (when classifying the adapted source examples). Based on this observation, we use a
comparatively simpler LeNet architecture with SVHN as the target domain (see Table 5). Using our proposed
approach, SVHN test performance improves by 27% over domain adaptation using CycleGAN. We also include
some qualitative results when performing domain adaptation from SVHN (source) to MNIST (target), as shown
in Figure 5. We also compare the performance with different number of labeled target samples in Figure 4. It
indicates the improvement on generalization performance of target model using Augmented cyclic adaptation,
with variable labeled target domain on MNIST and SVHN datasets. Evaluation of semi supervised adaptation is
presented in Table 6.

per class (MNIST-(10)), the experiments was performed 4 times with different random sampling for
MNIST.

Figure 5: Qualitative comparison of domain adaptation for experimental models. Each column
illustrates the mapping performed by each of the models from the original SVHN image (source
domain) to MNIST (target domain, 10 labeled samples per class in total). It can be seen that the
augmented cycle-consistent model is able to preserve most of the semantic information, while still
approximately match the target distribution.

Appendix B	Speech Domain Models Implementation
In this section, the detail of CycleGAN and speech model architectures are explained. The size of the convolution
layer are denoted by the tuple (C, F, T, SF, ST), where C, F, T, SF, and ST denote number of channels, filter size
in frequency dimension, filter size in time dimension, stride in frequency dimension and stride in time dimension
respectively. Architecture of CycleGAN model is based on Zhu et al. (2017) with modifications mentioned
in Hosseini-Asl et al. (2018). Both generators in CycleGAN are based on U-net Ronneberger et al. (2015)
architecture with 4 layers of convolution of sizes (8,3,3,1,1), (16,3,3,1,1), (32,3,3,2,2), (64,3,3,2,2), followed by
corresponding deconvolution layers. To increase stability of adversarial training, as proposed by Hosseini-Asl
et al. (2018), the discriminator output is modified to predict a single scalar as real/fake probability. Discriminator
has 4 convolution layers of sizes (8,4,4,2,2), (16,4,4,2,2), (32,4,4,2,2), (64,4,4,2,2), as default kernel and stride
sizes in Hosseini-Asl et al. (2018). ASR model is implemented based on Zhou et al. (2017), which is trained
only with maximum likelihood. The model includes one convolutional layer of size (32,41,11,2,2), and five
residual convolution blocks of size (32,7,3,1,1), (32,5,3,1,1), (32,3,3,1,1), (64,3,3,2,1), (64,3,3,1,1) respectively.
Convolutional layers are followed by 4 layers of bidirectional GRU RNNs with 1024 hidden units per direction
per layer. Finally, a fully-connected hidden layer of size 1024 is used as the output layer.
