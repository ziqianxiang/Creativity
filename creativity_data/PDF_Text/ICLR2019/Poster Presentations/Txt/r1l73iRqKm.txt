In open-domain dialogue intelligent agents should exhibit the use of knowledge,
however there are few convincing demonstrations of this to date. The most popu-
lar sequence to sequence models typically “generate and hope” generic utterances
that can be memorized in the weights of the model when mapping from input ut-
terance(s) to output, rather than employing recalled knowledge as context. Use of
knowledge has so far proved difficult, in part because of the lack of a supervised
learning benchmark task which exhibits knowledgeable open dialogue with clear
grounding. To that end we collect and release a large dataset with conversations
directly grounded with knowledge retrieved from Wikipedia. We then design ar-
chitectures capable of retrieving knowledge, reading and conditioning on it, and
finally generating natural responses. Our best performing dialogue models are
able to conduct knowledgeable discussions on open-domain topics as evaluated
by automatic metrics and human evaluations, while our new benchmark allows
for measuring further improvements in this important research direction.
1	Introduction
Arguably, one of the key goals of AI, and the ultimate the goal of natural language research, is
for humans to be able to talk to machines. In order to get close to this goal, machines must mas-
ter a number of skills: to be able to comprehend language, employ memory to retain and recall
knowledge, to reason about these concepts together, and finally output a response that both fulfills
functional goals in the conversation while simultaneously being captivating to their human speak-
ing partner. The current state-of-the-art approaches, sequence to sequence models of various kinds
(Sutskever et al., 2014; Vinyals & Le, 2015; Serban et al., 2016; Vaswani et al., 2017) attempt to
address some of these skills, but generally suffer from an inability to bring memory and knowledge
to bear; as indicated by their name, they involve encoding an input sequence, providing limited
reasoning by transforming their hidden state given the input, and then decoding to an output. To
converse intelligently on a given topic, a speaker clearly needs knowledge of that subject, and it is
our contention here that more direct knowledge memory mechanisms need to be employed. In this
work we consider setups where this can be naturally measured and built.
We consider the task of open-domain dialogue, where two speakers conduct open-ended chit-chat
given an initial starting topic, and during the course of the conversation the topic can broaden or
focus on related themes. During such conversations, an interlocutor can glean new information and
personal points of view from their speaking partner, while providing similarly themselves. This is a
challenging task as it requires several components not found in many standard models. We design
a set of architectures specifically for this goal that combine elements of Memory Network architec-
tures (Sukhbaatar et al., 2015) to retrieve knowledge and read and condition on it, and Transformer
architectures (Vaswani et al., 2017) to provide state-of-the-art text representations and sequence
models for generating outputs, which we term Transformer Memory Networks.
As, to our knowledge, no public domain dataset of requisite scale exists, we build a supervised
dataset of human-human conversations using crowd-sourced workers, first crowd-sourcing 1365
diverse discussion topics and then conversations involving 201, 999 utterances about them. Each

topic is connected to Wikipedia, and one of the humans (the wizard) is asked to link the knowledge
they use to sentences from existing articles. In this way, we have both a natural way to train a
knowledgeable conversation agent, by employing a memory component that can recall and ground
on this existing text, and a natural way to evaluate models that we build, by assessing their ability at
locating and using such knowledge.
Our Transformer Memory Network architectures, both in retrieval and generative versions, are tested
in this setup using both automatic metrics and human evaluations. We show their ability to execute
engaging knowledgeable conversations with humans, compared to a number of baselines such as
standard Memory Networks or Transformers. Our new benchmark, publicly in ParlAI (http://
ParLai/projects/wizard_of_wikipedia/), aims to encourage and measure further improvements
in this important research direction.
2	Related Work
Many existing dialogue tasks do not study the use of knowledge explicitly. For example, popular
chit-chat datasets such as Open-Subtitles (Vinyals & Le, 2015), Persona-Chat (Zhang et al., 2018)
and Twitter (Sordoni et al., 2015) have tested the ability of sequence-to-sequence models that attend
over the recent dialogue history, but do not attempt to recall long-term knowledge beyond encoding
it directly into the weights of the feed-forward network.
In the area of goal-directed dialogue, separate from open domain chit-chat, such as airline (El Asri
et al., 2017) or restaurant booking (Henderson et al., 2014; Wen et al., 2016; Bordes et al., 2017),
knowledge conditioning is typically employed by allowing access to a database through API calls
or otherwise. In contrast, our work investigates unstructured knowledge across a large, diverse set
of topics potentially spanning all of Wikipedia.
In question answering one does not produce a dialogue response based on a conversation history,
but a factual answer based on a question. In that case, it is clear that retrieving and conditioning
knowledge is vital. For example, in SQuAD neural models have been developed that attend to
a given paragraph from Wikipedia to answer questions (Rajpurkar et al., 2016), or Open-SQuAD
which extends this to answering without being given the paragraph, instead performing retrieval
over the entirety of Wikipedia (Chen et al., 2017). Recently, the QuAC dataset investigates similar
themes, but as a sequence of questions and answers in dialogue form instead (Choi et al., 2018).
In this work we do not address question answering, but focus on natural human dialogues which
contain a diverse set of utterances, not just questions and answers.
The closest work to ours lies in the area of non-goal directed dialogue incorporating knowledge. The
work of Dodge et al. (2016) employed Memory Networks to perform dialogue discussing movies
in terms of recommendation and open-ended discussion from Reddit, conditioning on a structured
knowledge base. Zhou et al. (2018) also links Reddit to structured knowledge. Both Parthasarathi
& Pineau (2018) and Ghazvininejad et al. (2018) use unstructured text instead, as we do: the former
to discuss news articles using Wikipedia summaries as knowledge, and the latter to discuss local
businesses in two-turn dialogues using Foursquare tips as knowledge. Ghazvininejad et al. (2018)
uses an extended Encoder-Decoder where the decoder is provided with an encoding of the context
along with the external knowledge encoding. Neither involves dialogue authored with the given
knowledge, so it is unclear when knowledge is useful or not. In contrast, in our task, we know the
Wikipedia articles and sentences that ground crowdworkers dialogues. Model-wise, Parthasarathi
& Pineau (2018) uses a Bag-of-Words Memory Network type fact encoder and an RNN decoder.
Our work compares Memory Networks (Sukhbaatar et al., 2015) and Transformers which have been
shown to be on-par or superior to RNN encoder-decoders (Vaswani et al., 2017), and develops
an architecture that combines these approaches. Concurrently with our work Moghe et al. (2018)
proposed a dataset based on the closed domain of movie chats. Our paper shows models working on
full multi-turn dialogue in an open-domain setting, which to our knowledge was not shown before.
3	Wizard of Wikipedia
We consider the following general open-domain dialogue setting: two participants engage in chit-
chat, with one of the participants selecting a beginning topic, and during the conversation the topic
2

is allowed to naturally change. The two participants, however, are not quite symmetric: one will
play the role of a knowledgeable expert (which we refer to as the wizard) while the other is a curious
learner (the apprentice).
Apprentice At each stage of the conversation the apprentice talks to the wizard freely, playing
the role of a curious learner, eager to chat. Their goal is to go into depth about a chosen topic that
interests themselves or their partner, while keeping the conversation engaging and fun. Note that the
instruction to delve deeply into a topic makes this different to more “shallow” chit-chat tasks. In this
task the use of knowledge is emphasized more.
Wizard The wizard is given the following instructions: “You have just met the other person, who
seems quite curious, and you are eager to discuss a topic with them!” Their goal is to inform their
conversation partner about a topic that one of them will choose. Crucially, the wizard has access
to an information retrieval system that shows them paragraphs from Wikipedia possibly relevant to
the conversation, which are unobserved by the apprentice. Before each conversation turn the wizard
can read these paragraphs and then potentially base their next reply on that observed knowledge.
Note, the wizard is particularly instructed not to simply parrot this knowledge, but to use it to craft
a relevant reply, and to present any relevant knowledge in a fun and engaging way, if possible.
Conversation Flow The flow of the conversation thus takes place as follows.
1.	Either the wizard or apprentice is picked to choose the topic and speak first. The other
player receives the topic information, and the conversation begins.
2.	When the apprentice sends the wizard a message, the wizard is shown relevant knowledge
(described below), and chooses a relevant sentence in order to construct a response, or else
chooses the no sentence used option.
3.	The Wizard responds to the apprentice basing their response on their chosen sentence.
4.	The conversation repeats until one of the conversation partners ends the chat (after a mini-
mum of 4 or 5 turns each, randomly chosen beforehand).
After collecting data of such wizard-apprentice conversations between humans, the goal is to then
replace the human wizard with a learned agent that will speak to a human apprentice instead, similar
to the procedure in Wizard of Oz experiments (Bernsen et al., 2012).
Topics We crowd-sourced a set of 1365 natural, open-domain dialogue topics, each linked to a
Wikipedia article. These include diverse topics such as commuting, Gouda cheese, music festivals,
podcasts, bowling, and Arnold Schwarzenegger.
Knowledge Retrieval At each step of the dialogue the wizard has access to a set of passages of
knowledge which may be relevant to the given dialogue context. While this is a potentially learnable
part of the model, we required for this to be fixed so that we could present the results to the annotator
when collecting the dataset. We thus used exactly the same retriever that is commonly used for the
Open-SQuAD dataset in Chen et al. (2017). It uses a simple inverted index lookup followed by
term vector model scoring. Articles and queries are compared as TF-IDF weighted bag-of-word and
n-gram vectors, using the hashing trick. We retrieve the top 7 articles (first paragraph only) for the
last two turns of dialogue (by wizard and apprentice) and the article (first 10 sentences only) for the
original topic, and present these articles to the wizard as knowledge context, along with their titles.
Note that while this system is used to build the dataset, a superior method can in principle be learned
and used by a model at test time.
Knowledge Selection and Response Generation During data collection, the wizard can click on
any of the retrieved article titles in the dialogue UI to expand that article, at which point they can
click on a sentence that is most relevant to the response they want to make (only one article, and one
sentence can be selected on any turn, for simplicity). If they see no relevant article or sentence they
can choose no sentence used instead. The wizard then enters their response to the apprentice. An
image of the Wizard’s UI is shown in Appendix A.1.

Final Dialogue Dataset The final dialogue dataset we collect consists of 22,311 dialogues with
201,999 turns, which we divide into 166,787 for train, 17,715 for validation, and 17,497 for test.
The test set is split into two subsets, Test Seen and Test Unseen. Test Seen contains 533 overlapping
topics with the training set with new dialogues about those topics. Test Unseen consists of 58
topics never seen before in train or validation. Overall data statistics can be found in Table 1, and
further statistics and examples of collected conversations in Appendix A.2. We observe wizards and
apprentices both asking and answering questions, and providing each other with a mixture of facts
and personal feelings during their general discussion.
4	Models
In this work we consider learning dialogue models to replace the wizard in our learning tasks, i.e. the
knowledgeable speaker. The dialogue model thus can have access to a knowledge source, in this case
Wikipedia, to ground the conversation with. We thus develop extensions of the Memory Network
(Sukhbaatar et al., 2015) and Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) models that can (i) retrieve from a
large memory relevant information conditioned on the dialogue history, (ii) carefully read and attend
over the retrieved set of knowledge, and then (iii) generate the next dialogue utterance. This model
is then used consecutively on each turn to form an entire dialogue with a user.
We develop two classes of models capable of leveraging knowledge: (i) retrieval models that produce
an output among a set of candidate responses (the set of utterances from the training set); and (ii)
generative models that generate word-by-word (using a beam).
The input to either model is the same: at each dialogue turn where the model is intended to make
a response, it is given the current dialogue context x1, . . . , xt of t dialogue turns, where x1 is al-
ways the initial starting topic (e.g. “Kurt Cobain”), and the remaining turns swap between the two
speakers. The goal at each stage is to output the next utterance xt+1.
Knowledge Retrieval We assume a large knowledge base (memory) m1, . . . , mN which is hier-
archically organized into documents consisting of paragraphs and sentences. As it is infeasible for
current neural attention techniques to operate on this scale, we use standard information retrieval
(IR) techniques (c = IR(x, m)) as a first step to return a smaller set of candidates mc1 , . . . , mcK for
fine-grained selection.
In our experiments, we use the IR system provided to the human annotators during dataset creation,
detailed in Section 3. The retriever operates on the topic (x1) and the last two turns (xt and xt-1)
if they exist, effectively calling the IR system three times with three different queries. Empirically,
this provided better performance compared to merging into one query, likely because it can address
quite different topics. We retrieve the top 7 articles (first paragraph only) for each lookup and then
flatten all the results into separate sentences (i.e. remove the organization of sentences belonging to
articles), but prepend every sentence with its article title. In this way the candidates mc1 , . . . , mcK
given to the neural model in the next stage can be attended to independently without having to deal
with hierarchical issues.
Knowledge Attention We use an attention mechanism to perform fine-grained selection of which
knowledge sentences will be used to produce the next turn of dialogue. Each sentence in the memory
is independently encoded with a Transformer encoder (Vaswani et al., 2017), and the same Trans-

dates from Wikipedia. Dialogue Context and Knowledge are encoded using a shared encoder. In the

former is used to encode the dialogue context x. We then perform standard dot-product attention
between the memory candidates and the dialogue context.
Utterance Prediction Given the hidden state derived from the memory attention process described
above, the final stage is to predict the output utterance that will form the next dialogue turn.
We consider different variants of the two stages above, knowledge attention and utterance prediction,
when considering retrieval and generative variants of our models. We will now detail these in turn.
4.1	Retrieval Transformer Memory Network
This model encodes each knowledge sentence mc1 , . . . , mcK and the dialogue context x with a
Transformer, as described above. The final input encoding is calculated by performing dot-product
attention over enc(mc1), . . . , enc(mcK) and adding the resulting weighted sum of these vectors to
enc(x) to get the representation repLHS(mc1 , . . . , mcK , x). The candidate responses r1, . . . , rL are
encoded with a separate Transformer to get repRHS (ri) for each i. We choose as a response r` where
` =arg max rePLHS(mci, …，mcκ , X) ∙ rePRHSm)
i∈{l,...,L} IIrePLHS (mcι ,...,mcκ ,x)k2	IIrePRHS (ri) k 2 .
The model is trained to minimize the cross-entroPy loss, where the negative candidates for each
examPle are the resPonses to the other examPles in the batch (Henderson et al., 2017).
4.2	Generative Transformer Memory Network
We consider two versions: a Two-stage and an End-to-end version. Both models find the most rel-
evant Piece of knowledge mbest, and then Perform an encoding steP by concatenating it with the
dialogue context, allowing the decoder to attend over both the knowledge and dialogue when formu-
lating its resPonse. We emPloy a beam search of 5 to select our best resPonse. All generative models
emPloy BPE encoding (Sennrich et al., 2016), which we found effective at enabling generators to
coPy rare words from WikiPedia sentences (Fan et al., 2018).
In the End-to-end version, a shared Transformer encoder is used to encode all candidates mci and
the dialogue history. The encoded candidates are flattened into vectors using the normalization from
Cer et al. (2018) (summing, and normalizing by the square root of the sentence length in order to
balance short and long sentences) to Produce an attention Prediction over the memory. The full
sequence encoding of the single highest selected knowledge mbest is concatenated with the encoding
of the dialogue, and Passed into a Transformer decoder. An illustration of our End-to-end model
is shown in Figure 1. We train the model to minimize the negative log-likelihood of the resPonse
utterance. We can add additional suPervision by forcing the knowledge selection to correctly choose
the same knowledge candidate as the human wizard in the training set by adding an additional cross-
entroPy loss over the knowledge attention, modulated by a weight λ:
L
(1 - λ)LNLL + λLknowledge .
In the Two-stage version, we emPloy two seParately trained models for each of these two tasks,
knowledge selection and utterance Prediction. As the knowledge selection steP creates a hard deci-

sion influencing the output of the generator, we find maximizing the performance of this component
to be vital. We can also improve performance of the decoder by employing knowledge dropout
(K.D.), wherein we artificially prevent the model from attending to knowledge a fraction of the time
during training. We find this helps the generator be more resilient to errors at the knowledge se-
lection stage, and makes training faster. K. D. is a novel technique we propose here, however it is
similar to many other dropout techniques, e.g. feature dropout used in Wu et al. (2017).
5	Experiments
We describe each of our experimental setups and results. We first investigate the ability of our mod-
els to select knowledge appropriately, and then consider the full task of dialogue with knowledge.
5.1	Knowledge Selection Task
Before looking at the full Wizard dialogue task, we assess the ability of models to predict the knowl-
edge selected by human wizards in the dataset given the dialogue history. This will inform us of the
feasibility of this task and the best models to use in a two-stage architecture. We compare Transform-
ers against various baselines including a random baseline; an Information Retrieval (IR) baseline,
which uses simple word overlap; and a Bag-of-Words Memory Network (Sukhbaatar et al., 2015).
Where noted, the Transformer is pretrained on Reddit data (Mazare et al., 2018), and fine-tuned for
our task. The results are shown in Table 2. Transformers work best, as long as they are pretrained on
a large dataset (Reddit), while multi-tasking on SQuAD provides marginal impact. Further analysis
of this task using other models is provided in Appendix B.1. We use the best performing Transformer
model reported here for our two-stage generative Memory Network in the full dialogue task.
5.2	Full Task: Dialogue with Knowledge
We evaluate our models on the full task of dialogue generation given knowledge in two settings:
given the gold knowledge sentence chosen by a human, or where the model needs to predict which
knowledge to use. We separately describe experiments for retrieval and generative models.
Retrieval Experiments We use similar baselines as in the knowledge selection experiments, but
now also apply Transformer Memory Networks, which attend over knowledge. Models are evalu-
ated measuring Recall@1 when ranking the gold response among 99 randomly chosen candidates,
and unigram F1 of the model’s prediction with the gold response. The results are shown in Table 3.
We find that the addition of knowledge improves all models (improving Bow MemNet from 56 to 71
R@1 and the Transformer MemNet from 79 to 87 R@1) for predicted knowledge. Performance im-
proves dramatically when models are provided gold knowledge, but otherwise retain similar trends.
Generative Experiments We compare our generative End-to-end and Two-stage Transformer
Memory Network models to two more baselines: repeating the last utterance, and a generative
Transformer model trained to respond to dialogue but without access to knowledge. Models are
evaluated using perplexity (PPL) of the gold response and unigram F1.

The results are given in Table 4. Our experiments show that both the End-to-end and Two-stage
models employ the knowledge in their response predictions, as they outperform their counterpart
Transformer without knowledge, and demonstrate substantial improvements when provided the gold
knowledge. While the Two-stage model produces significantly stronger perplexity and F1 scores
using the predicted knowledge, the End-to-end model outperforms the Two-stage model in the gold
knowledge experiments. This suggests that the Two-stage model benefits from the strong knowledge
selection module (Section 5.1), but that the End-to-end model is better at employing the selected
knowledge. Furthermore, we find that the additional knowledge selection supervision (auxiliary
loss) in the End-to-end model improves it on every metric, suggesting that tightly integrating these
tasks is beneficial. Knowledge dropout (K. D.) also helps (compare last two rows). More evidence

for this is shown in Appendix B.1. Lastly, we note that both Two-stage models give higher F1 scores
than any of the retrieval models shown in Table 3.
5.3 Human Evaluation
We perform human evaluation of our models using crowd-sourced workers. Humans are paired with
our models and asked to Chat about a specific topic (given a choice of 2-3 topics) for 3-5 dialogue
turns. Following their conversation, the humans are asked to rate their dialogue partner on a scale
of 1-5, with the rating indicating how much they “liked” the conversation (5 is best), which we
refer to as the engagingness rating. Using the collected conversations, we also calculate a metric
we call the Wiki F1 sore: the F1 overlap of the model’s utterances with the first 10 sentences of
the Wikipedia page for the chosen topic as a proxy for how much knowledge the model exhibits.
We seek a model that can be simultaneously engaging and knowledgeable, hence we would like to
maximize both these metrics1. For comparison, we also collect 100 human-human conversations,
with only one human choosing the topic and performing evaluation. In total, we collect a total of
546 conversations with ratings from 464 distinct workers. These results are shown in Table 5.
We find that the retrieval models significantly outperform the generative models on the human en-
gagingness evaluation(Student’s t-test, p < .05). The human engagingness differences between
retriever models with and without knowledge are not significant, but note they both trend toward use
of knowledge due to the candidate sentences retrieved, with the knowledgeable version obtaining
significantly higher Wiki F1 scores in both seen and unseen test sets.
For the generative models, we find human engagingness ratings are significantly improved by the
use of knowledge (p < .01). The significantly higher Wiki F1 scores indicate that (i) these models
convey more knowledge than their counterparts without knowledge conditioning; and (ii) on both
seen and unseen sets they convey more knowledge than the retrieval models. In particular, on unseen

data the gap between retrieval and generative models is larger. This is understandable, as retrieval
models are limited to producing a response from the training set where the unseen topic did not
appear.
There is still a considerable gap to human ratings of other humans compared to all our models (first
row of Table 5). Figure 2 shows example conversations with the retrieval and generative models.
Additional analysis and examples can be found in Appendix B.3 and C.
6 Conclusion
In this work we build dialogue agents which are able to employ large memory systems containing en-
cyclopedic knowledge about the world in order to conduct engaging open-domain conversations. We
develop a set of architectures, Transformer Memory Network models, that are capable of retrieving
and attending to such knowledge and outputting a response, either in retrieval or generative modes.
To train and evaluate such models, we collect the Wizard of Wikipedia dataset, a large collection of
open-domain dialogues grounded by Wikipedia knowledge, and demonstrated the effectiveness of
our models in automatic and human experiments. Our new publicly available benchmark aims to
encourage further model exploration, and we expect such efforts will result in significant advances
in this important research direction.
There is much future work to be explored using our task and dataset. Some of these include:
(i) bridging the gap between the engagingness of retrieval responses versus the ability of genera-
tive models to work on new knowledge and topics, (ii) learning to retrieve and reason simultane-
ously rather than using a separate IR component; and (iii) investigating the relationship between
knowledge-grounded dialogue and existing QA tasks which also employ such IR systems. The aim
is for those strands to come together to obtain an engaging and knowledgeable conversational agent.

A.2 Wizard of Wikipedia Examples
Topic:	Lifeguard
Apprentice:	So I am a lifeguard. Know anything about saving lives in water?
Wizard:	I’m impressed! It’s a big responsibility to supervise other people’s safety in the water! Tell me more.
Apprentice:	Well, I help make sure people do not drown or get injured while in or near the water!
Knowledge:	A lifeguard is a rescuer who supervises the safety and rescue of swimmers, surfers, . . . Lifeguards are strong swimmers and trained in CPR/AED first aid, certified in water . . . • ∙ ∙ In some areas, the lifeguard service also carries out mountain rescues, or may function as the primary EMS provider.
Wizard:	I’ve heard that in some places, lifeguards also help with other sorts of emergencies, like mountain rescues! Is that part of your job too?
Apprentice:	I have! I feel like you know much about this! What brings you to know so much?
Wizard:	Oh, that’s about the extent of my knowledge. I’ve just been around beaches and I’ve always admired lifeguards. I’m not a super strong swimmer myself.
Topic:	Armadillo
Wizard:	I love animals and think armadillos are awesome with their leathery shell.
Apprentice:	I don’t think I’ve ever seen an armadillo in real life!
Wizard:	I’ve seen them at the zoo. Armadillo means little armored one in Spanish.
Apprentice:	Are they native to a Spanish-speaking part of the world?
Knowledge:	Armadillos are New World placental mammals in the order Cingulata . . . The word “armadillo” means “little armoured one” in Spanish. ••• The nine-banded armadillo (“Dasypus novemcinctus”), or the nine-banded, long-nosed armadillo, is a medium-sized mammal found in North, Central, and South America.
Wizard:	Yes, they are most commonly found in North, Central, and South America
Topic:	Ice cream
Wizard:	I just love ice cream. I love the types with fruits and flavours. Do you like ice cream?
Apprentice:	I love Ice cream as much as any one. I especially like Gelato, foreign ice cream!
Knowledge	Ice cream is a sweetened frozen food typically eaten as a snack or dessert	 It is usually made from dairy products, such as milk and cream, and . . . ••• Bacon ice cream (or bacon-and-egg ice cream) is an ice cream generally created by adding bacon to egg custard and freezing the mixture.
Wizard:	Me too. There are some strange combinations though, have you heard of bacon ice cream? where they add bacon and even egg custard to the freezing mixture!
Apprentice:	Surprisingly bacon ice cream doesn’t surprise me. That doesn’t sound appealing to me, but perhaps it could be delicious. . .
Figure 3: The Wizard of Wikipedia dataset. Examples of collected conversations from the dataset,
where both wizard and apprentice are humans. The wizard has access to an information retrieval
system over Wikipedia, so that they can ask and answer questions, and make statements relevant
to the discussion. For each utterance, knowledge retrieval is performed based on dialogue history,
giving 〜61 knowledge candidates per turn, with wizards clicking no sentence used 6.2% of the time.
Assuming that a question contains a question mark or begins with ’how’, ’why’, ’who’, ’where’,
’what’ or ’when’, in the dataset Apprentices ask questions in 13.9% of training set utterances, and
answer questions (i.e., the Wizard has asked a question) 39.5% of the time, while saying new or
follow-on statements (neither asking nor answering a question) 49.3% of the time. Hence, the
wizard and apprentice conduct conversations with a variety of dialogue acts.
A.3 Topic Selection
To choose between topics that are natural we employed the existing Persona-Chat dataset (Zhang
et al., 2018) where crowdworkers where asked to create personas of typical speakers. There are
13
Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2019
〜1000 personas, each of which consists of 4-5 sentences describing that person's interests, e.g. “I
love watching Game of Thrones”, “I like to eat cheetos” and “I recently got a cat”. These can thus
naturally be seen as topics of interest, and using another set of annotators we mapped each sentence
to 1 or more relevant Wikipedia pages, if possible, e.g. “Ariel is my favorite princess” was labeled
with the Wikipedia page for The Little Mermaid. As some sentences are harder to connect with
Wikipedia, e.g. “I am witty”, they are left unlabeled. We thus obtain 1,431 topics in total to use for
our task. We retain the persona topic sets and thus present 2-3 related topic choices as conversation
starters per dialogue during data collection.
B Additional Experiments

Table 6: Test performance of the Knowledge Selection Tasks. We also tested the performance of
our models trained to do the full dialogue task (see Section 5.2) on the knowledge selection task. For
our retrieval system, this refers to the performance of the knowledge attention. The results show that
our retrieval system could be improved, and the auxiliary loss clearly helps the generative models.

B.2	Full Dialogue with Retrieval
B.3	Human Experiments
C Error Analysis
We perform an analysis of the dialogues produced from the human evaluation experiments detailed
in Section 5.3. We sample 20 conversations from each experimental setting, split between seen
and unseen. Conversations are re-tokenized and lowercased to reduce superficial differences be-
tween models, and then analyzed in a single-blind setup. We note of common errors and behaviors
exhibited in each of the different conversations.
In general, the human-human conversations are starkly different than any of the bot conversations
一 humans tend to have more small talk, or use the topic of discussion as a mere icebreaker, with
neither human behaving as a wizard. This is in contrast to human-human conversations from the
Wizard dataset itself, where one human has access to Wikipedia, and the conversation becomes more
grounded in factual sentences. Similarly, all models attempt to play the role of wizard and produce
more factual sentences too. In some rounds, humans treat the bot as a sort of question-answer
machine, suggesting that the models could be improved by additionally employing SQuAD-like
training data.
The retriever without knowledge is particularly prone to non sequiturs, or rapidly changing the
subject. During unseen conversations, it is especially likely to discuss something other than the
chosen topic. In contrast, the retriever with knowledge tends to stick to the chosen topic strongly,
but has difficulty if the human changes the subject. Frequently in unseen topics, the retriever with

Table 7: Retrieval methods on the full Wizard task. In addition to the models we tested in the
paper, we also tested a two-stage retrieval system in which we used our best-performing model on
the knowledge selection task to choose a single knowledge sentence to condition on for the dialogue
retrieval task. This outperformed our best retrieval method in terms of F1 but not not in terms
of Recall@1. Furthermore, we compared these results to a two-stage retrieval system in which
the dialogue retrieval module is optimized for seeing the gold chosen knowledge sentence. The
performance of this system on the gold knowledge task suggests that the retrieval system could be
improved by increasing performance on the knowledge selection subtask.

Table 8: Human Experiments. We calculate the Wiki F1 score for the wizard and apprentice as
they appear in the dataset for the sake of comparison to our human evaluations. Note that this
differed from the human-human evaluation set-up in the sense that the wizard had direct access to
Wikipedia passages in the UI, which explains the higher values of Wiki F1 both for the wizard (who
uses Wikipedia) and for the apprentice (who would likely reference that use).

knowledge produces similar, but factually inaccurate answers to user queries. For example, when
one user asks about parts of Ireland to visit, the model enumerates a list of locations in Greece.
Nonetheless, its repertoire of available responses often include inviting responses, allowing the bot
to have a more natural conversational flow. Selected conversations with the retriever with knowledge
may be found in Figure 4, for both seen and unseen topics.
The generator without knowledge is particularly prone to many of the typical behaviors of seq2seq
systems (Li et al., 2016; Vijayakumar et al., 2016), including local repetition (“cookies are made
of flour, oil, oil, and oil”), global repetition (producing the near same utterance for multiple turns),
or inconsistencies in its personality (saying it both likes and dislikes movies). The generator with
knowledge has significantly fewer issues with repetition, as it errs on the side of copying large
fragments from the Wikipedia knowledge. The generator with knowledge can also act as a selfish
conversationalist, choosing to respond or detail information without inviting a response. Although
it generally produces accurate statements, it sometimes produces statements using an incorrect date,

name or word. It also frequently produces formulaic responses, like “I don’t know, but I do know
that [Wikipedia excerpt]”. Nonetheless, we find the generator with knowledge is able to successfully
generalize to unseen topics using the knowledge from Wikipedia. Selected conversations with the
generator with knowledge may be found in Figure 5.
