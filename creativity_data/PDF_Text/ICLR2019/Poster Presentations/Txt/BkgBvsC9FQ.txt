Ab stract
Variational autoencoders (VAEs) have shown a promise in data-driven conversa-
tion modeling. However, most VAE conversation models match the approximate
posterior distribution over the latent variables to a simple prior such as standard
normal distribution, thereby restricting the generated responses to a relatively sim-
ple (e.g., unimodal) scope. In this paper, we propose DialogWAE, a conditional
Wasserstein autoencoder (WAE) specially designed for dialogue modeling. Un-
like VAEs that impose a simple distribution over the latent variables, DialogWAE
models the distribution of data by training a GAN within the latent variable space.
Specifically, our model samples from the prior and posterior distributions over
the latent variables by transforming context-dependent random noise using neu-
ral networks and minimizes the Wasserstein distance between the two distribu-
tions. We further develop a Gaussian mixture prior network to enrich the latent
space. Experiments on two popular datasets show that DialogWAE outperforms
the state-of-the-art approaches in generating more coherent, informative and di-
verse responses.
1	Introduction
Neural response generation has been a long interest of natural language research. Most of the recent
approaches to data-driven conversation modeling primarily build upon sequence-to-sequence learn-
ing (Cho et al., 2014; Sutskever et al., 2014). Previous research has demonstrated that sequence-
to-sequence conversation models often suffer from the safe response problem and fail to generate
meaningful, diverse on-topic responses (Li et al., 2015; Sato et al., 2017). Conditional variational
autoencoders (CVAE) have shown promising results in addressing the safe response issue (Zhao et
al., 2017; Shen et al., 2018). CVAE generates the response conditioned on a latent variable - repre-
senting topics, tones and situations of the response - and approximate the posterior distribution over
latent variables using a neural network. The latent variable captures variabilities in the dialogue and
thus generates more diverse responses. However, previous studies have shown that VAE models
tend to suffer from the posterior collapse problem, where the decoder learns to ignore the latent
variable and degrades to a vanilla RNN (Shen et al., 2018; Park et al., 2018; Bowman et al., 2015).
Furthermore, they match the approximate posterior distribution over the latent variables to a simple
prior such as standard normal distribution, thereby restricting the generated responses to a relatively
simple (e.g., unimodal) scope (Goyal et al., 2017).
A number of studies have sought GAN-based approaches (Goodfellow et al., 2014; Li et al., 2017a;
Xu et al., 2017) which directly model the distribution of the responses. However, adversarial training
over discrete tokens has been known to be difficult due to the non-differentiability. Li et al. (2017a)
proposed a hybrid model of GAN and reinforcement learning (RL) where the score predicted by a
discriminator is used as a reward to train the generator. However, training with REINFORCE has
been observed to be unstable due to the high variance of the gradient estimate (Shen et al., 2017).
Xu et al. (2017) make the GAN model differentiable with an approximate word embedding layer.
However, their model only injects variability at the word level, thus limited to represent high-level
response variabilities such as topics and situations.

In this paper, we propose DialogWAE, a novel variant of GAN for neural conversation modeling.
Unlike VAE conversation models that impose a simple distribution over latent variables, DialogWAE
models the data distribution by training a GAN within the latent variable space. Specifically, it
samples from the prior and posterior distributions over the latent variables by transforming context-
dependent random noise with neural networks, and minimizes the Wasserstein distance (Arjovsky
et al., 2017) between the prior and the approximate posterior distributions. Furthermore, our model
takes into account a multimodal1 nature of responses by using a Gaussian mixture prior network.
Adversarial training with the Gaussian mixture prior network enables DialogWAE to capture a richer
latent space, yielding more coherent, informative and diverse responses.
Our main contributions are two-fold: (1) A novel GAN-based model for neural dialogue modeling,
which employs GAN to generate samples of latent variables. (2) A Gaussian mixture prior network
to sample random noise from a multimodal prior distribution. To the best of our knowledge, the
proposed DialogWAE is the first GAN conversation model that exploits multimodal latent structures.
We evaluate our model on two benchmark datasets, SwitchBoard (Godfrey and Holliman, 1997) and
DailyDialog (Li et al., 2017b). The results demonstrate that our model substantially outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods in terms of BLEU, word embedding similarity, and distinct. Furthermore,
we highlight how the GAN architecture with a Gaussian mixture prior network facilitates the gener-
ation of more diverse and informative responses.
2	Related Work
Encoder-decoder variants To address the “safe response” problem of the naive encoder-decoder
conversation model, a number of variants have been proposed. Li et al. (2015) proposed a diversity-
promoting objective function to encourage more various responses. Sato et al. (2017) propose to
incorporate various types of situations behind conversations when encoding utterances and decoding
their responses, respectively. Xing et al. (2017) incorporate topic information into the sequence-to-
sequence framework to generate informative and interesting responses. Our work is different from
the aforementioned studies, as it does not rely on extra information such as situations and topics.
VAE conversation models The variational autoencoder (VAE) (Kingma and Welling, 2014) is
among the most popular frameworks for dialogue modeling (Zhao et al., 2017; Shen et al., 2018;
Park et al., 2018). Serban et al. (2017) propose VHRED, a hierarchical latent variable sequence-
to-sequence model that explicitly models multiple levels of variability in the responses. A main
challenge for the VAE conversation models is the so-called “posterior collapse”. To alleviate the
problem, Zhao et al. (2017) introduce an auxiliary bag-of-words loss to the decoder. They further
incorporate extra dialogue information such as dialogue acts and speaker profiles. Shen et al. (2018)
propose a collaborative CVAE model which samples the latent variable by transforming a Gaussian
noise using neural networks and matches the prior and posterior distributions of the Gaussian noise
with KL divergence. Park et al. (2018) propose a variational hierarchical conversation RNN (VHCR)
which incorporates a hierarchical structure to latent variables. DialogWAE addresses the limitation
of VAE conversation models by using a GAN architecture in the latent space.
GAN conversation models Although GAN/CGAN has shown great success in image generation,
adapting it to natural dialog generators is a non-trivial task. This is due to the non-differentiable
nature of natural language tokens (Shen et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2017). Li et al. (2017a) address this
problem by combining GAN with Reinforcement Learning (RL) where the discriminator predicts
a reward to optimize the generator. However, training with REINFORCE can be unstable due to
the high variance of the sampled gradient (Shen et al., 2017). Xu et al. (2017) make the sequence-
to-sequence GAN differentiable by directly multiplying the word probabilities obtained from the
decoder to the corresponding word vectors, yielding an approximately vectorized representation of
the target sequence. However, their approach injects diversity in the word level rather than the level
of the whole responses. DialogWAE differs from exiting GAN conversation models in that it shapes
the distribution of responses in a high level latent space rather than direct tokens and does not rely
on RL where the gradient variances are large.
1A multimodal distribution is a continuous probability distribution with two or more modes.

3	Proposed Approach
3.1	Problem Statement
Let d=[u1, ..., uk] denote a dialogue of k utterances where ui=[w1, ..., w|ui|] represents an utterance
and wn denotes the n-th word in ui. Let c=[u1, ..., uk-1] denote a dialogue context, the k-1 historical
utterances, and x=uk be a response which means the next utterance. Our goal is to estimate the
conditional distributionpθ(x|c).
As x and c are sequences of discrete tokens, it is non-trivial to find a direct coupling between them.
Instead, we introduce a continuous latent variable z that represents the high-level representation
of the response. The response generation can be viewed as a two-step procedure, where a latent
variable Z is sampled from a distribution pθ(z∣c) on a latent space Z, and then the response X is
decoded from Z with pθ (x | z, c). Under this model, the likelihood of a response is
pθ
(x|c) =
z
p(x|c, Z)p(Z|c)dz.
(1)
The exact log-probability is difficult to compute since it is intractable to marginalize out Z. There-
fore, We approximate the posterior distribution of Z as qφ(z∣χ, c) which can be computed by a neural
network named recognition network. Using this approximate posterior, we can instead compute the
evidence lower bound (ELBO):
log Pθ (x|c) = log
≥ '(X)C)= Ez~qφ(z∣χ,c)[log pψ (x|c, Z)] - KL(q0(z|x, C)IIp(ZQ),
where p(Z |c) represents the prior distribution of Z given c and can be modeled with a neural network
named prior network.
p(XIC, Z)p(ZIC)dz
z
(2)
3.2	Conditional Wasserstein Auto-Encoders for Dialogue Modeling
The conventional VAE conversation models assume that the latent variable Z follows a simple prior
distribution such as the normal distribution. However, the latent space of real responses is more
complicated and difficult to be estimated with such a simple distribution. This often leads to the
posterior collapse problem (Shen et al., 2018).
Inspired by GAN and the adversarial auto-encoder (AAE) (Makhzani et al., 2015; Tolstikhin et al.,
2017; Zhao et al., 2018), we model the distribution of Z by training a GAN within the latent space.
We sample from the prior and posterior over the latent variables by transforming random noise
using neural networks. Specifically, the prior sample Z~pθ(z∣c) is generated by a generator G
from context-dependent random noise e, while the approximate posterior sample Z~qφ(Z∣c, x) is
generated by a generator Q from context-dependent random noise e. Both e and E are drawn from
a normal distribution whose mean and covariance matrix (assumed diagonal) are computed from C
with feed-forward neural networks, prior network and recognition network, respectively:
Z = Gθ (e), E ~N(a μ,σ2ι),	]og^ = Wfθ(c)+b	⑶
Z = Qφ(e), 6~N(a μ,σ2I),	Iogσ2 = Wgφ( [x] ) + b,	⑷
where fθ(∙) and gφ(∙) are feed-forward neural networks. Our goal is to minimize the divergence
between pθ(ZIC) and qφ(ZIx, C) while maximizing the log-probability of a reconstructed response
from Z . We thus solve the following problem:
min -Eqφ(z∖x,c) logpψ(x|Z,c) + W(qφ(Hχ, c)||pe(ZIC)),	⑸
θ,φ,ψ
where pθ(ZIC) and qφ(ZIx, C) are neural networks implementing Equations 3 and 4, respectively.
pψ(x∣z, c) is a decoder. W(∙∣∣∙) represents the Wasserstein distance between these two distribu-
tions (Arjovsky et al., 2017). We choose the Wasserstein distance as the divergence since the WGAN
has been shown to produce good results in text generation (Zhao et al., 2018).

Figure 1 illustrates an overview of our model. The utterance encoder (RNN) transforms each ut-
terance (including the response x) in the dialogue into a real-valued vector. For the i-th utterance
in the context, the context encoder (RNN) takes as input the concatenation of its encoding vector
and the conversation floor (1 if the utterance is from the speaker of the response, otherwise 0) and
computes its hidden state hictx . The final hidden state of the context encoder is used as the context
representation.
At generation time, the model draws a random noise e from the prior network (PriNet) which trans-
forms c through a feed-forward network followed by two matrix multiplications which result in the
mean and diagonal covariance, respectively. Then, the generator G generates a sample of latent
variable Z from the noise through a feed-forward network. The decoder RNN decodes the generated
Z into a response.
At training time, the model infers the posterior distribution of the latent variable conditioned on the
context c and the response x. The recognition network (RecNet) takes as input the concatenation of
both x and c and transforms them through a feed-forward network followed by two matrix multi-
plications which define the normal mean and diagonal covariance, respectively. A Gaussian noise
is drawn from the recognition network with the re-parametrization trick. Then, the generator Q
transforms the Gaussian noise into a sample of latent variable Z through a feed-forward network.
The response decoder (RNN) computes the reconstruction loss:
Lrec ― -Ez=Q(e), e〜RecNet(x,c) logpψ (X|c, Z)	(6)
We match the approximate posterior with the prior distributions of Z by introducing an adversarial
discriminator D which tells apart the prior samples from posterior samples. D is implemented as a
feed-forward neural network which takes as input the concatenation of Z and c and outputs a real
value. We train D by minimizing the discriminator loss:
Ldisc = Ee〜RecNet(x,c)[D(Q(e), c)] - &〜PriNet(c) [D(G(N), c)]

3.3	Multimodal Response Generation with a Gaussian Mixture Prior Network
It is a usual practice for the prior distribution in the AAE architecture to be a normal distribution.
However, responses often have a multimodal nature reflecting many equally possible situations (Sato
et al., 2017), topics and sentiments. A random noise with normal distribution could restrict the gen-
erator to output a latent space with a single dominant mode due to the unimodal nature of Gaussian
distribution. Consequently, the generated responses could follow simple prototypes.
To capture multiple modes in the probability distribution over the latent variable, we further propose
to use a distribution that explicitly defines more than one mode. Each time, the noise to generate
the latent variable is selected from one of the modes. To achieve so, we make the prior network to
capture a mixture of Gaussian distributions, namely, GMM({∏k, μk,σ∕}3ι), where ∏k, μk and
σk are parameters of the k-th component. This allows it to learn a multimodal manifold in the latent
variable space in a two-step generation process - first choosing a component k with ∏k, and then
sampling Gaussian noise within the selected component:

where gi is a Gumbel noise computed as
gi = —log(—log(Ui)),Ui ~ U(0,1)
and τ ∈[0,1] is the softmax temperature which is set to 0.1 in all experiments.
We refer to this framework as DialogWAE-GMP. A comparison of performance with different num-
bers of prior components will be shown in Section 5.1.
3.4	Training
Our model is trained epochwise until a convergence is reached. In each epoch, we train the model
iteratively by alternating two phases — an AE phase during which the reconstruction loss of decoded
responses is minimized, and a GAN phase which minimizes the Wasserstein distance between the
prior and approximate posterior distributions over the latent variables. The detailed procedures are
presented in Algorithm 1
4	Experimental Setup
Datasets We evaluate our model on two dialogue datasets, Dailydialog (Li et al., 2017b) and
Switchboard (Godfrey and Holliman, 1997), which have been widely used in recent studies (Shen et
al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2017). Dailydialog has 13,118 daily conversations for a English learner in a
5

daily life. Switchboard contains 2,400 two-way telephone conversations under 70 specified topics.
The datasets are separated into training, validation, and test sets with the same ratios as in the base-
line papers, that is, 2316:60:62 for Switchboard (Zhao et al., 2017) and 10:1:1 for Dailydialog (Shen
et al., 2018), respectively.
Metrics To measure the performance of DialogWAE, we adopted several standard metrics widely
used in existing studies: BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), BOW Embedding (Liu et al., 2016) and
distinct (Li et al., 2015). In particular, BLEU measures how much a generated response contains
n-gram overlaps with the reference. We compute BLEU scores for n<4 using smoothing techniques
(smoothing 7)2 (Chen and Cherry, 2014). For each test context, we sample 10 responses from the
models and compute their BLEU scores. We define n-gram precision and n-gram recall as the
average and the maximum score respectively (Zhao et al., 2017).
BOW embedding metric is the cosine similarity of bag-of-words embeddings between the hypothe-
sis and the reference. We use three metrics to compute the word embedding similarity: 1. Greedy:
greedily matching words in two utterances based on the cosine similarities between their embed-
dings, and to average the obtained scores (Rus and Lintean, 2012). 2. Average: cosine similarity
between the averaged word embeddings in the two utterances (Mitchell and Lapata, 2008). 3. Ex-
trema: cosine similarity between the largest extreme values among the word embeddings in the two
utterances (Forgues et al., 2014). We use Glove vectors (Pennington et al., 2014) as the embeddings
which will be discussed later in this section. For each test context, we report the maximum BOW
embedding score among the 10 sampled responses.
Distinct computes the diversity of the generated responses. dist-n is defined as the ratio of unique
n-grams (n=1,2) over all n-grams in the generated responses. As we sample multiple responses for
each test context, we evaluate diversities for both within and among the sampled responses. We
define intra-dist as the average of distinct values within each sampled response and inter-dist as the
distinct value among all sampled responses.
Baselines We compare the performance of DialogWAE with seven recently-proposed baselines for
dialogue modeling: (i) HRED: a generalized sequence-to-sequence model with hierarchical RNN
encoder (Serban et al., 2016), (ii) SeqGAN: a GAN based model for sequence generation (Li et al.,
2017a), (iii) CVAE: a conditional VAE model with KL-annealing (Zhao et al., 2017), (iv) CVAE-
BOW: a conditional VAE model with a BOW loss (Zhao et al., 2017), (v) CVAE-CO: a collaborative
conditional VAE model (Shen et al., 2018), (vi) VHRED: a hierarchical VAE model (Serban et al.,
2017), and (vii) VHCR: a hierarchical VAE model with conversation modeling (Park et al., 2018).
Training and Evaluation Details We use the gated recurrent units (GRU) (Cho et al., 2014) for
the RNN encoders and decoders. The utterance encoder is a bidirectional GRU with 300 hidden
units in each direction. The context encoder and decoder are both GRUs with 300 hidden units.
The prior and the recognition networks are both 2-layer feed-forward networks of size 200 with
tanh non-linearity. The generators Q and G as well as the discriminator D are 3-layer feed-forward
networks with ReLU non-linearity (Nair and Hinton, 2010) and hidden sizes of 200, 200 and 400,
respectively. The dimension of a latent variable z is set to 200. The initial weights for all fully
connected layers are sampled from a uniform distribution [-0.02, 0.02]. The gradient penalty is used
when training D (Gulrajani et al., 2017) and its hyper-parameter λ is set to 10. We set the vocabulary
size to 10,000 and define all the out-of-vocabulary words to a special token <unk>. The word
embedding size is 200 and initialized with Glove vectors pre-trained on Twitter (Pennington et al.,
2014). The size of context window is set to 10 with a maximum utterance length of 40. We sample
responses with greedy decoding so that the randomness entirely come from the latent variables. The
baselines were implemented with the same set of hyper-parameters. All the models are implemented
with Pytorch 0.4.03, and fine-tuned with NAVER Smart Machine Learning (NSML) platform (Sung
et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2018).
The models are trained with mini-batches containing 32 examples each in an end-to-end manner. In
the AE phase, the models are trained by SGD with an initial learning rate of 1.0 and gradient clipping
at 1 (Pascanu et al., 2013). We decay the learning rate by 40% every 10th epoch. In the GAN phase,
the models are updated using RMSprop (Tieleman and Hinton) with fixed learning rates of 5×10-5

5	Experimental Results
5.1	Quantitative Analysis
Tables 1 and 2 show the performance of DialogWAE and baselines on the two datasets. DialogWAE
outperforms the baselines in the majority of the experiments. In terms of BLEU scores, Dialog-
WAE (with a Gaussian mixture prior network) generates more relevant responses, with the average
recall of 42.0% and 37.2% on both of the datasets. These are significantly higher than those of the
CVAE baselines (29.9% and 26.5%). We observe a similar trend to the BOW embedding metrics.
DialogWAE generates more diverse responses than the baselines do. The inter-dist scores are signif-
icantly higher than those of the baseline models. This indicates the sampled responses contain more
distinct n-grams. DialogWAE does not show better intra-distinct scores. We conjecture that this is
due to the relatively long responses generated by the DialogWAE as shown in the last columns of
both tables. It is highly unlikely for there to be many repeated n-grams in a short response.
We further investigate the effects of the number of prior components (K). Figure 2 shows the
performance of DialogWAE-GMP with respect to the number of prior components K . We vary K
from 1 to 9. As shown in the results, in most cases, the performance increases with K and decreases
once K reaches a certain threshold, for example, three. The optimal K on both of the datasets was
around 3. We attribute this degradation to training difficulty of a mixture density network and the
lack of appropriate regularization, which is left for future investigation.
5.2	Qualitative Analysis
Table 3 presents examples of responses generated by the models on the DailyDialog dataset. Due
to the space limitation, we report the results of CVAE-CO and DialogWAE-GMP, which are the
representative models among the baselines and the proposed models. For each context in the test
set, we show three samples of generated responses from each model. As we expected, DialogWAE
generates more coherent and diverse responses that cover multiple plausible aspects. Furthermore,

we notice that the generated response is long and exhibits informative content. By contrast, the
responses generated by the baseline model exhibit relatively limited variations. Although the re-
sponses show some variants in contents, most of them share a similar prefix such as “how much”.
We further investigate the interpretability of Gaussian components in the prior network, that is,
what each Gaussian model has captured before generation. We pick a dialogue context “I’d like
to invite you to dinner tonight, do you have time?” which is also used in (Shen et al., 2018) for
analysis and generate five responses for each Gaussian component. As shown in Table 4, different

Gaussian models generate different types of responses: component 1 expresses a strong will, while
component 2 expresses some uncertainty, and component 3 generates strong negative responses.
The overlap between components is marginal (around 1/5). The results indicate that the Gaussian
mixture prior network can successfully capture the multimodal distribution of the responses.

To validate the previous results, we further conduct a human evaluation with Amazon Mechanical
Turk. We randomly selected 50 dialogues from the test set of DailyDialog. For each dialogue
context, we generated 10 responses from each of the four models. Responses for each context were
inspected by 5 participants who were asked to choose the model which performs the best in regarding
to coherence, diversity and informative while being blind to the underlying algorithms. The average
percentages that each model was selected as the best to a specific criterion are shown in Table 5.
Table 5: Human judgments for models trained on the Dailydialog dataset
Model	Coherence	Diversity	Informative
CVAE-CO	-144%-	19.2%	-248%-
VHCR	26.8%	22.4%	20.4%
DialogWAE	27.6%	29.2%	25.6%
DialogWAE-GMP	31.6%	29.2%	29.6%
The proposed approach clearly outperforms the current state of the art, CVAE-CO and VHCR, by a
large margin in terms of all three metrics. This improvement is especially clear when the Gaussian
mixture prior was used.
6	Conclusion
In this paper, we introduced a new approach, named DialogWAE, for dialogue modeling. Differ-
ent from existing VAE models which impose a simple prior distribution over the latent variables,
DialogWAE samples the prior and posterior samples of latent variables by transforming context-
dependent Gaussian noise using neural networks, and minimizes the Wasserstein distance between
the prior and posterior distributions. Furthermore, we enhance the model with a Gaussian mix-
ture prior network to enrich the latent space. Experiments on two widely used datasets show that
our model outperforms state-of-the-art VAE models and generates more coherent, informative and
diverse responses.
