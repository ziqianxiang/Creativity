Figure 1: (a) The proposed Self-Modulation framework for a generator network, where middlelayers are directly modulated as a function of the generator input z . (b) A simple MLP basedmodulation function that transforms input z to the modulation variables β(z) and γ(z).
Figure 2: In Figure (a) we observe that the proposed method outperforms the baseline in the un-paired setting. Figure (b) shows the number of models which fall in 80-th percentile in terms ofFID (with reverse ordering). We observe that the majority “good” models utilize self-modulation.
Figure 3: Each point corresponds to a single model/hyperparameter setting. The left-hand plotsshow the log condition number of the generator versus the FID score. The right-hand plots showthe generator precision/recall curves. The r values for the correlation between log condition numberand FID on CIFAR 1 0 are 0.67 and 0.83 for Self-Mod and Base, respectively. For IMAGENET theyare 0.24 and 0.39 for Self-Mod and Base, respectively. LSUN-BEDROOM and CELEBA-HQ are in theappendix.

Figure 5: Each point in each plot corresponds to a single model for all parameter configurations.
