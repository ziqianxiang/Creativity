Figure 1: A generic function defined by a deep network is the composition of a one-to-one functionand a linear function. Each level set is therefore homeomorphic to the intersection of an opentopological ball with an n - 1-dimensional hyperplane, which forces it to be unbounded.
Figure 2: In the proof of Lemma 2, we choose ε by finding an intercal U = (y - ε, y + ε) whosepreimage contains a bounded component C.
