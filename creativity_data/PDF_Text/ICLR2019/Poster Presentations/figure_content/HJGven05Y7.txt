Figure 1: Stabilizing MAML: This figure illustrates 3 seeds of the original strided MAML vs stridedMAML++. One can see that 2 out of 3 seeds with the original strided MAML seem to becomeunstable and erratic, whereas all 3 of the strided MAML++ models seem to consistently convergevery fast, to much higher generalization accuracy without any stability issues.
