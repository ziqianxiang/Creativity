Figure 1: Group sparsity demonstrated in adversarial pertur-bations obtained by C&W attack and our StrAttack, where‘ostrich’ is the original label, and ‘unicycle’ is the mis-classified label. Here each group is a region of 13×13×3 pix-els and the strength of adversarial perturbations (through their`2 norm) at each group is represented by heatmap. C&W at-tack perturbs almost all groups, while StrAttack yields stronggroup sparsity, with more semantic structure: the perturbedimage region matches the feature of the target object, namely,the frame of the unicycle.
Figure 2: C&W attack vs StrAttack. Here each grid cell represents a 2 × 2, 2 × 2, and 13 × 13 small region inMNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, respectively. The group sparsity of perturbation is represented by heatmap.
Figure 3: Interpretabilicy comparison of StrAttack and C&W attack. (a) ASM-based IS vs ν, given from the30th percentile to the 90th percentile of ASM scores. (b) Overlay ASM and BASM ◦ δ on top of image withthe true label ‘Tibetan Mastiff’ and the target label ‘streetcar’. From left to right: original image, ASM (darkercolor represents larger value of ASM score), BASM ◦ δ under StrAttack, and BASM ◦ δ under C&W attack.
Figure 4: CAMs of adversarial examples generated by the C&W attack and StrAttack under the original label(t0) and target label (t). Here xCW and xStr denote adversarial examples crafted by different attacks. At eachrow, the subplots from left to right represent the original image x0 , perturbations generated by C&W attack,perturbations generated by StrAttack, and CAMs with respect to natural or adversarial example under t0 or t.
Figure A1: An example of 4 × 4 perturbation matrix under sliding masks with different strides. The values ofmatrix elements are represented by color’s intensity (white stands for 0). Left: Non-overlapping groups withr = 2 and S = 2. Right: Overlapping groups with r = 2 and S = 1. In both cases, two groups G1,1 and G1,2are highlighted, where G1,1 is non-sparse, and G1,2 is sparse.
Figure A2: (a) Overlay ASM and BASM ◦ δ on top of image with the true and the target label. From left toright: original image, ASM (darker color represents larger value of ASM score), BASM ◦ δ under our attack,and BASM ◦ δ under C&W attack. Here V in BASM is set by the 90th percentile of ASM scores. (b) From left toright: original image, CAM of original label, and perturbations with target label generated from the StrAttackand C&W attack, respectively.
