Figure 1: (a)A toy example input DAG function Î¼G, (b) a DG-DAGRNN model that processes theinput in (a) using two sequential DAG embedding layers: a forward layer followed by a reverse layer.
Figure 2: (Left) In-Sample test results comparing between DG-DAGRNN and NeuroSAT, as thenumber of recurrence iterations T increases. (Right) Out-of-Sample test results comparing the twomethods when tested on much larger problems.
