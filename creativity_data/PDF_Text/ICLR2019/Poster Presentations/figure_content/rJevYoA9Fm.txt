Figure 1:	Time used to compute singular values. The left graph is for a 3 × 3 convolution on a16 × 16 image with the number of input/output channels on the x-axis. The right graph is for a11 × 11 convolution on a 64 × 64 image (no curve for full matrix method is shown as this methodcould not complete in a reasonable time for these inputs).
