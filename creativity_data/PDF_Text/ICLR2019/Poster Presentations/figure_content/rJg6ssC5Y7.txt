Figure 1: Illustration of the different stepsimplemented in the DeepOB S package andtheir outputs. The color of each block high-lights the Way a user mostly interacts withthis part. Blocks in ∙ signify classes, thosein ∙ are used via command line scripts. ∙signals data packaged with DEEPOBS and• denotes parts provided through templatescripts.
Figure 2: Learning curves for all eight test problems showing the performance of SGD, Momentum,and Adam produced with DeepOBS.
Figure 3: Relative performance against learning rate for each test problem and optimizer. Top rowshows test problems P1 to P4, bottom row the test problems P5 to p8. The optimizers are representedin the same color as in Figure 2, where ∙ represents SGD, ∙ represents Momentum, and ∙ theAdam optimizer.
