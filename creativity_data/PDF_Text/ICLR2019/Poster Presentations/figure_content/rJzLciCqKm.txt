Figure 1: Two Gaussians: The horizontal axis is the value of x and the vertical axis is the probabilitydensity. The vertical lines represent the decision boundaries of the classifiers. The distribution ofpositive data, negative data, unlabeled data and p(x|o = +1, y = +1) are plotted.
Figure 2: Experimental results of training deep neural networks. Left: MNIST; Center: CIFAR-10;Right: RealData: All measures are calculated for test data sampled from the marginal distributionp(x). The horizontal axis is the epoch of training the network, the vertical axes of the top figures arethe error rates and the vertical axes of the bottom figures are the precision and the recall.
Figure 3: Results of the second experiment of Section 5.4 using the RealData dataset with theestimated class prior 0.1095 (the true class prior is 0.0709). The horizontal axes are the epochs oftraining the network, the vertical axis of the right figure is the error rate and the vertical axis of theleft figure is the value of the precision and the recall.
Figure 4: Experimental results of training deep neural networks using the RealData dataset withmisspecified class priors (the true class prior is 0.0709). Upper Left: π = 0.0209; Upper Right:π = 0.1209; Lower Left: π = 0.1709; Lower Right: π = 0.2709: All measures are calculated fortest data sampled from the marginal distribution p(x). The horizontal line is epoch of training thenetwork, the vertical line of the upper is error rate.
Figure 5: Experimental results of training deep neural networks using the RealData dataset withmisspecified class priors (the true class prior is 0.0709). Upper Left: π = 0.0209; Upper Right:π = 0.1209; Lower Left: π = 0.1709; Lower Right: π = 0.2709: All measures are calculated fortest data sampled from the marginal distribution p(x). The horizontal line is epoch of training thenetwork, the vertical line of the upper is value of the precision and the recall.
Figure 6: Experimental results of training deep neural networks using the RealData dataset, whosetrue class prior is 0.0709, with misspecified class priors, 0.0209, 0.1209, 0.1709, and 0.2709.: Allmeasures are calculated for test data sampled from the marginal distribution p(x). The horizontal lineis epoch of training the network, the vertical line of the right graph is value of the precision - recall.
