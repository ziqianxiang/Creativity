Figure 1: Successfulinterpolation suggeststhat semantically similarpoints may be clusteredtogether in latent space.
Figure 2: Adversarially Constrained Autoencoder Interpolation (ACAI).
Figure 3: Interpolations on the synthetic lines benchmark produced by (a) baseline auto-encoder,(b) denoising autoencoder, (c) Variational Autoencoder, (d) Adversarial Autoencoder, (e) VectorQuantized Variational Autoencoder, (f) Adversarially Constrained Autoencoder Interpolation (ourmodel). While we only show one example here, the behavior of each autoencoder was generallysimilar for all interpolations. A more comprehensive measure of interpolation behavior is given intable 1.
Figure 4: Examples of data and interpolations from our synthetic lines dataset. (a) 16 random samplesfrom the dataset. (b) A perfect interpolation from A = 11π∕i4 to 0. (C) Interpolating in data spacerather than “semantic” or latent space. Clearly, interpolating in this way produces points not on thedata manifold. (d) An interpolation which abruptly changes from one image to the other, rather thansmoothly changing. (e) A smooth interpolation which takes a longer path from the start to end pointthan necessary. (f) An interpolation which takes the correct path but where intermediate points arenot realistic.
