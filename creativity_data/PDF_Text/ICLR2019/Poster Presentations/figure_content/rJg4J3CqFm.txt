Figure 1:	Random networks: Learned Wasserstein embeddings achieve lower distortion than Eu-clidean/hyperbolic embeddings. Hyperbolic embeddings outperform specifically on random trees.
Figure 2:	Real networks: Learned Wasserstein embeddings achieve lower distortion than Euclideanand hyperbolic embeddings of real network fragments.
Figure 3: Directly visualizing high-dimensional word embeddings.
