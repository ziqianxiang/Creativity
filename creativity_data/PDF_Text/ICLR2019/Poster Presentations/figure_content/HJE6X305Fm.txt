Figure 1: Results from four generative adversarial models. The leftmost model is trained with astandard discriminator, while the models on the right use an increasingly more robust discriminator.
Figure 2: Dirac-GAN objective value as a function of the generator parameter Î¸ for linear (WGAN),least squares (LSGAN) and Jensen-Shanon (GAN) objectives: (a) without constraints, (b) constrainson the loss function (Thm 4.1), (c) constrains the discriminator output (Thm 4.2), (d) a regularizer onthe discriminator output (Thm 4.3). Adding adversarial robustness to the discriminator smoothes outany objective. Best viewed in color.
