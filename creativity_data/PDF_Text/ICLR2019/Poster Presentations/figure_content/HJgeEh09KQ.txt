Figure 1: Robustness analysis of a toy example neural network using our method. Here, approxi-mation results computed with DeepZ (blue box) are refined using MILP whereas those in green arerefined using LP.
Figure 2: ReLU transformers, computing an affine form. Here, lx , ux are the original bounds,whereas lx0 , u0x are the refined bounds. The slope of the two non-vertical parallel blue lines isλ = ux/(ux - lx) and the slope of the two non-vertical parallel green lines is λ0 = u0x/(u0x - l0x).
