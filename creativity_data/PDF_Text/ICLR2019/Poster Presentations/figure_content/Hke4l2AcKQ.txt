Figure 1: The mean of pairwise distances between points in (a) is close to (b), while the standarddeviation in (a) is much larger.
Figure 2: Image reconstructions on MNIST and OMNIGLOT. Every three columns compose a set ofreconstruction, original image is on the left, reconstructed image from MAE is in the middle, andreconstructed one from VLAE is on the right.
