Figure 1: Empirical success rates of recovery of the Riemannian subgradient descent with R = 5n log n runs,averaged over 10 instances. Left to right: identitiy dictionaries with θ = 0.1, 0.3, 0.5. See Appendix G for theresults on orthogonal dictionaries, which have qualitatively the same behaviors.
Figure 2: Empirical success rates of recovery of the Riemannian subgradient descent with R = 5n log n runs,averaged over 10 instances. Left to right: orthogonal dictionaries with θ = 0.1, 0.3, 0.5.
Figure 3: Results on two images. First row: the images; Second row: learned dictionaries; Thirdrow: histograms of the representation coefficients; Fourth row: zoomed-in versions of the histogramsaround zero.
