Figure 4: CIFAR-10: stability comparison between WC and WzcaC. While WC is stable, inour experiments we observed that WzcaC can frequently degenerate to a model which produces aconstant, gray image. When this happens, the IS value collapses. Specifically, this figure showsthree randomly initialized training runs for both WC and WzcaC. In two out of three runs, WzcaCdegenerated at some point during training.
