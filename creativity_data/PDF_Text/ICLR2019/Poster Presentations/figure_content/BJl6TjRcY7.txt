Figure 1: Examples of representative expertslearned from motion capture. From top to bottom,these are “run and dodge”, “cartwheel”, “back-flip”, and “twist”. See accompanying video. Notethat these four behaviors will be used as represen-tative examples for validation in single-skill trans-fer experiments.
Figure 2: Neural probabilistic motor primitive architecture for one-shot skill deployment. Theyellow-highlighted information are available for offline, supervised training. Once the full modelhas been learned, the decoder can be reused as a policy in other settings.
Figure 3: Comparisons of trajectory rollouts for4 reference behaviors for the nominal trajectory andat varying noise levels. Note that the score is determined by similarity to motion-capture referenceand the expert may be slightly suboptimal so slight improvements on the expert may arise by chance.
Figure 4: Performance relative to expert policies for trained neural probabilistic motor primitivemodels. Performance of model variations are compared on training and testing data. We comparemodels trained using cloning with 100 trajectories per expert for different levels of regularization,using a smaller latent space of dimension 20 rather than 60 in all other experiments, as well as LFPC.
Figure 5: These panels consist of visualizations of the PCA latent space with comparisons in thisspace between one-shot latent-variable sequences and optimized latent variable sequences for var-ious behaviors: A. Run B. Backwards walking C. Jumping. Running executes well based on theone-shot trajectory so serves as a reference for which optimization is not noticeably different. Walk-ing backwards and jumping one-shot imitations fail, but are noticeably improved by optimization.
