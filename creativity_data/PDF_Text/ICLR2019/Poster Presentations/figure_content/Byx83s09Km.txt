Figure 1: Gaussian Process setting. R: the true function, ρ2 : true observation noise variance, blue:confidence region with μ indicating the mean, blue dots: sampled evaluation points. (a): prior, (b),(c), (d): UCB, TS, IDS posteriors respectively after 20 samples.
Figure 2: Training curves for DQN-IDS and C51-IDS averaged over 3 seeds. Shaded areas corre-spond to min and max returns.
Figure 3: The return distributions learned by C51-IDS and C51. Plots obtained by sampling arandom batch of 32 states from the replay buffer every 50000 steps and computing the estimates forρ2 (s, a) based on eq. (9). A histogram over the resulting values is then computed and displayed asa distribution (by interpolation). From top to bottom, the lines on each plot correspond to standarddeviation boundaries of a normal distribution [max, μ + 1.5σ, μ + σ, μ + 0.5σ, μ, μ - 0.5σ, μ -σ, μ — 1.5σ, min]. The x-axis indicates number of training frames.
