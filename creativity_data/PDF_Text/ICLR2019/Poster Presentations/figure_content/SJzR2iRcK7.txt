Figure 1: Problem reduction schemes for multi-class classification. This work proposes scheme (b),which introduces a binary classifier that captures Sij. Note that Sij represents the probability that Xiand Xj belong to the same class.
Figure 2: Graphical representation for the meta classification task; Xi represents the node of inputdata, Yi represents the class label, Sij is pairwise similarity between instances i and j, and Î¸ representsthe neural network parameters.
Figure 3: The training flows for each learning paradigm. XL represents the labeled data with classlabel YL. XUL is unlabeled data. S is the predicted pairwise similarity while S is used as the learningtarget. The similarity prediction network (SPN) in (b) is learned on a labeled auxiliary dataset andtransferred to the target dataset XUL .
Figure 4: The loss landscape visualizations. Dark green represents a low loss value while yellowmeans high value. The bottom part of each diagram is the 2D contour of its 3D surface. The verticalaxis of CE is logarithmic to better visualize its dynamic range (Li et al., 2017).
