Figure 1: Landscape of TV-GAN objective function F (η, w) = supb [EP sigmoid(wX + b) -EN(η,1)sigmoid(wX + b)], where b is maximized out for visualization. Samples are drawn from P =(1 - )N (1, 1) + N (10, 1) with = 0.2. Left: a surface plot of F (η, w). The solid curves are marginalfunctions for fixed n's: F(1, w) (red) and F(5, W) (blue), and the dash curves are marginal functions for fixedw’s: F(η, -10) (orange) and F(η, 10) (green). Right: a heatmap of F(η, w). It is clear that F(w) = F(η, w)has two local maxima for a given η, achieved at w = +∞ and w = -∞. In fact, the global maximum forF(w) has a phase transition from w = +∞ to w = -∞ as η grows. For example, the maximum is achieved atw = +∞ when η = 1 (blue solid) and is achieved at w = -∞ when η = 5 (red solid). Unfortunately, even ifwe initialize with η0 = 1 and w0 > 0, gradient ascents on η will only increase the value of η (green dash), andthus as long as the discriminator cannot reach the global maximizer, w will be stuck in the positive half space{w : w > 0} and further increase the value of η.
