Figure 1: Three component spaces: sphere S2, Euclidean plane E2, and hyperboloid H2. Thick linesare geodesics; these get closer in positively curved (K = +1) space S2, remain equidistant in flat(K = 0) space E2, and get farther apart in negatively curved (K = -1) space H2.
Figure 3: Geodesic triangles in differently curved spaces: compared to Euclidean geometry in whichit satisfies the parallelogram law (Center), the median am is longer in cycle-like positively curvedspace (Left), and shorter in tree-like negatively curved space (Right). The relative length of am canbe used as a heuristic to estimate discrete curvature.
