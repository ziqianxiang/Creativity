Figure 1: Illustration for the MeshConv operator using parameterized differential operators to re-place conventional learnable convolutional kernels. Similar to classic convolution kernels that es-tablish patterns between neighboring values, differential operators computes “differences”, and alinear combination of differential operators establishes similar patterns.
Figure 2: Schematics for model architecture for classification and semantic segmentation tasks, at alevel-5 inPut resolution. Ln stands for sPherical mesh of level-n as defined in Sec. 3.2. MeshConvis imPlemented according to Eqn. 4. MeshConvT first Pads unknoWn values at the neXt level With 0,folloWed by a regular MeshConv. DoWnSamP samPles the values at the nodes in the neXt mesh level.
Figure 3: Parameter efficiency study on Model-Net40, benchmarked against representative 3Dlearning models consuming different input datarepresentations: PointNet++ using point cloudsas input, VoxNet consuming binary-voxel in-puts, S2CNN consuming the same input struc-ture as our model (spherical signal). The ab-scissa is drawn based on log scale.
Figure 4: Parameter efficiency study on 2D3DSsemantic segmentation task. Our spherical seg-mentation model outperforms the planar andpoint-based counterparts by a significant marginacross all parameter regimes.
Figure 6: Visualization of semantic segmentation results on test set. Our results are generated on alevel-5 spherical mesh and mapped to the equirectangular grid for visualization. Model underper-forms in complex environments, and fails to predict ceiling lights due to incomplete RGB inputs.
Figure 7: Visualization of segmentation for Atmo-spheric River (AR). Plotted in the background is In-tegrated Vapor Transport (IVT), whereas red masksindicates the existance of AR.
Figure 8: Comparison of runtime for our model and the only other model of comparable peakaccuracy: PointNet++. Our model achieves a significant speed gain (5x) over the baseline in highaccuracy regime.
