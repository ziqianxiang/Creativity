Figure 1: The four fluorescent channels of a sample from the dataset, namely (A) nucleus, (B)microtubules, (C) endoplasmic reticulum, (D) protein.
Figure 2: Exemplary samples from the dataset. Overlay of reference channels in gray and proteinin green. The protein of interest is located in (A) golgi apparatus and vesicles, (B) cytosol, nucleusand plasma membrane, (C) actin filaments, (D) nucleoli and centrosome.
Figure 3: GapNet-PL architectureinterpolation, samples were not resized but kept at their original resolution. The pre-processedsamples were then randomly split into a training (80%), a validation (10%) and a test (10%) set.
Figure 4: Confusion matrices for multi-class estimates of GapNet-PL (top left) and the 3 humanexperts. The CNN exhibits good performance across all classes, predicting 9 classes perfectly, whilethe human experts performance varies widely for several classes.
Figure 5:	Class distributions for the whole dataset with 18,756 samples (left) and for all 11,484multi-class samples (right).
Figure 6:	Visualization of the datasets. We used an 8:1:1 split ofdataset into training (15,004 samples), validation (1,876 samples)and test (1,876 samples) sets. An additional test set was definedfor the comparison with human experts and scholars, which is asubset of 200 samples from the test set with single-class labels.

Figure 9: Visualization of samples provided to the human experts and scholars. Every sample wasdisplayed in 4 separate images with the protein in green and the reference channels in red.
Figure 10: Sample misclassified by both GaPNet-PL and all human experts. True class: EndoPlaS-mic reticulum. GapNet-PL: Cytosol. Human experts: Cytosol, Cytosol and Vesicles. All threeclasses are similar structures outside the nucleus up to or near the boundaries of the cell.
Figure 12: Sample misclassified by all human experts but correctly by GaPNet-PL. True class:Nucleus. GapNet-PL: Nucleus. Human experts: Nucleoli, Nucleoli and Nucleoli.
Figure 13: Sample misclassified by all human experts but correctly by GapNet-PL. True class:Vesicles. GapNet-PL: Vesicles. Human experts: Centrosome, Centrosome, Centrosome.
Figure 14: Sample misclassified by all human experts but correctly by GaPNet-PL. True class:Plasma membrane. GapNet-PL: Plasma membrane. Human experts: Centrosome, Centrosome,Vesicles.
Figure 15: Sample misclassified by all human experts but correctly by GapNet-PL. True class:Cytosol. GapNet-PL: Cytosol. Human experts: Microtubul, Plasma membrane and Vesicles.
