Figure 1: A) The stability-plasticity dilemma considers plasticity with respect to the current learning and howit degrades old learning. The transfer-interference trade-off considers the stability-plasticity dilemma and itsdependence on weight sharing in both forward and backward directions. This symmetric view is crucial assolutions that purely focus on reducing the degree of weight-sharing are unlikely to produce transfer in thefuture. B) A depiction of transfer in weight space. C) A depiction of interference in weight space.
Figure 2: Left: a sequence of frames from Catcher and FlaPPy Bird respectively. The goal in Catcher is tocapture the falling pellet by moving the racket on the bottom of the screen. In Flappy Bird, the goal is tonavigate the bird through as many pipes as possible by making it go up or letting it fall. Right: average score inCatcher (above) and Flappy Bird (below) for evaluation on the first task which has slower falling pellets and alarger pipe gap.
