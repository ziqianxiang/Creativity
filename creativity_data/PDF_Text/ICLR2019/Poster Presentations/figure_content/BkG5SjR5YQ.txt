Figure 3: (a)(b): False positive rates at significant level α = 0.05 of the proposed incomplete estimator, blockestimator and linear estimator with/without PSI. For incomplete MMD, we set ' = 10n. For block MMD, weset the block size B = √n. The MMD without PSI computes the p-values without adjusting for the selection.

(e)-(h): The incomplete MMD estimatorwith different sampling parameter r. For all plots, we fixed the number of samples as n = 200 andthe dimensionality d = 1.
Figure 6: Covariance estimation error with respect to the number of samples. We fixed B = 20 and` = 5n.
Figure 7: (a): Type II error comparison. We change the sample size n = [100, 200 . . . , 1500]and compute the type II error of the four empirical estimates of MMD When the type I error iscontrolled at 0.05. For incomplete MMD, we use r = 10. For the block MMD, we use B = √n.
Figure 8: Wine (White) dataset experiment with varying number of samples. (a): True Positive Rate(TPR). (b): False Positive Rate (FPR). In this experiment, we set ` = 5n and B = 20, respectively.
