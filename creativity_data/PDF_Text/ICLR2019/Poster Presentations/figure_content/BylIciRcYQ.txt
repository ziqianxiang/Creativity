Figure 1: Distance to output of SGD in training neural networks.
Figure 2: Verification of epochwise star-convex path.
Figure 3: Verification of iterationwise star-convex path under crossentropy loss.
Figure 4: Iterationwise path on local minimum.
Figure 5: Verification of epochwise star-convexity when the reference point x* is taken at end ofdifferent epochs. Top plots correspond to the training of Alexnet with x* taken at 60th, 80th, 100th,and 120th epochs, and bottom plots correspond to the training of MLP with x* taken at 60th, 80th,100th, and 120th epochs.
Figure 6: `2 norm of network weights and training loss of different networks.
Figure 7: Verification of epochwise star-convexity under MSE loss (i.e., `2 loss).
