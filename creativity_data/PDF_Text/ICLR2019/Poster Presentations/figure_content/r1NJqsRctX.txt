Figure 1: The auxiliary random walk proposal. The variational approximation allows for small stepsin the auxiliary space to correspond to large steps in the target space. Our initial point starts on amanifold of high probability in the target space, is mapped down to the low-dimension auxiliaryspace, perturbed, and then mapped back up to the high probability manifold. Unlike a random-walkin the x-space, our random perturbations correspond to moves along the high probability manifold.

Figure 3: (a) Samples from the learned variational distribution pθ(a∣x) for X on the ring of highprobability. The auxiliary space is plotted on the vertical axis, with the target space plotted in theplane. We can see that the auxiliary variational approximation has recovered the low dimensionalstructure of the target distribution, so that random perturbations in the auxiliary space will mostlycorrespond to proposals within the region of high target probability and large moves. (b): Samplesfrom the trained Auxiliary Variational Sampler (AVS) algorithm (1). (c,d) show the distance movedper sampling step for RWM and AVS for a ring of radius 5, thus demonstrating the benefit ofexploiting structure.
