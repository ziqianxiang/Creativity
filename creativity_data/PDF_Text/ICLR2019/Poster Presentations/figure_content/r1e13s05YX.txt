Figure 1: The Estimate and Replace approach. Figure (a) shows a schematic description of the twoassessment modes. A rectangle represents a neural network. Solid and dashed arrows signify forwardand backward passes of back-propagation. Figure (b) shows a more detailed schematic view of themodel with regards to usage of the external function during training.
Figure 2: Learning efficiency of an Actor-Critic agent vs. the EstiNet model on the image-addition(k âˆˆ {2, 3}) task. Results show the MNIST test set classification accuracy of the argument extractorfor RL Policy and for EstiNet as a function of the amount of gradient updates.
Figure 3: Empirical results for the confidence penalty in the image-lookup experiment for k = 3(Section 4.3). The gradients norms, entropy and accuracy are shown as function of training time foridentical models, with and without confidence regularization. The results show correlation betweenhigh confidence, measured as low entropies, and small gradients.
