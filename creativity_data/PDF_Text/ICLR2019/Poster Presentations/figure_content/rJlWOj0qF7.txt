Figure 1: (a) The structure of N -ball; (b) →u is inside w→; (c) →u disconnects from w→more precise and sensitive than conventional cosine similarity measurements. (3) We create a largedata set of N -ball embeddings using the pre-trained GloVe embeddings and a large category tree ofword senses extracted from Word-Net 3.0.
Figure 2: (a) Hypernym relations of three word senses of flower in Word-Net 3.0; (b) Three compo-nents of the center point of an N -ball.
Figure 3: (a) The angle between ball (A0, r 1) and ball (B0, r2) is greater than 90o, so, ball (A0, r 1)will contain O, ifit contains ball (B~0, r2); (b) If ball (A~, r1) contains ball (B~, r2), not containing O,the sum of α and β is less than 90o; (c) The angle ∠AOB = 180o. If we shift A and B one unit intothe new dimension, we have A0(0, 1, 1) and B 0(0, -1, 1), the angle ∠A0OB 0 will become 90o ; (d)O1 , O2 , O3 are homothetic to O10 , O20 , O30 , inclusion relations among them are preserved.
Figure 4: (a) Precision, recall, F1 score of hypernym prediction, when 5%, 10%, 20%, . . . , 90% ofthe members are used for training; (b) Mode, mean, and population standard deviation of the recall,when 5%, 10%, 20%, . . . , 90% of the members are used for training.
