Figure 1: Mean of the absolute values of the text embeddings (y-axis) plotted depending on thenumber of multiplications (x-axis) for the three initialization strategies. As one can see, the absolutevalue of the embeddings sharply decreases for the initialization strategies Glorot and N(0, 0.1)the more multiplications are performed. In contrast, when our initialization method is applied, theabsolute values of the embeddings have the same magnitude regardless of the sentence length.
