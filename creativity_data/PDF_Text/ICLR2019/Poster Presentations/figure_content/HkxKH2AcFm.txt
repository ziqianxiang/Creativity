Figure 1: Common GAN benchmarks pre-fer training set memorization (^train,red) toa model (q, green) which imperfectly fitsthe true distribution (p, blue) but coversmore of pâ€™s support.
Figure 2: CNN divergence on a small test set isbiased, but correlated, with a large test set.
Figure 3: CNN divergence reveals overfitting ina large GAN.
