Figure 1: (Left) A graphical illustration of the blocks world. Given an initial and a target worlds, theagent is required to move blocks to transform the initial configuration to the target one. (Right) A setof sentences used throughout the paper to define the blocks world.
Figure 2: An illustration of Neural Logic Machines (NLM). During forward propagation, NLM takesobject properties and relations as input, performs sequential logic deduction, and outputs conclusiveproperties or relations of the objects. Implementation details can be found in Section 2.3.
Figure 3: An illustration of the computational block inside NLM for binary predicates at layer i. Ci(j)denotes the number of output predicates of group j at layer i. [âˆ™] denotes the shape of the tensor.
