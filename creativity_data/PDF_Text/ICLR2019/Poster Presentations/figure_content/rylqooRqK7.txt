Figure 1: A conceptual visualization for a forward pass within SNAS. Sampled from P(Z), Z is amatrix whose rows Zi,j are one-hot random variable vectors indicating masks multiplied to edges(i,j) in the DAG. Columns of this matrix correspond to operations Ok. In this example, there are 4operation candidates, among which the last one is zero, i.e. removing that edge. The objective is theexpectation of generic loss L of all child graphs.

Figure 3: Search progress in validation accuracy fromSNAS, DARTS and ENAS.
Figure 4: Entropy of architecture distri-bution in SNAS and DARTS.
Figure 5: Cells (child graphs) SNAS (aggressive constraint) finds on CIFAR-10. (a) Normal cell.
Figure 6: A comparison for gradients in DARTS and SNAS. (a) Deterministic gradients in DARTS;(b) Stochastic gradients in SNAS. Solid lines denote deterministic nodes, while dashed lines de-note stochastic nodes. Black dotted lines denote compounded gradients, purple lines for parametergradients in SNAS, red for search gradients.
