Figure 1: Segmental structure of speech data. Circles of the same color denote the same frame labelin each segment. The shaded input vectors represent the sampled vectors to compute Jodm(Θ).
Figure 2: Self-validation metric. (a) The learning curves of the self-validation loss and the validationFER. (b) The self-validation loss and the validation FER for different values of λ in (3).
Figure 3: Further analysis of our algorithm. (a) Influence of λ after the 1st iteration of fully unsu-pervised learning with matching language model. (b) Equivalent amount of labeled data.
