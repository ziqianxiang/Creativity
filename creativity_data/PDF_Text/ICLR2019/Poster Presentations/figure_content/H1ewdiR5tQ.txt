Figure 2: Top-10 active bases of two words in Cora. The central network of each subgraph representsthe dataset Cora, which is split into 7 classes. Each node represents a document, and its colorindicates its label. The nodes that represent the top-10 active bases are marked with bold rims. (a)W ord984 only appears in documents of the class “ Case-Based ” in Cora. Consistently, all its 10active bases also belong to the class “ Case-Based ”. (b) The frequencies of W ord1177 appearing indifferent classes are similar in Cora. As expected, the top-10 active bases of W ord1177 also belongto different classes.
