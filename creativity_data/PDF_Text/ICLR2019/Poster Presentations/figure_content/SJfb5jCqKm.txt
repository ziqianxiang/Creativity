Figure 1: RC-curve for the CIFAR100 dataset with softmax response confidence score. Blue: the RCcurve based on softmax response; black: the optimal curve that can be achieved in hindsight.
Figure 2: (a): Average confidence score based on softmax values along the training process. Green(solid): 100 points with the highest confidence; red (dashed): 100 points with the lowest confidence.
Figure 3: The E-AURC of MC-dropout on CIFAR-100 along training for 5000 points with highestconfidence (a), and 5000 points with lowest confidence (b).
Figure 4: The E-AURC of NN-distance on CIFAR-100 along training for 5000 points with highestconfidence (a), and 5000 points with lowest confidence (b).
