Figure 1: The framework of our proposed residual non-local attention network for image restoration.
Figure 2: Residual (non-)local attention block. It mainly consists of trunk branch (labelled with graydashed) and mask branch (labelled with red dashed). The trunk branch consists of t RBs. The maskbranch is used to learning mixed attention maps in channel- and spatial-wise simultaneously.
Figure 3: Non-local block. Red dashed line denotes matrix reshaping. HX WX C means C featureswith height H and width W.. 0 denotes matrix multiplication. L denotes element-wise addition.
