Figure 1: Illustration of AQM+ applied for GuessWhich task. The goal of GuessWhich is to figureout a correct answer out of 9,628 test images by asking a sequence of questions.
Figure 2: Architecture of AQM+ and comparative models. SL and RL have their main neuralmodules as Qgen Pt and QSCore f *, while AQM has aprxAgen P USed for QPoSt P and Qinfo I.
Figure 3: Test percentile mean ranks on GuessWhich experiments.
Figure 4: Left column shows the results of ablation studies on no caption experiments. Right columnshows the result of ablation studies on random candidate answers experiments, where candidateanswers are sampled from the training data.
Figure 5: The result of ablation studies on different sizes of the subsets of candidate questions,answers, and classes. In the subfigure (a), the size for three subsets are the same to K .
Figure 6: Qualitative results on image retrieval of AQM+. Left column shows true images and theircorresponding caption, and right column contains selected top-k images.

Figure 8: Ablation study on no caption experiment. The results of the non-delta setting with depAand trueA are illustrated.
Figure 9: Ablation study on the model with AQM+’s question-generator and SL’s guesser.
Figure 10: Ablation study on gen1Q. The candidate questions are generated only at the first turn.
Figure 11: Ablation study on randQ. The candidate questions are extracted from the training data.
