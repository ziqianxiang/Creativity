Figure 1: An example Karel synthesis task, where the goal is to synthesize the program in (b) giventhe two I/O examples shown in (a). See the Appendix for more details about Karel.
Figure 2: Comparison of generalization accuracies across the datasets given in Table 1 plus perfor-mance on the original test set. The training datasets used for both models (denoted Baseline andUniform) contained the same programs; however, for Uniform, we sampled new I/O grids used tospecify the programs, with homogenized salient random variables, as described in Section 4.2.
Figure 3: Evaluation of models that were trained on narrow distributions. When evaluated on theirown training distribution, they consistently achieved similar results. When evaluated on a differentnarrow distribution, the performance was rarely similar and usually very low.
Figure 4: (a) The DSL of Karel programs taken from Bunel et al. (2018), and (b) a declarativespecification of the space of valid input worlds for Karel programs.
Figure 5: Number of samples required by salient variable homogenization parameterized by an Îµbefore a new sample is returned.
