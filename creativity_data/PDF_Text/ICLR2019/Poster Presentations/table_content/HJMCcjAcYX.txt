Table 1: Mean squared error of image mosaic reconstruction for different datasets and number of tilesan image is split into. Lower is better. LinAssign* is the model by Mena et al. (2018), LinAssign isour reproduction of their model, PO-U and PO-LA are our models with uniform and linear assignmentinitialisation respectively.
Table 2: Accuracy of classification from implicitly-learned image reconstructions through permu-tations. max shows the accuracy of the pre-trained model on the original images, min shows theaccuracy of the pre-trained model on images with randomly permuted tiles.
Table 3: Accuracy on VQA v2 validation set, mean of 10 runs. The sample standard deviation overthese runs is shown after the Â± symbol. Overall includes the other three question categories.
Table 4: Accuracy of image mosaic reconstruction. Higher is better. A permutation is consideredcorrect if all tiles are placed correctly. Because of indistinguishable tiles at higher tile counts (forexample multiple completely blank tiles on MNIST) it becomes very unlikely to guess the correctground-truth matching at higher tile counts. LinAssign* results come from Mena et al. (2018).
