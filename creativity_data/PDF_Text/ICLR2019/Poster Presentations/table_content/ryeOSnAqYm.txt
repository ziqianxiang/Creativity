Table 1: Generalization accuracies of the baseline model and a model trained on a uniform I/Odistribution, on selected datasets. G, U, and A stand for Geom(0.5), U {1, . . . 9} and 10-Geom(0.5)respectively. See Section 4.2 for dataset generation details, and Section 5.1 for details about theUniform model.
Table 2: Results on programs only containing actions. The generalization accuracy on action-onlyprograms in the existing test set is 99.24%. See Section 5 for details on Action-Only Augmented.
