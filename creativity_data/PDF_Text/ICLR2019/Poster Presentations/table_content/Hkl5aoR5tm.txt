Table 2: In the unpaired setting (as defined in Section 3.2), we compute the median score (acrossrandom seeds) and report the best attainable score across considered optimization hyperparameters.
Table 3:	Reduction in FID over a large class of hyperparameter settings, losses, regularization,and normalization schemes. We observe from 4.3% to 33% decrease in FID. When applied tothe resnet architecture, independently of the loss, regularization, and normalization, self-modalways outperforms the baseline. For SNDCGAN we observe an improvement in 87.5% of the cases(all except two on lsun-bedroom).
