Table 1: Forward prediction, collision normal estimation and COR estimation (test set). We evaluate ourmodel and compare to baselines on the task of forward prediction, collision normal and COR estimation. Wereport median distance in centimeters to observed post-bounce trajectories for each experimental setting.
Table 2: Bounce and Learn ablative evaluation (val set). We evaluate our models in different trainingsettings on the task of forward prediction, collision normal and COR estimation. We report median distance incentimeters to observed post-bounce trajectories for each experimental setting. Please see the text for details.
Table 3: Spatial Regularization Ablation (val set). We present an ablative study of the effect of spatialregulation on the Bounce and Learn model. We report median distance in centimeters to observed post-bouncetrajectories for each experimental setting. We also evaluate the predicted normals and CORs.
Table 4: Bounce and Learn with estimated collision points (test set). We evaluate our model on the task offorward prediction, collision normal and restitution estimation under the absence of impact location annotationsin the scene image.
Table 5: Comparison to Interaction Networks. We evaluate our Center-based PIM model and InteractionNetworks (Battaglia et al., 2016) on 10000 simulated trajectories. We report median distance in centimeters toground truth post-bounce location at t=0.1s. Please see the text for details.
