Table 3: We evaluate ResNet adversaries on unseen models and show that parametric adversarial exam- ples also share across models. The table shows the success rate of attacks (%).			Table 4: We compute parametric adver- saries using a subset of views (#Views) and evaluate the success rates (%) of at- tacks on unseen views.

An ad-versary normally requires less than 10 itera-tions, thus takes a few seconds.

Our runtime depends on the number of pixels requiring derivatives.
