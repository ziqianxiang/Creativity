Table 1: Error correction results on the vector representation. The performance of path integral is measuredby mean square error between predicted locations and ground truth locations; while for path planning, theperformance is measured by success rate. Experiments are conducted using several noise levels: Gaussiannoise with different standard deviations in terms of the reference standard deviation s and dropout mask withdifferent percentages. DE means implementing decoding-encoding process when performing the tasks.
Table 2: Path integral results with noises in the self-motion. Performance is measured by mean square error(MSE) between the predicted locations and ground truth locations in the path integral task. Noises are added toself-motions âˆ†x by several noise levels: Gaussian noise with different standard deviations in terms of numberof grids. Reference MSE is computed by path integral in 2D coordinates.
