Table 1: The domain specific language (DSL) for 3D shapes. Semantics depends on the types ofobjects that are modeled, i.e., semantics for vehicle and furniture should be different. For details ofDSL in our experimental setting, please refer to supplementary.
Table 2: Shape reconstruction results on ShapeNet, evaluated in intersection over union (IoU, higheris better), Chamfer distance (CD, lower is better), and Earth Moverâ€™s distance (EMD, lower is better).
Table 3: Measurement of stability and connectivity. Our model is able to capture shape regularity suchas symmetry. Therefore, shapes represented by our programs are more stable and better connected.
Table 4: Shape reconstruction results on unseen categories. Results with or without guided adaptationin intersection over union (IoU, higher is better) and Chamfer distance (CD, lower is better).
Table 5: The list of semantics and shapes, as well as associated parameters used by our modelA.2 Architecture DetailsProgram Generator. The program executor contains a 3D ConvNet and two LSTMS. (1) 3DConvNet. This 3D ConvNet is the first part of the program generator model. It consists of 8 3Dconvolutional layers. The kernel size of each layer is 3 except for the first one whose kernel size is 5.
