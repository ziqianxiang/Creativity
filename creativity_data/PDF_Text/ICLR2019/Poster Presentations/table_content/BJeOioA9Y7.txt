Table 1: Comparison with PathNet (Fernando et al., 2017) and progressive neural network(PNN) (Rusu et al., 2016b). Since PathNet and PNN don’t report exact scores we obtain theirnumbers from their plots and indicate that with a 〜symbol. The results of the state-of-the-artmethods: A3C (Mnih et al., 2016), PPO (Schulman et al., 2017), and ACKTR (Wu et al., 2017) onAtari games are also listed for reference.
Table 2: Comparison with fine-tuning and baseline A3C on different environment/teacher settings. Thesubscript following each number indicate the teachers being used. E.g., (alien, space I.) indicates that oneteacher is an alien expert and the other is a space invaders expert.
Table 3: Test Error (%) on CIFAR-10/100. The parentheses following “Ours” indicates the teacherswe use. I.e., ‘Ours (SVHN, C100)’ indicates that we use an SVHN expert and a C100 expert asteachers.
