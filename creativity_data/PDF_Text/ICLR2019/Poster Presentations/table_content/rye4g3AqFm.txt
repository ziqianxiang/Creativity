Table 1: Mean generalization errors and PAC-Bayes bounds for the convolutional and fully con-nected network for 0 label corruption, for a sample of 10000 from different datasets. The networksare the same as in Figure 3 (4 layer CNN and 1 layer FC)7	SGD versus Bayesian samplingIn this section we test the assumption that SGD samples parameters close to uniformly within thezero-error region. In the literature, Bayesian sampling of the parameters of a neural network hasbeen argued to produce generalization performance similar to the same network trained with SGD.
