Table 1: NeuroSAT’s performance at test time on SR(40) after training on SR(U(10, 40)). Italmost never guesses sat on unsatisfiable problems. On satisfiable problems, it correctly guesses sat73% of the time, and we can decode a satisfying assignment for 70% of the satisfiable problems byclustering the literal embeddings L(T) as described in §6.
