Table 1: Quantitative comparison of the SWAE and WAE-GAN using the sliced-Wasserstein distancewith discriminant slices in the latent space, SW(pZ, qZ), and the output space, SW(pX,pY ). Thedistribution in the 64-dimensional latent space, qZ, was set to Normal. We also report the negativelog-likelihood of {zi = φ(xi)} with repect to qZ for 1000 testing samples for both datasets. We didnot use Nowizin’s trick for the GAN models.
Table 2: FID score statistics (N = 5) at finaliteration of training. Lower is better. Scoreswere computed with 104 random samples fromthe testing set against an equivalent amount ofgenerated samples.
