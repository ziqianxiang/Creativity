Table 1: Common GAN objective functions.
Table 2: Hit ratios (Hr), hit distances (Hd), cover errors (Ce) results. Note, if the model failed tocapture all the modes of real data, by definition its cover error is âˆž. In that case, we report theaveraged KL-divergence on modes captured by the model in brackets.
Table 3: Inception score and FID results on CIFAR-10. Results of each model trained with 4 differentGAN objectives are all reported.
Table 4: Inception score and FID results on STl-10 and ImageNet. Each model is trained withGAN-NS objective.
Table 5: Configuration of four models in comparison.
