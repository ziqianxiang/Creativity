Table 1: Train and test accuracies before and after spectral normalization for various datasets, networkarchitectures, and training schemes. The amount of spectral normalization was selected from 4-6values of β via cross validation on 500 samples. For each row, the greater test accuracy is bolded(both are bolded in the event of a tie). '∞ adversarial training was performed with magnitude 0.1.
Table 2: Runtime increase after introducing spectral normalization for various datasets, networkarchitectures, and training schemes. These ratios were obtained by running the experiments on oneNVIDIA Titan Xp GPU for 40 epochs.
Table 3: Runtime increase of the proposed spectral normalization approach compared to Miyato et al.
