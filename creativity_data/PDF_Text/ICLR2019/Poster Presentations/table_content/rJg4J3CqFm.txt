Table 1: Change in the 5-nearest neighbors when increasing dimensionality of each point cloud withfixed total length of representation.
Table 2: Performance on a number of similarity benchmarks when dimensionality of point cloudsincrease given a fixed total number of parameters. The middle block shows the performance of theproposed models. The right block shows the performance of baselines. The training corpus sizewhen known appears below each model name.
