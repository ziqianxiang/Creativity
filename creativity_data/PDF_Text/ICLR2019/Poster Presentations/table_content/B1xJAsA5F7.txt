Table 1: Translation performance on penalized logP task. GCPN results are copied from You et al. (2018a). We rerun JT-VAE under our setup to ensure all results are comparable.

This task is challenging as the target range contains onlythe top 6.6% of molecules in the ZINC dataset. We extracted a training set of 88K molecule pairswith similarity constraint δ = 0.4. The test set contains 800 molecules.
