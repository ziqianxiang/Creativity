Table 1: Examples of interesting sample operations which need to be adapted (’matched’) if we wantthe distribution of the result y to match the prior distribution.
Table 2: Inception scores on LLD-icon, LSUN, CIFAR-10 and CelebA for the midpoints of linearinterpolation and its matched counterpart. Scores are reported as mean ± standard deviation (relativechange in %). Our matched variants fully recover from the (up to 29%) score drop of the linearinterpolation, giving the same quality as random samples.
Table 3: We measure over the average (normalized) perturbation ∣y — y∣∣p∕∣∣y∣∣p incurred by ourmatched interpolation for the latent spaces used in Table 2, for p = 1, 2.
