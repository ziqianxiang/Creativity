Table 1: Quantitative evaluation results of other algorithms and proposed methods (DCUnet-20,Large-DCUnet-20). Higher score means better performance where bold text indicates highest scoreper evaluation measure.

All evaluation measureswere computed by using open source implementation.2	CSIG	CBAK	COVL	PESQ	SSNRWiener (Scalart et al., 1996)	3.23	2.68	2.67	2.22	5.07SEGAN (Pascual et al., 2017)	3.48	2.94	2.80	2.16	7.73Wavenet (Rethage et al., 2018)	3.62	3.23	2.98	-	-MMSE-GAN (Soni et al., 2018)	3.80	3.12	3.14	2.53	-DeeP Feature Loss (Germain et al., 2018)	3.86	3.33	3.22	-	-DCUnet-20 (ours)	4.24	4.00	3.69	3.13	15.95Large-DCUnet-20 (ours)	4.34	4.10	3.81	3.24	16.85For comparison, we used the configuration of using a 20-layer Deep Complex U-Net (DCUnet-20) to estimate a tanh bounded cRM, optimized with weighted-SDR loss. As a showcase for thepotential of our approach, we also show results from a larger DCUnet-20 (Large-DCUnet-20) whichhas more channels in each layer. Both architectures are specified in detail in Appendix B. Resultsshow that our proposed method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods with respect to allmetrics by a large margin. Additionally, we can also see that larger models yield better performance.
Table 2: Table of quantitative evaluation results with corresponding mask and loss function in threedifferent model configurations (DCU-10, DCU-16 and DCU-20). The bold font indicates the bestloss function when fixing the masking method. The underline indicates the best masking methodwhen fixing the loss function.
Table 3: Table of quantitative evaluation results from three different settings (cRMCn: Complex-valued output/Complex-valued network, cRMRn: Complex-valued output/Real-valued network, andRMRn: Real-valued output/Real-valued network) to show the appropriateness of using complex-valued networks for speech enhancement. Bold font indicates the best results.
Table 4: Preference scores of DCUnet compared to other baseline models. The scores were ob-tained by calculating the relative frequency the subjects prefer one method to the other method.
Table 5: Phase distance and phase improvement under four different SNR conditions. The Spc, Wav,and wSDR column show results from models trained with three different objectives Spectrogram-MSE, Wave-MSE, and weighted-SDR, respectively.
Table 6: The performance difference between conventional method (without phase estimation) andour method (with phase estimation). The performance difference is presented with four differentSNR values of mixture in test set.
Table 7: Pairwise preference scores of four models including DCUnet. The scores are ob-tained by calculating the relative frequency the subjects prefer one method to the other method.
