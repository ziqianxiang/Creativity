Table 1: A sample sequence y* from the Wall Street Journal dataset, where the model's prediction eis not perfect. The optimal next characters for each prefix of ye based on edit distance are shown inblue. For example, for the prefix “as_e” there are 3 optimal next characters of “e”, “h”, and “_”. Allof these 3 characters when combined with proper suffixes will result in a total edit distance of 1.
Table 2: Each row corresponds to a prefix of “SATRAPY” and shows edit distances with all prefixesof “SUNDAY”. We also show OCD targets (optimal extensions) for each prefix, and minimum valuealong each row, denoted mi (see (8)). We highlight the trace path for Dedit(“Satrapy”, “Sunday”).
Table 3: WSJ Character Error Rate (CER) and Word Error Rate (WER) of different baselines.
Table 4: Character Error Rate (CER) and Word Error Rate (WER) results on the end-to-end speechrecognition WSJ task. We report results of our Optimal Completion Distillation (OCD) model, andwell-tuned implementations of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and Scheduled Sampling (SS).

Table A.1: Top: Each row corresponds to a prefix of “SATURDAY” and shows edit distances withall prefixes of “SUNDAY"，along with the optimal targets and their Q *-value at that step. Thehighlighted cells indicate cells with minimum edit distance at each row. Bottom: An example ofappending suffixes of “SUNDAY” with minimum edit distance to the prefix “SA”.
