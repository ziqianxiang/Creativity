Table 1: FC networks on MNIST dataset. #CLR is the number of complete linear regions amongthe 10K testing points, and ^χ,p shows the 'p margin for each r ∈ {25,50,75,100} percentile Pr.
Table 2: Running time for a gradient descent step of FC networks on MNIST dataset. The fullsetting refers to Eq. (9) (γ = 100), and 3-samples refers to approximating Eq. (10) with 3 samples.
Table 3: RNNs on the Japanese Vowel dataset.	^x,p shows the 'p margin for each r ∈{25, 50, 75, 100} percentile Pr in the testing data (the larger the better).
Table 4: ResNet on Caltech-256. Here ∆(x, x0, y) denotes '1 gradient distortion ∣∣Vχo fθ (x0)y -Vχfθ (x)y∣ι (the smaller the better for each r percentile Pr among the testing data).
