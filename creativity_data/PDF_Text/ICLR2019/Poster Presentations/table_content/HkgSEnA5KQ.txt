Table 1: Mean completion rates on test tasks for baseline methods and ours across 5 random seeds.
Table 2: Ablation Experiments analyzing the importance of various components of the model onthe multi-room env. We see that removing previous corrections (only ci) performs the worst, whileremoving instruction L is less impactful.
Table 3: Mean completion rates on testtasks for 5, 7, 10 corrections. Only up to5 corrections are seen during training.
Table 4: Experiments investigating different correction types and effect on performance (meancompletion). The experiments agree with intuition that binary carries little information and results ina small increase of the completion rate. Directional corrections which gives an intermediate amountof information result in a fair increase in performance, but less than fully specified correction.
Table 5: Experiments on holding out specific objects during training to see if our method cangeneralize to Unseen objects at test time.
