Table 1: Classes used in the Restricted ImageNet model. The class ranges are inclusive.
Table 2: Value of ε used for adversarial training/evaluation of each dataset and `p -norm.
Table 3: Value of ε used for large-ε adversarial examples of Figure 3.
Table 4: Standard and robust accuracy corresponding to robust training with half natural and halfadversarial samples. The accuracies correspond to standard, robust and half-half training.
Table 5: Comparison of performance of linear classifiers trained on a binary MNIST dataset withstandard and adversarial training. The performance of both models is evaluated in terms of standardand adversarial accuracy. Adversarial accuracy refers to the percentage of examples that are correctlyclassified after being perturbed by the adversary. Here, we use an '∞ threat model with ε = 0.20(with images scaled to have coordinates in the range [0, 1]).
