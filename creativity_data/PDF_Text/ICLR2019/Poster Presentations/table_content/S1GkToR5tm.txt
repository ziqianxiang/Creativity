Table 1: Results with and without DRS on 10,000 generated samples from a model of a 2D grid ofGaussian components.
Table 2: Results with and without DRS on 50K ImageNet samples. LoW FID and high IS are better.
Table 3: Ablation study on 10,000 generated samples from a 2D grid of Gaussian components. Thethird to sixth columns represent % of high-quality samples within x standard deviations. “No FT”stands for the discriminator not being trained to convergence.
