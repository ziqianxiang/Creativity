Table 3: Accuracy on the Karel test set. In the “Training”column, we use “MLE” and “Exec” toindicate the training approaches proposed in (Bunel et al., 2018) and this work, “SL” and “RL” toindicate supervised learning and reinforcement learning respectively. In the “Ensemble” column,dash indicates that no ensemble is used, “S” and “MV” indicate the shortest and majority voteprinciples respectively. For the single model accuracy, we report the results of the model with thebest generalization accuracy. We include 15 models in each ensemble.
