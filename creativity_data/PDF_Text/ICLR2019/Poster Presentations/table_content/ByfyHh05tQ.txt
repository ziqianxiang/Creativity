Table 1: Fraction of solved target structures for MCTS-RNA, antaRNA, RL-LS, RNAInverse, LEARNA,Meta-LEARNA, and Meta-LEARNA-Adapt on the two benchmarks from the literature (Eterna100 andRfam-Taneda), as well as on our newly introduced benchmark (Rfam-Learn-Test). A target structurecounts as solved if a solution was found in any of the evaluation runs.
Table 2: Overview on the three benchmarks Eterna100 (Anderson-Lee et al., 2016), Rfam-Taneda(Taneda, 2011) and Rfam-Learn we used for our experiments. The table displays the timeout, thenumber of evaluations for each target structure, the number of sequences and the range of sequencelengths for the corresponding benchmark.
Table 3: Search space for the agentâ€™s architecture and the hyperparameters used for LEARNA.
Table 4: Modified hyperparameters in the search space used for optimizing Meta-LEARNA comparedto Table 3. We adapted these ranges slightly based on preliminary experiments. We hypothesize thatthe longer training time and the parallel training require smaller learning rates and larger regulariza-tion.
