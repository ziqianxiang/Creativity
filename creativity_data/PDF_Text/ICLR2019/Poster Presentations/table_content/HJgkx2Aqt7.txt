Table 1: Segmentation Car IoU on the unseen KITTI test set for a ResNet-50 segmentation networktrained using synthetic data generated by random parameters or learned parameters using randomsearch or learning to simulate (LTS) for 600 epochs of each. We test the epoch with highest validationreward on the KITTI test set. We also report the maximum car IoU obtained by training on 982annotated real KITTI training images.
