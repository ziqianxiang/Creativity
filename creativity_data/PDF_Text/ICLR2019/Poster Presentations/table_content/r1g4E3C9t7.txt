Wesummarize our work in Table 1 and list some basic results. For Commander, due to unreleased train-ing data, we are not able to train an autoencoder. For GA and Opt we have sufficient data to trainautoencoder.

We also explore different val-ues of k and we observe that the results do not vary too much (detailed results can be found in TableA6 in Appendix). When k = 4/5, the AUC score based on CER can reach 0.969, which shows thatsuch temporal dependency based method is indeed promising in terms of distinguishing adversarialinstances. Interestingly, these results suggest that the temporal dependency based method wouldsuggest an easy-implemented but effective method for characterizing adversarial audio attacks.
