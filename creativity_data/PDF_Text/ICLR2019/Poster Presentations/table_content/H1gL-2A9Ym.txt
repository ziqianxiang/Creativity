Table 1: Dataset statistics. Shortest path length is denoted by SP.
Table 2: Average accuracy with uncertainties showing the 95 % confidence level calculated by boot-strapping. Previously reported improvements vanish on our rigorous experimental setup, whilePPNP and APPNP significantly outperform the compared models on all datasets.
Table 3: Average training time per epoch. PPNP and APPNP are only slightly slower than GCN andmuch faster than more sophisticated methods like GAT.
Table 4: Average macro F1 score with uncertainties showing the 95 % confidence level calculatedby bootstrapping. PPNP achieves the highest F1 score on all datasets investigated.
Table 5: p-value of the paired t-test with respect to accuracy.
Table 6: p-value of the paired t-test with respect to F1 score.
