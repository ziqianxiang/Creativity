Table 1: Data sets used for variational phylogenetic posterior estimation, and marginal likelihoodestimates of different methods across datasets. The marginal likelihood estimates of all variationalmethods are obtained by importance sampling using 1000 samples. We run stepping-stone in Mr-Bayes using default settings with 4 chains for 10,000,000 iterations and sampled every 100 iterations.
