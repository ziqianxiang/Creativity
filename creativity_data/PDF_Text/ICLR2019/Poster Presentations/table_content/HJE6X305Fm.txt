Table 1: FID scores on CIFAR10 and FID on Celeb-A for various GAN losses and regularizations.
Table 2: Performance under different experimental setups.
Table 3: GAN Architecture for our experiments on CIFAR-10 and CelebA. Note that CelebA followsthe same architecture, but the generator has a few more upsampling and processing blocks to outputan image of the correct size.
