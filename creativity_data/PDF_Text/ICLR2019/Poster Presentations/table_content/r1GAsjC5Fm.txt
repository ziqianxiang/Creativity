Table 1: Performance comparison with the state of arts: Student-forcing (Anderson et al., 2018b),RPA (Wang et al., 2018b), and Speaker-Follower (Fried et al., 2018). *: with data augmentation.
Table 2: Ablation study showing the effect of each proposed component. All methods use thepanoramic action space. Note that, for methods using beam search during inference, only the lastselected trajectory is used for evaluating OSR and SPL. *: we implemented the model from Speaker-Follower (Fried et al., 2018) with panoramic action space as baseline.
