The inferred representa-tions are fed into the generative model pθ and the resulting sequences are compared to the originalsequence.
Table 3: Average absolute angle error (mean ± standard deviation) for action-conditioned videoprediction. Note that we could not detect angles on some sequences for the action-conditionedbaseline of Oh et al. (2015) trained on only 100 sequences due to bad prediction quality.
