Table 1: Attention Model (AM) vs baselines. The gap % is w.r.t. the best value across all methods.
Table 2: Epoch durations and results and with different seeds and learning rate schedules for TSP.
Table 3: Additional results for the OPTable 3 displays the results for the OP with constantand uniform prize distributions. The results are sim-ilar to the results for the prize distribution based onthe distance to the depot, although by the calculationtime for Gurobi it is confirmed that indeed constantand uniform prize distributions are easier.
