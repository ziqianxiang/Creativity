Table 2: Performance comparison of 12 different predictive models in Setting B (trained on synthetic, tested onreal) in terms of AUROC and AUPRC (the generators of PATE-GAN and DPGAN are (1, 10-5)-differentiallyprivate) over 6 different datasets. GAN is (∞, ∞)-differentially private and is given to indicate an upper boundof PATE-GAN and DPGAN.
Table 3: Synthetic Ranking Probability of PATE-GAN and the benchmark when comparing Setting A andSetting C for various (with δ = 10-5) in terms of AUROC. The Synthetic Ranking Agreement of OriginalGAN is 0.9091, which is also attained by both PATE-GAN and DPGAN for = 50.
