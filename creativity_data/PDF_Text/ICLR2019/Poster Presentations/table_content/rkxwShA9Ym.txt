Table 1: Accuracies and Jaccard, or average intersection over union (IOU), scores on several datasets and models. Note that we train models with high-resolution data from only the Maryland 2013training region and low-resolution data from the region on which they are tested. We give bothoverall metrics and those on areas labeled with NLCD “Developed, {Open, Low, Medium, High}Intensity” classes.
Table 2: Area Under receiver operating characteristic Curve (AUC) results of super-resolving low-resolution lymphocyte infiltration probability maps to individual lymphocyte segmentation, on thelymphocyte classification dataset from Hou et al. (2018). A testing image patch is classified aslymphocyte/non-lymphocyte by our method if its center pixel is segmented as lymphocyte/non-lymphocyte respectively. All HR baseline methods are directly evaluated on the classification datasetby four-fold cross-validation and reported by Hou et al. (2018). Our weakly supervised methodperforms effectively as well as the best-performing baseline method with cell-level supervision. *:Hard naive achieves 0.50 AUC because there is no positive HR label, due to hard label assignment.
