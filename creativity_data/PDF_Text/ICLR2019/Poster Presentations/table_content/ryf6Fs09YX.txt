Table 1: Best obtained ELBOs for discrete variational autoencoders. Results of REBAR and RELAX areobtained by running the released code4 from Grathwohl et al. (2017). All methods are run with the same learningrate for 1, 000, 000 iterations.
Table 2: Inception scores on quan-tized MNIST. BGAN’s results arerun with the author-released codehttps://github.com/rdevon/BGAN.
Table 3: Variable-nabla examples. Note y is a scalar random variable.
Table 4: Average running time per 100 iterations for discrete variational autoencoders. Results of REBAR andRELAX are obtained by running the released code5 from Grathwohl et al. (2017). The same computer with oneTitan Xp GPU is used.
