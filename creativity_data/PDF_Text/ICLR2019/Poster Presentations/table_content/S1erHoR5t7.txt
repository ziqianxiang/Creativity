Table 1: Frechet Inception Distance (FID) at exactly 100k generator iterations on the CIFAR-10dataset using stable setups with different GAN loss functions. We used spectral norm in D and batchnorm in G. All models were trained using the same a priori selected seed (seed=1).
Table 2: Minimum (min), maximum (max), mean, and standard deviation (SD) of the FrechetInception Distance (FID) calculated at 20k, 30k . . . , 100k generator iterations on the CAT datasetwith different GAN loss functions. The hyper-parameters used were lr = .0002, β = (.50, .999),nD = 1, and batch norm (BN) in D and G. All models were trained using the same a priori selectedseed (seed=1). Note: A missing number imply that the model did not converge and became stuck inthe first few iterations.______________________________________________Loss	Min	Max	Mean	SD64x64 images (N=9304)				SGAN	16.56	310.56	52.54	96.81RSGAN	19.03	42.05	32.16	7.01RaSGAN	15.38	33.11	20.53	5.68LSGAN	20.27	224.97	73.62	61.02RaLSGAN	11.97	19.29	15.61	2.55HingeGAN	17.60	50.94	32.23	14.44RaHingeGAN	14.62	27.31	20.29	3.96RSGAN-GP	16.41	22.34	18.20	1.82RaSGAN-GP	17.32	22	19.58	1.81128x128 images (N=6645)				SGAN	-	-	-	-RaSGAN	21.05	39.65	28.53	6.52
Table 3: An illustrative example of the discriminator’s output in standard GAN as traditionallydefined (P (xr is real) = sigmoid(C(xr))) versus the Relativistic average Discriminator (RaD)(P(Xr is real|C(Xf)) = Sigmoid(C(Xr) - C(Xf))). Breads represent real images, while dogsrepresent fake images.
Table 4: Frechet Inception Distance (FID) at exactly 100k generator iterations on the CIFAR-10dataset using unstable setups with different GAN loss functions. Unless otherwise specified, we usedlr = .0002, β = (.50, .999), nD = 1, and batch norm (BN) in D and G. All models were trainedusing the same a priori selected seed (seed=1).
