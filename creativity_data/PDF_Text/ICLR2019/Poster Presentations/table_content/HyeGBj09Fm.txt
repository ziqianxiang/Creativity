Table 1: Performance and setup details of our 4D data sets in the Android app measured on aSamsung S8 device. The ”defo. align” step contains alignment and rescaling of the deformations.
Table 2: Overview of our 2D and 4D simulation and machine learning setups. Timings were mea-sured on a Xeon E5-1630 with 3.7GHz. Res, SDF and Defo denote resolutions for simulation, train-ing, and the NN deformation, respectively; Sim and Train denote simulation and training runtimes.
