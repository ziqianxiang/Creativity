We evaluate our algorithm on horse 什 zebra with a human perceptualstudy. We randomly selected 50 images from the horse2zebra test set and showed the input imagesand three generated images from CycleGAN, DistanceGAN and HarmonicGAN (with generatedimages in random order). 10 participants were asked to score the generated images on a Likert scalefrom 1 to 5 (as above). As shown in Table 4, the participants give the highest score to the proposedmethod (in 72% of cases), significantly more often than CycleGAN (in 28% of cases). Additionally,the average Likert score of our method was 3.60, outperforming 3.16 of CycleGAN and 1.08 ofDistanceGAN, indicating that our method generates better results.
