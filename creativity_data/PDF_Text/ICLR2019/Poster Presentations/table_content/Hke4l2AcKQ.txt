Table 1: Image modeling results on dynamically binarized MNIST and OMNIGLOT.
Table 2: Performance of unsupervised clustering and semi-supervised classification. For eachexperiment, we report the average over 5 runs.
Table 3: Density estimation performance on CIFAR-10. Negative log-likelihood is evaluated with512 importance samples.
Table 4: Density estimation results on dynamically binarized MNIST. RE and KL correspond to thereconstruction error and the KL term in ELBO. MPD is the mutual posterior diversity in (4), andSTD is the corresponding standard deviation in (6).
Table 5: Performance of semi-supervised classification using SVM classifiers with linear and RBFkernels. For each experiment, we report the average and standard deviation over 5 runs.
