Table 1: The predicted precisions required for all accumulations of our considered networks. Each table entryis an ordered tuple of two values which correspond to the predicted mantissa precision of both normal andchunk-based accumulations, respectively. The precision requirements of FWD and BWD are typically smallerthan those of GRAD. The latter needs the most precision for layers/blocks close to the input as the size of thefeature maps is highest in the early stages. The benefits of chunking are non linear but range from 1 to 6 bits.
