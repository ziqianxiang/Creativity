Table 1: Average correlation on test set of ourrotation-equivariant CNN, two controls, and sev-eral regular CNNs as baselines. The three numbersfor the CNNs are the number of feature maps ineach layer; other parameters are identical to therotation-equivariant CNN. Standard deviations areacross the top-five models of each type.
