The resultsare shown in Table 5. Some conclusions can be drawn from this experiment: (1) When training query is fixed,increasing the test query will lead to the performance gain. Moreover, even a small test query (e.g., 5) canyield good performance; (2) When test query is fixed, the performance is relatively stable with various trainingquery numbers; (3) If the query number of training matches test, the performance can also be improved withincreasing number.

We relieve this concern from two aspects. On one hand, the few-shot learning problem assumes thattraining examples in each class is quite small (only 1 or 5). In this situation, Eq 3 and the closed-form versioncan be efficiently solved, since the dimension of S is only 80 × 80 (5-way, 1-shot, 15-query) or 100 × 100(5-way, 5-shot, 15-query). On the other hand, there are plenty of prior work on the scalability and efficiencyof label propagation, such as Liang and Li (2018); Fujiwara and Irie (2014), which can extend our work tolarge-scale data.
