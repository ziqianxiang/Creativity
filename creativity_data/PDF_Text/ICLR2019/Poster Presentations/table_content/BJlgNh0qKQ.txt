Table 1: Number of labeled and unla-beled instances in each dataset.
Table 2: (a) Parsing results: unlabeled attachment score / labeled attachment score. We also reportresults with the parser of (Kiperwasser & Goldberg, 2016) which uses a different discriminativeloss for supervised training. (b) Recall / Precision evaluation with respect to dependency lengthsfor the supervised parser and the best semi-supervised parser on the English test set. Bold numbershighlight the main differences. (c) Recall / Precision evaluation with respect to dependency labels formulti-word expressions (mwe), adverbial modifiers (advmod) and appositional modifiers (appos).
