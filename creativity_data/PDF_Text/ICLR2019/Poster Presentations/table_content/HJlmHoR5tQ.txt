Table 1: The evaluation of reward learning on transfer learning tasks. Mean scores (higher the better)with standard deviation are presented over 5 trials.
Table 2: The evaluation of imitation learning on benchmark control tasks. Mean scores (higher thebetter) with standard deviation are presented over 5 trials for each method.
