Table 1: FID score comparisons using neutral architecture. For all GAN-based models listed inthe top section of the table, reported values represent the optimal FID obtained across a large-scalehyperparameter search conducted separately for each dataset (Lucic et al., 2018). Outlier cases (e.g.,severe mode collapse) were omitted, which would have otherwise increased these GAN FID scores.
Table 2: FID scores on CelebA data obtained using the network structure and training protocol from(Tolstikhin et al., 2018). For the 2-Stage VAE, we apply the exact same architecture and trainingepochs without any tuning of hyperparameters.
Table 3: Maximum mean discrepancy be-tween N (0, I) and qφ (z) (first stage); like-wise for qφ0 (u) (second stage).
