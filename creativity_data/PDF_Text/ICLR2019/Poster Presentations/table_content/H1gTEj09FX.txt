Table 1: Comparison of a fully-connected layer, a regular convolutional layer, and a rotation-equivariantconvolutional layer with group-indexed channels.
Table 2: Test accuracy in the rotMNIST transfer learning eXperiment. The network is trained on 10K up-rightMNIST samples and tested on 50K randomly rotated samples up to the MaXRot degrees.
Table 3: Classification accuracy using non-equivariant CNN and rotation-equivariant ones on rotMNISTand CIFAR10. Baseline DCF (Qiu et al., 2018) and SFCNN (Weiler et al., 2017). “# param.” is number ofparameters in all convolutional layers, and “Ratio” indicates the proportion to the # param. of the regular CNN.
Table A.1: Conv-3 network architectures used in rotMNIST, M = 32, 16 or 8. cLxLxM 0 xM stands for aconvolutional layer of patch size LxL and input (output) channel M0 (M). apLxL stands for LxL average-pooling. In the RotDCF Net, rcLxLxNθ xM 0 xM stands for a rotation-indexed convolutional layer, whichincludes Nθ -times many number of filters except for the 1st rc layer (see Section 2). Batch-normalizationlayers (not shown) are used during training.
Table A.2: Conv-6 network architectures used in rotMNIST. Similar to Table A.1 with 3 more layers.
Table A.3: Classification accuracy using non-equivariant CNN and rotation-equivariant CNNs on rotMNISTbased on Conv-3, c.f. Table A.1. Similar results to the rotmnist experiments in Table 3 with a net of fewer(three) layers.
Table A.4: VGG-16-like network architectures used in CIFAR10, M = 64 or 32. mpLxL standsfor LxL max-pooling, and other notations similar to Table A.1.
Table A.5: Convolutional Auto-encoder network used in the image reconstruction experiment. Rot-DCF layers are used in the enCoder network, with Nθ = 16, K = 5, Kα = 5 (K = 8, Kα = 15 inthe last RotDCF layer), and transposed-Convolutional layers with upsampling are used in the deCodernet. apLxL stands for LxL average-pooling, and other notations similar to Table A.1.
Table A.6: Network arChiteCtures used in faCe experiments, notations as in Table A.1. In theRotDCF Net, Nθ = 8, K = 5, Kα = 5.
