Table 1: CIFAR-10 and STL-10 results of different frameworks with and without our WC. TheGP and SN based values (without WC) are taken from the corresponding articles (Gulrajani et al.
Table 2: CIFAR-10 experiments using unconditioned (left) or conditioned (right) methods. Most ofthe reported results are taken from (Gulrajani et al. (2017)).

Table 9: The architectures used in the unconditional image generation experiments. All the gen-erators have a tanh nonlinearity at the end. We use WC before each convolutional layer of thegenerators.
Table 10: The architectures used in the conditional image generation experiments. All the generatorshave a tanh nonlinearity at the end. We use cWC before each convolutional layer of the generators,except for the last C3S block in which we use WC.

Table 12: The MNIST and the Fashion-MNIST architectures. Similarly to the architectures in Tab 9-10: (1) All the generators have a tanh nonlinearity at the end, (2) We use WC/cWC before eachconvolutional layer of the generators, (3) In the conditional case, in the last C3S block, cWC isreplaced by WC.
