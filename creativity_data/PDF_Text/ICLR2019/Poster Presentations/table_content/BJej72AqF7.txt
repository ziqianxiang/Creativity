Table 1: Classification accuracies on the (permuted) MNIST and SST-2 test sets for various models. A randominitial hidden state elevates simple RNNs from also-rans to strong competitors of complex, state-of-the-artmodels.
Table 2: Various experiment setup. Curly brackets indicate that we attempted more than one valuefor this experiment.
Table 3: K-nearest neighbor classification accuracies using data reparametrized by RNN comparedto those using raw pixel data. We can see that classification accuracies using RNN reparametrizeddata are much higher than those using raw pixel data for all k’s.
Table 4: Classification accuracy for MNIST dataset under 2 different optimizers, various learningrates and different standard deviation σ in the random initial hidden state. Results suggest RMSproptolerates various choices of σ while SGD works for smaller σ .
