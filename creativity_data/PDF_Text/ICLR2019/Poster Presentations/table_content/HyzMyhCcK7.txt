Table 3: Top-1 classification error of ternarized ResNets on CIFAR-10. Performance is reported inmean(std) over 4 runs, where for PQ-T we report in addition the best of 4 (Bo4).
Table 4: Performances and sign changes on ResNet-20 in mean(std) over 3 full-precision initial-izations and 4 runs per (initialization x method). Sign changes are computed over all quantizedparameters in the net.
Table 5: Performances and sign changes on ResNet-20 in raw data over 3 full-precision initial-izations and 4 runs per (initialization x method). Sign changes are computed over all quantizedparameters in the net.
