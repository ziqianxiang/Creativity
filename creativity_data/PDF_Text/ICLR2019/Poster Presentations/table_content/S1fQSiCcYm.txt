Table 1: Scores achieved by different autoencoders on the synthetic line benchmark (lower is better).
Table 2: Single-layer classifier accuracy achieved by different autoencoders.
Table 3: Clustering accuracy for using K-Means on the latent space of different autoencoders (left)and previously reported methods (right). On the right, “Data” refers to performing K-Means directlyon the data and DEC, RIM, and IMSAT are the methods proposed in (Xie et al., 2016; Krause et al.,2010; Hu et al., 2017) respectively. Results marked * are excerpted from (Hu et al., 2017) and ** arefrom (Xie et al., 2016).
