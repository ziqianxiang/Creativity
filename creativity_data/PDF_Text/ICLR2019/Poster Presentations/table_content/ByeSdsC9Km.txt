Table 1:Omniglot test accuracies for fixed context sizes compared to other baselines.ã€‚For 1000-way classification rotated pseudoclasses are used.)continues writing examples to memory as it sees surprising observations, which allows it to correctfor the distribution shift. After writing 45 examples per class, it reaches an accuracy of 86% (thereare 1000 examples per class in the MNIST test set, so it is not simply memorizing).
