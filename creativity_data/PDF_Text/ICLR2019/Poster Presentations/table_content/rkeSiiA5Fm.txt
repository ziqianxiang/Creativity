Table 1: SHRECâ€™11 classification result using different rotation modes with respect to three typesof shape descriptors. Here, NA = no augmentation, AZ = augmenting training data with azimuthrotations about z-axis, SO(2)(x)=augmenting training data with SO(2) rotations about x-axis , Alt-AZ = augmenting training data with alt-az rotations and SO(3) = augmenting training data withrandom rotations.
Table 2: ModelNet classification result using different perturbation modes of the testing data,demonstrating the rotation invariance property of our network with different types of unseen orien-tations. Here, NR = non-rotated and X/Y denotes, that the network was trained on X and evaluatedon Y.
