Table 1: Verification and identification accuracy on the Cross Ethnicity Faces (CEF) dataset. For supervisedmodels, we report results trained on labeled CAU (SupC) or on labeled CAU, AA, EA domains (SupC,A,E); foradaptation, we evaluate DANN and FTN, without and with multi-class entropy minimization (MCEM).
Table 3: Face verification and recognition performance on LFW and IJB-A. From left to right, verification(VRF), closed-set (CLS) and open-set recognition at FAR = 0.01 and 0.001 (Best-Rowden et al., 2014) on LFW,and verification at different FAR and identification (id.) at rank-k on IJB-A are reported.
Table S1: Network architecture for digit experiments.
Table S2: Network architecture for face experiments.
Table S3: Optimal hyperparameter settings of different adaptation models.
Table S4: Verification precision and recall of clustering methods, such as projection to source example orsource class center, or hierarchical clustering using embeddings of SupC (HDBSCAN) or our proposed FTNmodel. Furthermore, we repeat the clustering using the FTN with multi-class entropy minimization model(FTN+MCEM) and report the clustering accuracy.
