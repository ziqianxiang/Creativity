Table 1: Nudged-SGD optimizes faster and finds a sharper final endpoint with a slightlybetter generalization performance. Experiments on Resnet-32 model on the Cifar-10 dataset.
Table 2: Same as Tab. 1, but for Simple-CNN model. NSGD With γ = 5.0 diverged and Wasexcluded from the Table.
Table 3: Same as Tab. 1, but for Resnet-32 and NSGD using base learning rate η = 0.1.
Table 4: Same as Tab. 1, but for Resnet-32 and NSGD using momentum coefficient 0.9.
Table 5: Same as Tab. 1, but for Simple-CNN and NSGD on the Fashion-MNIST dataset.
Table 6: Same as Tab. 1, but for Resnet-32 and NSGD on the CIFAR-100 dataset.
Table 7: Same as Tab. 1, but for CNN on IMDB dataset.
