Table 1: The results of applying ADef to the images in the MNIST test set and the ILSVRC2012validation set. The accuracy of the Inception and ResNet models is defined as the top-1 accuracy onthe center-cropped and resized images. The success rate of ADef is shown as a percentage of thecorrectly classified inputs. The pixel range is scaled to [0, 1], so the perturbation r = y - x, where xis the input and y the output of ADef, has values in [-1, 1]. The averages in the three last columnsare computed over the set of images on which ADef is successful. Recall the definition of the vectorfield norm in equation (3).

Table 3: The results of applying ADef to the images in the ILSVRC2012 validation set and theInception model, using different values for the standard deviation σ of the Gaussian filter. As before,We define ADef to be successful if ∣∣τ* ||丁 ≤ 3.
