Table 1: Predator Prey (Left): Avg. number of steps taken to complete the episode in three differentenvironment sizes in mixed settings. IC3Net completes the episode faster than the baselines by findingthe prey. Traffic Junction (Right): Success rate on various difficulty levels with zero vision for all.
Table 2: StarCraft Results: Win Ratio and average number of steps taken to complete episodes forexplore (Exp) tasks with 10 Marines (M) on different grid sizes (50×50 and 75×75) and a combat(Cbt) task with 10 Marines (M) vs 3 Zealots (Ze) on a grid of size 50 × 50. IC3Net beats the baselineswith huge margin in case of exploration tasks, while it is as good as CommNet in case of 10 Marinesvs 3 Zealots combat task.
Table 3: Predator-Prey Cooperative: Avg. rewards in three difficulty levels of predator-preyenvironment in cooperative setting. IC3Net performs equivalently or better than baselines consistently.
Table 4: Traffic Junction: Variations in different traffic junction difficulty levels. T refers to True asin the difficulty level has 2-way roads and F refers to False as in the difficulty level has 1-way roads.
