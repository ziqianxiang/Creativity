Table 1: Clean Error, mCE, and Corruption Error values of different corruptions and architectureson ImageNet-C. The mCE value is the mean Corruption Error of the corruptions in Noise, Blur,Weather, and Digital columns. Models are trained only on clean ImageNet images.
Table 2: Clean Error, Relative mCE, and Relative Corruption Errors values of different corruptions andarchitectures on ImageNet-C. All models are trained on clean ImageNet images, not ImageNet-Cimages. Here “BN” abbreviates Batch Normalization (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015).
