Table 3: Contextual bandits regret. Results are relative to the cumulative regret of the Uniform algorithm.
Table 4: Contextual bandits regret. Results are relative to the cumulative regret of the Uniform algorithm.
Table 5: Averaged test RMSE and log-likelihood for the regression benchmarks. We compared BBB, fBNNsand VFE. The numbers a Ã— b represent networks with a hidden layers of b units.
Table 6: Large scale regression. BBB and FBNN used networks with 5 hidden layers of 100 units.
