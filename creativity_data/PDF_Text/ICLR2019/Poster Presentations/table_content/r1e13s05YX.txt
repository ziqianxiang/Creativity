Table 1: The Text-Logic task results: accuracy on the test data using baseline model and EstiNet withonline training, at inference mode, both on varying amounts of training data.
Table 2: Loss performance for the image-addition task on the MNIST test-set. k is the sequencelength of the test set. Loss is mean absolute error. EstiNet results are in Inference mode.
Table 3: Accuracy results for the Image-Lookup task on the MNIST test-set for the three modelconfigurations: train, test, and inference. We also report the accuracy of the argument extractorand estimator. The estimator accuracy is evaluated on the online sampling dataset. k is the digit ofMNIST images in the input, and the dimension of the lookup table.
Table 4: Accuracy results for the text-lookup-logic task of the three model configurations: train, test,and inference with the training procedures: offline, online, and hybrid. Each value in the table iscalculated as an average of ten repeated experiments.
