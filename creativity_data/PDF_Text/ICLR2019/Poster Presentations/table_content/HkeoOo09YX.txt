Table 1: The final performance for the samplers on MNIST, averaged over 10 independent runs.
Table 2: The best performance on CIFAR-10 over 200 epoch , averaged over 5 independent runs. Allthe samplers achieved the best performance after around 190 epochs.
Table 3: The basic statistics for 4 RNN datasets, bold figure represents large difference compared toothers. Size is the number of data point. Avg. Time is the averaged sequence and Energy scale is therough scale of the train NLL when sampler converges.
