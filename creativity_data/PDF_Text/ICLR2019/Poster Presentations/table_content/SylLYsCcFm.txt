Table 1: Test performance of a selection of visual reasoning network architectures trained in thenormal regime and with LABC on the Novel Domain Transfer experiment. The test questionsinclude those with both semantically-plausible and merely perceptually-plausible incorrect answers.
Table 2: Mean (+SD) distance between clusters of RNNhidden state representations. LABC seems to promotegreater distinctions between different abstract relations inthe representation space of models. Since the maximum eu-clidean distance between two points in a 64 dimensional unitcube isPi64 12 = 8, the distances that we observe betweenrelational representations are close to the maximum possible.
