These datasets cover a range ofconfigurations as Social Dataset is a small network with high clustering coefficient and over 2Mevents. In contrast, Github dataset forms a large network with low clustering coefficient and sparseevents thus allowing us to test the robustness of our model. Further, Github dataset contains severalunseen nodes which were never encountered during training.
