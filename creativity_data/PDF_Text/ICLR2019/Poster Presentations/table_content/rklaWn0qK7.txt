Table 1: Comparisons between our models and the baseline solvers. The Conv models are comparedwith Jacobi, and the U-Net models are compared with Multigrid. The numbers are the ratio betweenthe computation costs of our models and the baselines. None of the values are greater than 1, whichmeans that all of our models achieve a speed up on every problem and both performance metric(convolutional layers and multiply-add operations).
