Table 1: Metrics for different models. “+ H” stands for higher frequency resolution, and ”Real Data”is drawn from the test set.
Table 2: Comparison of models generating waveforms directly. Our Waveform GAN baseline per-forms similar to the WaveGAN baseline, but the progressive training does not improve performance,so we only compare to the WaveGAN baseline for the paper. The 8-bit categorical WaveNet outper-forms the 16-bit mixture of logistics, likely due to the decreased stability of the 16-bit model withonly pitch conditioning, despite the increased fidelity.
Table 3: Model architecture for hi-frequency resolution. Low frequency resolution starts with awidth of 4, and height of 8, but is otherwise the same. ”PN” stands for pixel norm, and ”LReLU”stands for leaky rectified linear unit, with a slope of 0.2. The latent vector Z has 256 dimensions andthe pitch conditioning is a 61 dimensional one-hot vector.
