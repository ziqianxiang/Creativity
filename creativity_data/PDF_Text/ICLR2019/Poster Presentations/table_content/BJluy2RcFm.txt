Table 1: Accuracy (and RMSE for the variance task) of various Janossy pooling approximationsunder distinct tasks. The method column refers to the method used to deal with the sum over allpermutations. Infr sample refers to the number of permutations sampled at test time to estimateequation 11 for methods learned with π-SGD. k = 1 corresponds to DeepSets. tanh activations areused with the MLP. Standard deviations computed over 15 runs are shown in parentheses.
