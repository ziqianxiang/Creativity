Table 1: Comparisons of error rates of the baseline and accelerated ResNet-18 models.
Table 2: Comparisons of top-5 error rate increases for VGG-16 on ILSVRC2012 validationset under 3×, 4× and 5× speed-up constraints. The baseline has a 10.1% top-5 error rate.
Table 3: Comparisons of the memory accesses and peak memory usage of the ILSVRC2012classifiers with FBS respectively under 3× and 2× inference speed-ups. The Weights andActivations columns respectively show the total amount of weight and activation accessesrequired by all convolutions for a single image inference. The Peak Memory Usagecolumns show the peak memory usages with different batch sizes.
Table 4: The network structure of M-CifarNet for CIFAR-10 classification. In addition, weprovide a detailed per-layer MACs comparison between FBS, NS, and the composition ofthem (NS+FBS). We minimize the models generated by the three methods while maintain-ing a classification accuracy of at least 90.5%.
