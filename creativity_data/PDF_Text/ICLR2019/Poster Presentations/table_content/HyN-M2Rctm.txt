Table 1: Test set error rates (%) of batch norm (BN), instance norm (IN, Ulyanov et al., 2017),layer norm (LN, Ba et al., 2016), and mode norm (MN) in the multi-task setting for a batch size ofN = 128. Shown are average top performances over five initializations alongside standard deviations.
Table 2: Test set error rates (%) for BN, MN, mode group norm (MGN) and group norm (GN) onsmall batch sizes. Shown are average top performances over five initializations alongside standarddeviations.
Table 3:	Test set error rates (%) with BN and MN for NIN and VGG13.
Table 4:	Test error (%) for ResNet20, ResNet56 normalized with BN and MN.
Table 5:	Top-1 and top-5 error rates (%) of ResNet18 on ImageNet ILSVRC12, with BN and MN.
Table 6: Test set error rates (%) of multiple normalization methods in the multi-task setting for largebatch sizes. The table contains average performances over five initializations, alongside their standarddeviation.
