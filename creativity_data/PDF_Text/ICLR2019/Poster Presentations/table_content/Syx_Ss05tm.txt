That is, Crafting adversarial programs torepUrpose ImageNet models to instead Classify CIFAR-10 images. Some examples of the resUltingadversarial images are given in FigUre SUpp. 1. OUr resUlts show that oUr adversarial program wasable to inCrease the aCCUraCy on CIFAR-10 from ChanCe to a moderate aCCUraCy (Table 1). ThisaCCUraCy is near what is expeCted from typiCal fUlly ConneCted networks (Lin et al., 2015) bUt withminimal CompUtation Cost from the adversary side at inferenCe time. One observation is that althoUghadversarial programs trained to Classify CIFAR-10 are different from those that Classify MNIST or
