Table 1: Formulas to recursively track weighted averages.
Table 2: Simple load balancing. The faster worker can advance both sequences, even when the slowerworker has not yet finished the computation. In the example each worker does H steps of local SGD(denoted by the operator U: Rd → Rd) before writing back the updates to the aggregate X. DUe tothe load balancing, τ ≤ 3H .
