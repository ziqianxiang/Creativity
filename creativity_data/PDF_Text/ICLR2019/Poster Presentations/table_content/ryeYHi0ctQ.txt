The cleaner cost pro-files that ensue from the cost aggregation leadto clearer and edge-preserving depth regression results. As mentioned in a recent study Hu & Mor-dohai (2012), a cost profile that gives confident estimates should have a single, distinct minimum (ormaximum), while an ambiguous profile has multiple local minima or multiple adjacent labels withsimilar costs, making it hard to exactly localize the global minimum. Based on two quantitativeconfidence measures Hu & Mordohai (2012) on cost volumes in Table 4, the proposed aggregationimproves the reliability of the correct match corresponding to the minimum cost.
