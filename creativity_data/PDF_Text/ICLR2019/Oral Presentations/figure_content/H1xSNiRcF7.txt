Figure 1: Comparison between the Order Embedding (vector lattice) and Box Embedding represen-tations for a simple ontology. Regions represent concepts and overlaps represent their entailment.
Figure 2: One-dimensional example demonstrating two disjoint indicators of intervals before andafter the application of a smoothing kernel. The area under the purple product curve is proportionalto the degree of overlap.
Figure 3: Comparison of different overlap functions for two boxes of width 0.3 as a function of theircenters. Note that in order to achieve high overlap, the Gaussian model must drastically lower itstemperature, causing vanishing gradients in the tails.
