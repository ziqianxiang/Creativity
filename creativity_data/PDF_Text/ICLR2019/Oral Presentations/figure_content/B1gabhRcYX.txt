Figure 1: Overview of our BA-Net structure, which consists of a DRN-54 (Yu et al., 2017) asthe backbone network, a Basis Depth Maps Generator that generates a set of basis depth maps,a Feature Pyramid Constructor that constructs multi-scale feature maps, and a BA-Layer thatoptimizes both the depth map and the camera poses through a novel differentiable LM algorithm.
Figure 2: A feature pyramid and some typical channels from different feature maps.
Figure 3: Feature distance maps defined over raw RGB values, pretrained CNN features C3, or ourlearned features F 3 . Our features produce smoother objective function to facilitate optimization.
Figure 4: A single iteration of the differentiable LM.
Figure 5: Network details for the (a) the DRN-54 backbone and (b) the basis depth generator.
Figure 6: The camera pose and the depth errors correspond to different constant Î» values.
Figure 7: Quantitative Comparisons with CodeSLAM (Bloesch et al., 2018) on EUroC MH02. Theerror bars represent the maximum and the minimum errors. The orange and the blue boxes representthe median errors for CodeSLAM and our method.
