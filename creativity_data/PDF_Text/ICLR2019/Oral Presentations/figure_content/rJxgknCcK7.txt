Figure 1: FFJORD transforms a sim-ple base distribution at t0 into the tar-get distribution at t1 by integrating overlearned continuous dynamics.
Figure 2: Comparison of trained Glow, planarCNF, and FFJORD models on 2-dimensional dis-tributions, including multi-modal and discontinu-ous densities.
Figure 3: Samples and data from our image models. MNIST on left, CIFAR10 on right.
Figure 4: The variance of our modelâ€™slog-density estimator can be reduced us-ing neural network architectures with abottleneck layer, speeding up training.
Figure 5: NFE used by the adap-tive ODE solver is approximately inde-pendent of data-dimension. Lines aresmoothed using a Gaussian filter.
Figure 6: For image data, a singleFFJORD flow can achieve near perfor-mance to multi-scale architecture whileusing half the number of evaluations.

MNIST on left, CIFAR10 on rightAppendix B	Experimental Details and Additional ResultsB.1	Density EstimationOn the tabular datasets we performed a grid-search over network architectures. We searched overmodels with 1, 2, 5, or 10 flows with 1, 2, 3, or 4 hidden layers per flow. Since each dataset hasa different number of dimensions, we searched over hidden dimensions equal to 5, 10, or 20 timesthe data dimension (hidden dimension multiplier in Table 4). We tried both the tanh and softplusnonlinearities. The best performing models can be found in the Table 4.
Figure 8: Numerical integration shows that the density under the model does integrate to one givensufficiently low tolerance. Both log and non-log plots are shown.
