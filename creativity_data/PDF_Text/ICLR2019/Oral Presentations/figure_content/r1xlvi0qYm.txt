Figure 1: Writing mechanism in Cached Uniform Writing. During non-writing intervals,the controller hidden states are pushed into the cache. When the writing time comes, thecontroller attends to the cache, chooses suitable states and accesses the memory. The cacheis then emptied.
Figure 2: The accuracy (%) and computation time reduction (%) with different memorytypes and number of memory slots. The controllers/sequence lengths/memory sizes arechosen as LSTM/50/{2, 4, 9, 24} (a&b) and RNN/30/{2, 4, 9, 14} (c&d), respectively.
