Table 1: Frechet Inception Distance (FID, lower is better) and Inception Score (IS, higher is better)for ablations of our proposed modifications. Batch is batch size, Param is total number of param-eters, Ch. is the channel multiplier representing the number of units in each layer, Shared is usingshared embeddings, Skip-z is using skip connections from the latent to multiple layers, Ortho. isOrthogonal Regularization, and Itr indicates if the setting is stable to 106 iterations, or it collapsesat the given iteration. Other than rows 1-4, results are computed across 8 random initializations.
Table 2: Evaluation of models at different resolutions. We report scores without truncation (Column3), scores at the best FID (Column 4), scores at the IS of validation data (Column 5), and scores atthe max IS (Column 6). Standard deviations are computed over at least three random initializations.
Table 3: BigGAN results on JFT-300M at 256×256 resolution. The FID and IS columns report thesescores given by the JFT-300M-trained Inception v2 classifier with noise distributed as Z 〜N(0, I)(non-truncated). The (min FID) / IS and FID / (max IS) columns report scores at the best FID andIS from a sweep across truncated noise distributions ranging from σ = 0 to σ = 2. Images from theJFT-300M validation set have an IS of 50.88 and FID of 1.94.
