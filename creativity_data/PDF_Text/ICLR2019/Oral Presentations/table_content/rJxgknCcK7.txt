Table 2: Negative log-likehood on test data for density estimation models; lower is better. In natsfor tabular data and bits/dim for MNIST and CIFAR10. *Results use multi-scale convolutionalarchitectures. ^Results use a single flow with a convolutional encoder-decoder architecture.
Table 3: Negative ELBO on test data for VAE models; lower is better. In nats for all datasets exceptFrey Faces which is presented in bits per dimension. Mean/stdev are estimated over 3 runs.
