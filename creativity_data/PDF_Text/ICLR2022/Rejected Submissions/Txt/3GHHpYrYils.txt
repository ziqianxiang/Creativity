Classical machine learning frameworks assume access to a possibly large dataset in
order to train a predictive model. In many practical applications however, data does
not arrive all at once, but in large batches over time. This creates a natural trade-off
between accuracy of a model and time to obtain such a model. A greedy predictor
could produce non-trivial predictions by immediately training on batches as soon as
these become available but, it may also make sub-optimal use of future data. On the
other hand, a tardy predictor could wait for a long time to aggregate several batches
into a larger dataset, but ultimately deliver a much better performance. In this work,
we consider such a streaming learning setting, which we dub anytime learning at
macroscale (ALMA). It is an instance of anytime learning applied not at the level
of a single chunk of data, but at the level of the entire sequence of large batches.
We first formalize this learning setting, we then introduce metrics to assess how
well learners perform on the given task for a given memory and compute budget,
and finally we test about thirty baseline approaches on three standard benchmarks
repurposed for anytime learning at macroscale. Our findings indicate that no model
strikes the best trade-off across the board. While replay-based methods attain the
lowest error rate, they also incur in a 5 to 10 times increase of compute. Approaches
that grow capacity over time do offer better scaling in terms of training flops, but
they also underperform simpler ensembling methods in terms of error rate. Overall,
ALMA offers both a good abstraction of the typical learning setting faced everyday
by practitioners, and a set of unsolved modeling problems for those interested in
efficient learning of dynamic models.
1 Introduction
Empirical risk minimization (Vapnik, 1998) is the dominant framework to formalize the learning
process of a supervised task, and it has been critical to the success of large scale training of deep
learning systems on a wide variety of applications. Within this framework, training data is assumed
to be provided to the learner all at once. Alternatively, when the dataset is very large (essentially
infinite), data is streamed to the learner one minibatch at the time, assuming that the rate at which
samples are received matches the model’s processing time to learn from them.
Learning over streams of data has been studied in the machine learning domain for a long time (see
Section 2 and Figure 1 for more details) with different assumptions: for instance in online learning, it
is usually assumed that datapoints are coming one by one and have to be processed as soon as they
are received. In continual learning, the streaming of data usually corresponds to a stream of large
datasets corresponding to different tasks to solve, etc. In this paper, we define a simple yet important
setting where there is a single task to solve, and where training data often comes at a slower rate than
a model can process it. Moreover, it comes in relatively large batches once in a while. While poorly
studied, this setting corresponds to practical applications encountered in production pipelines. For
instance, it is faced by teams deploying language modeling applications (e.g content moderation)
build models that are trained on large amounts of data like filtered versions of Common Crawl, which
are dumps of the internet. However, new snapshots are available every month, as new content is
generated over time. Therefore datasets keep getting bigger every few months and models need to be
retrained accordingly. Similarly, visual object recognition datasets used in deployed applications are
often extended every few months to include new images with their corresponding annotations.

Figure 1: ALMA compared to other learning frameworks.
Practically, there are two main approaches to integrate information present in a new batch of data
in an existing model. If a lot of computational resources are available, a new and bigger model is
instantiated and trained from scratch on the union of the old training set with the new batch of data.
However, since this is a computationally very intensive process, retraining is typically done only
rarely, once several batches of data have been collected. We call this approach “tardy” large-scale
learning, since a predictor is available only at a later time. Another option, particularly suitable
when computational resources are scarce and a predictor is needed quickly, is to simply finetune the
old model on the new data as this arrives. Note that, in that settings, methods from the data stream
domain or from the online learning domain that are based on the idea of processing any datapoint just
once are not suitable since they have been developed for different use-cases.
This trade-off is emblematic of anytime learning, a learning setting where a learner has to provide
good predictions at any point in time, while improving its performance over time as more and more
data is observed. From an anytime learning perspective, neither training a large model after all data is
received nor finetuning on the newly added batch of data are not satisfying. The former approach is a
poor anytime learner because one needs to wait for a long time before obtaining a useful predictor.
The latter approach is a poor anytime learner because it typically cannot leverage very well future
batches of data since the model has a fixed capacity, determined on a small portion of the overall
dataset and because inherently the model is trained on non i.i.d. data.
In this work, we aim at exploring this accuracy versus time trade-off of anytime learning, not at the
level of a single batch of data, but at the macroscale of the entire sequence of batches. This is a setting
which more closely mimics practical applications, that we call anytime learning at mascroscale
(ALMA). In this learning setting, we assume that the time to train a model is negligible compared
to the interval of time between two consecutive batches of data (and therefore we do not care about
how quickly a learner adapts to a new batch), yet efficiency matters in the sense that for the same
performance a predictor that uses less compute and memory is preferable. In summary, we are
interested in a learner that i) yields high accuracy, ii) can make non-trivial predictions at any point in
time while iii) limiting its computational and memory resources.
Our first contribution is to formalize the ALMA problem and to introduce metrics to evaluate
learners (§3). We consider three different axes: error rate, memory and amount of computation. By
measuring these quantities against time, via an area under the curve, we account not only for the final
performance but also for the whole training trajectory over the sequence of large batches of data.
Our second contribution is an extensive empirical evaluation (§5) of various models (§4) that strike
different trade-offs between accuracy and time to obtain a useful predictor. In particular, we explore
models that fall in between greedy finetuning and tardy large-scale learning, and investigate models
that leverage batches of data at an intermediate rate. We also consider a rich family of modular
architectures, from plain ensembling methods to hierarchical mixture of experts, and several variants
thereof, including those that have access to a replay buffer storing all previous batches of data and
those that can grow capacity over time.
Our findings across three different benchmarks, including a large scale language modeling one,
can be summarized as follows. a) An intermediate waiting time offers the best trade-off between
accuracy and time to yield such a predictor. However, b) there is no single approach striking the best
trade-off between performance and efficiency for various model sizes. c) Retraining from scratch
a big model does offer the lowest error rate but sacrifices efficiency. d) Interestingly, large models
are the most statistically efficient even when considering small datasets (like MNIST) and fully

connected networks. e) While approaches to grow capacity exhibit gains in terms of computational
efficiency, these do not even outpeform simple ensembles. Overall, our work points at several research
opportunities to improve modeling in a streaming setting of broad practical relevance, rather then
pointing at any particular solution. We have also released code to reproduce our experiments and the
entire platform implementing ALMA.
2	Related Work
ALMA relates to several other learning frameworks: offline learning, continual learning, online
learning and transfer learning as illustrated in Figure 1. i) It shares the same assumptions of classical
empirical risk minimization (ERM) (Vapnik, 1998) at the level of each batch of data. However, it
overall violates ERM’s assumptions of i.i.d. observations, because data points come in a stream of
data chunks. ii) Because of this, ALMA relates to continual learning (CL) (Ring, 1994; Thrun, 1994;
Ring, 1997; Thrun, 1998), with the key difference that the data distribution across batches (or tasks)
is assumed stationary in ALMA. Therefore, ALMA can be seen as a special case of CL with a single
task to solve. iii) ALMA relates also to online learning (Bottou, 1998) since it assumes that data are
coming in a stream, an assumption also made in the concept drift literature (Lu et al., 2018). However,
in online learning examples are streamed one at the time (or at random from a large dataset), while
in ALMA the learner receives large batches of data sequentially In ALMA, received data can be
processed multiple times as opposite to the online learning setting that usually assumes that any new
datapoint has to be processed as soon as it is available, and will not be reused in future updates. iv)
Finally, ALMA relates more broadly to transfer learning (Pan & Yang, 2010), as the problem of
adapting to a new batch of data can be interpreted as leveraging knowledge acquired on previous
batches to more effciently learn from the new batch of data.
Of course, ALMA relates to anytime learning (Grefenstette & Ramsey, 1992; Ramsey & Grefenstette,
1994), which has been recently applied to compare various autoML frameworks (Liu et al., 2020).
However, in this work we are not interested in assessing the anytime learning ability at the level
of each chunk of data, but only at a coarser granularity, at the level of the entire stream of chunks.
Inspired by Liu et al. (2020), we consider the area under the curve of error rate against time to
measure performance, but in order to account also for compute and memory budget, we add to our
evaluation metrics also the area under the curve for memory and compute.
From the more theoretical side, there has been work about sub-bagging (BUhlmann & Yu, 2002)
(bagging using subsets of a larger dataset) which is similar to our setting but without the sequential
aspect of it. In this context, Breiman (1999) proposed a model similar to our growing ensembling
(gEns), BUhlmann & Yu (2002) studied sub-bagging as a way to make the prediction of tree classifiers
more robust while Zou et al. (2021) studied the consistency of the estimator in this setting. We defer
to future studies the analysis of ALMA, while in this work we focus on the empirical evaluation.
Shifting the discussion to prior work on models that adjust their capacity dynamically, Waterhouse &
Robinson (1995) introduced an approach to grow a hierarchical mixture of experts model (Jordan &
Jacobs, 1994). This is a tree structured model where experts are at the leaves and gating functions are
at non-terminal nodes. The tree determines a hierarchical partition of the input space into regions
that are associated to each expert. This approach was made more efficient in later work by (Fritsch
et al., 1996). In this work we consider a baseline (gMoE) that extends this prior work to hierarchical
mixture of experts (Eigen et al., 2014; Denoyer & Gallinari, 2015; Lepikhin et al., 2020).
Growing architectures have also been studied in CL. For instance, Fernando et al. (2017) and Veniat
et al. (2021) proposed a modular architecture that is assembled for every task, possibly reusing
previously trained modules. The major difference with our work is that in our case routing is
input dependent as opposed to task dependent. Yoon et al. (2018) instead proposed a method to
incrementally and smoothly add hidden units. Similarly, Wen et al. (2020) proposed a heuristic
approach to automatically adjust the network depth. Wang et al. (2017) considered growing both
depth and width when finetuning to a new task. Liu et al. (2019a) and Wu et al. (2020) proposed
approaches to grow architectures in depth and width by leveraging Taylor approximation and greedy
selection. In our work, we benchmark against this last variant. None of these approaches have been
applied to the ALMA setting to date.
Finally, some of our findings are built upon and extend recent empirical evaluations studying the
scaling properties of language models (Kaplan et al., 2020a; Li et al., 2020b). In this study, we

confirm the conclusion that bigger models generalize better and are more statistically efficient, not
only in language modeling tasks using a transformer architecture, but also in smaller scale computer
vision tasks using both fully connected and convolutional architectures.
3	Learning Setting
In anytime learning at macroscale (ALMA), we assume that there exists an underlying data distribution
p(x, y) with input x ∈ RD and desired label y ∈ {1, . . . , C}. Notice that extensions to regression
and unsupervised learning (where y is missing) are trivial, and therefore in this work we focus on
classification problems for simplicity of exposition. A important property of ALMA is that data is
presented to the learner as a stream SB of B consecutive batches of examples. Let Di be a collection
of N 0 i.i.d. samples randomly drawn from p(x, y), for i ∈ {1, . . . , B}. The stream is then
defined as the ordered sequence SB = {D1, . . . , DB}. We refer to each dataset Di as mega-batch, as
it is composed by a large number of examples. Typically a learner m : RD → {1, . . . , C} updates its
parameters by processing a mini-batch of n N examples at the time from each mega-batch Di ,
and by iterating several times over each mega-batch before being presented with the next mega-batch.
Since the learner cannot access future mega-batches, overall the data distribution is not i.i.d., even
though samples drawn from each mega-batch are i.i.d., and cross-validation is performed using a
subset of the current mega-batch. A learner could decide to use previous mega-batches when learning
on the current mega-batch, but this will increase its compute usage.
Finally, we assume that the time it takes a learner to update its internal parameters after having
observed a mega-batch is much less than the interval between the arrival of two consecutive mega-
batches. In other words, the rate at which data arrives is slower than the processing time of the model,
and therefore the model could decide to iterate several times over the data at its disposal to improve
its prediction accuracy.
3.1	Metrics
We evaluate learners in the ALMA setting across three axes, namely: accuracy, memory and compu-
tation. Let t be the time at which the t-th mega-batch arrives; this data can be used by the model to
update its parameters or it is simply aggregated to previous mega-batches for later use.
We compute the error rate of model m at time t (after the arrival of the t-th mega-batch) and compute
the area under the curve obtained varying t from 0 till the total number of mega-batches B ; the
resulting cumulative error rate (CER) is:
B1
CER = Σ ∣dts∣	Σ ∣m(x; θt) = y∣
t=0	(x,y)∈DTs
(1)
where m(x; θt) is the model at time t equipped with parameters θt, DTs is the test set, ∣DTs∣ is the
number of examples in the test set, and ∣m(x; θt) 6= y∣ is one if the model prediction does not match
the ground truth label and zero otherwise. The outer sum computes the discrete integral of the error
rate over time. CER is going to be small only when the error rate is small throughout the whole
stream . CER is instead large for a tardy model that waits till the very last mega-batch to update
the model, even though eventually this may obtain a very low final error rate. If not perfect, CER
provides a good summary of the performance of a system across time. Anyway, to fully capture the
differences between two models, it is needed to have a deeper look at the performance across time as
illustrated in Figure 2 for instance.
Similarly, we compute the cumulative memory usage and compute as:
BB
Mem = X ∣θt∣, ComP = X O(m(∙; θt))	⑵
t=0	t=0
where ∣θt∣ is the number of free parameters of the model at time t, and O(m(∙; θt)) is the number of
floPs used by the model to Process the t-th mega-batch. Once again, by measuring the area under the
curves obtained by tracking these quantities over time we obtain a holistic assessment of memory
and compute throughout the whole stream. A model can obtain small Mem and Comp only if it does
not consume memory and if it is computationally parsimonious throughout the entire duration of the
stream.

4	Learning Algorithms
In this section, we describe the methods we tested in the ALMA setting. They generally follow the
learning procedure shown in Algorithm 1. At a high level, we consider two families of models, those
with a monolithic architecture and those with a modular architecture (e.g., ensembling). The latter are
amenable to grow over time by adding new modules to the existing set. We will start by describing
fixed architectures (§4.1) and then conclude with growing architectures (§4.2). All models are also
given the option to replay previous mega-batches.
4.1	Fixed Architectures
The first family of methods trains models with a fixed architecture. These models are sequentially
trained over new mega-batches and exhibit a fixed memory footprint. We consider three models:
Single Model (SM): This is a standard multi-layer neural network (e.g., fully connected neural
network or transformer) trained by stochastic gradient descent. It can be initialized from random or
from the parameters of the model trained on the previous mega-batch. The initializaiton choice is
determined via cross-validation.
Ensemble of Models (Ens): The second approach is the simplest modular approach, consisting
of an ensemble of N neural networks with the same architecture, each being trained independently
on the same sequence of data. The output of the overall model at test time is the average probability
distribution produced by each component1. The advantage of Ens is that training and inference can
be trivially parallelized, enabling to scale up model parameters very easily. The disadvantange is that
inference requires N times more compute than what is required by each component.
Uniform Mixture of Models (UMix): A potential drawback of Ens is that evaluation and training
are inconsistent. UMix addresses this by training a model whose prediction is the average (in logit
space) of the predictions produced by N networks. While this requires synchronization during
training, now both training and evaluation use the same model.
4.2	Growing Architectures
In the previous section, the number of parameters and the architecture of the model are fixed
throughout the model’s lifetime. However, as more data is observed, it is interesting to consider
dynamic architectures that grow over time, because these may save compute and memory during the
earlier stages of learning while providing more predictive power during the later stages. We consider
three growing approaches:
1Classical bagging approaches and majority vote strategies have been also explored without significant
difference.

Growing Ensemble (gEns): Like the Ens model, gEns is also a combination of neural networks
trained independently. While Ens considers N networks that are, at each stage, trained over the new
chunck of data, gEns replaces this step by a growing step where n neural networks are added. In our
implementation, only these n neural networks are trained over the new data, while the other neural
networks (trained on previous mega-batches) are kept fixed.
Growing Mixture of Experts (gMoE): A hierarchical mixture of experts models (MoE) is an
architecture where at layer l the output representation zl is: zl = Pjk=1 g(j|zl-1)h(zl-1 |j), where g
is the gating or routing function and h(∙j) is the j-th expert. Compared to Ens, MoE has exponentially
many more components albeit with a lot of parameter sharing. Another advantage is that by selecting
only one (or a few) experts, the computational cost is independent of the number of experts, assuming
the cost of gating is negligible compared to the cost or executing the experts. The main issue is that
MoE are notoriously harder to train (Eigen et al., 2014; Denoyer & Gallinari, 2015; Lepikhin et al.,
2020). In this work, we consider a growing version of MoE, which we denote with gMoE, whereby
experts are added over time. See Appendix A for more details.
Firefly (Wu et al., 2020) (FF): FF is a method which progressively grows neural networks, jointly
optimizing both the model architecture and parameters. Growth includes both a width expansion
by adding new hidden units (or feature maps) as well as a depth expansion by adding new layers.
Importantly, this is an example of non-modular method unlike Ens or gMoE, which is potentially
more expressive but also more inefficient at inference time because there is no structured sparsity that
can be leveraged to speed up computation.
5	Experiments
In this section we first describe how standard benchmarks can be repurposed for ALMA, we then
provide the details of the models we tested, and we finally conclude with an analysis of the results
we obtained, aiming to understand which method attains the best trade-off between time, accuracy,
compute and memory usage.
Datasets We consider a variety of datasets. The first dataset is MNIST (LeCun et al., 1998), which
consists of a training set with 60,000 quasi-binary handwritten digits of size 28x28 pixels, and a test
set with 10,000 examples. The second dataset is CIFAR 10 (Krizhevsky, 2009) that has a training
set with 50,000 images of size 32x32 pixels belonging to 10 classes such as bird, car, horse, ship,
truck, etc. The third dataset, used for our large-scale language modeling evaluation, is a portion of the
collection of English language text introduced in Liu et al. (2019b), consisting of Books, Wikipedia
and Common Crawl. We consider 4 (large) mega-batches for training and one additional mega-batch
for evaluation, each consisting of approximately 440M words; we also hold out a validation set with
approximately 0.5M words of Common Crawl for model selection. We use a byte-pair encoding
(BPE) (Sennrich et al., 2016) vocabulary with 50,000 units, following Radford et al. (2019). This
dataset is fairly representative of what practitioners might face when maintaining a deployed system
with new data arriving every few months.
Given a dataset like any of the above, we construct a benchmark for ALMA evaluation as follows: 1)
we randomly partition the training set into B mega-batches with equal number of training examples
(B = 50 for MNIST and CIFAR 10, and 4 for the text dataset), 2) from each mega-batch we extract
10% of the data to build the mega-batch validation set (except for the large scale language modeling
dataset where we use the provided validation set), and 3) we create a learning experience by doing
one pass over the sequence of mega-batches. For each mega-batch, the learner can query as many
mini-batches as desired. The learner can also decide not to train on the data of a mega-batch right
away but instead to wait and accumulate data across a few consecutive mega-batches. While the
learner observes data, it is also tested on the test set. This is not used for validation purposes, but only
for final reporting as shown in §5.1.
Models We evaluate the six approaches presented in §4, and for each of them we consider various
waiting times, a version with and without replay, and at least two model sizes. For each setting,
we cross validate over several hyper-parameters such as initializaiton type, learning rate, stopping
criterion, growth rate, etc.

Table 1: MNIST results with waiting time equal to 5. Rows with parameter size in blue refer to small
networks (e.g., Ens totalling 16050 parameters has five components of the same size of SM shown
in blue); similarly, rows in orange refer to the large network size. Numbers in parentheses are for
versions with replay. For all metrics smaller is better.
Next, we describe in details the architecture used on each dataset. Further experimental details to
aide reproducibility are reported in Appendix B. On MNIST the backbone architecture of SM is a
three layer fully connected neural network with ReLU units. We considered two hidden units sizes,
namely 4 and 32 (denoted by [s] and [b], respectively), which let us simulate the regime of big data
relative to the size of the network and explore how to grow architectures without worrying about
overfitting. Similarly, the components of Ens, gEns and UMix are SM networks of the same size as
stated above; gMoE also starts off as SM and adds modules (at the first two layers) that have the same
size as the original layer of SM. When varying the waiting time, i.e., the number of mega-batches that
are aggregated before initiating a new training session, we use the suffix “_w” to indicate its value.
On CIFAR 10, the methods and notations are the same as in MNIST. The only difference is that the
backbone architecture is a scaled down version of a VGG19 convolutional neural network (Simonyan
& Zisserman, 2015), where the number of intermediate feature maps is the same for each layer and
equal to either 4 or 32. On this dataset, we also consider FF starting off from the same VGG19
backbone.
For the language modeling task SM is a Switch Transformer (Fedus et al., 2021), which is a hard
mixture of experts model with an additional load balancing loss term and hard capacity constraint
applied during training to prevent uneven expert utilization. Following Fedus et al. (2021), we fix the
weight of the balancing loss term to 0.01 and use a capacity factor of 1, ensuring relatively uniform
expert utilization. We train the model using Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2015) and tune the learning rate
and dropout on the validation set. In the growing setting we copy the expert weights and gating
network weights corresponding to the top-k experts incurring the largest loss, where k is typically
between 2 and 4. We consider two model sizes: a base model with 6 layers and model dimension
of 512, for a total of 40M shared parameters and 6M additional parameters per expert; and a large
model with 12 layers and model dimension of 768, for a total of 96M shared parameters and 28M
additional parameters per expert. We use an input sequence length of 512 tokens and we do not use
replay given the large chunk sizes.
5.1	Results
In Fig. 2 we start by analyzing learning curves on CIFAR 10 for a subset of the methods as a function
of the waiting time. We then dive into analyzing all methods on both MNIST (Tab. 1) and CIFAR 10

Table 2: CIFAR 10 results with waiting time equal to 5. Same notations and colors as in Table 1.
(Tab. 2), using the optimal empirical value of waiting time. We conclude by confirming the major
findings at scale on the language modeling task (Tab. 3).
Fig. 2 shows the test error rate as a function of the number of mega-batches received for both the small
(left) and the large (right) model. We observe that an intermediate waiting time (in this case equal to
5) strikes the best trade-off between accuracy and time for all methods, since curves with waiting
time equal to 5 have the lowest area under the curve. Greedy methods using waiting time equal to 1
achieve lower error rate only during the very beginning of the stream. Second, we observe that bigger
models (SM and Ens) not only generalize better but they are also statistically more efficient: the small
Ens obtained almost 35% error rate by the end of its learning experience, which is worse than the
error rate obtained by the large Ens just after having observed one tenth of the entire stream. The
statistical efficiency of large models does not apply only to large transformers (Kaplan et al., 2020a),
but also to fully connected (we obtained similar results on MNIST) and convolutional models.
Next, using the waiting time that yielded the lowest cumulative error rate, we compare all methods
discussed in §4, focusing our discussion on Tab. 2 of CIFAR 10 as same conclusions apply to MNIST
as well (see Tab. 1).
First, replay lowers the CER by a relative amount of about 10% at the cost of increasing the cumulative
training flops by a factor of more than 5, which is rather substantial. Notice that retraining from
scratch using memory replay, as reported here in parentheses, is nowadays the dominant approach to
deal with sequential datasets.
Second, Ens works better than UMix for larger models, and vice versa. We surmise that ensembling
may alleviate overfitting of large models, but coordinating the components of the ensemble like UMix
does, is more effective in an underfitting regime (i.e with small models). Ens thus looks like a good
method to train large architectures without suffering of the overfitting aspect and may be used when
the complexity of the task is not known a priori.
Third, all growing approaches perform rather similarly, particularly when starting from larger back-
bones, although they strike slightly different trade-offs. For instance, gMoE is the most efficient at test
time, while FF yields a lower error rate. Interestingly, none of the approaches that grow architectures
currently manages to beat Ens in terms of error rate when starting from a large backbone, although
they require substantially fewer flops at inference time. Finally, while methods derived from SM (for
the same size of the initial backbone, see rows with the same color in the table) all manage to beat
SM, it is also worth noting that for the same number of parameters SM is still the best performing
method, unless there is overfitting. In particular, Ens with 12550 parameters achieves a CER of
2440 while SM with 11710 parameters obtains a CER of 2038 while requiring much less compute;
same considerations apply also to the gMoE with 29550 parameters compared to SM with 31660
parameters. Therefore there is no single model striking a much better trade-off, and more advanced
approaches do not outperform simpler methods like Ens.

Table 3: Large scale language modeling results. For Ens and gEns, 4@3 means 3 components in the
ensemble, each of which has 4 experts per block, for instance.
The results on the large scale language modeling task reported in Tab. 3 show that bigger models
perform better (the larger the number of parameters the lower the PPL for a given model class) and
are also more statistically efficient (for instance the base SM_w1 attains 26.53 after seeing the whole
stream, while the large SM_w1 obtains 22.47 just after seeing the first chunk of data), consistent
with recent related work (Kaplan et al., 2020b; Li et al., 2020a). We also observe that Ens is a strong
performer, with Ens_w1 and gEns_w1 models dominating SM models in all settings. Surprisingly,
ensembles trained on distinct data chunks (gEns_w1; t1 or t3) perform no better than ensembles
trained on a single data chunk (Ens_w1; t0 ). For instance, among Base 2-model ensembles (4@2),
Ens_w1 achieves a perplexity of 26.20 using a single data chunk (t0), while gEns_w1 achieves a
perplexity of 26.27 using models trained on each of the two data chunks (t1). Finally, if test time
inference is a concern, then gMoE is a preferable choice since its runtime is comparable to SM.
6 Conclusion and Perspectives
In this work we introduced the anytime learning at macroscale (ALMA) setting, which is an instance
of anytime learning under the assumption that data is observed as a sequence of large batches. ALMA
better mimics the learning scenarios faced by machine learning practitioners, who want to efficiently
solve a task, but time to time they receive more data to train on. We introduced metrics that enable
the assessment in terms of error rate, memory usage and compute throughout the entire learning
experience. Equipped with these tools, we then evaluated several approaches on three different
datasets, including large scale language modeling. We found that methods that update parameters
at an intermediate rate tend to yield a better trade-off, and that bigger models tend to generalize
better. In particular, models that grow capacity over time generalize better particularly when the
initial model is smaller, and ensembling is a very strong baseline.
A cynical interpretation of our finding that bigger models generalize better, could take the reader to
the conclusion that it can all be solved by starting with a big model. However, as data is added over
time so is computation. It is often the case that researchers working on large-scale learning instantiate
the biggest possible model to train on their task, but few months later they can manage to launch
even bigger models thanks to compute and engineering advances. How can the larger model leverage
what has been learned from the previously trained model? Is there a modeling choice that strikes a
better trade-off than retraining from scratch? More generally, what are good approaches to extract
information from a new batch of data to integrate it into an existing model? While we do not provide
a full answer to these questions, we do offer a framework to study them and several strong baseline
approaches to compare against and build upon.

Appendix
A Growing Mixtures of Experts
Growing Mixture of Experts (gMoE): A mixture of expert (MoE) is a sequence of non-linear
functions, each of which is potentially a mixture of experts (omitting the dependence on parameters):
k
m(x)=fl(fl-1(...f1(x)...)), withfi(z)=Xgi(j|z)hi(z|j)
j=1
where gi is the gating function at the i-th layer which outputs a categorical distribution over the
number of experts, and hi(∙∣j) is the j expert at layer i. The gating function can be “soft” in which
case it outputs non-zero weights for each expert via a softmax, or “hard” version in which case only
one expert is selected through a multinomial sampling (and learned through the straight-through
estimator in this paper (Bengio et al., 2013)). At test time in the “hard” case, we select the expert
with the largest probability. The interest of mixtures of experts is they have a high expressivity, and
experts can be easily added to increase the capacity of the model. The gMoEmodel is the growing
version where, at each stage as illustrated in Fig. 3, new experts are added at each layer - details
about the precise expansion process are given in Appendix.
The key design considerations are: when to
grow, what to grow and how to grow. Here,
we will refer to our default setting which favors
simplicity, unless otherwise specified.
A growth step is triggered at each stage, en-
suring a linear growth over time. We grow by
adding one expert at each layer, making sure
that all experts within a layer have the same ar-
chitecture albeit with different parameters. In
order to grow, we look at which expert has asso-
ciated the largest cumulative loss; we call such
expert the losing expert. The cumulative loss is
defined as the sum of the losses of examples on
the validation set that have been routed through
a particular expert; each expert has associated a
cumulative loss value. The rationale is to iden-
tify at each layer the expert responsible for the
largest contribution to the total loss.
Figure 3: Illustration of a growth step in a tree struc-
tured mixture of experts. A network is composed of
several layers like this. The blue squares are experts
(e.g VGG layers). The red elements corresponds to the
gatings which, given an input compute a score for each
expert. When splitting an expert (right), the gating struc-
ture is updated by creating a child gate, and an additional
expert is added to the mixture.
To avoid drop in the loss function and to keep
its differentiability when splitting an expert, we propose a tree-based approach we the losing expert
is split such expert into two experts with exactly the same parameters as illustrated in Fig. 3: Two
children leaves are derived and we instantiate a new gating for the children which decides whether an
input example routed to the old expert, should now go to the right or left expert child. The parameters
of the new gate are initialized at random while the parameters of the new experts are exact copies of
the ones of the losing expert that we split.
More formally, if s is the losing expert then the term gi(s|z)hi(z|s) is replaced by:
2
X gi(s|z)gi(k|z, s)hi(z|s, k)
k=1
(3)
where gi(k|z, s) is the newly introduced gate, and z is the input of the gating and experts.
Over time, the gating function learns to partition its input space into a binary tree (if we start from a
single expert), and the gating value of an expert is the product of the gating probabilities on the path
from root to the leaf expert. Both the gating tree structure and the particular initialization scheme
guarantee that the growth step is smooth and fully differentiable, in particular, the loss before and
after the growth step is the same.

If we consider each path in the MoE model to be a different model, then with L layer of k MoE
components, there are kL many possible paths through the MoE model, hence the number of
paths grows exponentially with the number of layers. You can think of this as an ensemble with
exponentially many components, but this is still tractable because components share parameters.

B	Hyper-parameter settings
B.1	Computer Vision Experiments
For each megabatch received, we keep 10% of the data to perform cross-validation. All experiments
are run on a single 16GB Quadro GP100 GPU. We apply data normalization for each dataset
considered. A training minibatch size of 128 is used. UMix and Ens models have N = 5 in all
experiments. for gEns, we train one model n = 1 at every mega-batch, so the total number of models
depends on the amount of mega-batches. For Firefly we use a growth rate of 0.25, meaning that at
every growth phase, we add approximately a quarter of the initial number of parameters.
B.1.1	MNIST
Models are trained for 100 epochs, and we report results with soft gating. We use the AdaDelta
(Zeiler (2012)) optimizer with default learning rate of 1. We use a MLP with 2 hidden layers of
varying width (e.g. 4,8 or 32 neurons).
B.1.2	CIFAR- 1 0
Models are trained for 200 epochs, as this was shown to be long enough to allow the model to
converge with a learning rate of 0.01. We use Stochastic Gradient Descent with momentum value
of 0.9 and weight decay of 1 × 10-4. During training, we apply random horizontal flips and select
random image crops with padding of 4 pixels. For the architecture, we use the same reduced VGG
with batch normalization as prescribed in Wu et al. (2020). All layers are initialized with the same
number of channels (e.g. 4, 8, or 32 channels). For the Firefly experiments, we keep all the Firefly-
specific hyperparameters to the default values suggested in the author’s public codebase. We make
one exception to this, namely we adapt the growth ratio to result in linear (rather than exponential)
growth.
B.2	Language Modeling Experiments
All the language models are trained using fairseq (Ott et al., 2019) with a maximum of eight 32GB
GPUs (NVIDIA V100), optimized with Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2014) using β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98,

=1e-8. The learning rate is warmed up over the first several hundred updates (between 500 and
4000) and then linearly decayed to 0 over the remaining updates, with a peak value tuned between
2e-4 and 5e-3. Models are trained up to 120,000 updates with local batch size of 8 sequences per
GPU, with gradient accumulation as needed to achieve a total batch size of 192 sequences; each
sequence has 512 tokens. We fix the Switch Transformer balancing loss term to 0.01 and use a
capacity factor of 1, following Fedus et al. (2021).
C	Additional Computer Vision Results
In this section we show the impact of several variants of our framework. Namely, we report results
for (a) a varying number of mega-batches, (b) whether to use preemption or not, and (c) whether to
initialize from scratch or simply finetuning when replay is performed.

C.1.2 Preempted Results
We also consider the use of a patience term when training the model. When the validation accuracy
has not improved over 25 consecutive epochs, we stop training for the given learning phase. As
expected, we observe gains on compute efficiency, with a small loss in performance.

C.1.3 Initializing from s cratch
Below we show results, comparing the performance of re-training models from scratch on all the data
seen so far vs simply finetuning the current model(s) on all the data. Main numbers are finetuned
models, numbers in parentheses are trained from scratch.
