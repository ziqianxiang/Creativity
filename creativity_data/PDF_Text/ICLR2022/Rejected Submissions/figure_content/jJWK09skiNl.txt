Figure 1: Simplified structure of our YOLOv5-ZS networkThe simplified architecture of our YOLOv5-ZS network is shown in Figure 1. The network takesan RGB image as input and output predictions in three feature levels. The input image size is640*640*3 in our network since all images in the YCB Video dataset are 640*480 pixels. They arepadded with grey pixels on top and bottom to become a square shape. The image is first processedby the Backbone (DarkNet) and Neck (PANet). The size of DarkNet and PANet is changeable inYOLOv5. By changing the number of convolutional layers and feature map depth, four versions ofYOLOv5can be created, and they are YOLOv5s (small), YOLOv5m (medium), YOLOv5l (large)and YOLOv5x (extra-large). As the network becomes bigger and deeper, their detection accuracywill increase, but the detection speed decreases. In our work, we chose to use YOLOv5s. Tensor Tfrepresents the block of are extracted features in three levels, they are passed to the following blocks:bounding box and attribute prediction (Tb), feature concatenation (Tc), objectness prediction (Tp)and output concatenation (To). They are detailly explained in the following sections.
