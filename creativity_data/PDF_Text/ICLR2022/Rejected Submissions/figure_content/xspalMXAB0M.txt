Figure 1: The figure illustrates a Policy Tree hierarchy (see Definition 5), obtained by setting N = 3on the inner loop, and T = 2 on the outer loop, to overall get all base policies π1, ..., π6 ∈ ΠW onthe lower level. The middle level holds T = 2 Policy Shurbs (see Definition 4), where each Shrubλt ∈ Λ(Π, N) is an aggregation of base policies. The top level is an weighted aggregation of theprojected shrubs Γ[λt] , which forms the overall Policy Tree π ∈ Π(Π, N, T).
