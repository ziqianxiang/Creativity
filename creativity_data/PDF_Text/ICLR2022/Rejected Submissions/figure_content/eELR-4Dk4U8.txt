Figure 3:	Results of TD3, SAC, AE-SAC and NODA-SAC on MuJoCo environments in Gym. Themodels are evaluated every 4k steps for 10 episodes, and the means and standard deviations arecomputed across 10 episodes across 4 seeds. The dashed lines are the best asymptotic performancesof 1M steps.
Figure 4:	Results of Dreamer, BIRD and NODA-Dreamer on DMC. The models are evaluated every5k steps for 10 episodes, and the means and standard deviations are computed across 10 episodesacross 4 seeds. The dashed lines are the asymptotic performances of5M steps of Dreamer mentionedin (Hafner et al., 2019).
Figure 5: Results of TD3, SAC, AE and NODA on the Pendulum-v0 environment in Gym. Themodels are evaluated every 4k steps for 10 episodes, and the means and standard deviations arecomputed across 10 episodes across 4 seeds. The performance of NODA-SAC is stable, and NODAis able to facilitate the training of SAC in an early stage.
Figure 6: Results of Dreamer, BIRD and NODA-Dreamer on 6 tasks in DeepMind Control Suite.
Figure 7: Results of Dreamer, BIRD, NODA-Dreamer and NODA-BIRD on 3 tasks in DeepMindControl Suite. The models are evaluated every 5k steps for 10 episodes, and the means and standarddeviations are computed across 10 episodes across 4 seeds. The dashed lines are the asymptoticperformances of 5M steps of Dreamer mentioned in (Hafner et al., 2019). The results suggest thatNODA is very promising, in the sense that it can be easily combined with different MBRL methods,especially auto-encoder-type methods, by simply modifying their transition model.
