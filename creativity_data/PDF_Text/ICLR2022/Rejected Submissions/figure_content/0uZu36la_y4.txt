Figure 1: The error across classes is already not perfectly uniform in clean training on CIFAR10.
Figure 2: Contrary to ERM, which samples the examples uniformly, CFOL samples from an adap-tive distribution. The learned adversarial distribution is non-uniform over the classes in CIFAR10when using adversarial training. As expected, the hardest classes are also most frequently sampled.
Figure 3: The robust test accuracy for CFOL-AT and ERM-AT over classes. The horizontal blackand red line depicts the average and worst class accuracy over the classes respectively. The im-provement in the minimum accuracy is notable when using CFOL-AT, while there is only marginaldifference in the average accuracy.
Figure 4: Robust test accuracy under different norm-ball sizes after clean training on CIFAR10. Thenon-uniform distribution oVer class accuracies, eVen after clean training, indicates that the inferiorperformance on some classes is nota consequence of adVersarial training. Rather, the inhomogeneityafter perturbation seems to be an inherent feature of the dataset.
Figure 5: Clean training and adversarial training on CIFAR100 (top) and STL10 (bottom) usingERM-AT with PGD-7 attacks at train time and PGD-20 attacks at test time for the robust test ac-curacy. The CIFAR100 classes are sorted for convenience. Notice that CIFAR100 has a class withzero robust accuracy with adversarial training.
Figure 6: Robust class accuracy for CIFAR100 and STL10 respectively. Vertical black error bars in-dicate one standard deviation. The red and black horizontal line indicates the minimum and averagerespectively. The classes on both ERM-AT and CFOL-AT are ordered according to the accuracy onERM to make comparison easier.
