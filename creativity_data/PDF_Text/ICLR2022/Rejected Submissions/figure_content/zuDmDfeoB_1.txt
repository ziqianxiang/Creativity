Figure 1: MAML, NAL excess risks and optimal solutions in various environments.
Figure 2: First coordinates of wMaml，WNAL and their excess risks for various PH for large m (insubplots (a)-(b) for m = 2000) and small m (in subplots (c)-(d) for m= 100).
Figure 3: Theoretical and empirical excess risks for NAL and MAML and ratios of the NAL toMAML excess risk in the setting described in Section 3.2.
Figure 4: Loss landscapes and ground-truth neurons for NAL (a,c) and MAML (b,d) for two distinct,four-task environments and Softplus activation.
Figure 5: Task loss functions f1, f2, f3, f4 for task environment in Figure 4 (a-b).
Figure 6: Loss landscapes for NAL (a,c) and MAML (b,d) for two distinct task environments andSigmoid activation.
Figure 7: Logistic regression results in analogous setting to m = 500 column in Figure 2 (T = 2tasks, d = 10 dimensions). Recall that ρH is the strong convexity parameter (data variance) for thehard task, which determines its hardness, while the strong convexity parameter of the easy task is 1.
Figure 8: Version of Figure 2 with corresponding empirical results, including 95% confidenceintervals. The hardness parameter ρH varies along the x-axis.
