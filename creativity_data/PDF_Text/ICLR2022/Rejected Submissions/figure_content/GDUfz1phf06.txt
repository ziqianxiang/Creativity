Figure 1: Left-top: the relaxation of search space and the flow ensemble is shown in Fig. 1. Left-middle: binarization of weights. Left-bottom: degradation to normal flow architecture. Right-top:construction flow ensemble by mixed transformations. Right-bottom: construction of flow ensembleby mixing distributions. The blue line in right indicates transformation on random variables and theorange line reflects change in distributions.
Figure 2: An illustrative example of the original loss and upper bound for a flow ensemble with 2possible architectures. The red points indicate desired normal flow architectures and the green pointindicates the global minimum of LpO , which is a mixture model. The parameters (a, b, θ1, θ2)refer to the weight of architecture 1, architecture 2 and their corresponding parameters.
Figure 3: The result of optimization of a 4-layer flow ensemble with transformation options betweenplanar flow and radial flow with original loss and proposed upper bound. The left four figures arethe weight for each layer during the search process. The right-top figures are the training and vali-dation loss during training. The right-bottom table collects final weight for each layer, the searchedarchitecture, and their test score (lower the better).
