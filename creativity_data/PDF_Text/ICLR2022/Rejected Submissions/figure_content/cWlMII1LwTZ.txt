Figure 1: Motivating example. A task-aware approach (right) is more idealthan a task-agnostic approach (left) interms of a mean wage estimation task,since the former perturbs the wage at-tribute with a smaller noise while guar-anteeing the same LDP budget e.

Figure 3: Theoretical overall task loss L com-parison when L = I and Assumption 1 holds. Weconsider three different settings which have n = 4and λ1 = 4 in common. Difference between set-tings: 1)12：4 = 0; 2) λ2∕ = 1; 3) λ2∕ = 2. Forthe privacy-agnostic approach we use Z = 2.
