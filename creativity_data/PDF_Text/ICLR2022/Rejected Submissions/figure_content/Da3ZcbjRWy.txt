Figure 1: Overview of the LaGraph framework. Given a training graph, we randomly mask a smallportion VJ âˆˆ V of its nodes and input both original graph and masked graph to the encoderE. Crossednodes in the figure have all their attributes masked but topology preserved. The final loss consists ofa reconstruction loss on node features and an invariance loss between representations of the originalgraph and the masked graph. We omit the encoding part of the graph-level framework as frameworksfor the two levels mainly differ in whether the invariance term is computed on representations ofmasked nodes or graph-level representations obtained by R.
Figure 2: Model robustness to small batch sizes. Shown are changesin accuracy compared to the batch size of 256.
