Figure 6: Timesteps discovered via dynamic programming for Lsimple CIFAR10 (left) and LhybridImageNet 64x46 (right) for various computation budgets. Each step (forward pass) is between twocontiguous points. Our DP algorithm prefers allocates steps towards the end of the diffusion, agreeingwith intuition from prior work where steps closer to x0 are important as they capture finer imagedetails, but curiously, it may also allocate steps closer to x1, possibly to better break modes early onin the diffusion process.
