Figure 1: The CGA framework and its training process. The OOD loss can be the cross entropy lossin CGA-softmax, cross-entropy+energy loss in CGA-energy, or other possible losses.
Figure 2:	Ablation study on (a) CGA Stage 2 and (b) amount of generated pseudo OOD data.
Figure 3:	Ablation study on different options of generating pseudo OOD data. Figure 3(a) showsAUC results of different σ values of the sampling distribution. Figure 3(b) filters values near thecenter of the Gaussian distribution with σ = 1. Figure 3(c) filters values near the center of theGaussian Distribution with σ = 5.
Figure 4: Distribution of IND data and the generated pseudo OOD data. The grey points representthe IND data and the numbers are their class labels. The red points in the middle figure representthe generated pseudo OOD data and the pink points in the right figure represent the true OOD dataused in testing. The left figure contains only the IND data of 6 classes.
Figure 5: Generated data of different settings. SCE means standard class embedding and this col-umn shows the generated data from CVAE using the standard class embedding. PCE means pseudoclass embedding computed using the class embeddings of the two classes in each group (e.g., 0 and5 in Group 1). For each setting of PCE & σ, we generate 4 images by sampling 4 different z values.
