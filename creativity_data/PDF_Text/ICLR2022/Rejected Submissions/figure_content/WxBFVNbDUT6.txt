Figure 1: Results are averaged across 3 random seeds with shaded areas representing the standarddeviation. We can observe that non-uniform sampling strategies is also effective in batch RL, andthere is no priority metric that works in all situations.
Figure 2: Learned Q1 function in TD3. We can observe that non-uniform sampling schemes fail toavoid the bootstrapping error as in the Walker2d-Random environment.
