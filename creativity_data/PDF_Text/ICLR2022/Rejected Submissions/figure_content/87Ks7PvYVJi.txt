Figure 1: Illustrations of the scenarios. Different colors indicate different agents.
Figure 2: Learning curves of MABCQ and the baselines in HalfCheetah, Walker, Hopper, and Ant. The curvesare plotted based the mean and standard deviation of five runs with differenCe random seeds.
Figure 3: Difference in value estimates among agents along with the training in HalfCheetah, Walker, Hopper,and Ant. It is shown that transition normalization indeed reduces the difference in value estimates.
Figure 4: Learning curves ofMABCQ and the baselines in Swimmer.
Figure 5:	Learning curves of MABCQ with different in HalfCheetah, Walker, Hopper, and Ant. It is shownthat with any positive , MABCQ does not underperform that without value deviation.
