Figure 1: Empirical evaluation of thebias in the proposed methods of mea-suring influence. The influence valuesestimated by single and multiple esti-mators are compared to the true valuesof F . The results for the estimatedvalues are averaged across 8 runs.
Figure 2: Architecture of the general proposed method4 Empirical Evaluation & AnalysisThe goals of our experiments are to: a) verify the performance of our method on a comprehensive setof multi-agent challenges (SMAC, MAPE, sparse-reward settings, and continuous control environ-ments); b) perform ablations to examine which particular components of the proposed framework areimportant for good performance.
