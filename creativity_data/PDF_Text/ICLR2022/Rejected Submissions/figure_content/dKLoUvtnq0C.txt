Figure 1: The reconstruction error on the one-dimensional Burgers equation for different grid reso-lutions.
Figure 2: The reconstruction error on the one-dimensional Burgers equation for intermediate timepredictions and the py-pde solver solutions for different numbers of intervals P in the compositionloss term, Lc(oPm)p. We show the median as well as the 10th, 25th, 75th and 90th percentiles. Thestatistics is based on 100 samples from the test set. The dashed horizontal cyan line marks thereconstruction error of FNO at t = 1 for comparison.
