Figure 1: Few-shot Link Prediction with Domain Adaptation. Colors denote different domains.
Figure 2: Comparison of average test ROC-AUC performances in each dataset. The coloreddots represent the mean performance of 10 experiments and the error bars represent the standarddeviation.
Figure 3: Comparison of t-SNE visualization of graph embedding for all 24 domains in the PPIdataset. The distribution of graph embeddings generated by baseline SEAL vary across domainswhile the graph embeddings generated by the adversarial method are domain-invariant.
Figure 4: Domains in the ogbg-ppa dataset are already similar with baseline SEALthree heuristic methods only use graph topological structure data, they lack enough information tomake good predictions.
Figure 5: Comparison of Smoothed Training Curves over 10 ExperimentsIn addition, by increasing the value of α, we increase the impact of the discriminator of the targetmodel. In this case, α = 3 seems to provide the best performance. However, if we look at theaverage best performances, the best α is in fact 5. A closer look into each individual training curvetells us that some of the best models were trained when α = 5. However, the large α value alsomakes the model less stable and it’s more likely to see the model collapse during the training process.
