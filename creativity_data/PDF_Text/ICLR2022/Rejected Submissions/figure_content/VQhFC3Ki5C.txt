Figure 1: Sample of tree representation for node 1 (showing UP to 3-hop neighborhood). The inputfeatures of a node U is denoted as Xu, and the hidden features of the node U at the kth hop of the rootnode is denoted as hÂ£.
Figure 2: Model performance in accuracy at different depths, tested on four datasets: Cora (a),Citeseer (b), Pubmed (c), and Coauthor-CS (d).
