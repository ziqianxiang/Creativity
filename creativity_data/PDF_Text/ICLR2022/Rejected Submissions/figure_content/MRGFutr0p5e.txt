Figure 1: Overview of our proposed Graph Barlow Twins framework. We transform an input graph Gusing an augmentation function and obtain two views: G(1) and G(2). We pass both of them throughthe same GNN encoder fθ to compute two embedding matrices Z(1), Z(2). We build a loss functionsuch that the embeddings’ empirical cross-correlation matrix C is optimized into the identity matrix.
Figure 2: Comparison of using the "Same" and "Different" augmentation hyperparameter sets.
