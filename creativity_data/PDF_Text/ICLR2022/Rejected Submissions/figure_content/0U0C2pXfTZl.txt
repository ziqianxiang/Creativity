Figure 1: SLASH Attention illustrated for a visual reasoning task. SLASH with Neural-ProbabilisticPredicates consisting of a slot attention encoder and Probabilistic Circuits (PCs) realised via EiNets.
Figure 2: (a) Depending on the data set and underlying task, SLASH requires a suitable Neural-Probabilistic Predicate (NPP) that computes query-dependent probability estimates. An NPP can becomposed of neural and probabilistic modules, or (depicted via slash symbol) only one of these two.
Figure 3: ShapeWorld4 Experiments. (a) Converged test average precision scores for the set predictiontask with ShapeWorld4 (top) and ShapeWorld4 CoGenT (bottom). (b) Test average precision scoresfor set prediction with ShapeWorld4 over the training epochs. In these experiments we compareda baseline slot encoder versus SLASH Attention with slot attention and PC-based NPPs. For theCoGenT experiments, a model is trained on one training set and tested on two separate test conditions.

Figure 7:	Example SLASH Query for ShapeWorld4 experiments. In other words, this query corre-sponds to asking SLASH: “Is object 1 a small, bright red circle?”.
