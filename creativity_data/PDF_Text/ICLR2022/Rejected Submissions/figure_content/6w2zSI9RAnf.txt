Figure 1: Four example environments adopted for distilling the CNN policy network knowledge intothe symbolic policy. From left to right are: Airstriker-Genesis, Pong, CircusCharlie, Seaquest.
Figure 2: The discretized perception-decision procedure, with three representation types (see Sec. 3).
Figure 3: One sample distilled policy from a CNNagent in the CircusCharlie environment.
Figure 4: Performance validation and behavior comparisons for the CNN based RL agents and thedistilled symbolic rule. Action distribution (right) is for a single evaluation roundAlthough this smoothing and denoising effect might potentially overlook some subtle behaviors of theteacher agent, we argue that the benefits of introducing such mechanism outweigh the disadvantages.
Figure 5: Visual comparisonbetween the AdventureIsland2(top) and AdventureIsland3environments (bottom)network again endorses the better transferability of the symbolic rule.
