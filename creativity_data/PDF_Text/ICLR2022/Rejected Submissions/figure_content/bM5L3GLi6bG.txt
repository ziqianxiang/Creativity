Figure 1: An overview of the proposed domain adaptation with zero-shot learning. Close set domainadaptation align the target domain to the source domain. Open set domain adaptation not only alignthe domain gap, but also reject the unknown classes as one class. Open set domain adaptationwith zero-shot learning further gives detailed classification on the unknown classes, which is morecomplex and valuable.
Figure 2: An overview of our model for domain adaptation with zero-shot learning. We utilize aknowledge graph to infer the classifier of the unknown classes. With the employment of the graphconvolutional network, the model generates the initial classifier for all classes and applies it to theclassification part. The generator and the classifier are trained in an adversarial way to align thedomain gap.
Figure 3: In the task setting m2u, the model is trained on the MNIST dataset with seven or eightclasses and transferred to the USPS dataset with ten classes.
