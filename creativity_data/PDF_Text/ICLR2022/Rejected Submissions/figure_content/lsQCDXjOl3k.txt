Figure 2: The effect of guidance on a mixture of three Gaussians, each mixture component represent-ing data conditioned on a class. The leftmost plot is the non-guided marginal density. Left to rightare densities of mixtures of normalized guided conditionals with increasing guidance strength.
Figure 3: Unconditional guidance on 128x128 ImageNet. Left: non-guided samples, right:unconditional-guided samples with w = 3.0. Interestingly, strongly guided samples such as thesedisplay saturated colors. See Fig. 8 for more.
