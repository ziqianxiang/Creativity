Figure 1: (Preliminary experiment) The global modelâ€™s convergence under different data conditions.
Figure 2: (Preliminary experiment) Demonstration of learned representations from a distributionalperspective. The representations are generated by forward propagation in model evaluation. Eachbox corresponds to a randomly sampled element in the representation vector.
Figure 3: The workflow of the proposed FedProf algorithm.
Figure 4: The traces of evaluation accuracy of the global model through 100 rounds in the S-Taskusing (a) the full-aggregation method, and (b) the partial-aggregation method.
Figure 5: The traces of evaluation accuracy of the global model in the L-Task using (a) the full-aggregation method (through 300 rounds), and (b) the partial aggregation method (through 50rounds).
Figure 6: Total counts by client of participation (i.e., being selected) in (a) the S-Task and (b) theL-Task. For clarity, clients are indexed according to their local data quality.
