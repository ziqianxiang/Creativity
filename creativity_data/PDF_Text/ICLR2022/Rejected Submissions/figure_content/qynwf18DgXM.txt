Figure 1: Flow chart of strong approximation of the gradient flow. The new entries P and A pro-duced by neural network get combined into a new metric g(t) that is used to minimize the lossfunction by combining with the metric g(t), where the loss function is defined by Equation (12).
Figure 2: The evolution of metrics g(t) by the radius of a ball with the epoch of training process.
