Figure 1: Evolution of accuracy, likelihood and violation of weak signal constraints. Training withlikelihood makes LLF accumulate more probability mass to the constrained space, so that the gen-erated y are more likely to be within Î©, and the predictions are more accurate.
Figure 2: Model architecture of LLF for unpaired point cloud completion. The E represents theencoder, and the D represents the GAN discriminator.
Figure 3: Random sample point clouds generated LLF and mm-pc2pc. The point clouds generatedby LLF are as realistic as mm-pc2pc. Mm-pc2pc has a higher diversity in samples. However,sometimes it may generate unreasonable or invalid shapes.
Figure 4: Random chair samples generated by LLF. The first row is partial point clouds, and thesecond row is generated complete point clouds.
