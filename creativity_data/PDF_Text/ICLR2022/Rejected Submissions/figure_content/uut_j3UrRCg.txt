Figure 1: (left) The Routing-module (OS) routes sketches to the programs in the LSH table, whichin turn produces sketches that are fed back to the OS in addition to sketches of inputs from theenvironment. The OS, while shown here as a distinct module, could itself be a module (program)in the LSH hash table. (right) Sketch of a hand of cards during a card game. The (cards-in-hand-sketch〉is a tuple of P sub-sketches (one for each card), and each (card-i-sketch〉is itself a compoundsketch: for example, (card-1-sketch )consists of the CARD-DESCRIPTION label/type and threesub-sketches describing the card’s number, color, and symbol.
