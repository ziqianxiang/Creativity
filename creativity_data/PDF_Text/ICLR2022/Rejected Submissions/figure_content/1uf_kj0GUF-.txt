Figure 1: Output errors by SGD and ourmethod for different dimensions and sampleTable 1: Means / Standard deviations of net-work estimate errors for different networkweights. Values are computed from the processof learning 128 different ground-truth networkswith d = 16. 512 training samples are drawnfor each learning trial.
Figure 2: Respective errors of layers 1 and 2 and outputs of different label noise strengths forSGD, LP and QP. We fix the ground-truth weights with d = 10 and only the noise strength varies.
Figure 3: Output errors against running time by SGD and our LP algorithm for differentdimensions of networks. For each dimension size of d = 8, d = 16 and d = 32, we report thelearning curves of SGD and the final output error of our LP algorithm against time used on 5 differentground-truth networks. We used 512 training samples, drawn for learning each ground-truth network.
Figure 4: Layer 2 errors against layer 2 ground-truth weight condition numbers for differentdimensions of networks by SGD and our LP algorithm. Each data point is the mean acrosslearning 32 different ground-truth networks with the same pair of d and a condition number for B *.
