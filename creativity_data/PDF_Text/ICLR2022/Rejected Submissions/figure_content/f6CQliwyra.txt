Figure 1: Experiments on MuJoCo: We show curves of the return versus the training steps for SPEDE andmodel-based RL baselines. Results show that in these tasks, our method enjoys better sample efficiency evencompared to SoTA empirical model-based RL baselines.
Figure 2: Experiments on MuJoCo: We show curves of the return versus the training steps for SPEDE andmodel-based RL baselines. We also include the final performance of ME-TRPO from (Wang et al., 2019) forreference.
