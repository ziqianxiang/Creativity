Figure 1: Environment setup showing a Speaker communicating to a Listener over a lossy acousticcommunication channel f .
Figure 2: Example interaction of each component and the environment in a single round.
Figure 3: The Speaker agent generates an arbitrary length sequence of action-values given an inputconcept represented by S.
Figure 4: The Listener agent Q-network generates action-values given an input mel-spectrogram X .
Figure 5: Results for unconstrained communication. The agents are evaluated every 100 trainingepisodes over 20 runs. Shading indicates the bootstrapped 95% confidence interval.
