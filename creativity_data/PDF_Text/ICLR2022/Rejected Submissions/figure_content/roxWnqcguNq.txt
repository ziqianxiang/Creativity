Figure 1: Constituency tree representation of the sentence, according to the Universal POS tagscategories (with a maximum depth of 3): ”However, when adjusted for inflation, the new federalminimum is still less than the minimum wage through most of the period from 1961 to 1981.” aboutthe topic ”minimum wage”. The green nodes represents words or spans with ”PRO” label and thegrey nodes represents words and spans with ”NON” label.
Figure 2: Word Importance of the Integrated Gradient Method for the sentence : ”If you have a fearof losing your important data to hard drive failure, then you can use this drive clone tool to cloneyour mac hard drive or volume and restore the lost data, in case of media failure.”. The ”NT” tokenrefers to the sentence internal nodes. The words highlighted in green (resp. red) have a positive(resp. negative) impact on the final outputs.
Figure 3: Tree representation of the edges interpretability methods. The red edges refer to edgeswhich have a positive impact on the prediction. The green edges refer to edges which have a negativeimpact on the prediction. (This figure has been generated by NetworkX)6 ConclusionIn this study, we established a new method for identifying the ADU boundary using the sentenceconstituent tree representation. This model allows the information to be spread across the graph andperforms well on a small dataset.
