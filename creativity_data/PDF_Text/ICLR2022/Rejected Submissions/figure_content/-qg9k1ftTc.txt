Figure 1: The architecture of S3ADNet. Here, σ (∙) indicates the sigmoid function, ∙ symbolizesthe tensor dot operation, C signifies the number of concepts, and WMCC stands for the weight ofthe MCC layer. The two yellowish tensor blocks are different augmented sequential embeddingsgenerated from the batch input, while the yellow matrix is one sequential embedding for an instanceof the calculation in the MCC layer. The exact numbers of cells imply the identical dimension: oneof the minibatch size N = 3, the sequence length L = 4, and the embedding size m = 5. Thelookahead size for collecting relationships is 2.
Figure 2: Two examples of loss patterns on KDDCup99. Losses of contrast and augment wereobtained from the first and second terms in Equation 3, respectively, and ones of relate were obtainedfrom Equation 13. Figure 2a led to a good F1-score, while Figure 2b did not.
