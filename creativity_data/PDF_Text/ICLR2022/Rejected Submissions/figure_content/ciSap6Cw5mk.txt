Figure 1: An Overview of MANDERAThe contributions of this work are as follows. (1) We propose the first algorithm leveraging therank domain of model updates to detect malicious nodes (Figure 1). (2) We provide theoreticalguarantee for the detection of malicious nodes based on the rank domain under Byzantine attacks.
Figure 2: Independence tests for 100,000 column pairs randomly chosen from message matrix Mgenerated from FASHION-MNIST data supports the independence assumption made in Theorem 1.
Figure 5: Model Accuracy at each epoch of training, each line of the curve represents a differentdefense against the poisoning attacks.
Figure 7: Model Loss at each epoch of training, each line of the curve represents a different defenseagainst the attacks (GA: Gaussian attack; ZG: Zero-gradient attack; SF: Sign-flipping; and LF:Label-flipping).
Figure 9: Model Accuracy and Loss for MNIST data at each epoch of training, each line of the curverepresents a different defense against the attacks (GA: Gaussian attack; ZG: Zero-gradient attack;SF: Sign-flipping; and LF: Label-flipping).
