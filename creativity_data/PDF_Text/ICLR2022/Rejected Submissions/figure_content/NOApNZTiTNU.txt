Figure 1:	AQE versus TQC, REDQ and SAC. AQE is the only algorithm that beats SAC in all fiveenvironments during all stages of training, and it typically beats SAC by a wide margin.
Figure 2:	Performance for AQE and TQC using same hyper-parameters across the five environments.
Figure 3: AQE ablation results for Ant. The top row shows the effect of the ensemble size N . Thesecond row shows the effect of keep number parameter K . The third row compares AQE to somevariants.
Figure 4: Performance, average and std of normalized Q bias for AQE, SAC-5 and TQC-5. All ofthe algorithms in this experiment use UTD = 5.
Figure 5: Performance, average and std of normalized Q bias for AQE with different values of K .
Figure 6: Performance for AQE with different combinations of number of Q networks and numberof heads.
Figure 7: Performance of REDQ with N=10 and heads = 2 as compared with REDQ and AQE.
