Figure 1: Illustration of conceptual differences between deep learning-based AFT models in terms oftheir respective contributions and required assumptions with a format of the standard AFT. To allevi-ate the parametric distribution assumption, which DRAFT has, DATE exploits the GAN frameworkand learns the implicit underlying distribution qθ through the generator parameterized by θ . ForDRAFT, LNLL and LPR denote negative log-likelihood and partial ranking likelihood, respectively.
