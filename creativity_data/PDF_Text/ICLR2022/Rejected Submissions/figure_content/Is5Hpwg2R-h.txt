Figure 1: Outline of OTED: The simulator parameters are learned by the designer, which uses signalsfrom a learned discriminator to match the distribution appearing in the offline dataset to that inducedby a learned behavior policy acting in the environment. The learned simulator parameters are thenused to train a target policy via standard online RL.
