Figure 1: Comparison of the pipeline between previous learning methods and our solution for pointcloud registration. Previous learning-based methods regard 3D registration as a task for the givenpoint clouds. In comparison, we define each task as learning a unique 3D registration function(learner) for each pair of given 3D objects.
Figure 2: Main Pipeline. Our model includes two networks: 3D registration learner and 3D reg-istration meta-learner. The registration learner includes shape embedding and region aware flowregression. 3D registration meta-learner include task distribution estimator and learnerâ€™s initializa-tion predictor. Pn denotes the n-th region probability score.
