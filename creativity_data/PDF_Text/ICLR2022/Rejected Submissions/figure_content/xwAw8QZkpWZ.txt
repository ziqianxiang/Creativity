Figure 1: Evaluating the concentration of un-safe data in high likelihood regions by comput-ing the % of unsafe state-action pairs in a hold-out dataset of a safe robotic grasping task. PAR-ROT assigns high likelihoods to unsafe data, i.e.,it does not encourage safety, while SAFER hasmuch lower likelihood in unsafe data.
Figure 2: Overview of SAFER:SAFER optimizes the posteriorover a latent safety variable (topof figure) that encodes safety in-formation about the environment.
Figure 3: An example of atask where the robot success-fully and safely grasping anobject (top row). Here, therobot reaches into the containerand extracts the object with-out touching the container. Onthe bottom row, the robot per-forms the same task but com-mits safety violations by touch-ing the container.
Figure 4:	Assessing the calibration of the SAFER safety assurances by randomly sampling ac-tions from the prior with various safety upper bounds across different evaluation tasks. Each dotcorresponds to the empirical percent of unsafe (s, a) pairs from a single rollout on the task. Overall,we see that the SAFER safety assurances are quite well calibrated.
Figure 5:	Assessing the tradeoff be-tween success and safety varying thesafety assurances bound on the abstractaction space Z , (referred to as Î· in Al-gorithm 2). There is an sweet spot wheresuccess rate is high and safety violationsis low.
