(d) AleatOriCuncertainty measured as the L2 distance between two optical flows with and without a small per-turbation on the bit stream. (e) Epistemic uncertainty measured by motion vectors that cannot beestimated well. (f) The predictive uncertainty represented by the multi-head decoder. Visualizationof predictive uncertainty on other sequences can be found in Appendix A.6.
