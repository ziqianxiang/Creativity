Figure 1: Different learning scenarios for style transfer. a) With parallel examples, learning of thetransfer mapping is supervised. b) With non-parallel, distributionally matched datasets, learningof the transfer mapping is unsupervised. Nevertheless, style is given as the dataset difference, andgeneration takes place in-distribution. c) With non-parallel, not distributionally matched datasets,style needs to be inferred by excluding confounding differences. Not only is learning of the transfermapping unsupervised, but generation is also out-of-distribution.
Figure 2: Illustration of the learning of the invariant classifiers. a) The style classifier Cs is trained tobe invariant across different pairs of Ai and Bj datasets. b) The orthogonal classifier Co is trained tohighlight changes in sentences other than the style identified by Cs.
