Figure 1: The spherical harmonics of degrees i =1, 2, 3, 4, on S2 . The function value is given by color.
Figure 2: Left: the exponent of the error rate versus s and d. As expected, larger values of s and dresult in, respectively, faster and slower error decays. The bars show the standard deviation. Right:error rates for s = 1, 2, 3 and d = 2, 3, 4, shown in separate panels. Both axes are in log scale so thatthe slope of the line represents the exponent of the error rate. Experimental error rates are consistentwith the analytically predicted results.
