Figure 1: Approximation residual versus running time for three LIBSVM benchmark datasets,with the markers at 10-iteration intervals. Left: epsilon, middle: SUSY, right: real-sim. For thestochastic algorithms (SPS, S-Tseng, and FRB-VR), we plot the median results over 10 trials, withunit standard deviation horizontal error bars for the running time and the vertical error bars displayingthe min-to-max range of the approximation residual. The code is provided in the supplementarymaterial.

Figure 3: Fraction of nonzero entries versus running time for the three datasets. Left: epsilon, middle:SUSY, right: real-sim.
