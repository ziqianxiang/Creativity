Figure 1: 2-dimensional binary classification tasksGiven a task Ti , we first try to use fs as the model to solve this task. If the resulting accuracy isabove a threshold θacc, we store the model of this task, denoted as mi , in a set M . If the accuracyis below the threshold θacc, we use random search to choose two models mk, mq in M to form anew model fs ((mk (x), mq(x)) : θ) to replace fs and run from the first step again. We terminatethis task when we get a qualified model or the number of runs exceeds a threshold δ. This process ismarked as L.
