Figure 1: Top: Visualization and interpolation in a 2D latent space learned by a vanilla VAE trainedwith binary images of rings and disks. The log of the metric volume element，det G(Z) (alsoproportional to the log of the density we propose to sample from) is represented in gray scale. Topright: The Riemannian distance from a starting point is presented with the color maps. The dashedlines are affine interpolations between two points in the latent space and the solid ones are obtainedby solving Eq. 8. Bottom: Decoded samples along the interpolation curves.
Figure 2: Generated samples with different models and generation processes. Generated sampleswith RAE variants are also provided in Appendix D.
Figure 3: Nearest train image (near. train) and nearest image in all reconstructions of train images(near. recon) to the generated one (Gen.) with the proposed method. Note: the nearest reconstructionmay be different from the reconstruction of the nearest train image.
