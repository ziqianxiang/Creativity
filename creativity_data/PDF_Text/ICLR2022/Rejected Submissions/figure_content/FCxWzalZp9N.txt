Figure 3: Adaptive Focus Framework. Cl and Fl represent different hierarchy feature maps. Vl meansthe pixel set fed into level l and we show them in gray. The adaptive confidence mechanism (ACM)is employed to judge whether the prediction for each pixel is sufficiently confident or not in eachlevel, and Xis the sign of confidence. The detail of the red dashed box is shown in Fig. 4.
Figure 4: The process of Adaptive Confidence Mechanism. Firstly, the corresponding feature map ofpixels in Vl are fed into predictor l to get predicted probabilities. Then, the threshold is employedto judge whether the pixel should go down the hierarchy to get lower-grained features or output theprediction. Meanwhile, the threshold is periodically updated according to the confidence distributionof correctly predicted pixels. Note that the threshold will be fixed without update during the inference.
Figure 5: Image prediction process show case on iSAID validation set with r = 0.32. Different colormeans different category. Black means the background. Specifically, white means that the pixel hasnot been predicted or has been predicted in higher level.
