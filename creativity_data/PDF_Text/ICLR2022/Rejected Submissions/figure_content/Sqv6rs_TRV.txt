Figure 7: Absolute mismatches between the recovered functions and the physical ground truth.
Figure 8: (Left:) Illustration of the possible saddle point, local optimum, and global optimum inphysical equation learning. We observe that local optima can perform numerically as well as theglobal optimum (ground truth equation) since there is always a set of diversified equations to per-fectly fit limited data.
