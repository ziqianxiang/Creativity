Figure 1: Adding small Gaussian noise data augmentation and requiring the augmented samples ofthe same point to be assigned to the same cluster and have similar embedding allows neural networkto find the desired manifolds.
Figure 2: Visualization of principal components from subspace representation learned from CIFAR-10. Rows in each panel are training images that has the largest cosine similarities with differentprinciple components of that subspace. Similarity of images within each component is apparent.
