Figure 1: Original (a) vs Neural Reparametrization (b) of the optimization problem.
Figure 2: Optimizing Kuramoto model on a 25 × 25 square lattice (a) Loss over run time in secondsfor different methods. (b) Evolution of the phase variables over iterations. (c) Level of synchroniza-tion, measured by global order parameter over time. Neural reparameterization with GCN achievesthe highest speedup.
Figure 3: Hopf-Kuramoto model on a square lattice (50 × 50). a) Speedup in the final loss valuedifference function. Points color correspond to the regions of the phase diagram (b), also, the numberabove each phase pattern are the global order parameters. We fixed c = 1 for the simplicity. c)Coupled oscillator system.
Figure 4: Speedup: a,b) Training and total time speedup; c) GCN speeds up convergence.
Figure 5: a) Loss vs speed-up of GCN model. The converged loss value is determined by point cloudrange only, while the speed-up is affected by both point cloud range and size. b) Initial random pointcloud and GCN-optimized point cloud.
