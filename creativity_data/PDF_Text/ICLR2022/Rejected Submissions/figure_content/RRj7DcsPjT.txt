Figure 1: Compare matrix approximation error for layer-wise sampling methods. The matrix ap-ProXimation error is measured by IlZbateh — Zsampling kF∙ The error curve of the original LADIESmethod shows an abnormal U-shape on ogbn-arxiv and ogbn-mag datasets.
Figure 2: Fit y(I)〜β0 + β1 X on ogbn-arXiV data. The orange solid line denotes the fitted regressionline. All pairs of (x, y) are collected from 5 repeated experiments and after the convergence ofmodels. Details of eXperimental setups, results for other data are deferred to AppendiX C.3.
Figure 3: Metrics in each epoch. The layer-wise sampling methods follow the “increasing” setting(denoted with (2) in Table 1); for the node-wise sampling methods, the number of neighbors is 2.

Figure 6: Distribution of kP [i] k and k(H W)[i] k for Reddit, ogbn-arxiv, ogbn-protein and ogbn-mag.
Figure 7: Regression on Reddit, ogbn-arxiv, ogbn-protein, ogbn-mag datasets. GCN is trained byLADIES + flat + debias sampler. The fitted regression line is in orange color.
Figure 8: Regression on Reddit, ogbn-arxiv, ogbn-protein, ogbn-mag datasets. GCN is trained byLADIES. The fitted regression line is in orange color.
