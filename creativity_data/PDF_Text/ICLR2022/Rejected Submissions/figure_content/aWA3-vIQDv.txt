Figure 1: Summary of the similarities between the RG and IMP. Both the RG and IMP areapplied iteratively to coarse-grain systems, revealing “relevant” features. Certain observables areknown to have regimes where they follow power-law scaling. In the case of the RG, this scaling andits universality are associated with properties of the flow the RG induces in the space of couplingconstants. The nature of the flow IMP induces has not been previously studied, but none-the-lessexists. See Table 1 for the analogous quantities in each theory.
Figure 2: IMP flow. Two-dimensional projections of the IMP flow for ResNet-50, pre-trained onImageNet via self-supervised simCLR training (Chen et al., 2020b), applied to three different tasks:ImageNet (triangles), CIFAR-10 (circles), and CIFAR-100 (stars). Blue corresponds to a singleapplication of IMP (density equal to 80%) and red corresponds to 17 applications of IMP (densityto 1.44%).
Figure 3: Error as a function of density scaling of CIFAR-10/100 and SVHN. Overlaying theerror as a function of density curves for ResNet-50, trained from random initialization, on CIFAR-10/100 or SVHN, with 5% rewind. The overlaid curves shows very similar, but noisy, behavior.
