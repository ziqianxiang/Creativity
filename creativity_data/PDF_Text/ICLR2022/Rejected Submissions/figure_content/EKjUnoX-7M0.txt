Figure 1: Upper row: Nk (T) Vs 1∕(∆k - Ak)2 for arm k ∈ Anon-cr. Bottom row： Nk(T) Vs ∖/∆for arm k ∈ Acr. In all plots, the blue horizontal line stands for fairness level τkT.
Figure 2: Penalized Regret (Rπ (T)) Vs Different Time Horizon (T) under different settings.
Figure 3: Unfairness path ((τkT - Nk (T))+, k ∈ [K]) for three algorithms under two settingsdescribed in Experiment D. (Upper row is for Setting 1 and bottom row is for Setting 2.) Forsub-optimal arms, the proposed method can guarantee the fairness with a wider range of tuningparameter. By contrast, Flearn and LFG can break the fairness easily.
Figure 4: Total regret vs unfairness level for three algorithms under different settings described inExperiment E. (The first row is for 5 arms with required fraction of times τ = 0.2; The second rowis for 5 arms with required fraction of times τ = 0.5; The third row is for 20 arms with requiredfraction of times τ = 0.2; The fourth row is for 20 arms with required fraction of times τ = 0.5.
