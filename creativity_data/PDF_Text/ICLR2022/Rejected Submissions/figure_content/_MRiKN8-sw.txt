Figure 6: Imputation RMSE for both GAN models (MisGAN and GAIN) on mydata2 dataset in the MCARscenario with 20% missing rate. We select the optimal number of epochs to be 5,000 for MisGAN and 20,000for GAIN.
Figure 7: Imputation RMSE for additional training epochs with GAIN on mydata2 dataset in the MCARscenario with 20% missing rate. There is no significant improvement after 20,000 epochs on the imputationRMSE in spite of a large computation cost increase.
Figure 8: Imputation RMSE on mydata2 dataset in the MCAR scenario with 20% missing rate with theKNN models while varying the number of neighbours. The optimal hyperparameters seems to lie close toN=50 neighbours.
Figure 9: Imputation RMSE for the Wine_White dataset in MCAR scenario with 20% missing rate dependingon the hyperparameter selection. The scaling process gives approximately 4000 epochs for GAIN and 250neighbours for the KNN algorithms.
Figure 10: Imputation RMSE for the breast dataset in MCAR scenario with 20% missing rate depending onthe hyperparameter selection. The selected scaling process gives approximately 10,000 epochs for GAIN and25 neighbours for the KNN algorithms.
Figure 11: Imputation RMSE on mydata2 dataset in MCAR setting for all data imputation methods withvarying missing rates. The performances of MisGAN are particularly poor in comparison to the other threemethods.
Figure 12: Imputation RMSE for all real-world datasets (including the news dataset) in the MCAR scenariowith 20% missing rate. The performances of the four selected algorithms are extremely variable on the newsdataset.
