Figure 1: Upsel, validationFigure 2: Kick, validationDoes the proposed algorithm help to increase the quality of boosting models? In this paragraph,we carry out an extensive search of the best partition in terms of two loss metrics (lower is better):Logloss and 0-1 loss. The number of clusters is tuned according to the procedure from Section 4.4.
