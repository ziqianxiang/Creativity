Figure 1:	Domain adaptation adjusts a model trained on source data for testing on target data. Wecontrast methods by their updates on source and target. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA)jointly learns 50/50 on source/target. Source-free adaptation transfers source parameters, then se-lectively learns on target. Our on-target approach learns 100% of the testing model parameters ontarget by neither sharing nor transferring source parameters, but instead distilling source predictions.
Figure 2:	On-target adaptation proceeds in four stages. Source data is colored in orange while targetdata is colored in blue. Stage 0 is the only stage to use source data. Stage 3 is the stage that connectssource and target: the target representation from stage 2 is fine-tuned as a student model on thepredictions of the teacher model from stage 1. Note that no parameters are shared or transferredfrom source to target, so the target parameters are fully learned on target data.
