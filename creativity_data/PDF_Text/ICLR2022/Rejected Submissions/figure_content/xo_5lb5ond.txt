Figure 1: (A) Example CNN architecture with the number of channels indicated above each layer.
Figure 2: The output of a stride-2 convolution can be obtained by adding the result of 4 convolutions.
Figure 3: Comparison of structured pruning methods and LEAN pruning on three datasets (rows).
Figure 4: Practically realized speedup of pruned MS-D networks evaluated on the test dataset.
Figure 5: Example input and target images of the (Left) Circle-Square (CS), (middle) CamVid,(right) real-world dynamic CT datasets.
Figure 6: Adjacency matrices of active convolutions (in white) after pruning. All pruned network were pruned to a ratio of 10%. Fromleft to right, we have the unpruned matrix of a 100-layer MS-D network trained on the real-world dynamic CT dataset, randomly prunedconvolutions, structured magnitude pruning, structured operator norm pruning, and LEAN.
