Figure 1: An example about cluster step in Carlini et al. (2020) for T = 2 and npriv = 4.
Figure 2: The construction of the graph for min-cost max flow. c denotes the flow capacity of theedge, and W denote the weight of the edge. The graph contains T âˆ™ npriv nodes for each InstaHideimages, npriv nodes for each original images, a source and a terminal. There are three types of edges:i) (left) from the source to each InstaHide image node, with flow capacity 2 and weight 0; ii) (middle)from each InstaHide image node i to each original image node j, with flow capacity 1 and weightWi,j ; iii) (right) from each original image node to the terminal, with flow capacity 2T and weight 0.
Figure 3: The result of solving the min-cost flow in Figure 2. Each InstaHide image isassigned to two clusters, which ideally correspond to two original images. In reality, a clustermay not contain all InstaHide images that share the same original image.
