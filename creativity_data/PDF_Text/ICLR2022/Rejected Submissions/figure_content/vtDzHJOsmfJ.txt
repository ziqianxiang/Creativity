Figure 1: a) Experiment 1: loss as a function of fairness parameter γ. Algorithm 2 and Algorithm3 significantly improve the loss compared to the baseline. b) Experiment 1: distance between thesub-optimal solution and the optimal solution. Algorithm 3 generates a sub-optimal solution closerto the optimal solution compared to the baseline. c) Experiment 2: loss as a function of fairnessparameter γ. Both Algorithm 2 and Algorithm 3 outperform the baseline. d) Experiment 2: distancebetween the sub-optimal solution and the optimal solution.
