Figure 1: Adam with (continuous lines) and without (dottedlines) logit attenuation on MovieLens classification. Adam: after115 epochs (vertical dotted black line), loss flattening sets in,Test HR@10 is sub-optimal, with overfitting. Adam with logitsattenuation: The introduction of Î± factor after the 115th epochreduces Margin p50 but keeps Test HR@10 the same. ThoughEpochsTest HR@10 then drops initially, with further constrained weighttraining Adam with logit attenuation eventually achieves a higherTest HR@10 than vanilla Adam.
Figure 2: Adam-LAWN vs. Adam (weight decay comprehensively tuned) for a variety of datasets. Adam-LAWN causes little to no drop in generalization performance with increasing batch size.
