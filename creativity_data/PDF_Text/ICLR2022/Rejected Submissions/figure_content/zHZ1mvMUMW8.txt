Figure 2: An example of Wavelet Tree (WT): This is an illustration of WT for the string “abcd-dcbaabcddcba”. The bitvector for its first layer (i.e. 0011110000111100) is derived based on thealphabet partition: characters “a” and “b”, located in the left subset of the alphabet, are encoded withthe bit “0”, and the other two characters “c” and “d” are encoded with the bit “1”. For two subsetsin the next layer, they are recursively divides into smaller subsets, which are “a” , “b”, “c” and “d”.
Figure 3: Speedup-Compression Rate Tradeoff of Huffman Coding, our Element-wise method, andour Block-wise method among (A) AlexNet (w/out PQ); (B) VGG-16 (w/out PQ); (C) AlexNet (w/PQ); and (D) VGG-16 (w/ PQ). For each sub-figure, results are for (i) all layers; (ii) CONV layers;(iii) FC layers. The y-axis refers to Compression Rate (lower is better), and the x-axis refers toSpeedup (higher is better).
