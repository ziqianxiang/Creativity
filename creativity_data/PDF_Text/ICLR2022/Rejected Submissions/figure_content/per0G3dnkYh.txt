Figure 1: An Overview of mTAF. In a first step, we apply estimators from extreme value theory toclassify the marginals as heavy- or light-tailed. This classification defines a flexible base distributionconsisting of marginal Gaussians and marginal t-distributions with trainable degree of freedom, asillustrated by Step 2 of this figure. Further, we rearrange the marginals such that the first d marginalsare light-tailed, whereas the remaining marginals are heavy-tailed. mTAF is then constructed usingseveral flow-layers as visualized in Step 3: we employ a triangular mapping, followed by a 2-grouppermutation scheme, i.e. we just permute within the set of light-tailed marginals and within theset of heavy-tailed marginals. At the end, we restore the original ordering using the inverse ofthe permutation employed in Step 2. Using Theorem 3, we prove that mTAFs are marginally tail-adaptive (Corollary 1).
Figure 2: Visualizing the 16th marginal of samples resulting from the tail generation procedurefrom Section 4.2 in orange in the settings h ∈ {1, 2, 4, 8} and ν = 2 (from left to right). In blue, wevisualize samples from the true distribution.
Figure 3: Applying the tail sample generation procedure form Section 4.2 with a vanilla flow anda TAF in two different settings. Samples from the true distribution are visualized in blue and flowsamples are in orange.
Figure 5: Applying the sample generation procedure from Section 4.2 but with tail samples fromother base marginals and visualizing the 16th target marginal. Samples from the true distribution arevisualized in blue and flow samples are in orange. We sample from the 3rd, 7th, 11th, and the 15thbase marginal, respectively (from left to right). The visualized setting is ν = 2 and h = 8.
