Figure 1: Visualization of feature relationsof Sonar and Waveform datasets. Selectedfeatures by LapScore are marked by red lines.
Figure 2: SOFT model framework. The inputs of our SOFT model consists of the first-order datamatrix and second-order correlation feature matrix. The green line shows that attention representationis expected to preserve the intrinsic information from the pseudo labels and gets close to originalrepresentation, while the red line presents that the masked representation contains little structuralinformation and gets away from the attention representation. Finally, we could get a sparse andeffective feature relation matrix that can represent the second-order correlation.
Figure 3: Performance of 12 UFS methods on different percents of selected features. On each dataset,only top 5 methods on average performance are displayed for better visualization.
