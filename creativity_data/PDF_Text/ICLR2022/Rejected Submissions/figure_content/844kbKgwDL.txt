Figure 1: Label of data4	CNN constructionWe model our data using Convolutional Neural Networks. These are known to return superior resultsfor time-series classification when compared to other models (Canizo, 2019; Okita & Inoue, 2017;Yang et al., 2015), and when combined with auxiliary output are known to give predictions with50% improved accuracy compared to state of the art models (Zhang et al., 2018).
Figure 2: Label frequencyConsidering a single feature in a sequence (as in Figure 3), the 1-dimensional convolution uses akernel that weights adjacent observations, and by using pooling and a second convolution, enablesthe model to learn the trend of this specific feature. In our case we have multiple features, so wecombine their output into a fully connected layer.
Figure 4: The first part of the model includes two layers of 1-dimensional CNNconnected layer. At the far right of the figure is the first auxiliary layer.
Figure 5: The second part of the model includes 6 auxiliary layers.
Figure 6: Exchange rate per country. Our model was unable to predict the erratic behaviour of thisdata set.
