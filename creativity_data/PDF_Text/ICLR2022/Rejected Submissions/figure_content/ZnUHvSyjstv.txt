Figure 1: Diagrammatic representation of the MLSUP learning procedure. Ellipsoid boxes containthe true outputs, which are compared to the predicted output for training/evaluation purposes.
Figure 2: Four sets of weights, shown for a small network. All fourminima have very different sets of weights, as evidenced by the colours.
Figure 3: Heat capacity (CV) curve for ML landscape.
Figure 4: Contribution of each of four selected minima (right) to the MLSUP prediction of binarytest data (left). Marker shape indicates the label, colour of the respective minimum, and size theSoftmax probability that the respective minimum obtains for the correct class of this datapoint (scaledquadratically). Only points that are classified correctly by the respective minimum are included.
