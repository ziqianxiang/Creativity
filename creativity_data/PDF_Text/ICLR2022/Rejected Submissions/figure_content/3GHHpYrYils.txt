Figure 2: Accuracy over time for small models (left) and large models (right) on CIFAR 10 with no replay.
Figure 3: Illustration of a growth step in a tree struc-tured mixture of experts. A network is composed ofseveral layers like this. The blue squares are experts(e.g VGG layers). The red elements corresponds to thegatings which, given an input compute a score for eachexpert. When splitting an expert (right), the gating struc-ture is updated by creating a child gate, and an additionalexpert is added to the mixture.
