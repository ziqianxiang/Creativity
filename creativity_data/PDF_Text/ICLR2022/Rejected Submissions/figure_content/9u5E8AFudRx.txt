Figure 1: Uniform Goal Sampling (up), acl goal sampling (middle) and our proposed hme goal sampling(down). Histograms reflect the distribution of sampling probability for each method.
Figure 2: Global sr across training episodes for (a) various percentages of social episodes (Section 4.1), (b)ACL baselines (Section 4.2) and (c) the semantic graph ablation (Section 4.3). Mean ± standard deviation,computed over 5 seeds. Stars highlight statistical differences w.r.t. (a) SP-100%, (b) SP-0% (Welch’s t-testwith null hypothesis H0: no difference in the means, α = 0.05).
Figure 3: Success rates for eachclass with different ratios of sp in-terventions.
Figure 4: Learning trajectory of gangstr with 20% social interven-tion. We report the # of goals proposed by sp (dashed), the # of timesgangstr encountered them (dotted) and its success rate (plain).
Figure 5: Global SR of (a) SP-0.2% and SP-0.2%-NI, (b) SP-20% and SP-20%-NI. (c) Counts of steppingstones during training for SP-20% and SP-20%-NI. Mean ± standard deviations, computed over 5 seeds. Starsindicate significant differences w.r.t. SP-X%. (Welch’s t-test, α = 0.05).
Figure 8: Learning Trajectory of gangstr with social intervention ratio of 0.2%. We report the number ofgoals proposed by sp (dashed), the number of times the goals were encountered (dotted) and the success rate(plain).
