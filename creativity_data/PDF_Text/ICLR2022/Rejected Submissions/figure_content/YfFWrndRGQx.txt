Figure 1: Simulation setup and results. Left: Tar-get points ξt1 , ξt2 cycle along the circle. At eachround t, the Pareto set is the line segment [ξt1 , ξt2],and PSG measures the distance between xt andthe line segment. Right: Performance compari-son of OMMD-II and baselines.
Figure 2: Results to verify the effectiveness ofadaptive regularization using OMMD-II in real-world online classification tasks. The two plotscompare the performance of adaptive regulariza-tion (OMMD-II) and fixed regularization (lin-opt) on protein and covtype datasets.
Figure 3: Results to verify the effectiveness of OMMD-II for online deep learning. The plots showthe average cumulative loss, training loss and test loss for both tasks (task L/R) on MultiMNIST.
Figure 4: Illustration of an example in which the projection-based metric ∆tproj fails to measure thePareto optimality of the generated decision xt . The light blue area and the orange area represent thedecision set X and its image set Ft(X), respectively. The blue line segments constitute the Paretooptimal set Xj. The red line segments constitute the Pareto front Pt. As shown in the plot, in thisexample, the projection-based metric ∆tproj compares Ft (xt) with the farthest point Ft (xproj) inthe Pareto front; the comparator xproj does not even dominate xt. In contrast, PSG compares Ft(xt)with the nearest point Ft(xPSG) in the Pareto front; the comparator xPSG indeed dominates xt.
