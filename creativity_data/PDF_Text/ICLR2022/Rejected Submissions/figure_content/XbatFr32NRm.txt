Figure 1:	A sample image from the Adience dataset. Instead of using the original images, such asFigure 1a, we use affine-transformed images, as in Figure 1b.
Figure 2:	The age distribution of the Adience (Figure 2a) and IMDB-WIKI (Figure 2b) datasets.
Figure 3: The neural network architecture of the 2-class gender classification model2. The skipconnections are depicted with the arrows that go over multiple layers.
Figure 4: Cross-entropy loss vs. epoch in training gender and classification, with random and pre-trained initialization. The top, middle, and the bottom rows are the 2-class gender, 8-class age, and“modified” 8-class age classification task, respectively. Random initialization is done with KaimingHe uniform random initialization (He et al., 2015). We ran five-fold cross validation five times. Thereported numbers are the averages of the 25 runs.
Figure 5: Top row faces are the ten Adience pictures with the lowest entropy. Their entropy valuesare all zero, which means that the model is 100% sure of its predictions. Bottom row faces are theten Adience ones with the highest entropy. Their entropy values are all close to 0.6931, which is themaximum entropy for a binary classification.
