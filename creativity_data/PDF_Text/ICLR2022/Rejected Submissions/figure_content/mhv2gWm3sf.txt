Figure 1: Thermodynamic Variational Objective (TVO). Left:evidence lower bound (ELBO); middle:TVO is a Riemannian sum approximation of log p(x); right: log model evidence log p(x). TVO is atighter bound of log p(x) than ELBO.
Figure 2:	Variants of f -Thermodynamic Variational Objective (f -TVO). (a)Left Riemannian approxi-mation; (b) Right Riemannian approximation; (c)zig-zag Riemannian approximation.
Figure 3:	Effect of partition numbers. We evaluate f -TVO with partition numbers [1,2,5,10] ondatasets (a)Caltech (b) Frey Face (c) MNIST (d) Omniglot.
Figure 4: Effect of f -TVO variants. We evaluate f -TVO with all 3 variants: left riemannianapproximation, right Riemannian approximation, “zig-zag” Riemannian approximation, on datasets(a)Caltech (b) Frey Face (c) MNIST (d) Omniglot.
