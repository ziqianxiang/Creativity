Figure 1: Histogram of average scores by gender, first and last author, ICLR 2017 - ICLR 2021. Weobserve a pronounced gap in first author scores, but a mostly equal distribution for last authors.

Figure 3: (left) Mean reviewer scores as a function of number of authors, ICLR 2017 to ICLR 2021.
Figure 4: Geographic distribution of papers submitted and acceptedIt appears that the scoring difference between papers of Western and Asian origins is likely explainedin part by Asian authors having less professional experience on average than authors from otherregions. 84% of papers of East and South Asian origin were lead by a first-time author, whereasfirst-time authors lead 66% of papers from the US. We also suspect that scores are affected by gapsin English language experience in addition to cultural differences in how non-Western speakers writeand communicate, although we are not able to quantify these latter impacts.
