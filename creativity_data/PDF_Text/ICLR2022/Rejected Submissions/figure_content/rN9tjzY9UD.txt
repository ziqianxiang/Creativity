Figure 1:	Tensor network representation of a vector v ∈ Rd, a matrix M ∈ Rm×n and a tensorT ∈ Rd1 ×d2 ×d3 .
Figure 2:	Tensor network representation of common operation on matrices and tensors.
Figure 3:	Tensor network representation of common decomposition models for a 4th order tensor.
Figure 4: Evaluation of Greedy-TN on tensor decomposition. Curves represent the reconstructionerror averaged over 100 runs, shaded areas correspond to standard deviations and the vertical linerepresents the number of parameters of the target TN. Greedy corresponds to Greedy-TN withoutthe search for internal nodes (line 14 of Algo. 1) while Greedy-int. includes this search.
Figure 5: Image completion with 10% of the entries randomly observed. (left) Relative reconstructionerror. (right) Best recovered images for CP, Tucker, TT and TR, and 6 recovered images at differentiteration of greedy (image title: RSE% [number of parameters]).
Figure 6: Train and test accuracies on theMNIST dataset for different model sizes.
