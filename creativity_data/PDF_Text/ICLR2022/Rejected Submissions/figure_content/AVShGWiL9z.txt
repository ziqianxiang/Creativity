Figure 1: Inspired by principles of dendritic computation, our dendPLRNN extends each unit into aset of nonlinear branches connected to a soma, yielding single unit transfer functions with increasedapproximation capabilities. Image of dendrite from https://www.milad.no/blog/ (CC BY-SA 4.0).
Figure 2: Examples of low-dimensional model reconstructions: (a) Time series (left) and statespace trajectories (right) for the original Lorenz-63 chaotic attractor and simulations produced bya dendPLRNN trained with VI (B = 20, M = 15, λ = 1, Mreg/M = 0.5). Dots indicate true andreconstructed fixed points. (b) Same for the bursting neuron model, produced by a dendPLRNNtrained with TF (B = 47, M = 26, τ = 5). Note that the bursting is a complex limit cycle butnon-chaotic.
Figure 3: Examples of high-dimensional model reconstructions: (a) Time series (left), spatio-temporalevolution (center), and power spectra (right) for the true 10d Lorenz-96 system and for dendPLRNNsimulations (B = 50, M = 30, λ = 1.0, Mreg/M = 1.0). (b) Same for a 50d neural populationmodel producing coherent chaos (B = 5, M = 12, λ = 1.0, Mreg/M = 0.2).
Figure 4: Effect of basis expansion for dendPLRNN trained by VI. (a) Agreement in attractorgeometries (left) and 20-step ahead prediction error (right) for the Lorenz-63 system as a function ofthe number of bases (B) for fixed numbers of total parameters. (b) Agreement in attractor geometries(left) and 20-step ahead prediction error (right) for the Lorenz-63 system as a function of the numberof bases (B) for different numbers of latent states (M).
Figure S1: Correlation between the binning approximation (m = 30) and the logarithm of theGMM approximation (σ2 = 1) to Dstsp on the Lorenz-63 system for different noise realizationsand variances. Similar as reported for the KLZ approximation in Koppe et al. (2019) we observed alogarithmic relation between the GMM and binning based measures.
Figure S2: Example power spectrum for different values of the smoothing factor σ2 .
Figure S3:	Effect of basis expansion for dendPLRNN trained by VI. (a) Agreement in attractorgeometries (left) and 20-step ahead prediction error (right) for the bursting neuron system as afunction of the number of bases (B) for fixed numbers of total parameters. (b) Agreement in powerspectrum correlation (left) and 20-step ahead prediction error (right) for the Lorenz-96 system as afunction of the number of bases (B) for different numbers of latent states (M).
Figure S4:	We observed that the dendPLRNN frequently underwent bifurcations between fixed pointor various cyclic solutions until it reaches the chaotic behavior of the ground truth system.
