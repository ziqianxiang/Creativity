Figure 1: Deployment of an MRTA policy using CAM archi-tecture. a) Robot-1 at t°. b) Robot-2 at tι; here, the CAMoutput for previously selected task (task 2 in (b)) is set at 0.
Figure 2: CAM architecture with the information flow along the con-text, encoder & decoder. The node are represented by the coloredcircles, where the colors represents the time deadline. The robots arerepresented by the pentagon shapes and the robot highlighted (green)is the robot taking decision.
Figure 3: Node A belongs to a smaller sized graph G1, while B and C are nodes of a larger-sizedgraph G2. Based on the relative positions of its neighbor nodes (represented by the dashed lines), andthe deadline of neighbor nodes (color of the nodes), A, B , and C has a similar neighborhood.
