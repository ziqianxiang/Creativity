Figure 1: Regularization target comparison between the proposed scheme (b) and kernel orthog-onality (a). Green part stands for zero entries (this figure is best viewed in color). Index 1 to Ndenotes the filter indices. In (b, c), filter 2 and N are the unimportant filters to be removed. (a)Regularization target of pure kernel orthogonality (an identity matrix), no pruning considered. (b)Regularization target when considering both kernel orthogonality and filter pruning.
Figure 2: Mean JSV and test accuracy during finetuning with different setups (network: MLP-7-Linear, dataset: MNIST). L1 refers to the L1-norm pruning (Li et al., 2017). OrthP is the dynamicalisometry recovery method proposed by (Wang et al., 2021a). Below each plot are, in order, the bestaccuracy of LR 1e-2, the best accuracy of LR 1e-3, and the mean JSV right after pruning (i.e.,without finetuning). LR 1e-2 and 1e-3 are short for two finetuning LR schedules following (Wanget al., 2021a): {0:1e-2, 30:1e-3, 60:1e-4, #epochs:90}, {0:1e-3, 45:1e-4,#epochs:90}. The accuracies are averaged by 5 random runs. For reference, the unpruned modelhas mean JSV 2.4987, test accuracy 92.77.
