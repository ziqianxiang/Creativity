Figure 1: A diagram of our model showing generation of two CNN layers: transformer-based weightgenerators receive global and local features along with sample labels as their inputs and produceCNN layer weights (θ1 and θ2). After being generated, the CNN model is used to compute the losson the query set. The gradients of this loss are then used to adjust the weights of the entire weightgeneration model.

Figure 3: (Left) Test accuracies for the generated 4-, 6- and 8-channel CNN models on the 5-shot-20-way OMNIGLOT task. Models with only the last logits layer generated (red) are characterizedby lower test accuracies compared to the models with some or all convolutional layers also beinggenerated (blue, green). Similar plot for TIEREDIMAGENET can be found in Appendix (Fig. 13).
