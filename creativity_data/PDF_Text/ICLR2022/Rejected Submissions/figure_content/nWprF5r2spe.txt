Figure 1: Example of four FL clientswith data distributions P1 , . . . , P4. Theshaded area (Agnostic FL’s ambiguityset) is covered by the blue ball with ra-dius ρ and centered at Pbλ (Wassersteinambiguity set). For domain adaptationwith Q as a target domain, the nom-inal distribution (multi-source domain).	..C r	J	YY	L / J	Nis shifted to Pλ0 such that W2 (Pλ0 , Q)is minimal.

Figure 3:	Global accuracy and loss of with different values of γ on MNIST and CIFAR-10 under clean dataand distribution shifts (40% of clients are affected by PGD attack). The blue vertical line indicates the value ofγ giving the same level of PGD attack(γ = 0.05 for MNIST and γ = 0.5 for CIFAR-10).
Figure 4:	Comparison with other robust methods on MNIST and CIFAR-10 at different proportion of attackedclients (clients are affected by distribution shifts).
