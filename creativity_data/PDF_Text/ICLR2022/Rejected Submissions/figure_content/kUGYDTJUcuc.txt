Figure 1:	(a) The top-down attention model: it divides the region (marked as red) into 4 sub-regions in the current resolution, and then concatenates features of each region (extracted fromneural networks) as in the input to action network to decide which sub-region it should choose toattend; This process repeats to select sub-region in the next level of image pyramid (b) the bottom-up attention model: based on the location output from the top-down attention model, it extractsfeatures at different scales at the current location and then combines location feature as input torecurrent neural networks and action network to decide next location.
