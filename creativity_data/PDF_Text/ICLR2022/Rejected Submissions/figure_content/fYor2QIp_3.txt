Figure 1: The network architecture of this work. we defined that L is the protein sequence length, dis the hidden dimension size and N is the number of GO terms in each GO domain.
Figure 2: The performance of our model against baseline models on the CAFA3Baseline Models and Results We compared our model using baseline models. The baseline mod-els were Naive, DIAMONDScore, DeepGoCNN, and TALE. Naive predicted protein functions us-ing prior probability. DIAMONDScore predicted protein functions based on the sequence similar-ity measured using the Diamond tool (Buchfink et al., 2015). DeepGoCNN was the most famoussequence-based PFP model, using 1D CNN protein sequence encoder and a flat multi-label clas-sifier (Kulmanov & Hoehndorf, 2020). TALE was the state-of-the-art sequence-based PFP model,using a transformer encoder for protein sequences encoding and embedding GO terms with hi-erarchical information (Cao & Shen, 2021). Results were shown in Figure 2. Overall, our modelachieved the best performance on all domains in AUPR and on biological process (BPO) in F max.
