Figure 1: Illustration of the proposed robust late-fusion method. Before unimodal raw logit zA andzB are fused, the Jacobian regularization technique is applied. Roughly speaking, it will enforcethe derivative of p with respect to zA becomes smaller. Thus, when zA is perturbed to z0A (dueto random corruption or adversarial attack), the change of multimodal prediction ||p0 - p|| will belimited to some extent. For the illustration purpose, all variables here (e.g., p, zA) are drawn inone-dimensional space.
Figure 2: (Unimodal case) The leftmost figure reveals the results of training and testing on cleandata. The heatmap in the background represents the value of ||JW||F . The remaining right threefigures show the results of testing on data with Gaussian noise, and similarly, the heatmap in thebackground represents the value of ||JWxW||F. For each figure, the test accuracy on clean andnoisy data are reported at the left top and right bottom.
Figure 3: (Multimodal case) The leftmost column reveals the results of training and testing on cleandata. For illustration purpose, we only perturb the Y-coordinates with Gaussian noise. The firstand second row correspond to small and large noise, respectively. Heatmaps reveal the values of||JW||F in (a) and ||JWAW||F in (b), (c), and (d). For each figure, the test accuracy on clean andnoisy data are reported at the left top and right bottom.
Figure 4: Accuracies of multimodal networks obtained by statistically fusing a vanilla image net-work and audio network with γ = 0.1. Mean and Std of 20 repeated experiments are shown by thesolid lines and the shaded regions, respectively. Note that FGSM attack is rather deterministic, thusthere is almost no variance when repeating experiments.
Figure 6: Accuracies of multimodal networks obtained by statistically fusing a vanilla image net-work and audio network with γ = 0.1 (the 1-st row), γ = 0.5 (the 2-nd row), and γ = 0.9 (the3-rd row). Mean and Std of 20 repeated experiments are shown by the solid lines and the shadedregions, respectively. Note that FGSM attack is deterministic, thus there is almost no variance whenrepeating experiments.

Mean and Std of 5 repeated experiments are shown by the solid lines and theshaded regions, respectively.
