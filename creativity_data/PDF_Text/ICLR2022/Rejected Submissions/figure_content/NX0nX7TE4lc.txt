Figure 1: Illustration of Diversifyï¼š (a) Domain generalization for image data require known do-main labels. (b) Domain label is unknown for time series. (C) If we treat the time series data as onesingle domain, the sub-domains are misclassified. Different colors and shapes correspond to differ-ent classes and domains. (d) Finally, our Diversify can effectively learn the latent distributions.
