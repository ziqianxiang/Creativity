Figure 1: Visualization of the generated images among: clean image, ILA, and Aug-ILA (Ours), with theperturbation budget = 0.03. Rather than adding uninterpretable noise, Aug-ILA appears to smoothen theoriginal fine texture and overwrite new texture on the image.
Figure 2: Attack transferability over different choices of the intermediate layer for ResNet50, VGG19 andInception V3. The dotted curve shows the performance of ILA without augmentation. ‘3-1’ in ResNet50 refersto the first residual block of the third meta-block. The naming of layers of Inception V3 follows the PyTorchconvention.

Figure 5: Attack success rates of applying translation, cropping, rotation and color jittering as augmentationin ILA.
Figure 6: Attack success rates of different augmentation, in conjunction with adversarial reverse update (de-noted as adversarial). The performance of simple augmentation without reverse adversarial update is alsoincluded as baseline.
