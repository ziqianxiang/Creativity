Figure 1: Left: An example heterogeneous graph, with 3 node types and 4 edge types. ◊ repre-sents authors, O represents publications, and 口 represents venues. This heterogeneous graphcan be represented as a set of adjacency matrices, one for each edge type. In this paper, we designlinear mappings between each adjacency matrix, allowing us to learn, for example, how author-colleagues-with-author relationships and publication-published-at-venue relationships can in-fluence author-associated-with-venue relationships.
