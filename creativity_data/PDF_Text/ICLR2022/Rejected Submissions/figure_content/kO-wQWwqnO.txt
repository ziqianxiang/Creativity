For the present problem, there is a requirement of paired images such that the low-lightimage serves as input while its brighter counterpart serves as the target image. The Adobe 5k dataset(Vladimir et al., 2011) serves as a benchmark used by many researchers for this task. This datasetprovides an original low light image, retouched by five different photographic experts, one of which1Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2022is used as the target of supervised training. Some researchers have also used a synthetic paired setfor the same by intentionally transforming a bright image to generate its dark counterpart. Thistransformation being global, its suitability for challenging real time images is arguable. Ideally, atraining procedure without the requirement of paired supervision is the most appropriate solution.
