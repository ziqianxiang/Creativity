Figure 1:	The estimated log-base-weight function `θ as a function of logarithms of the empirical den-sity of the treatment log(pb(a)) and conditional distribution log(pb(a|x)). We perform the experiment100 times and report the median and the inter-quantile range. We align all curves by normalizingtheir value at the beginning to zero.
Figure 2:	(a) The average treatment effect curve for measuring the impact of P M2.5 concentrationon the cardiovascular mortality rate. We perform the experiment 100 times and report the mean and±std range. (b) The estimated log-base-weight function `θ as a function of logarithm of the empiricaldensity of the treatment log(pb(a)).
