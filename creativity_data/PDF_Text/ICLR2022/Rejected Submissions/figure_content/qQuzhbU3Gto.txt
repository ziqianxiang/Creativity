Figure 1: The motivating synthetic graph. The expected adjacency matrix (left) and the sampledmatrix (right); the latter is passed to the training algorithms. The network is approximately a unionof ten bipartite graphs, each of which correspond to recruiters and non-recruiters at one of the tenlocations.
Figure 2: (Right) Reconstructions of the motivating synthetic graph of Figure 1 with SVD, BigClam,and our model, using 12 communities or singular vectors. Note the lack of the small diagonal structurein BigClamâ€™s reconstruction; this corresponds to its inability to capture the heterophilous interactionbetween recruiters and non-recruiters. (Left) Frobenius error when reconstructing the motivatingsynthetic graph of Figure 1 with SVD, BigClam, and our model, as the embedding length is varied.
Figure 3:	Error when reconstructing real-world graphs with SymNMF, SVD, BigClam, and ourmodel. Frobenius error is normalized as in Figure 2; cross-entropy is normalized by the number ofentries of the matrix (n2).
