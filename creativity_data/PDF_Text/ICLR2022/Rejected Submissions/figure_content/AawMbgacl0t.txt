Figure 1: Cross path similarity ∣ ((Pi(OP))I I(Pt- I(Ipt- I))I for AleXNet trained on CIFAR-10 data in the(at Θaj∙ )∙(at-1 OajT)left column and the quantity --t~~j「“ t-1~~jtτ- in the right column. The top row depicts the 4th|(at Oaj) ||(ai Oaj )|layer of the network and the bottom row the 1rst layer of the network. We find that for a majority oftraining, there is not a perfect correlation for either quantity, indicating images intersect each otheron different features at different points in training.

Figure 4: Path overlap Pt ∙ P versus distance in original space ||xi - Xj||2 for AleXNet trained onCIFAR 10. Layer 6 shown on the left and Layer 2 shown on the right. We find that there is not aclean linear relationship between distance in original space and overlap in path vectors, supportingthe case for considering each image update as its own function.
