Figure 1: Proposed architecture consisting of N speech-MLP blocks, comprising three components:(1) a linear transformation as pre-projection; (2) a Split & Glue layer as the main processing module;and (3) another linear transformation as post-processing.
Figure 2: The Split & Glue layer, best viewed in color. The input feature X is split to 2 chunks(denoted by blue and green box respectively), and the window sizes of the unfold operation are setto 3 and 5 respectively for the two chunks. The red box indicates a single time step, and ‘P’ in Xw1and Xw2 represents padding.
