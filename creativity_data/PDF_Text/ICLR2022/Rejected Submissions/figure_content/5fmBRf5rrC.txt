Figure 1: m-Gaussian mixture transferred with KRDA to an n-Gaussian mixture; we plot the source(blue), target (green), transferred (orange) and some mappings (red).
Figure 2: KRDA on the inter-twinning moon dataset with different number of components; we plotthe source (blue), target (green), transferred (orange) and some mappings (red).
Figure 3: The learning curves of different UDA algorithms under different source and target trainingsizes. KRDA has excellent performance on small data sets and it shows very stable accuracy overdifferent training sizes.
