Figure 2: DKE simulation. 1000 agents are trained on 500 synchronised episodes of the underlyingMDP and the trust model on each of the 3 mazes. Hyperparameters are set to: (α, y, α, ^) =(0.1, 0.99, 0.01, 0.99) for the 3 mazes. Estimate of the central tendency (mean estimator) and 95%confidence interval of self-confidence computed by SelfQ-Trust vs. learning episode.
Figure 3: Sensitivity to learning hyperparameters α, γ, α and γ. We set (α,γ,α,^) =(0.1, 0.9, 0.1, 0.9) then for each of the figures we vary the hyperparameter studied in the set{0.0i, 0.02,0.05,0.1,0.2} for a and a and in the set {0.8,0.9,0.99,0.999} for Y and ^. Estimateof the central tendency (mean estimator) and 95% confidence interval of self-confidence computedby SelfQ-Trust vs. learning episode.
Figure 4: Sensitivity to environment complexity measured with the metric M2. 600 agents aretrained on 8 mazes of dimension (10, 10) and complexity (18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88). (a,b) Self-confidence vs. episode with two different discount factors of trust. Y = 0.9 in (a) and Y = 0.99in (b). (c) Self-confidence tendency per agent vs. complexity in both cases. All curves show anestimate of the central tendency (mean estimator) and 95% confidence intervalWe also observe on Figure 4(a) and (b) that the overconfidence peak occurring at the outset oflearning is not exclusive. Depending on the trust discount factor and the level of complexity, oneor two more peaks appear afterwards. This repetition of overconfidence peaks at the beginningof learning has not been reported in any of the social science research we have studied, and mayconstitute a new hypothesis.
