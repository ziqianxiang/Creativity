Figure 1: Bouncing balls example (re-printed, with permission, from Battaglia et al. (2016)). Naturalinputs, x, correspond to pixel observations. Predicting future observations (natural outputs, y), canbe simplified as follows: if we are able to extract a set of abstract inputs, X, (e.g. the radius, positionand velocity for each ball), the movements in this space must obey the laws of physics.

Figure 3: RMR for bouncing balls reconstruction rollout. States marked in green are the naturalinput, followed by the reconstructed output. The states below the reconstruction is the ground truth.
Figure 4: A hierarchically clustered heatmap depiction of the transfer results, where the Train Gameabstract models have been trained on the Test Games. The results are summarised by a Wilcoxontest, denoting where the performance of RMR is better, does not differ or is worse than C-SWMâ€™s.
Figure 5: Bit-level F1 scores for the Atari experiments while varying the latent size. A clear de-creasing trend is apparent a dim z is reduced, indicating the bottleneck effect.
