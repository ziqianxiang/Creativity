Figure 1: Evaluation of graph reconstruction on synthetic compressed graphs in 20-d embeddingspaces (10-d complex hyperbolic space for UnitBall). m represents the number of nodes in the graphwhile k represents the number of random trees aggregated to the graph (k controls the denseness andnoise level of the graph). The statistics of the compressed graphs are provided in the tables.
Figure 2: Left: The cloud tree plot of Xiphophorus. Right: The 1-N structure statistics in YAGO3-wikiObjects original taxonomy. The horizontal axis represents the number of parents linked to anode. The vertical axis counts the number of nodes and edges in the 1-N structures. For example,there are 4, 107 nodes that link to N parents for 2 ≤ N ≤ 5, and these links count to 10, 550 edges.
Figure 3:	Some subtrees of Xiphophorus. The multitree dataset XiPhoPhorUs contains 160 trees on26 Xiphophorus fishes as leaf nodes.
Figure 4:	Simple examples of the synthetic data. The numbers {0,1,..., 6} represent the nodes. Thecompressed graph-(m = 7, k = 2) on the right are aggregated from the middle two compressedgraphs-(m = 7, k = 1).
Figure 5: Evaluation of graph reconstruction on synthetic balanced trees in 20-d embedding spaces(10-d complex hyperbolic space for UnitBall). r represents the degree while h represents the depth.
