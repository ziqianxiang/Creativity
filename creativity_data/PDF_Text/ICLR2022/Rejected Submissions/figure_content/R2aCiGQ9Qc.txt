Figure 1: Accuracy of nodes grouped by degree dion Citeseer. Initial stage: when mean effectiVe ho-mophily bhli (ratio of a node’s neighbors in the sameclass—§ 3.3.2) is high, the accuracy increases as thedegree increases. DeVeloping stage: when bhli is low,the accuracy of high-degree nodes drops more sharply.
Figure 2: Node representation dynamics during neighborhood aggregation (in 1D for illustration purposes; ‘MR’:misclassification rate). The expectation of node representations from class 1 & 2 are denoted by μ and -μ,respectively. The bars show the expected node representations of node vi before and after the aggregation.
