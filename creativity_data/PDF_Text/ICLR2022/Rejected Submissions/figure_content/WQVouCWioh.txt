Figure 1: Growing a synthetic dataset and training unconditional language models with DARK. An illus-trative overview of the procedure used by DARK to iteratively grow a training set of synthetic sequences thatare used to train increasingly performant generative models. The final structure generation with AlphaFold forsampled sequences is also included.
Figure 2: Generating de novo designed sequences with AlphaFold refinement and DARK3. (A) Overviewof our AlphaFold refinement approach. (B) Comparisons of the method and two benchmarks in C. (C) Plotshowing the design trajectories for 10 DARK samples with AlphaFold refinement (10K steps) compared to10 runs of the Simulated Annealing benchmark and 10 runs of the Greedy benchmark (both 20K steps).(D)Structures and metrics of the 10 AlphaFold refinement examples in C before and after refinement. (E) Averagedmetrics of the benchmarked methods, with more detailed metrics for AlphaFold refinement.
Figure 3: Showing the structure of a DARK sampled sequence predicted to have an immunoglobin fold by Al-phaFold. The structure of the sequence is shown after AlphaFold refinement along with the change in pLDDT,the Cα-RMSD difference between the two structures, and the sequence identity between the two sequences.
Figure 4: The superimposed structures of 10 examples produced by simulated annealing of the AlphaFold IG-score, in essence, a trDesign approach with AlphaFold. All 10 examples achieve a low IG-score of 1.28 (ourmethod achieves 2.10) but an extremely high mean pLDDT of 97. This direct approach to maximizing theAlphaFold IG-score effectively generates adversarial examples, evident in all samples being predicted to havethe same single long helix. The structures are visualized with ChimeraX (Pettersen et al., 2021)Figure 5: DARK3 paired with AlphaFold unconditionally samples diverse predicted structures. We showvaried examples of protein structures, predicted by AlphaFold, for sequences sampled directly from DARK3without any refinement. These structures have a variety of different folds, and are visualized with ChimeraX(Pettersen et al., 2021). For clarity, we split the rows into examples of all-α, α & β, and all-β structures.

Figure 6: Agreement between Rosetta and AlphaFold structure prediction. Predicted structures of a se-quence sample (ID 209a) using AlphaFold and Rosetta AbinitioRelax. Both approaches are in agreement, pro-ducing close to the same structure. For the latter, the best predicted structure with the lowest Rosetta all-atomscore is used, being -279. The root-mean-square deviation between α carbons in the two different predictionsis included.
Figure 7: DARK models generate samples with confidently predicted structures. A Normalized histogramsof the pLDDT scores produced by AlphaFold when predicting structures for three sets of sequence samples,each containing 1000 sequences. A skew-normal is fit to each set and plotted for clarity. Random refers touniformly random sequences of L = 100. The Good+ pLDDT (pLDDT> 70) proportion is also included.
Figure 8: Rosetta predicts correct fold and potential alternative conformation. The top 1000 predictedstructures (by Rosetta score) for a sampled sequence, of 10000 structures, produced by the Rosetta AbinitioRe-lax protocol. Rosetta scores are expressed in Rosetta Energy Units (REU; lower values are better). RMSD isroot-mean-square deviation (RMSD) in A from the AlPhaFold structure prediction of the sampled sequenceusing α-carbon atoms. The best model is bottom left but a second peak suggests an alternative conformationmay be possible (bottom right). We note a similarity to the multi-peak distributions presented in Figures 2B &2C of Norn et al. (2021).
