Figure 1: Transferring across tasks in Colored MNIST (Arjovsky et al., 2019). On the source task,we learn a color-invariant model that achieves oracle performance (given direct access to the unstablefeatures). However, directly transferring this model to the target task, by reusing or fine-tuning itsfeature extractor, severely overfits the spurious correlation and underperforms the majority baseline(50%) on a test set where the spurious correlation flips. By explicitly transferring the unstable features,our algorithm tofu (Transfer OF Unstable features) is able to reach the oracle performance.
Figure 2: Our algorithm tofu 1) infers unstable features from the source task (Section 3.1) and 2)learns stable correlations for the target task (Section 3.2). We create partitions for all environmentpairs. For ease of illustration, we only depict using f1 to partition E2 . Best viewed in color.
Figure 3: PCA visualization of the un-stable feature representation fz for ex-amples in MNIST EVEN. fz is trainedon MNIST odd. TOFU identifies thehidden spurious color feature by con-trasting different source environments.
Figure 4: Visualization of the unknown attribute Maleon CelebA. Left: distributions of Male in the trainingdata. Mid: partitions learned by tofu. Right: partitionslearned by EIIL. TOFU generates partitions that are moreinformative of the unknown attribute (14% vs. 2%). SeeAppendix F for results on more attributes.
