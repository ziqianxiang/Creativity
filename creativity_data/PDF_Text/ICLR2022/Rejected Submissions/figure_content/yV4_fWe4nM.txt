Figure 1: Note the red and blue points are instances with different PSV values. Traditional fairclustering (left) aims to find a fair partition of the data while minimizing some classic clusteringobjectives. Deep fair clustering (right) aims to learn a general fair representation to cluster the data.
Figure 2: Experimental results on novel predictive clustering settings and classic tabular datasets.
Figure 3: t-SNE visualization of learned embedding, color red and blue indicate different PSV values.
Figure 4: Sensitivity analysis of hyper-parameter Î² which serves as the weights for fairness objective.
