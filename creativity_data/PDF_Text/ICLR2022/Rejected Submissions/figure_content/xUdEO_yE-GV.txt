Figure 1: 2D and 3D delineation. (a) Aerial image and slice of a microscopy stack. (b) A network trainedusing a standard homology-based loss yields road and neurite interruptions. (c) One trained using our localizedloss is more topologically accurate and produces predictions that closely resemble the ground truth (d).
Figure 2: Filtration. When the distance map shown on the left is filtered by thresholding, the loop h emergesat scale bh and is filled at scale dh. This gives rise to the point (bh , dh) in the persistence diagram shown onthe right. Here, thresholding means retaining all pixels whose value is lower than the threshold.
Figure 3: Comparing filtration functions on synthetic data. The binary ground truth road annotation (top-left in each table part) contains four loops, marked with cyan dashed lines. We synthesized a predicted classaffinity map (bottom-left in each part) by extending one road to the left and interrupting another. In conse-quence, loop B and D from the ground truth are joined into B’ in the prediction, and A is split into A’ and E’.
