Figure 1: Performance between SARAH and ZeroSARAH under different datasets (columns) withrespect to different stepsizes (rows). In rows, we have stepsizes 0.01, 0.1, 1, respectively. Incolumns, we have LIBSVM datasates ‘abalone’, ‘triazines’, ‘mg’, ‘pyrim’, respectively.
Figure 2: Performance between distributed SARAH and distributed ZeroSARAH under differentdatasets (columns). We show convergence using the theoretical stepsize in red lines; in blue lines,we scale it by factor ×3; in green lines, we scale it by factor ×9.
