Figure 1: Power spectrum (solid black line) and spectral envelop (orange dashed line) for two vowelsuttered by a male speaker.
Figure 2: Qualitative example of modified and generated spectrograms with the proposed method.
Figure 3: Correlation matrix of thelearned latent subspaces basis vectors.
Figure 4: Architecture of the VAE. The number of neurons for each fully-connected layer is indi-cated below “FC”, within each gray box. The input/output vector dimension of the VAE is 513 andthe latent vector dimension is 16.
Figure 5: Visualization of trajectories in the learned latent subspaces.
Figure 6: Power spectra (solid black line) and spectral envelopes (dashed orange line) obtainedusing the conditional prior in equation (9) (generalized to conditioning on multiple factors). Eachsubfigure contains three plots where we vary the value of one single factor at a time: f0 in (a), f1 in(b), f2 in (c) and f3 in (d).
Figure 7: Figure (a) shows the spectrogram of a vowel uttered by a male speaker. Figures (b), (c),(d) and (e) show transformations of this spectrogram with the proposed method, where we vary f0,f1 , f2 , and f3 , respectively. The target value for these factors is indicated by the dashed blue line.
Figure 8: Each line in this figure corresponds to a speech signal uttered by a different speaker. Left:spectrogram of the original speech signal; Middle: transformed spectrogram where the fundamen-tal frequency is set constant over time; Right: transformed spectrogram where the original voicedspeech signal (left) is converted into a whispered speech signal (i.e., the fundamental frequency isremoved).
