Figure 1: Difference in en-ergy consumption with differ-ent number of iterations,4 NODEAttackWe elaborate the approach of NODEAttack through this section. First, we define two types ofenergy robustness in this section. Based on the definitions, we formulate the problem and proposetwo type of energy attacks against Neural ODEs.
