Figure 1: Illustration of the (a) activation outputs of 16 filters of a conv2d layer, and (b) input andoutput tensors of a convolution layer. In (a), the left portion shows the original image and the imageafter data augmentation; and the right portion visualizes the activation outputs of each filter.
Figure 2: Attentions of each filter of the first convolution layer of ResNet-50 on ImageNet withdifferent values of p (p â€œ 1, 2, 4).
Figure 3: The effect of the rewinding epoch (x-axis) on (a) Top-1 test accuracy, and (b) pruningstability, for pruned ResNet-50, when 83.74% of parameters are remaining.
Figure 4: Illustration of the changesof the accuracy loss and parameter re-duction over the pruning rounds as thepruning threshold adapts when pruningResNet-56 with CIFAR-10, given thetarget of 1% Top-1 accuracy loss.
