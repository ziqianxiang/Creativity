Figure 1: First row (column) shows the heatmap of Lr (Lc) at different t. A darker color indicatesa stronger similarity captured by the adaptive regularizer. The (i, j)-th element in the heatmap ofLr(t) has a darker color than the (i, j0)-th element indicate that the t-th row is more related to j-throw compared with j0-th row. The area in the middle of the dotted line corresponding to the smallblock in the figure represents the part of the adaptive positive that is considered similar.
Figure 2: Compare adaptive regularizer with fixed regularizer. The NMAE of recovered Baboonunder three types of sampling, including random missing 30% pixels, patch missing, and texturemissing, respectively. The blue line indicates the NMAE during training vanilla AIR-Net. Take theLr (t) and Lc (t) out, t equals 3000, 7000, 9000 respectively. The remind three lines in each figureindicate replacing the Lr and Lc with fixed Lr (t) and Lc(t).
Figure 3: NMAE during training of DMF and AIR-Net. All the figures show the NMAE changeswith the training step. The first row shows the results of Cameraman with (a) random missing(The proportion of different percentage figures show that the random missing) (b) textural missing(c) patch missing. The second row shows the remind data type with random missing respectively,including (d) Syn-Netflix, (e)IC and (f) GPCR.
Figure 4: Compared KNN(Goldberger et al., 2004), SVD(Troyanskaya et al., 2001), PNMC(Yang& Xu, 2020), DMF(Arora et al., 2019), RDMF(Li et al., 2020), AIR-Net(proposed) on Babara withthree types of data respectively.
Figure 5: The first column shows the realistic relationship among columns and rows respectively.
Figure 6: The first row shows the real data of Syn-Netflix, IC and GPCR respectively. The secondrow shows the corresponding NMAE during training.
