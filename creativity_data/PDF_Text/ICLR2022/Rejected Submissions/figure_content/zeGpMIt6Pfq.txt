Figure 1: Visual comparison of convolutional and local connections for a given filter; in convolu-tional connections, the weights are shared between all receptive fields. However, in a local connec-tions, each receptive field has its own set of weights.
Figure 2: Graphical representation of the proposed network; locally connected filters will be appliedto the rate-coded input image. Based on a winner-take-all inhibition mechanism, the most relevantfeatures from each receptive field transmit their spikes to the decoding layer, which selects the mostactive neuronal group as the predicted label exploiting lateral inhibitory connections. The red linesindicate inhibitory connections.

Figure 4: Smoothed running accuracy over the training set for four sets of hyperparameters usingthe R-STDP classifierOverall, the supervised SVM has achieved a better performance than the R-STDP method. Twoimportant observations can be made from Table 2. First, the classification accuracy has a positivecorrelation with the filter size, and the number of neurons in the decoding layer. Secondly, thedynamic RPE mechanism improved the classification performance compared to the default staticrewarding mechanism. dynamic RPE plays a similar role to the adaptive learning rate method em-ployed by Mozafari et al. (2018), yet with more biological roots and empirical support.
Figure 5: Classical conditioning experiment; in this experiment, we tested the adaptability of thenetwork to varying target responses. The plot shows the rate of receiving reward and punishmentaveraged over 20 runs, and the decoding layer weight maps at iterations 0, 200, 300, 400, and 600.
