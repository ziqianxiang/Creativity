Figure 1: (Top) The evolution of the KL divergence, the score matching metric and the TV normof the trained measure (i.e., the F1 norm) during training for Algorithm 1 with X = S14, m = 64,PR = 0, S = 0.02, n =105, N =2 ∙ 105 and a = 0.05 (primal training) or α = 20 (dual training),showing a speedup by a factor about 10-20 of the latter over the former. The angle between the twoteacher neurons is 1.37 rad (monomodal distribution). (Bottom) Same experiments with an angle of2.87 rad between the two teacher neurons (bimodal distribution).
