Figure 1: Visualizing improved OoD separability of intra-class mixup trained ResNet18 model.
Figure 2: Comparison of average AUROC performance (averaged over in-dist and OoD datasets and5 seeds) of methods that use distance proxies improved with the use of angular margin and intra-classmixup. Please note that “Vanilla cos” by definition cannot use the additional angular margin term,hence its not plotted.
