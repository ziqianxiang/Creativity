Figure 1: (A) Directed graphical model under consideration. (B-1) In traditional Langevin dynam-ics, the samples are directly updated in the latent space. (B-2) Our amortized Langevin dynamicsreplace the update of latent samples with an inference model fz|x that maps the observation x intothe latent variable z.
Figure 2: Visualization of ground truth density (left) and samples by ALD (right) in the conditionalcase (A) and the unconditional case (B) in toy examples.
Figure 3: Evolution of sample values across MCMC iterations for traditional LD and our SGALDin univariate Gaussian examples. The black lines denote the ground truth posteriors (the solid linesshow the mean values, and the dashed lines show the standard deviation).
