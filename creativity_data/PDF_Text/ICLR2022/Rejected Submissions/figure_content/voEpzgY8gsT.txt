Figure 3: KL Divergence for second-order Poisson process. The order of the model (color of theline) represents the k-th order model, i.e., k = 1 (blue) and k = 2 (orange).
Figure 4: Intensity function of two dimensional processes. Dots represent observations. Left: Repre-sents marginalized observation of the first dimension. Middle: Represents marginalized observationof the second dimension. Right: The joint observation of dimension 1 and 2. The order of the model(color of the line) represents the k-th order model, i.e., k = 1 (blue) and k = 2 (orange).
Figure 5:	KL Divergence for fourth-order Poisson process. We selected four representative examplesfor our experimental results, full results available in the supplementary material. The line colorsignifies the order of the model, i.e., k = 1 (blue), k = 2 (orange), k = 3 (green) and k = 4 (red).
Figure 6:	Intensity function of higher dimensional processes. Dots represent observations. Wehave selected four representative examples for our experimental results, full results available in thesupplementary material. The order of the model (color of the line) represents the k-th order model,i.e., k = 1 (blue), k = 2 (orange), k = 3 (green) and k = 4 (red).
