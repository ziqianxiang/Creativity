Figure 2: The graphical model that expresses thelearning process in the personalized FL and ourproposed method.
Figure 3: Test accuracy of personalized models (a) (b) and Communication rounds (c) (d) required toreach to target accuracy under Z ∈ [0,1]. Our AFML is compared with FedAvg-FT, FedAvg-Meta,and FedMAML based on the CIFAR100 (a) (c) and Shakespeare (b) (d) datasets.
Figure 4: Comparison of our AFML with three leading PFL methods on CIFAR100 and Shakespearedatasets. For System overhead in (a), we set the target accuracy as its test accuracy when convergence.
