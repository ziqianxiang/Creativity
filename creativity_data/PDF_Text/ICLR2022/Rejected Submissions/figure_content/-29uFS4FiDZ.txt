Figure 1: Sense embedding model3	ModelWe first describe our word sense embedding model. Then the details of extracting knowledge fromthe contextual embeddings in BERT are discussed.
Figure 2: Comparison of word embeddings and sense embeddings for topic modeling with differentvocabulary sizes. Here, ETM (sense) - ETM with BERTKDEmbed, ETM (mssg) - ETM with MSSG.
