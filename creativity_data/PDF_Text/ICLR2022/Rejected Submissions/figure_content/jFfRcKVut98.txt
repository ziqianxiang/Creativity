Figure 1: Partial group convolution. In a group convolution, the domain of the output is closed undergroup transformations of the input. Consequently, all response components are part of the outputregardless of the transformation applied to the input. Differently, the output domain S of a partialgroup convolution is not necessarily closed under input transformations. As a result, the featurerepresentation captured within S will change for different transformations of the input. In Fig. 1, forinstance, the output feature representation of the input (outlined in red) gradually leaves S for differenttransformations of the input. For large transformations (180Â° here), the responses within S changeentirely. This difference allows partial group convolutions to distinguish among input transformations.
Figure 2: Partial group convolution on a group subset. Contrary to the group convolution, partial groupconvolutions can receive an input whose domain is not the entire group G, but a subset thereof S(1) .
