Figure 1: Performance of FedSpa andseveral baselines w.r.t. communicationcost in Non-IID setting. Numbers aboveFedSpa and Sub-FedAvg are sparsity.
Figure 2: Overview of FedSpa. Firstly,the server masks and distributes thesparse weights. Secondly, clients do lo-cal training on a constantly sparse model.
Figure 3: Test Accuracy vs. Communication Roundssimulate two groups of Non-IID settings via Î³-Dirichlet distribution, named setting A and setting B.
Figure 4: FedSpa (DST) under different sparsity. Numbers in the labels are sparsity.
Figure 5: Layer-wise sparsity initialized by ERK or Uniform. Sparsity of FedSpa is fixed to 0.5.
Figure 6: Initialization based on same or different masks. Sparsity of FedSpa is fixed to 0.5.
Figure 7: Recovery with gradient information or random recovery. Sparsity is fixed to 0.5.
Figure 8: Global model vs. Personalized models. Sparsity of FedSpa is fixed to 0.5.
