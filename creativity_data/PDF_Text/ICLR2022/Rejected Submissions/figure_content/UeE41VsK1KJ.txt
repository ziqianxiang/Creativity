Figure 2: Results of OSL and the baselines on the open-ended regression task. (a) Ground-truth functions (solid)and the result of Vanilla (dashed). (b)(c) Results of MAMLand Modular. (d)(e)(f) Results of OSL with different num-ber of low-level models (solid). The dashed line in (f) in-dicates that OSL abandons a redundant model.
Figure 3: Impact of sampling hyperpa-rameters on OSL. (a) Fewer episodes(m = 50). (b) Fewer episodic sam-ples (n = 1). (c) The subjective errorwhen n = 1 (dashed lines representincorrect data allocations).
