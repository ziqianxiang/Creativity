Figure 2:	An intuitive illustration of the approximation: (a) Stage I and (b) Stage II. The blackcurves denote the energy functions. Green nodes and broWn nodes represent the true energy valuesand approximated values of neighbors, respectively. Note that the approximated values are obtainedbased on Taylor series of Eθ(∙) at x, as shown in Eq. (8). For clarity, we only show two neighborsof x in this figure, but this illustration can also be extended to include all neighbors.
