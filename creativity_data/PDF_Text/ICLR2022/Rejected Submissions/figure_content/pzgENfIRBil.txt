We also set F’s update interval IF = 50 in this experiment.

The IF -performance relation is shown as a U-shaped curve,which indicates that IF should be set to a moderate value, neither too large nor too small. The bestvalue of IF (the bottom of the U-shaped curve) is relevant to the total number of iterations T : IFshould be smaller for small T so F can be updated for reasonable times in very limited iterations,and should be moderately larger for large T so that the convergence acceleration technique (such asthe damping technique in equation 6) works better.
