Figure 1: Solving mSP with ScheduleNeL At every event of the MDP, ScheduleNet constructs the agent-taskgraph GT from Sτ, then computes the node embedding of GT using TGA, and finally computes the agent-taskassignment probabilities from the node embedding.

Figure 6: Disjunctive graph representation of JSPFigure 8: Agent-sharing constrainttechniques. A common representation of JSP is the disjunctive graph representation. As shown inFigures 6, 7 and 8, JSP contains the set of jobs, machines, precedence constraints, and disjunctiveconstraints as its entities. In the following sections, we provide the details of the proposed MDPformulation of JSP, training details of ScheduleNet, and experiment results.
