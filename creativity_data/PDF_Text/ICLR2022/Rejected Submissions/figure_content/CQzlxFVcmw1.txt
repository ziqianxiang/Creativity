Figure 1: The framework of several GNN frameworks. The green box refers to the message function.
Figure 2: The framework OfMSeaHKG. Fig. (b) represents concrete framework of MPNN layer inFig. (a), and Fig. (c) is detailed formulation of mg(∙; θ) in Fig. (b). The operator layer Cnt enablesthe connectivity of different layers (Jiang & Balaprakash, 2020).
Figure 3: The illustration to KGs and HKGs. The binary facts are simplified in (b) to make the 3-aryfacts look more prominent.
Figure 4: Several instantiation cases of MSeaHKG message function space. ◦ denotes circularcorrelation cοrr(∙) (Nickel et al., 2016), * denotes inner product mult(∙) (Yang et al., 2015),-denotes the substraction sυb(∙) (Bordes et al., 2013), ? is from RotatE (Sun et al., 2018).
