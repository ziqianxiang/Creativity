Figure 1: Illustrative category learning experiment: Training examples from the 3 independent training conditions, theextrapolation test, and characteristic behavior for learners with different inductive biases.
Figure 2: Formalizing the illustrative experiment: The experiment from Fig. (1) expressed in terms of the formalism inSection (3) with zdist = color and zdisc = shape. Background colors indicate true category boundary.
Figure 3: Spurious correlationacross data distributions (Eq. (3)).
Figure 4: Simple 2-D classification (Section (4)) The specific model used in (a) are bolded in (b).
Figure 6: CelebA results. Stimuli and results on various feature pairings from the CelebA domain (Section (6)). Error barsrepresent 95% confidence intervals across ResNets of various sizes. See figure sub-captions and main text for details.
Figure 7: We expand on Fig. (2) from the main text by including a realization of the abstract training conditions in the simple2D points-in-a-plane setting. (Top) Formalizing the illustrative experiment: The experiment from Fig. (1) expressed interms of the formalism in Section (3) with zdist = color and zdisc = shape. Background colors indicate true category boundary.
Figure 8:	CelebA EVR and FLB across feature pairs, averaged across 30 runs, split by depth and width of ResNet.
Figure 9:	We visualize several of the interpolants used for the interpolation analyses.
Figure 10: Interpolations away from the PE: changes in extrapolation behavior under data distribution with the same spuriouscorrelation as in PE, as well as different ways to change spurious correlation.
