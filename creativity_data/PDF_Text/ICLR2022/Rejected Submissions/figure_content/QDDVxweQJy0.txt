Figure 1: Clause graph of a goal clause. Each node has five features: clause type, node type,literal polarity, symbol hash and argument slot hash. The parts of formula correspondingto each node are shown outside of the nodes.
Figure 2: (a) Survival plot showing the progress of E and incremental learning with andwithout hindsight experience replay over the course of seven days of training. The time scaleis logarithmic. (b) Scatter plot of the shortest proof lengths achieved by E vs. incrementallearning with hindsight experience replay on the conjectures that can be proven by both.
