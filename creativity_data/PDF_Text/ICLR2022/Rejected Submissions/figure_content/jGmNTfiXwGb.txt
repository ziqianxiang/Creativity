Figure 1: Left: 1D time series X and the output of an offline piece-wise linear approximation (PLA)algorithm A(X). Right: The graphical decision-point representation (Section 2.1) of the structure{ao, ∙∙∙ , a4} using a greater-than relation between decision points.
Figure 2: Left: Extending the example from Figure 1, we show n = 5 decision points visible in wi .
Figure 3: The hard parameter sharing multi-task network for the case in which the structure sizen = 5, where n is both the number of decision points within a structure and the number of heads ofthe network. Under "Structure" we show the target structures for each Task-λ.
Figure 4: The internal structure of the CNN representation learner as well as the internal structureof a single MLP head (all MLPs are identical). For a complete definition of the model including allinput and output sizes of each layer, see [GitHub repository redacted for review].
