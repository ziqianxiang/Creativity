Figure 1: The right panel shows the gray original image and left panel shows image after beingpassed through high-pass filter. A good denoising algorithm should be able to suppress noise whilekeeping the edges sharp. NRRN’s architecture paired with our unsupervised training scheme removesthe noise and does a better job at preserving the edges of the organelles as compared to U-Net andDenoiseNet which were trained using supervised techniques.
Figure 2: Single Branch Architecturenot include the center pixel. As the blind-spot network has a little bit less information than N2N andN2C, it then expectantly cannot quite reach their performances, but still gives very good results.

Figure 5: NRRN denoising results, where the yellow doted line shows where image signal is measured:(a) validation image, (b) zoom in of the noisy input image, (c) zoom in of the denoised image, (d)box plot of the signal across the resin (from subfig. b) - showing the significant reduction in thesignal/noise variation, and (e) the signal variation across the mitochondria (from subfig. c)) - theNRRN denoising keeps sharp edges.
Figure 6: Left Panel: PSNR Histogram for the patches constructing a FIB-SEM image denoised withU-Net, NRRN and DenoiseNet. Right Panel: Comparison of the signal across the resin for U-Net,DenoiseNet, NRRN and the Ground Truth image. NRRN with its specific N2N loss function removesmore noise than the N2C trained methods. The IQR of NRRN outperform the rest of the networks.
Figure 7: Comparison of the denoising performance. Top to bottom: Input image, DenoiseNet,NRRN and U-Net. Left to right: added Poisson noise with peak = 1, 8, 30 and Gaussian noise withσ= 10, 75.
Figure 8: Iterative denoising process: a) Input signal scatter plot across the resin vs layers signal, b)SSIM at each layer for OHSU data set and EPFL with added Poisson noise with peak 1 and 30 (P1,P30) and added Gaussian Noise with σ = 15, 75 (G15,G75)U-Net and DenoiseNet, the winner is NRRN with 3 Building Units. For more noise corrupted images(as it was for EPFL with Poisson noise with peak 1-8 or Gaussian Noise with σ = 75) the 5 BUswith their bigger receptive field would be required.
