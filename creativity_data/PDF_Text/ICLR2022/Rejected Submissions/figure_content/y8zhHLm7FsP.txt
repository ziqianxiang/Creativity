Figure 1: The d = 2 example: (a) Open-loop (OL) and closed-loop (CL) eigenvalues; (b)-(d)Convergence of PtN : Plot of the entries of the matrix Pt(N) shows exponential convergence, witha small (random) error, to the ARE limit P∞ which is also depicted together with the exact DREsolution. (Note the x-axis of the plots (b)-(d) is T - t so convergence is easy to see).
Figure 2:	(a)-(b) Plot of MSE as a function of the number of particles N and system dimension d;(c) Comparison with algorithms in Fazel et al. (2018) (labeled [F18]) and Mohammadi et al. (2021b)(labeled [M21]). The comparisons depict the computation time (in a Python implementation) as afunction of the relative error in approximating the LQR gain K∞ .
