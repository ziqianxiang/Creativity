Figure 1: Architecture diagram of differentiable nonparametric belief propagation. DNBP combines domainknowledge in the form of graphical models with differentiable neural networks for tractable inference in con-tinuous spaces. Input features from a deep neural network and the probabilistic relationships encoded in agraphical model are learnedjointly in an end-to-end fashion using backpropagation. Following offline training,DNBP can be applied to unseen data without hand-tuning.

Figure 6: Comparison of articulated 'spider'tracking by LSTM (d,e,f) and DNBP (g,h,i) un-der cluttered conditions. Predicted and groundtruth keypoints shown as yellow circles. Cluttershown as faded shapes for illustration to high-light predictions.
Figure 8: Quantitative comparison between DNBP and neural network baseline on hand pose tracking taskof the FPHAB dataset. For each model the percent of frames with predicted pose less than a set threshold iscalculated as the threshold is varied from 0mm to 80mm.
Figure 9: Inspection of learned PairWiSe potentials from double pendulum tracking.
Figure 10: Inspection of DNBP's learned pairwise potentials from spider tracking. Only two of the six areshoWn to avoid redundancy, remaining four shoW very similar output.
Figure 11: Output from DNBP on randomly sampled frames of the hand Pose tracking experiment. Visualizedmodel uncertainty is calculated from the marginal belief estimates of DNBP as 1 standard deviation in the Xand y dimensions respectively as calculated by estimated covariance of belief particles. Uncertainty in depthdimension is not visualized.
