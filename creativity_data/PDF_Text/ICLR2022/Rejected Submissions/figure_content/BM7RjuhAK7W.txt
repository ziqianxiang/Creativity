Figure 1: Graphical model of spar-sity across state variables. The statevariable xt3+1 (shaded in blue) only de-pends on two variables xt3 and xt2 (inthe blue box). Predicting xt3+1 usingthe other variables (say xt1+1 ) can re-sult in spurious correlations which leadto poor generalization.
Figure 2: Architecture for learning model-invariantrepresentations. Model-invariance uses two (or more)transition dynamics models, denoted by f and h, over acommon representation Ï†. The critic g provides a scorefor a chosen dimension/state variable of the output off and h models.
Figure 4: Invariant Model Learning on Humanoid-v2. Left plot: test model learning error for differenthorizon values. Mean and std. err. over 10 random seeds. Middle plot: modelling error when we enforceper-state vs per-dim invariance. Table: mean correlation metric; order of magnitude is 103.
