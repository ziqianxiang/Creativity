Figure 1: Final average test Accuracy (%) (higher is better) and Forgetting (lower is better) obtainedafter the stream is finished for all four datasets. The vertical bars with hatches are the performance byTAG-optimizers while others are Naive optimizers. TAG-optimizers outperforms the naive optimizers in alldatasets in terms of accuracy and also results in a lower forgetting.
Figure 2: Evolution of (a) α(t, 2) and test accuracy at,2 (left), (b) α(t, 5) and test accuracy at,5 (middle) and(c) α(t, 6) and test accuracy at,6 (right) along the stream of 20 tasks in the Split-CUB dataset. The grey-coloured lines are maxτ 0 αn (t, τ0) (top, dashed line), Eτ0 [α(t, τ0)] (middle, solid line) and minτ0 α(t, τ0)(bottom, dashed line) that indicate the range of α(t, τ0). Elliptical regions (black dashed) highlight subtlegain in the accuracy by TAG-RMSProp that are maintained throughout the stream. Observing correspondingα(t, τ) in those regions validates our hypothesis discussed from Section 3.3.
Figure 3: Comparing performance for different existing methods with their RMSProp and TAGed versions onall four datasets in terms of final average test Accuracy (%) along with A-GEM and ER for different samplesper class (M) in the episodic memory. The vertical bars with hatches are the performance by TAGed versionsof the baselines. All results are averaged across 5 runs. All TAGed versions results in a similar gain in theaccuracy over baselines with both SGD and RMSProp update.
Figure 4: Evolution of average test Accuracy (%) At for different existing methods and TAG-RMSPropthroughout the stream on all datasets. All results are averaged across 5 runs and the shaded area representstandard deviation. Performing similar as ER for major part of the stream, TAG-RMSProp always results inthe highest final accuracy as compared to other methods with a low standard deviation.

The grey-coloured lines are maxτ 0 αn(t, τ0) (top, dashed line), Eτ0 [α(t, τ0)](middle, solid line) and minτ 0 α(t, τ0) (bottom, dashed line) that indicate the range of α(t, τ0).

The grey-coloured lines are maxτ 0 αn(t, τ0) (top, dashed line), Eτ0 [α(t, τ0)] (middle, solidline) and minτ0 α(t, τ0) (bottom, dashed line) that indicate the range of α(t, τ0).
