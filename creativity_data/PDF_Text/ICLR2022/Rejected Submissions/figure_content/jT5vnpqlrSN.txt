Figure 1: Comparison of position-aware GNN methods. (a) (Modified from (Li et al., 2020))Exam-ple unattributed input graph, nodes start with the same letter (A, B or C) are structurally equivalent.
Figure 2: (a) Example input graph, colored nodes are chosen as anchors. (b) Message propagatingedges for each layer in a 2-layer GIR model, Colored nodes highlight propagating source nodes.
