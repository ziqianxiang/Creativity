Figure 1: Error map comparisons of denoised im-ages from (3) using g(x) = median(x) (left) andg(x) = BM3D(x) (right) (blue and yellow de-note 0 and 50 absolute errors, respectively). Peaksignal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) values are averaged.
Figure 2: Proposed SSRL models using the J -complement in denoiser learning. Top: f and guse almost equal amount of information from input, i.e., |J| â‰ˆ |Jc|, where J and Jc are comple-mentary checkerboard masks. Bottom: f and g use unbalanced amount of information from input,specifically, |Jc| |J|.
Figure 4: Comparisons of denoised images (left) via DnCNNs from different learning methods andtheir saturation error maps (right) in camera image denoising (blue and yellow denote 0 and 0.5absolute error, respectively). PSNR & SSIM values were averaged across all BSD 300 test samples.
Figure 5: Comparisons of denoised images via DnCNNs from different learning methods in low-dose CT (display window is [800, 1200] HU). RMSE values were averaged across all test samples.
