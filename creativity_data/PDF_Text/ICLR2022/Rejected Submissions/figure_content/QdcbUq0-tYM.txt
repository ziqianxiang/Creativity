Figure 1: Overview of our method, UC-DiffOSI. The Universal Controller (UC) takes as inputthe current robot states Xt and the dynamics parameters μt identified by the differentiable physicsengine (DiffOSI), to generate optimal control actions τt.
Figure 2: Evaluation curves for the DR and UC-Oracle models on the Cartpole task.
Figure 3: Reward and μ estimation results for the half cheetah task. Results are averaged over 6models for each approach.
Figure 4: Analyzing the effect of the number of samples (window size from history) used by UC-DiffOSI vs. the absolute error μ prediction for the half cheetah task. N denotes the context windowsize, and the number of samples required is N - 1.
Figure 6: Comparison of CMA-ES and DiffOSI on the parameter estimation task. Results areaveraged over 3 runs and all dimensions.
