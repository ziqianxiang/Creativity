Figure 1: Diagram of the proposed ECORD architecture applied to solving a Max-Cut instance.
Figure 2: ECORD (blue) vs. ECO-DQN (orange) scaling performance. (a) Action selection timewhen running a single trajectory. (b) Step time (action selection and environment update time) whenrunning the maximum number of tradjectories that fit on the GPU. ECORD’s relative throughputat |V| = {30, 100, 300, 1000, 3000, 10 000} is {1.8, 3.0, 12.2, 39.3, 104.5, 298.9}× ECO-DQN’s(beyond | V ∣≈10 000, ECO-DQN no longer fits on the GPU).
