Figure 1: Architectural overview of the proposed approach of Tessellated 2D convolutional neuralnetworks for defence against adversarial attacks on image classification networks. The left part ofthe figure depicts a standard layered 2D convolutional neural network for image classification. Theright part of the figure shows our proposed method - 2D Tessellated ConvNet (TCNN), where, first,the input X ∈ Rd×d is partitioned into k sub-instances (non-overlapping image regions) - Xi suchthat UiXi = x.
Figure 2: (a) Regular tiling ofa 9 X 9 image with 9 3 × 3 square tiles (d = 9, l = 9); (b) Illustration ofthe effect of the split operation on a tiling - the yellow colored rectangle on the left part of the figureis transformed into two blue rectangles shown in the tiling shown along the right; (c) Illustrationof the effect of the merge operation on a tiling - the yellow colored rectangle on the left part of thefigure is merged with the rectangles right-adjacent to it; this operation for this example does notincrease or decrease the total number of tiles (as seen on the right part of the figure); (d) A Mondriantiling for a 14 × 14 square grid, note that the tiles are mutually non-congruent, the Mondrian scorefor this tiling is optimal, the value being 6 × 6 - 3 × 10 = 6.
Figure 3: Variation of (a) Classification accuracy (acc) on clean, and FGSM attacked ('∞, ε = 0.04)test examples, and (b) drop in accuracy (∆acc), with the number of sub-rectangles (hyperparameterk) in for the fashion MNIST dataset. The circled points in (b) correspond to smallest ∆acc forregular and aperiodic tessellations. Since, k = 24 is fixed in Mondrian tessellation we show it as abaseline in the plots.
