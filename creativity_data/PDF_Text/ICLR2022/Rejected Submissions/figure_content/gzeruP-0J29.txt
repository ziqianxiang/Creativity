Figure 1: RA-PGD of different robust training methods for (CIFAR-10, PARN-18) with the same training and evaluation attack strengths.
Figure A1: Visualization of adversarial loss landscapes of FAST-AT, FAST-AT-GA and FAST-BAT trainedusing the ResNet-18 model on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The losses at are calculated w.r.t. the same image exampleID #001456, and the landscape is obtained by tracking the loss changes w.r.t. input variations following Engstromet al. (2018). That is, the loss landscape is generated by Z = loss(I + X ∙ ri + y ∙ r2), where I denotes an image,and the x-axis and the y-axis correspond to linear coefficients associated with the sign-based attack directionri = sign(Vιloss(I)) X and a random direction r2 〜Rademacher(0.5), respectively.
