Figure 1: Comparison of different recognition paradigms: a) statistics of CIFAR-10 when used asa Semi-supervised Recognition benchmark; b) typical data distribution over classes in long-tailedrecognition; c) the proposed Semi-supervised long-tail recognition setting, in which both labeledand unlabeled subsets follow the same underlying long-tailed data distribution.
