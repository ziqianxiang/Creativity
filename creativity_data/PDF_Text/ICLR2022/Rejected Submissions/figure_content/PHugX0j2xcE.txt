Figure 1: ML-based predictive maintenance process in a dishonest settingMore recently, in Zheng et al. (2021), an end-to-end platform for collaborative learning using MPCis proposed. Though it is an interesting approach, it is unlikely that this platform can be applied toour use case since the collaborative learning through the use of release policies and auditing is notpreferable to the predictive maintenance.
Figure 2: Secure collaborative learning using Secret Sharing in FL3.2	DefensesWe present two defending methods against attacks in FL: MPC-based secure aggregation againstthe model inversion attack and anomaly detection against the model poisoning attack and the activecorruption attack.
Figure 3: The optimal threshold selection based on the precision, recall and F1 score scores yieldedby the GRU-based autoencodertransposed convolutional layer with 1 filter of size 3 Ã— 1 and a stride of 1 is used to generate theoutput. ReLU is selected as an activation function for the hidden layers of the model. The lossfunction is set to the MSE, which is adjusted by using the Adam optimizer.
Figure 4: Comparison of the proposed detection-based method and defense-based approaches interms of reconstruct error of the global model under two adversarial attacks. Note that the legend inFig. 4a applies to Fig. 4b as well.
Figure 5: Evaluation of the performanceand the fraction of the malicious clients which is required by Krum and Trimmed Mean can not beknown a priori in FL.
