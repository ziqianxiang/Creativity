Figure 1: Training: validating thecross gradients norm approaching tozero: the number of epochs versus theratio between '2-norm of the crossgradient term and the '2 -norm of thetrue gradient.
Figure 2: Robust accuracy curves of MAT +MSD, MAT, and MSD on MNIST under PGD '∞ (resp. '2, and'1) attack. First row: Robust accuracy against the number of steps of attack with radius 0.3 (resp. 2, and10). Second row: Robust accuracy against varying attack radius using '∞- (resp. '2 and '1) PGD attack; thevertical dashed lines denotes the common radius choice in prior work evaluations as 0.3 (resp. 2 and 10) for'∞ (resp. '2 and '1).
Figure 3: Robust accuracy curves of MAT +MSD, MAT,, and MSD on CIFAR-10 under PGD '∞ (resp. '2, and'1) attack. First row: Robust accuracy versus the number of attack steps 0.03 (resp. 0.5, and 12). Secondrow: Robust accuracy versus the varying radius using '∞ (resp. '2 and '1) PGD attack; the vertical dashedlines denote the common radius choice in testing as 0.03 (resp. 0.5 and 12) for '∞ (resp. '2 and '1).
