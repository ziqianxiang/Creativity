Figure 1: (a) is the procession of FL gradient updating. It consists of four parts: master server, masterserver distributed network, miner servers and miner network. (b) represents the schematic diagramof the gradient update direction: blue dashed lines represent the estimated gradients of miner nodes;red dashed lines represent the Byzantine update gradients under the attack of the Byzantine nodes;black solid line represents the ideal gradient.
