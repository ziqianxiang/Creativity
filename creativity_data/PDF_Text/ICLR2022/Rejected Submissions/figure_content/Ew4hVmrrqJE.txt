Figure 6: Two-agent cliff navigation. (“S”, “X”,“D” denote starting point, cliff and destination re-spectively. The optimal path is shown in red.)In this subsection, we test our algorithms in solv-ing a two-agent Cliff Navigation problem (39)in a grid-world environment. This problem isadapted from its single-agent version (see Ex-ample 6.6 of (48)). As illustrated in Figure 6,two agents start from the starting point “S” ona 3 × 4 grid and aim to reach the destination“D”. Here, global state is defined as the joint lo-cation of the two agents, and there are in total(3 × 4)2 = 144 global states. In most states,an agent can choose to move up, down, left orright by one step and receives -1 reward. How-ever, once an agent falls into the cliff “X”, itwill return to the starting point “S” and receives-100 reward. When an agent reaches “D”, itwill always stay at “D”, and receives 0 rewardif the other agent also reaches/stays at “D”, or
