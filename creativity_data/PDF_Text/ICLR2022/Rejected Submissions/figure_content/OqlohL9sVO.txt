Figure 1: Illustration of UGALR. Firstly, the images are fed into CNN blocks to extract features.
Figure 2: Illustration of spatial attention module. Here we take the relationship learning part ofnon-local block(Wang et al., 2018)as the spatial attention module. X is the input of the module andZ is the output. g, θ, φ and w denote 1x1 convolution kernels.
