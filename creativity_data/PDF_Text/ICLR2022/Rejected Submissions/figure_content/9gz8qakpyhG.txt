Figure 1: (Best viewed in color.) (a) Examples form two DG datasets: PACS and Office-Home. (b)Error of the ideal target hypothesis. “Art painting” indicates that the model is trained on the remain-ing source domains: Cartoon, Photo and Sketch, and the target representations are obtained by thesource-trained model. (c) Visualization of the target representations by t-SNE (Van der Maaten &Hinton, 2008). The category cluster in T-BN shows larger variance.
Figure 2: (Best viewed in color.) Qualitative results on GTA5 → Cityscapes. Equipped with ourα-BN, the source model yields better and cleaner segmentation map on target domain with littleadditional test time (e.g., about 16ms on each image). Specifically, without any training, α-BN re-discovers the missing class “person”, which is colored in red. More qualitative results are shown inAppendix D.5.

Figure 4: (Best viewed in color.) Some examples collected from the datasets: ImageNet-C,DomainNet, GTA5, Cityscapes, BDD-100K and Mapillary. The ImageNet-C figure is borrowfrom (Hendrycks & Dietterich, 2019) and the DomainNet figure is borrow from (Peng et al., 2019).

Figure 6: (Best viewed in color.) Qualitative results on GTA5 → Cityscapes. “GT” means groundtruth. Equipped with our α-BN, the segmentation performance on new environment is significantlyimproved with little additional test time cost (e.g., about 16ms on each image).
