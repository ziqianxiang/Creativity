Figure 1: An assembly graph of one part of chromosome 11, containing the repetitive region. Azoomed-in view of the repetitive region can be seen on the right. In the graph, orange nodes representnodes taken for the optimal genome reconstruction, while the blue nodes should be avoided. Figuregenerated with Graphia (Freeman et al., 2020).
Figure 2: Left: updating the edge representations, both forward (blue) and backward (magenta).
