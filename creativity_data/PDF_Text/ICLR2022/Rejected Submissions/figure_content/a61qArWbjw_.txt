Figure 1: Cross-generation of SVHN on MoPoE, SMVAE, and SMVGON. Each row of SVHN ineach cross-generation corresponds to a different sample from the inference model.
Figure 2: Performance on the PolyMNIST dataset. Left: Performance of the inferred latent repre-sentation given a set of modalities for each number. The markers are the means of the three runs, andthe error bands are their standard deviations. Center: Performance of generating modalities given aset of modalities corresponding to each number. Right: Conditional generation of PolyMNIST.Thetop panel shows examples of modalities M0 to M3 (we refer to the five different modalities as M0to M4), and the middle and bottom panels show the generation of M4 conditioned on the respectivemodality sets by MoPoE-VAE and SMVAE. Images in each column belong to the same example.
Figure 3: Performance on the PolyMNIST dataset. Left: Performance of the inferred latent rep-resentation given a set of modalities for each number as input.Right: Performance of generatingmodalities given a set of modalities corresponding to each number.
Figure 4: Conditional generation of Bimodal CelebA on SMVAE.
Figure 5: The results of generating all modalities from random noise in the latent space on eachdataset. Top: MNIST-SVHN-Text (from top to bottom: MNIST, SVHN, Text). Center: BimodalCelebA (Image ,Text). Bottom: PolyMNIST (M0, M1, M2, M3, M4). Each column of each datasetcorresponds to the same random noise.
