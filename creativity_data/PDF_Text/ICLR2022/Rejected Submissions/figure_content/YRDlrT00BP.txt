Figure 14: Transforming man face to woman face by using the gradient flow with m-OT and (e)BoMb-OT onCelebA dataset for (k, m) = (25, 100). The last column is the nearest image (in sense of L2 distance) to thefinal found female image, the corresponding L2 distance are also shown on the top of middle-stage images.
Figure 15: Visualization of transportation plans of m-OT and BoMb-OT between 2D empirical distributionswith 10 samples. The first two rows are results of k = 20. The next two rows are for (k, m) = (8, 2) and(k, m) = (2, 8) in turn.
