Figure 1: Illustration of the difference between patching for fixed-size images (left) and variablelength sequences (right). We rename patches as tokens to adapt to the semantics of sequences.
Figure 2: Overview of (a) MLP-Mixer type, (b) gMLP type, (c) token-mixing MLP in MLP-Mixer,and (d) Spatial Gating Unit in gMLP.
Figure 3: Overview of (a) Convolutional Gating Unit, (b) Convolutional Gating Unit0 , (c) Temporal-Shift Gating Unit, and (d) Temporal-Shift operation.
Figure 4: SGU with a tiny self-attention.
Figure 5: Comparison of inference speed for different sequence lengthsTable 3: Computational cost of architectures. N is the sequence length and D is the size of channeldimension of a feature. l is the size of filters in Fourier Filter Unit. k is the convolution kernel size.
