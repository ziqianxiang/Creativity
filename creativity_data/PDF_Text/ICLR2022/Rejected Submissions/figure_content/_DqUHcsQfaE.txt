Figure 1: The architecture of IT-PFL. The encoder uses the data of the novel client to produce anembedding. Then, the hypernetwork fθ predicts a local model h for the novel client.
Figure 2: (a) The servertrains a hypernetwork fθand an encoder gγ usingthe labeled clients. (b) Anovel client uses unlabeleddata to receive a personal-ized model from the server.
Figure 3: Accuracy of novelclients vs. distribution shift be-tween the novel client and train-ing clients. Shown results forCIFAR-100 across multiple splitsto Ntrain = 90 train clients andNnovel = 10 novel clients us-ing symmetric Dirichlet distribu-tions with varying parameter α (see6.5). For each test client, we calcu-late its KL-divergence to the near-est train client. Accuracies of novelclients are reported against the KL-divergence from the nearest trainclient for each method.
Figure 4: Test accuracy (±SEM) for CIFAR-10novel client while applying DP. As the dataset sizeincreases, we add less noise to obtain the sameprivacy level.
