Figure 1: Left: Venn diagram of the sets where XR and XM are colored as pink and teal, respectively;and the samples enclosed in the dashed circle are Dx. O is the complement of XR and X = O ∪ Xr.
Figure 2: Comparison of the relational graph G on HW, inferred using mRNP (left) with PCAprojections of latent representations from DeepIMV (middle) and mVAE (right). Nodes’ colors referto their class labels, i.e 1-10.
