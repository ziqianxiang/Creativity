Figure 2: Detailed Architecture of GNNI Realist TSP Instances in TSPLIBAs promised in Section 6, Tables 14 to 16 list the performances of various learning-based TSPsolvers and heuristic approaches upon realistic TSP instances in TSPLIB. The bold numbers showthe best performance among all the approaches. We can observe that most bold numbers are providedby eMAGIC, meaning our approach provides excellent results for TSPLIB. In addition, we alsoprovide our results for the larger instances (with size up to 1002) from TSPLIB in Table 13. Table13 only contains the experiments of our model since no other model can generalize to large size TSPinstances with adequate performance.
