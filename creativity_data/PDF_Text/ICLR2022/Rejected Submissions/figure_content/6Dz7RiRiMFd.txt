Figure 1: The overall architecture of our Molformer. FFN stands for a feed-forward network. Localfeatures are shown in purple and orange; yellow corresponds to a global feature.
Figure 2: The left is the four different categories of motifs that we apply in Molformer based onfunctional groups. The right is the ablation study of those groups in QM7 and BBBP.
Figure 3: Sampled points using FPS and AFPS. We do not show dummy nodes there.
