Figure 2: How VBLRL estimates different kinds of uncertainties in HiP-MDP. The world-modelposterior captures the epistemic uncertainty of the general knowledge distribution (shared across alltasks controlled by the hidden parameters) via the internal variance of world-model BNN. As thelearner is exposed to more and more tasks, the posterior should converge to Pq. The task-specificposterior captures the epistemic uncertainty of the current task m, which comes from the alleatoryuncertainty of the world model when generating ωm for a new task, via the internal variance oftask-specific BNN. The posterior should output the highest probability for ω near the true ωm as theagent collects enough data from the task. The aleatory uncertainty of the final prediction is measuredby the output variance of the prediction.
