Figure 1: (a) A real example in TR3. The GNN predictor classifies the full graph as 'House”. Onsubgraphs Gs1 and Gs2, the prediction probabilities of being “House” are respectively 0.21 and 0.70.
Figure 2: SCM II with a mediat-ing variable Gt.
Figure 3: Model structure of CVGAE. Pdse is the average probability of G* on the target prediction.
Figure 4: Validation of different frameworks for explanation evaluation.
Figure 5: A Case Example.
Figure 6: Elaboration for variable D in Figure 1b, where the definitions of the variables are annotated.
Figure 7: Instruction Example for conducting the user study.
Figure 8: Three cases in Tr3 datasets. Each graph in the left represents the ground truth explanatorysubgraphs (red) for explaining a given graph. One of the complement graphs (light blue) generatedfrom CVGAE is also shown with each explanatory subgraph. As the edge selection ratio increases ineach row, the importance scores output by our DSE are shown in the right.
