Figure 1: We propose two loss functions that works well for metric meta-learning approaches forfew-shot classification. We optimize an embedding network based on the error calculated by theICNN Loss or the proto-triplet loss, which aims to increase the inter-class distance and decrease theintra-class distance.
Figure 3: Umap visualization of the improved feature embeddings obtained from the test set. Thefeature embeddings were computed in a 5-way 5-shot setting by constructing 1,000 tasks from thetest data. When creating the tasks for the feature visualization, we kept fix the 5 classes sampled andrandomly draw samples to construct the support and query setsthe worst results from the experiments made, and are not competitive with state-of-the-art models.
