Figure 1: The DAC regularization reducesfunction class H to Tdac (H).
Figure 2: Comparison of DAC regularization andDA-ERM (Example 1). The results preciselymatch Theorem 2. DA-ERM depends on the d0 in-duced by different augmentations, while the DACregularization works equally well and better thanthe DA-ERM. Further, both DAC and DA-ERMare affected by the “strength of augmentation”daug.
