Figure 1: scCA framework3Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 20224.1	Feature extractionThe first part of scCA is feature extraction. Given thousands of genes’ expression levels fora cell, wehope to learn simple but efficacious features for classification. Capsules not only serve as dimensionreduction, but also extract a type of information of the cell. Through fully connected layers, wegenerate capsules to extract different features.
Figure 3: GSE70580 attention weights heatmap5Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2022The figure above shows 6 cells from dataset GSE70580. Three cells come from cell type 0 whilethe other come from cell type 1. The deeper the color is in the figure, the larger the attention weightis. We can find that attention weights’ distribution vary from one cell type to another. Differentcell types have different attention weight combinations of compound features. This provide reliableinterpretation for our model.
Figure 4: gene expression matrix heatmapWe then elaborate the nine datasets we use in experiments, listing out their numbers of cells andgenes as well as the numbers of cell types.
