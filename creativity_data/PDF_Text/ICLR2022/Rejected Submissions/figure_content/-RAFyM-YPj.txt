Figure 1: Illustration of a Recursive Neigh-borhood Pooling GNN (RNP-GNN) with re-cursion parameters (2, 2, 1). To compute therepresentation of node v in the given inputgraph (depicted in the top left of the figure),we first recurse on G(N2 (v) \ {v}) (top rightof figure). To do so, we find the represen-tation of each node u âˆˆ G(N2(v) \ {v}).
Figure 2: For the above graph,(v1 , v2 , . . . , v6 ) is a vertex covering se-quence. The corresponding covering se-quence (1, 4, 3, 2, 1) is not decreasing.
Figure 3: MPNNs cannot count substructures with three nodes or more (Chen et al., 2020). Forexample, the graph with black center vertex on the left cannot be counted, since the two graphs onthe left result in the same node representations as the graph on the right.
Figure 4: Example of a covering sequence computed forthegraph on the left. For thisgraph, (v6, v1 , v4, v5, v3, v2) is a vertex covering sequence with respect to the covering sequence(3, 3, 3, 2, 1). The first two computations to obtain this covering sequence are depicted in the middleand on the right.
