Figure 1: The overall pipeline of SpaLoc: a multi-layer neural network that applies to hypergraphs. Iand V denote the index tensor and value tensor respectively. To facilitate training and inference inlarge domains, we employ a sub-graph sampling procedure and sparsification.
Figure 2: A running example of a single layer SpaLoc: inferring the binary relationship of PhD-child-of from the attribute PhD and the binary relationship parent. Blue entries denote values that arereduced from high-arity tensors, while green entries are expanded from low-arity tensors. Yellowentries are created by the “permutation” operation. Gray entries are zero paddings.
Figure 3: The subgraph training contains two steps. First, we sample a subset of nodes from a largeinput graph. Next, we calibrate the labels for edges in the sub-sampled graph. Note that the edgewith information sufficiency 0 will be labeled as a negative example in this subgraph.
Figure 4: Numbers of non-zero elements (NNZ) in the intermediate groundings of SpaLoc vs. thenumber of objects in the evaluation domains.
Figure 5: The memory consumption and the inference time of each sample vs. the number of objectsin the evaluation domains.
