Figure 1: A high-level illustration of various approaches to fair learning on decentralized data and ourcontributions. Assuming two data owners, from left to right, we show UFL (Unfederated Fair Learning), FFLvia FedAvg (Federated Fair Learning via FedAvg), FedFB (ours), and CFL (Centralized Fair Learning).
Figure 2: Compar-ison of various fairlearning methods..
Figure 3: Fundamental limitation of UFL in terms of fairness range. We visualize the DP disparity of UFLas a function of local unfairness budgets on three simple Gaussian distributions. The blue horizontal plane isof perfect fairness. The pink horizontal plane visualizes the value of δ (the lowest DP disparity that UFL canachieve). (a) (Example 1) On a distribution that satisfies the conditions of Corollary 2. (b, c) On distributionsthat do not satisfy the conditions of Corollary 2. In all three cases, the UFL cannot achieve perfect fairness, i.e.,δ > 0.

Figure 6: Comparison of accuracy and Client Parity (CP) disparity on the synthetic, Adult, COMPAS,and Bank datasets. Even though our algorithm is not specifically designed for CP, it closely matches theperformance of the state-of-the-art fair federated learning algorithms designed for CP.
Figure 7: Visualization of g(λ) and ∣g(λ)∣. When g(0) = MD(f) > ε ≥ 0, the corresponding λ of the bestclassifier is λ = g-1() < 0.
