Figure 2: An illustration of the case when n = 2, m = 3, and K = S 1 is thecircle. Here f : S1 → R3 is an embedding such that the curve M = f(S1) isa trefoil knot. Due to knot theoretical reasons, there are no map E = T ◦ R :R2 → R3 such that E(S1) = M, where R : R2 → R3 is a full rank linearmap and T : R3 → R3 is a homeomorphism. This shows that a combination oflinear maps and coupling flow maps can not represent all embedded manifolds.
Figure 3: A schematic showing that, for a toy problem, the least-squaresprojection to a piecewise affine range can be discontinuous. Left: Apartitioning of R2 into classes with gray boundaries. Two points y, y0are in the same class if they are both closest to the same affine piece ofR(R), the range of R. The three points y1, y2 and y3 are each projectedto the closest three points on R(R) yielding y1, y2 and y3. Note that theprojection operation is continuous within each section, but discontinuousacross gray boundaries between section.
