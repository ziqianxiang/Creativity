Figure 2: Our "fact" V.S. existing approaches.
Figure 1: Two examples from LogiQA and ReClor respectively are illustrated. There are argumentsand relations between arguments. Both are emphasized by different colors: arguments, relations. Keywords in questions are highlighted in Purple. Key options are highlighted in gray.
Figure 3: An example of constructed super-graph. In contrast, the dotted vertices andedges are focused in most existing studies(Qiu et al., 2019; Ding et al., 2019; Chen et al.,2019b).
Figure 4:	The framework or our model. For supergraph reasoning, in each iteration, each nodeselectively receives the message from the neighboring nodes to update its representation. The dashedcircle means zero vector.
Figure 5:	The process of constructing the fact chain and its corresponding Levi graph form of anexample in Figure 1. Entities and relations are illustrated in their corresponding color.
Figure 6:	Accuracy of models on number of fact units on dev set of ReClor (left) and LogiQA (right).
Figure 7:	An example of how our model reasons to get the final answer.
Figure 8: An example of how our model reasons to get the final answer on the modified example.
