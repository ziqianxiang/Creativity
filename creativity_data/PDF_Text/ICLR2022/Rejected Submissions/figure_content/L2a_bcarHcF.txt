Figure 1: Learning accuracies for different problems measured with norms L1, L2 and Lâˆž.
Figure 2: Learning curves for different problems. All problems except addition use 5 X 5 matrices.
Figure 3: Empirical distributions of eigenvalues for Wigner matrices of dimension 5x5 (left) to20x20 (right), with uniform (top), gaussian (middle) and Laplace (bottom) coefficients. All distri-butions computed from 100 000 random matrices.
