Figure 7: Comparison of 3 partitions used bydifferent modelsthe baseline partition with same aggregation function. For the minimum function the improvement isalways positive in the range of 7-21%. For the maximum we see even greater improvement in mostcases, but for one dataset (exchange) there is a negative improvement. For median the differencesare smaller. Figure 6 shows the improvement of the top partitions, with maximum and medianaggregation functions, compared to the top partition with average aggregation.
