Figure 1: The DiCoM framework with two variants: (a) DiCoM-N (multi-network) and (b) DiCoM-B (multi-branch). Solid black arrows denote input/output; double black arrows denote augmenta-tions; solid blue and dotted red arrows represent forward and backward passes, respectively.
Figure 2: Undirected probabilistic graphical models of DiCoM: (a) for an unlabeled sample, (b)after marginalization of the views and (c) for a labeled sample.
Figure 3: Test RMSE on UCI datasets: each subplot shows the results for one dataset.
Figure 4: Test RMSE of DiCoM-N on UCI datasets with varying number of views M âˆˆ {2, 4, 8}.
Figure 5: Test RMSE on UCI datasets: each subplot shows the results for one dataset, N = 100.
Figure 6: Experiment results on toy data. The top row shows training losses in symmetric log scale.
