Figure 1: (a) Noise ratio comparison with noisy node labels, which shows the noise ratio of PI labels is muchsmaller than that of node labels. Red number means noisy label. (b) Density plot for the produced confidencemask with 60% symmetric noise. x-axis denotes the confidence value, where there exist uncertain PI predictions.
Figure 2: The framework of our PI-GNN, which has two GNNs, i.e., a mask generator and a task executor forrobust semi-supervised node classification. The two GNNs fm, f learn the pairwise interactions between eachnode pair by enforcing the embedding similarity to be close to the PI labels ypÎ¹. The mask generator generates aconfidence mask, which is applied to the PI loss of the task executor to reduce the uncertainty of its predictionscaused by the sub-optimal PI labels. X denotes dot product and 0 means element-wise multiplication.
