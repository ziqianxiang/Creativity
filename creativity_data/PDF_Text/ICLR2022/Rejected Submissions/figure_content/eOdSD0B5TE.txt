Figure 1: The solution space VS of a learning task denotes the subset of classifiers that attain zeroerror on a dataset S. While the solution space can have a complicated geometry when described inweight space, in function space the solution space of a binary classification task is just an orthant.
Figure 2: Testing Theorem 2â€”the bound on the average population error of the NNGP posterior.
Figure 3: Exploring generalisation performance along the label ray defined in Section 5.3. Functionsfurther along the ray are found to generalise substantially better than average, for both NNGP drawsand finite width networks trained by gradient descent.
