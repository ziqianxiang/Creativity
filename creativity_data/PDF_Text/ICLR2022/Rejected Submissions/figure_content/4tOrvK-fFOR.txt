Figure 1: Synperiodic filter bank illustration: Syndistance filter bank (green color) rotates the samedistance in complex plane and thus has the same kernel length, regardless of frequency it carries. Itstime-frequency dynamic resolution map is thus rectangular. our proposed synperiodic filter bank (bluecolor) are generated by rotating the same periodicity number. So filter carrying lower frequency haslarger kernel size than those with higher frequency response. As a result, synperiodic filter bankâ€™stime-frequency dynamic resolution map that is able to achieve a better trade-off than traditionalsyndistance filter bank.
Figure 2: Multi-scale learning in frequency domain. Given the raw one channel sound waveformand pre-constructed synperiodic filter bank, we consecutively downsample the waveform by factor2x, the newly downsampled waveform is processed by low-half filter bank from the proceedingfilter bank. We can obtain time-frequency representation for on each frequency scale. These time-frequency representations share the same time length by adjusting step size. The final time-frequencyrepresentation is obtained by max-pooling them together.
Figure 3: Qualitative comparison on DoA task. We show detected sound source temporal location (toprow) and azimuth (bottom row). The horizontal axis is time, the vertical axis is semantic label (top)and azimuth in degree(bottom). Different color indicates different sound source category.
Figure 4: The relationship between filter frequency response and the periodicity. Green curve:our proposed windowing function. Light orange dots: mel-scale initialized frequency-periodicityrelationship.
Figure 5: Consecutively downsampled waveform has longer time range in the original waveform (toprow). So processing downsampled waveform increases the Causality.
