Figure 4: Average accuracy on Omniglot 5-way 1-shot & miniImageNet 5-way 1-shot, with 95%confidence interval. All samplers are poorer than the Uniform Sampler and are statistically signifi-cant (with a P-ValUe P = 0.05). We use the symbol * to represent the instances where the results arenot statistically significant and similar to the performance achieved by Uniform Sampler.
Figure 5: AVerage accuracy on Omniglot 20-way 1-shot, with a 95% confidence interVal. We denoteall samplers that are worse than the Uniform Sampler and are statistically significant (with a p-Valuep = 0.05) with H, and those that are significantly better than the Uniform Sampler with N.
Figure 6: Average accuracy on tieredImageNet 5-way 1-shot, Meta-Dataset Traffic Sign 5-way1-shot & Meta-Dataset MSCOCO 5-way 1-shot, with a 95% confidence interval. We denote allsamplers that are worse than the Uniform Sampler and are statistically significant (with a p-valuep = 0.05) with H, and those that are significantly better than the Uniform Sampler with N.
