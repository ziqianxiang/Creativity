Figure 1:	Evaluation of GVR in 4-agent matrix games. (a) Comparison of ∆Qopt between ITS with randomreward shaping and VDN with fixed reward shaping. The red dash line (∆Q(uopt, τ) = -1.951) denotes thecalculation result (from Eq.6) under ITS target. (b) Median test ratio of the optimal stable points as grows(i.e., test probability of the optimal convergence), where y = 1 indicates the optimal stable point is the uniquestable point and y = 0 indicates the optimal point is unstable. The red dash line (0 = 0.837) denotes thecalculated lower bound of (from Eq.8) when ITS eliminates non-optimal stable points.
