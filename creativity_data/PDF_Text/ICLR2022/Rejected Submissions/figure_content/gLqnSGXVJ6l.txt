Figure 1: The model arChiteCture Bd-eremeev (2020)3.1	EncoderMore preCisely, the enCoder inCrementally gets the input sequenCe and transforms it into a set ofembeddings. For eaCh node xi with features of dimension d (d = 5 in the Case of VRPTW), thestarting embedding hi(0) with dimension d0 is CalCulated via a linear transformation as follows:hi(0) = Wxi +b if i 6= 0hi(0) = W0xi + b0 if i = 0(2)Where W ∈ IRd ×d and b ∈ IRd are the learnable parameters, while W0 and b0 are the ones usedfor the Case of the depot.
