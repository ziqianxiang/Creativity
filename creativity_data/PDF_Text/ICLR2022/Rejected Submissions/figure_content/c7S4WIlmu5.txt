Figure 1: Zero-shot retrieval. We compare our pre-training without using any annotated data toREALM, SimCSE and BM25. For SimCSE we report results of the model using RoBERTa large.
Figure 2: Impact of the number of negatives. We report nDCG@10 as a function of the queue size,with and without fine-tuning on MS-MARCO. We report numbers using the MoCo framework wherethe keys for the negatives are computed with the momentum encoder and stored in a queue.
