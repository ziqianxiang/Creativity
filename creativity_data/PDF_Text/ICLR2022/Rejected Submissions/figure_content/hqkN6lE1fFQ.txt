Figure 1: Attention densities for kernel deformed exponential families for the first attention headof the uWave experiment and all test set participants for three classes. The densities are sparse andeach have support over different non-overlapping time intervals, which cannot be done with eitherGaussian mixtures or exponential families. They also attend to similar regions within each class.
Figure 2: General architecture for classification using continuous attention mechanisms. Thepipeline is trained end-to-end. The encoder takes a discretized representation of an observation(i.e. a time series) and outputs parameters for an attention density. The value function takes theoriginal (potentially irregularly sampled) time series and outputs parameters for a function V (t).
