Figure 1: Part of a fair generative model that intends to yield generated samples with the equal sizeover demographic groups. We employ training data {x(biia)s}im=b1ias (potentially biased) and balancedreference data {xr(eif)}im=re1f. The entire structure of the proposed model will be illustrated in detail inFig. 2. Here mbias (or mref ) denotes the number of training samples (or reference samples).
Figure 2: The architecture of the proposed three-player optimization, reflected in equation 6.
Figure 3: (Top) Generated samples by Choi et al. (2020) trained on CelebA-single with 10% referenceset size. Faces above the yellow line are female (57 pictures), while the rest are male (43). Intra FIDvalues are around 21.07 (female) and 25.74 (male); (Bottom) Generated samples by the proposedapproach under the same setting. We obtain 54 females and 46 males, yet producing more realisticsample images, reflected in a much lower intra FID values, around 9.51 (female) and 14.29 (male).
