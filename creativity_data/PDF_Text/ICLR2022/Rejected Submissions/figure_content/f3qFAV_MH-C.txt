Figure 1: Toy representation learning experiment. In Step 2 (common to both methods) we solve aleast-squares problem assuming y = [y1, . . . , yN] ∈ RN and Φ(x) = [φ(x1), . . . , φ(xN)] ∈ RN×r.

Figure 3: How model confidence varies with annotator reliability for CIFAR-10H. Each pointrepresents a single human annotator. The x-value is the probability the annotator’s label agrees withthe true CIFAR-10 label. See individual captions for y-value meaning. Confidence is defined as themaximum probability given by the model across the 10 labels.
