Figure 1: Diagram of our Previous Knowledge Channel Attention Module (PKCAM). Given aR aggregated features, PKCAM generates global aware channel weights by performing a fast 1Dconvolution of size R, accompanied by another 1D convolution, which represents global cross channelinteraction, then fused with the standard local cross channel interaction.
Figure 2: Training ResNet, and local channel attention modules (LCA) baseline architectures andtheir PKCAM counterparts on ImageNet validation set. PKCAM exhibit improved optimisationcharacteristics and produce consistent gains in performance which are sustained throughout thetraining process.
