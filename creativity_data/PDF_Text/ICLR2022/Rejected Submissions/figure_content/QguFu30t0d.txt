Figure 6: Formulations of Communication Cost. B indicates the corresponding bits of logits or parameters. Sand C denotes Server and Client, while #S and #C denotes the total number of Server and Clients.
Figure 7: Communication cost per round of different public dataset sizes on CIFAR-10. Due to the enormouscommunication overhead of feature maps, we do not figure the flat line (irrelevance to the size of public dataset)of FedGKT which is always 1.6M (kb).
