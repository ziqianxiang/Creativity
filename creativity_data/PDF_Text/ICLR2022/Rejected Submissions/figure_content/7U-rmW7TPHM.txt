Figure 1: High-level comparison between EfficientPhys and existing deep learning approaches forcamera-based vitals measurementeffort. Some libraries, such as facial landmark detection, are not even available on every platform.
Figure 2: We present two novel architectures to enable simple, fast and accurate camera-basedvitals measurement: Convolution based EfficientPhys and Transformer based EfficientPhys. N is thenumber frames of video clip inputting to the network.
Figure 3: Outputs of Diff and batchnorm layers and comparison with normalized frames generatedvia the hand-crafted process in prior work Chen & McDuff (2018b). The output from the diff layer isalmost black because the difference in skin pixels of consecutive frames is very subtle.
Figure 4: Accuracy-Latency Trade-off in eight dif-ferent methods. Y-axis denotes the MAE error,and X-axis denotes the latency. The methods inthe left-top corner have the best accuracy-latencyTrade-off.
