Figure 3: Visualization results on the 11 datasetsin terms of quality metrics of NMI (↑) and mod-ularity (↑) (y-axis), as well as efficiency metricof runtime (1) (x-axis). The number records,evaluation results of AC and NCut, as well asanalysis of the trade-off between quality and ef-⑴ AS	(k) Enron	ficiency are given in Appendix C.5.
