Figure 1:	Tradeoffs between coreset size and empirical error.
Figure 2:	Speedup of kernelized k-MEANS++ using our coreset. This experiment is conducted onthe Twitter dataset with RBF and polynomial kernels. We run each algorithm 10 times, report theaverage running time and the minimum objective value (in relative-error evaluation).
Figure 3:	Speedup of spectral clustering using coreset-based kernelized k-MEANS++, with coresetsize N = 2000. Similarly to Figure 2, we run each algorithm 10 times, report the average runningtime and the minimum objective value.
