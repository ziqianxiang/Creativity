Figure 1: The geometric neuron ('k = 一 1 ∣∣xfc ∣∣2).
Figure 2: The effect of rotation on the spherical neuron activation in 2D (left) and 3D (right); t(θ)denotes the tangent length.
Figure 3: a) A rotation from c0 to c described by a tetrahedron rotation. b) A regular tetrahedron.
Figure 4: The effect of standardizing the orientation of the 3D skeleton representing WaveHandsaction: the original (left) and the derotated (right) shape; the arrow is the normal vector of the planeformed by the three hip joints.
