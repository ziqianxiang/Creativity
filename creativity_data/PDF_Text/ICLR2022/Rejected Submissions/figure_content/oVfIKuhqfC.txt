Figure 1: VPSDE model — 2nd cells’ row: evolution of a trajectory of X over sampling time (itsterminal value Xτ is the generated sample) via the Euler(1000) discretization of (3) using the truescore Vy lnqr(y) for D(CIFAR); line-plot: weights’ evolution ω(Xt, t)(n) for all x(n) in D(CIFAR)for the same X (cyclical palette, many weights cannot be distinguished as they remain close to 0); 1stcells, row: E[Xτ ∣Xt, t] evolution for the same X; 3rd and 4th cells, rows: same as 1st and 2nd cells’rows for another trajectory X , using the trained score model; 5th and 6th cells’ rows: same as 3rd and4th cells, rows for another trajectory X , using Euler(100).
Figure 2: (1st (Πo⊥⊥,1), 2nd (Πo=,1) plots): marginal density of the diffusion mixture M in yellow, whichmatches the marginal density of X solving (8), 5 sample paths of X started at 0 in black; (3rd (Πo⊥⊥,1),4th (Πo=,1) plots): transition matrix ofX from t = 0 to t = 1 estimated from 2000 samples.
