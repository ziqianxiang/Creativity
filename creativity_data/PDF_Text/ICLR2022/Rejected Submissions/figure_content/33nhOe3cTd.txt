Figure 1: Performance of Virtual MCTS on Go 9 × 9 against GnuGo (level 10). (a) Evaluatingthe speed of search and winning rate of MCTS, V-MCTS as well as the GnuGo at different levels.
Figure 2: Sensitivity of the termination rules to the hyperparameter r, on Go 9 × 9. The solid linesand dashed lines display the winning probability and the average tree size respectively.
Figure 3: Heatmap of policy distributions from the MCTS (N = 150) and the V-MCTS. A darkerred color represents larger visit counts of the corresponding action. The V-MCTS will terminate withdifferent search times k according to the situations and generate a near-oracle policy distribution.
