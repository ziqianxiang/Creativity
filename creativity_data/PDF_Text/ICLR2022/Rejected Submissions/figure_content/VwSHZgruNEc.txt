Figure 1: The gadget game of SES. The shadow and dashed line indicate that player 2 cannotdistinguish between the two branches. C represents chance node, P1 represents player 1’s actionnode. S1 and S2 are two identical copies of the subgame S with utility shifted.
Figure 2: Left: Expected payoffs of SES and the mixing strategy in the proposed matrix gameexample. Right: Exploitability of the two algorithms.
Figure 3: Row 1&2: Experiment results on Leduc poker. Row 3&4: Experiment results on FHP.
Figure 4: Comparison between SES and RNR. From left to right, each column represents a type ofopponent with Prshuffle = 0.0, 0.3, 0.7. The X-axis is the parameter α for SES and p for RNR.
