Figure 1: Overview of Koopman Q-learning. The states of the data point (st, st+1 , at) are shifted alongsymmetry trajectories parametrized by 1,2,3 for constant at. Symmetry transformations can be combined toreach other specific subset of the -ball region.
Figure 2: Results on challenging dexterous robotics environments using data collected using a similar strategyas S4RL (Sinha et al., 2021). We report the % of goals that the agent is able to reach during evaluation, wherethe goal is set by the environments. We see that KFC and KFC++ consistently outperforms both CQL andthe two best performing S4RL variants.
Figure 3: Symmetry shifts vs. random latent space shifts of same magnitude in the mean of âˆ†S compared byits accuracy in the online evaluation in the gym Hopper-v3 environment. The first line shows the result where stand st+1 are shifted by the same N-dimensional random variable. For the ablation study in line two we sampletwice from the random variable for the shifts st of st+1 , respectively.
