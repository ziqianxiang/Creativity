Figure 1: The process by which GEN3D samples a 3D molecule.
Figure 2: Samples of molecules produced by GEN3D when trained on various training sets listedin the first column. These examples have been curated to showcase the qualitative diversity ofmolecules created by GEN3D. For a larger number of raw samples, see Appendix A.
Figure 3: Predicted geometries for GEOM-QM9. The right columns contains reference geome-tries, and the left two columns show the nearest neighbor to the reference geometries among thegeometries generated by RDKit and GEN3D.
Figure S1: Unfiltered, independent random samples from GEN3D models trained on QM9 withouthydrogens (top), QM9 with hydrogens (middle), and GEOM-Drugs (bottom).
Figure S2: The composition of molecules generated from GEN3D and CGVAE.
Figure S3:	Histograms of inter-atom distances for GEN3D-generated and QM9 molecules with 19total atoms.
Figure S4:	The probability densities of ROCS scores for molecular graphs and geometries gener-ated by GEN3D-gd (blue), molecular graphs generated by GEN3D-ft with the Omega geometries(orange), and molecular graphs and geometries generated by GEN3D-ft (green). Higher ROCSscores indicate that a model is better able to produce desirable molecules.
Figure S5:	The similarity to the fine-tuning dataset of the molecules with the top 2% of ROCSscores. For clarity, we include those molecules that exactly match a member of the fine-tuningtraining set (i.e., they have a Tanimoto similarity coefficient of 1.0).
