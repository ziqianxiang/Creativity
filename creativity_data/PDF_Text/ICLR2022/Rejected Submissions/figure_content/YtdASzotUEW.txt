Figure 1: Distributions of the 1-NN radius distance for each of three layers as well as our test statistic,which aggregates over all layers. “Depth” refers to the layer index with respect to the logits layer.
Figure 2: Left: Impact of k on ROC-AUC. We observe that performance is mostly stable across arange of k. We do see slight degradation with larger k, and so we recommend users a default of k = 1.
Figure 3: We observe the ROC-AUC of our method using only a single layer at a time, for FashionMNIST and CelebA, with and without label smoothing. We find that label smoothing usually helpsevery layer on its own, and that the penultimate layer (depth = -1) often outperforms the rest on thesedatasets.
