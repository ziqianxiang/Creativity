Figure 1: Estimated uncertainties on synthetic datasets. The red cluster of points are unseen OODpoints, while the other colors represent different classes of training data. The background colorshows the normalized predictive uncertainty for the different methods. The deterministic and het-eroscedastic methods are overconfident on the OOD data, while the other methods offer distance-aware uncertainties. The uncertainties of the Posterior Network do not grow quickly enough awayfrom the data, such that only the SNGP and proposed HetSNGP provide effective OOD detection.
Figure 2: Predicted labels on synthetic data with label noise. We see that the proposed methodperforms on par with the heteroscedastic method and that they both outperform the other baselinesthanks to their label noise modeling capabilities.
