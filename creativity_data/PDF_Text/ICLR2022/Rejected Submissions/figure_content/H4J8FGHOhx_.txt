Figure 1: Illustration of permutation invari-ance. Exchanging identities of the agents(first and third row) does not change thetransition of the system (second row).

Figure 3: Performance versus number of environment steps in the multi-agent cooperative navigationtask, over five independent runs per method. Points are taken every 1000 training episodes, withthe first point taken after the first 1000, and is the average reward of 1000 evaluation episodes. MFsignificantly outperforms other critic representations for various number of agents.
