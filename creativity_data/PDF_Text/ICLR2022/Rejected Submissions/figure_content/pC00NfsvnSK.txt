Figure 1: Two levels of the Climber game from the Procgen benchmark (Cobbe et al., 2020) withnear-identical true latent states and near-identical value functions but drastically different actionsequences.
Figure 2: Schematic VieW of GSF : the offline dataset DÎ¼ is used to estimate POMDP-SPeCifiCGVFs wrt some cumulant function c, whose quantiles are then used to label each observation in thedataset. These labels are then used in a multi-class contrastiVe learning Procedure along With offlineRL learning.
