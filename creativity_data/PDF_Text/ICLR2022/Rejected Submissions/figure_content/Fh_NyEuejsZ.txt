Figure 1: Computational graph of entropy score for detection backbone with multi-scale features.
Figure 2: Visualization of Algorithm 2.
Figure 3: mAP vs. FLOPs and inference speed on COCO val 2017 in Table 1. Note that FLOPs in(a) is the value of the full detector, cotaining backbone, FPN and head.
Figure 4: mAP (on FCOS) vs. scores during the search with different search strategies. The scoreson the left and the right are computed with the ratio of 0:0:1 and 1:1:6 respectively. Starting fromthe initial point, the dotted line indicates the evolution direction in the search process.
Figure 5:	mAP vs. scores. All models are from Table 8 and the scores are computed with differentweight ratios. When the ratio is equal to 1:1:6, the correlation between mAP and score is well fitted.
Figure 6:	Build the basic structure of auxiliary components with 64 channel input by standardGaussian initialization. The resolution of inpput is 192 Ã— 192. ConvK1-64 means the convolutionwith kernel size 1 and output channel 64.
