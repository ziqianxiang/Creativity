Figure 1: An example in which Y ⊥ Zitem but Y 6⊥ Zitem|Zuser. Here Y := 1{Y ≥ τ}; Y is ageneric random variable w.r.t. estimated ratings Mij ’s; and τ indicates a certain threshold. The(i, j ) entry of an estimated preference matrix with 6 users (row) and 6 items (column) indicates1{Mcij ≥ τ}.
Figure 2: (Left) DEE as a function of (p0,p1) which controls the degree of population imbalancewhile fixing q0 = q1 = 0.2; (Right) DEE as a function of (q0, q1) w.r.t. observation bias whilefixing p0 = p1 = 0.4. Here p0 = pMM0 = pFF0 , p1 = pMF0 = pFM0 , q0 = qMM0 = qFF0 andq1 = qMF0 = qFM0 .
Figure 3: Predicted preference rate of item groups for every user group Pr(Y = 1 ∣Zuser, Zitem) onthe synthetic dataset. The dataset preserves observation bias (qo, qι) = (0.2,0.01) while exhibitingno population imbalance (p0, p1) = (0.4, 0.4).
Figure 4: Predicted preference rate of item groups for every user group Pr(Y = 11 Zuser, Zitem) on thesynthetic dataset. The dataset preserves population imbalance (p0,p1) = (0.4, 0.1) while exhibitingno observation bias (q0, q1) = (0.2, 0.2).
