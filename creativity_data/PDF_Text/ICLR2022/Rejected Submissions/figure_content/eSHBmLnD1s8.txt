Figure 1: Concept: Two-stage stochastic subsampling process. (a) In the first stage, we screen out lessimportant data points to construct the candidate subset. (b) In the second stage, we autoregressively selectinstances from the candidate subset.

Figure 8: Visualization of 1D function reconstruction with three different subset selection models. Each methodselects 15 out of 400 elements. As can be seen, SSS selects elements that result in better reconstructed functions.
Figure 9: Visualization of reconstructed images for the CelebA dataset. Each model selects 40, 60, 80, and 100pixels from a 218 Ã— 178 image and reconstruct the full image using only the selected pixels.
Figure 10: Zoom-In for best view. Selected pixels for different tasks on CelebA. As can be seen from theselected pixels, SSS adaptively selects different pixels for both reconstruction and classification. Pixels forreconstruction are more spread out to include the background since this contributes to the reconstruction loss.
Figure 11: Visualization of a set with 200 images for instance selection. The two stage selection method in SSSis visualized as Candidate Set and coreset. A subset of size 5 is visualized.
Figure 12: Sample visualization of prototype selection for the miniImagenet dataset on the few-shot classifica-tion task. Each row represents a set that corresponds to the support from which a prototype is selected for thefew-shot classification task.

Figure 15: Ablation: Visualization of 1D function reconstruction. In the ablation studies, we compare the firststage (CAND) and the second stage (AUTO) with SSS. Additionally, we replace the Candidate Selection stage(Stage 1) in SSS with random selection (RANAUTO) and compare the performance of these models. As canbe seen from the visualized reconstructed outputs, the combination of the Candidate Seletion stage with theAutoregressive stage results in the best subset selection for the reconstruction task.
