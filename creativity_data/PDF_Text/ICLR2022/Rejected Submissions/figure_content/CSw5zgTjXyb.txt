Figure 3: (a) the loss plane of P({l1,l2,l3}) learned from training data of {I 1, I2,I3}; (b) theloss curve of P({l1,l2}) learned from training data of {I 1,I2} is embedded in the loss plane ofP({l1, l2,l3}); d1, d2,., d4 are 4 vectors corresponding to 4 Pareto models in P({l1, l2}); (3) theperformances of the models h âˆˆ P ({l1,l2}) on true (testing) distributions and h* (h*) achieves theoptimal performance on client I 1 (I2) corresponding to d3 (d2) in (b).

Figure 5: Collaboration Equilibrium of 10 real hospitals(c) collaboration equi-libriumCollaboration Equilibrium The benefit graph of all hospitals determined by SPO and its corre-sponding strongly connected components are shown in Figure 5(a) and 5(b). From Figure 5(a), 10and 13 are the unique necessary collaborator for each other, C1 = {10,13} is the first identifiedstable coalition as shown in Figure 5(b); I9 is a tiny clinic that cannot contribute to any hospitals,so no hospital is willing to collaborate with it and I9 learns a local model with its own data byforming a simple coalition C2 = I9 . The benefit graph of the remaining clients are shown inFigure 5(b). On the one hand they cannot benefit I3 or I0 so they cannot form coalitions withthem, on the other hand they refuse to contribute I9 without any charge. They choose form thecoalition C3 = I1, I2, I4, I5, I6, I7, I8} to maximize their AUC. Therefore, the CE in this hospitalcollaboration network is achieved by the collaboration strategy S = {C1, C2, C3} and the modelAUC of each client in the CE is in Table 4.
Figure 6: d = [d0, d1, d2, d3, d4, d5] varies in each iteration where di corresponds to the client Ii.
