The numbers in the figure legends after slash denote the number ofconvolution layers used to enforce diversitydiversity training. We consider three ensembles ENSPARL/7, ENSPARL/5, and EN SP ARL/3 forthis study, where ENSPARL/N denotes that the first N convolution layers are used for enforcingthe diversity. We consider the same evaluation configurations as discussed in Section 5.1. Theaccuracies of all the ensembles on clean examples considering both CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 arementioned in Table 2. We can observe that as fewer restrictions are imposed, the overall ensembleaccuracy increases, which is expected and can be followed from Equation (1). A detailed analysison the diversity achieved by all these ensembles in terms of Linear CKA metric is provided inAppendix B for interested readers.

The numbers in the figure legends after slash de-note the number of convolution layers used to enforce diversity. The value inside the braces withinthe corresponding figure legends represent the overall average Linear CKA values between each pairof classifiers.
