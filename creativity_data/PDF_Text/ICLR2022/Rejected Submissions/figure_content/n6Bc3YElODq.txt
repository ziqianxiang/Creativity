Figure 1: Architectures OfMBOM4 Model-Based Opponent ModelingMBOM employs the environment model to predict and capture the learning of opponent policy.
Figure 2: Illustrations of the scenarios.
Figure 3: Performance of adaptation against different types of opponents, i.e., fixed policy, naivelearner, and reasoning learner. The results are plotted using mean and standard deviation with fivedifferent random seeds (x-axis is opponent index). The results show that MBOM can outperformother baselines, especially against naive learner and reasoning learner.
Figure 4: (a) Illustration of Coin Game; (b) Learning curves in Coin Game, which are plotted usingmean and standard deviation with five runs with different random seeds.
Figure 5: Visualization of α0, α1, α2 of MBOM, where αi is the weight of level-i IOP. The resultsare plotted using mean and standard deviation with five different random seeds (x-axis is opponentindex).
