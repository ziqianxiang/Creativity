Figure 3: Adaptive Model Training Process for Continuous Classification of Time Series4	Adaptive Model Training PolicyFigure 3 shows the model training process by the policy of ACCTS. When a model is trained by timeseries from the initial to the final time, ACCTS gives two decisions:•	Whether the current time series segment forms a new distribution to be learned. If yes, train themodel by the current time series; Otherwise, do not train and continue to get new data points;•	Which old samples need to be replayed and learned again. If the previous decision is yes, train themodel by the obtained old samples again after train it by the current time series.

The extraction is concentrated in 85%-length latestage, which may be because the patient’s vital signs change significantly near the outcome time.
