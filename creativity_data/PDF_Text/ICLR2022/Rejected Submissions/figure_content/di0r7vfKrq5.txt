Figure 1: Schematic agent interaction with the search environment (Lucene-BM25) for an ambiguousquery (tennis/golf). After receiving a set of documents (Dt), the corresponding observation (ot) iscompiled by ranking all documents ∈ ∪ti=0Di by their Passage Score (PS), and creating snippets forthe top-k documents around the answers extracted by the Machine Reader (MR). Note that PS/MRalways condition on q0. In step 1, q1, the agent doubles the weight on term ’tennis’ in document titles(we use the Lucene query syntax). In the last step, qT , the agent excludes from search results alldocuments containing the term ’pga’ (golf), then outputs the top-k documents found in the session.
