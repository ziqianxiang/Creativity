Figure 1: Low-precision SGLD with varying stepsizes on a Gaussian distribution. Variance-corrected SGLD with low-precision gradient accumulators (VC SGLDLP-L) and SGLD withfull-precision gradient accumulators (SGLDLP-F) converge to the true distribution whereas naiveSGLDLP-L diverges and the divergence increases as the stepsize decreases.
