Figure 1: State-Noisy Markov Decision Process where V(St) is perturbed by the noise mechanismN.
Figure 2: Average returns ofDQN and QRDQN against adversarial state observation noises acrossfour games. advX in the legend indicates adversarial state observations with the perturbation sizee as X. Both QRDQN (solid lines) and DQN (dashed lines) converge and the convergence level isdetermined by the perturbation strength e.
