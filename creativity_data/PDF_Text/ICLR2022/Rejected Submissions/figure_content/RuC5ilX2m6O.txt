Figure 2: The framework of Patch AutoAugment (PAA). We divide an image into a grid of patchesand assign an agent to each patch for selecting the optimal augmentation operation according to thepatch content together with the whole image semantics. The agents cooperate with each other toachieve the joint optimal DA results by sharing a team reward through multi-agent reinforcementlearning (MARL). Specifically, each agent outputs Oi(∙;pi； mJ operation performed on patch i,which includes two parameters: probability of calling the operation pi and the magnitude mi . Notethat PAA is co-trained with the target network.
Figure 3: Grad-CAM visualization onthe examples from CUB with ResNet-50trained by baseline, AutoAugment and ourPAA. PAA tends to help the target networkfocus on task-related features.
Figure 4: We categorize patches into four groups ac-cording to the patch importance calculated throughGrad-CAM. We draw four stacked area chart ofthe operations’ percentages over time. The arearepresents the percentage of each operation.
Figure 5: We give more visualizations of augmentation and Grad-CAM(Selvaraju et al., 2017) re-sults of baseline, AA(Cubuk et al., 2018) and our PAA. PAA performs rich diversity ofDA and tendsto help the target model focus on the class-related features.
