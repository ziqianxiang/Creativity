Figure 1: Active learning results on Bayesian models. Solid lines and shaded areas represent meansand standard deviations of test accuracy over different seeds. Our method especially SABAL-Greedyoutperforms most baselines and the SOTA method Bayesian Coreset.
Figure 2: Active learning results on general (non-Bayesian) models. Solid lines and shaded areasrepresent means and standard deviations of test accuracy over different seeds. Our method performscomparable or better than baselines and the SOTA method BADGE.
