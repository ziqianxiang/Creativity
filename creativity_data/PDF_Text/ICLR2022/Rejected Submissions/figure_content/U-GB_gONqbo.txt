Figure 1: Schematics of the distance matrix calculation for a hierarchical structure of tree heightL = 3 and number of observations N = 64.
Figure 2: (i) Facebook ordered adjacency matrix for the learned D = 2 embeddings of SH-LDM-RE for a hierarchical structure of L = 3. (ii) NLL comparison between SH-LDM and LDM forFacebook with D = 2. (iii) AUC performance over various networks for varying embedding sizes.
Figure 3: The first two columns for each dataset represent the node embeddings learned in two-dimensional space and t-SNE algorithm is applied for the second and the third columns to reducethe dimension size for the visualization task and to demonstrate the influence of t-SNE algorithm onthe embeddings. For each network, NMI (node clustering), Micro-F1 (node classification) and AUCscores (network reconstruction) are reported, respectively.
