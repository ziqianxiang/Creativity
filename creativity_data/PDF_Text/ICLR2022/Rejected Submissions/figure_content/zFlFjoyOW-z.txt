Figure 1: Model architecture of user Multi Interest Capsule Network(MICN) as auxiliary task andshare item embeddings with main model task(DIN). MICN takes user interactive behavior sequencesand user profile into dynamic routing capsule and extracts user interests as capsules. Scaled dotproduct between interest capsule and candidate item embeddings makes them in the same repre-sentation space. In label aware attention layer. The item embedding vector combined with itemembeddings of original recommending model brings user diverse interest-based item representationin main model. The main model is designed suitable for specific task, such as ranking model etc.
