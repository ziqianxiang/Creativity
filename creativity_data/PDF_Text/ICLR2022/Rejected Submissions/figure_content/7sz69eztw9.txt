Figure 2: Context-invariant embeddings with contrastive and domain adversarial learning. Weselect negative samples such that the correlation structure between exogenous and endogenous sig-nals is explicitly broken. For the other samples, we augment them randomly, denoted by the squigglyarrows. In addition to the contrastive component, we further add a domain adversarial componentthat, given a positive embedded sample, tries to reconstruct the context of the positive sample asbadly as possible while reconstructing the context of the negative sample as well as possible.
