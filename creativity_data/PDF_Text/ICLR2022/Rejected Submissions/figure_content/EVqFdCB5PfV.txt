Figure 1: DOCHOPPER Overview for a structured document consisting of sentences and paragraphs. Thequery encoder first computes embeddings q0 , . . . , qn for a sequence of sub-questions. During the iterativeattention process, DOCHOPPER attends to a paragraph or a sentence from the context embedding table thatcontains both paragraph embeddings and sentence embeddings. Information in the attended sentence or para-graph will be mixed with the query vector to compute query update. If the query attends to a paragraph, e.g. thefirst query q0 in the figure, the query vector will be broadcast to the associated sentences. If the query attendsto a sentence, e.g. the second query q1, only the sentence s10 will be used. DOCHOPPER then updates the queryvector q1 for the next round of attention. The selected sentences will be used to make final predictions.
