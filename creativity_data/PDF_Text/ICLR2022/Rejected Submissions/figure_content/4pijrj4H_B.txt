Figure 1: Toy examplesFigure 2: Augmented graphs via node samplingFor XX,	(μι -	μu) in equation 15 becomes [0, -0.05,0, -0.32,0] where	it was[-0.32, -0.05, 0.43, -0.32, 0] for the original graph. Note that	this	is the best case	scenariogiven the 40% masking budget, with the maximal decrease in ∣∣μι - μokι. As also mentionedin Footnote 2, the	actual feature masking process is stochastic.	By	assigning larger	maskingprobabilities to the	features with high deviations betweeen S0 and	S1 ,	the non-uniform	maskingstrategy proposed herein increases the chances of obtaining the “better” cases with larger reductionsin (μι - μo).

Figure 3: Augmented graphs via edge deletioninitial group size), and 1 node from the set S1χ . Therefore, the presented example in Figure 2b is apotential augmented topology obtained after the proposed node sampling framework. For this case,the original kk1 = 0.558 which becomes 0.892 for the augmented graph presented in Figure 2b.
Figure 4: Augmented graphs via edge additionaddition is presented in Figure 4b. For the presented example in Figure 4b, edge addition can lowerthe value of kk1 from 0.558 to 0.293.
