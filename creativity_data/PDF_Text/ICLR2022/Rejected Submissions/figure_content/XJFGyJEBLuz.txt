Figure 1: An illustration of the BARframework. Black arrows show thefeed-forward paths and red arrowsdirect the backward gradients. Theteacher ranker can be trained with anyranking loss functions. The studentmodel uses a multi-objective architec-ture that adds a listwise Softmax lossover teacher scores, in addition to theoriginal ranking loss.

Figure 4: An illustrative example of born again distillation. Given the training data set (x, y) (redsquares), loss functions L(b) (blue solid lines) and optimized models f(x) (green dashed lines)are trained with the original label y in red for the teacher model on Left, and are trained with thecombined label ys = (y + f t (x))/2 in yellow for the student model on Right. The models are thenevaluated with the test data set in cyan dots.
