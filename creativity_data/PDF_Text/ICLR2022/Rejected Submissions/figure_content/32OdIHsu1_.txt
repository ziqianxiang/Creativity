Figure 1: Functional mapping between image embeddings and word embeddings. (A), Schematicsof expert system. (B), Diagram of MLP trained to detect functional mappings. In MLPs, singlehidden layers contain 100 neurons. (C), MSE error ratio between before and after training. TheMSE error estimated after training is normalized to that estimated before training. Blue and Orangerepresent error ratios for experiments ‘img-to-word’ and ‘word-to-img’, respectively.
Figure 2: Prediction of EAB on the single action. (A), Examples of screenshots augmented withbird symbols; see top-left corers. (B), Example of outputs of ABIC trained as EAB.
Figure 3: Detection of game objects. (A), Examples of detected pigs (top-row) and wood blocks(bottom-row). Our detectors can distinguish the size of pigs. Blue and red boundary boxes refer tomid and small pigs. (B) and (C), Examples of raw screenshots (top-row) and reconstructed images(bottom-row).
