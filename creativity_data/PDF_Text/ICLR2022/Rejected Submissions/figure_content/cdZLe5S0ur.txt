Figure 1: The schematic illustration of the communication efficient FL with AQUILA in comparisonwith the naive combination of AdaQuantFL and LAQ. The blue lines indicating the transmission ofquantized gradients in AQUILA are drawn in different thicknesses to represent different quantizationlevels selected by various clients.
Figure 2: Comparison of AQUILA and AdaQuantFL+LAQ on the number of unskipped clients perstep in three experiment settings with homogeneous model architecture. AdaQuantFL clashes withthe threshold condition in LAQ and results in high communication frequency due to the increasingquantization level late in the training process, but AQUILA keeps the communication frequency atan appropriate level throughout the training.
Figure 3: Training Loss vs Total Transmitted Bits. In this figure, LAQ-2 and LAQ-16 representLAQ with fixed quantization level of 2 and 16 respectively. AdaQuantFL+LAQ represents the naivecombination of AdaQuantFL and LAQ. For heterogeneous model architecture, 100%-50% impliesthat half of clients have 100% of global model, whereas the other half of clients just share 50% * 50%of the global model. Similarly, 100%-25% means the other half of clients just share 25% * 25% ofthe global model. Particularly, we zoom in the end of the curves to better compare AQUILA withother methods.
