Figure 1: Estimating DE ofGaussian data with decreasingvariance.
Figure 2: Left: PDF when estimating DE of a triangle mixturein 1 dimension. Right: Training run when estimating DE of a2-component triangle mixture in 8 dimensions.
Figure 3: Top: Estimation of I(Xd; Y d), where (X, Y ) are multivariate Gaussian with correlationcoefficient ρi in the i-th epoch and d = 20. Middle: Estimation of I(Xd; (Y 3)d). Bottom: Estimationof I(Xd; Yd) for uniform (X, E) and Y = PiX + pl - PE in the i-th epoch.
Figure 4: Results on the fair classification task for both main (Figures 4a and 4c) and private task(Figures 4b and 4d) for both mention and sentiment labels. Results of MINE are not reported becauseof instabilities that prevent the network from converging. Figures 4b and 4d are obtained by trainingan offline classifier to recover the protected attribute S from Φψ (X).
Figure 5: Left: Estimation of I(X; Y ); Right: Estimation of I(X; Y3) (cubic transformation).
Figure 6: Bias, variance, and MSE for MI estimation on uniformly distributed data.
