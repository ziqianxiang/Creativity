Figure 1: Chaining together views to gain a whole view of multiple interrelated datasets with theonly requirement that features are keyed by other features. While a linear chain is shown in the leftof the figure, it can actually be a radial branching chain as seen in the right of the figure. It is shownsymmetric, but there is no requirement for symmetry. This method differs from graph embeddingsbecause entire relational tables factors can reconstruct the nodes in the graph. (Bottom) Depictedis a fictitious relational dataset model relating to black holes where arrows represent primary keysthat are not provided. We propose performing analysis at the NMF insertion point Sagittarius A*analyzing at the datapoint level, this novel approach is different than analyzing the graph structurewith graph embeddings or only the immediate neighboring tables. Clusters, factors and other NMFoutputs are not shown, but only the input structure in all three of the subfigures.
Figure 2: Chaining together three matrices, 1000×20 to 350×1000 to 630×350. This chain couldalso have been done on real data for instance: hashtag × location graph to location × word topicgraph finally to a word topic × continuous feature blob dataset. Chained views improve the abilityto discern clusters in each of the linking matrices and give a unique interpretation that depends onwhich information or matrices are included in the chain. (In the blobs, we show the first 2 dimensionsof the 20 dimensional dataset.)Mean Input 1 (Matrix 1) Mean Input 2 (Matrix 2) Arithmetic Output Mean (Inner Product)0.8	3	20 * 0.8 * 3.0 = 480.8	5	20 * 0.8 * 5.0 = 802.8	3	20 * 2.8 * 3.0 = 1682.8	5	20 * 2.8 * 5.0 = 280Table 2: Truth table for multidimensional input signals to output modeling the flow of informationfor NMF clustering of chained data. The number of features in matrix 1 is 20.
