Figure 1: Overview of our attack and defense framework ROCO for CO solvers. ROCO targetson the CO problems which can be encoded by graph (often holds in practice). Here delete/add theedges in the encoded graph represents delete/add constraints in CO. Symmetric RL denotes that thedefender and attacker share the same structure with symmetric reward and action space.
