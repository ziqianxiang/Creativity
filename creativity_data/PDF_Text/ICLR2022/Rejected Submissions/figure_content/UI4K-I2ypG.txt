Figure 2: Examples of the probability simplex for a K = 3 classification problem, where everycorner corresponds to a class and every point to a categorical distribution. Brighter colors correspondto higher density. (a) Ensemble of discriminators. (b) - (e) (Desired) Behavior of Dirichlet indifferent scenarios by Malinin & Gales (2018).

Figure 3: Schematic of a posterior network, takenfrom Charpentier et al. (2020). An encoder fÎ¸maps inputs to a latent representation z. NFs thenmodel class-conditional densities, which are usedtogether with the prior concentration to producethe posterior parameters.
