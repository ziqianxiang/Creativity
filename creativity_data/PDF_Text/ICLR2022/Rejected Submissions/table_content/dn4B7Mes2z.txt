Table 1: Over-parameterization ablations: A nonlin-ear CNN with 4 conVolution and 2 linear layers trainedon CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 with Various degrees oflinear oVer-parameterization.
Table 2: ImageNet: We show on existing architecturesthat linear over-parameterization can improve generaliza-tion performance. The benefit plateaus off when usingdeeper models. We did not see a noticeable improvementstarting from ResNet34.
Table 3: Explicit regularizers: Comparison of modelstrained with various regularizers. Over-parameterizationconsistently outperforms explicit regularizers.
