Therefore, a more balanced model is necessary and a multi-objective modelwhich considers sensitivity and specificity simultaneously is needed.

For fairness of comparison, the numberof layers of the two models is required to be equal. We make the number of layers five. The fourparameters of the Mixer network are set to 5, 256, 392, 1024, respectively.
