Table 1: AUC (Area Under the ROC curve) (%) on detecting IND and OOD samples on 2 settings.
Table 2: AUC (Area Under the ROC curve) (%) results of the original model (denoted by original)and the model plus fine-tuning using CGA-energy (denoted by +CGA-e). Almost every +CGA-eversion of the baselines outperforms the original model. Every experiment was run 5 times.
Table 3: Execution time (min) of each method spent in running the whole experiment on benchmarkdatasets for setting 1.
Table 4: AUC (Area Under the ROC curve) (%) on detecting OOD samples from the same dataset.
