Table 1: Variance reduction (high is good) for the camel, slashed circle and sinusoidal functionscompared to uniform sampling and to VEGAS over 10 repetitions.
Table 2: Comparison of the three test processes.
Table 3: Setup of the 35 different camel functions considered to benchmark ZuNIS. We scan overfunction relative standard deviations, which correspond to different σ parameters for each dimen-sion(eq. (12)). We provide the corresponding width of a 1D gaussian (σ1d) with the same variancefor reference.
Table 4: Variance reduction factor compared to VEGAS for each of the 35 different camel setupsdefined in table 3.
