Table 1: Quantitative comparisons between different learning-based video compression models mea-sured in BD rate. The anchor model is x265 (veryslow). Negative number means bitrate saving andpositive number means bitrate increase.
Table 2: Ablation study on the effectiveness of each module. The performance are measured in BDrates using our baseline model as the anchor. MH-MV: multi-head MV decoder, MH-Res: multi-head residual decoder, EA-L: ensemble-aware loss, FGSM: adversarial training with FGSM. Allmodels have hmv = hres = 4 considering the trade-off between performance and complexity.
Table 3: Ablation study on the number of heads in a multi-head decoder. The performance aremeasured in BD rates using our single-head baseline as the anchor. For simplicity, we set hmv =hres and train eight models with hmv = hres = 1, . . . , 8 using the fast training strategy.
