Table 1: MTK framework can effectively protect the target secured tasks, and can reveal theinformation by adding the corresponding trigger-keys. The baseline model is trained on theoriginal training set. Square (S1) and Cross (C2) are used to protect Age and Race, respectively.
Table 2: MTK models trained by using the decoupling process can alleviate high correlationsamong tasks without appreciable hindering on the model performance. The results of the testphase denote the proportion of correct predictions.
