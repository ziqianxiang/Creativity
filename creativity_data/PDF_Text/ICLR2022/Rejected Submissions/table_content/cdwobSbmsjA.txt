Table 1: Reconstruction quality evaluation (Mean Opinion Score)Model	MOS	95% CI	Training time	Parameter countGround truth	4.21	±0.04	-	-NSynth	2.68	±0.04	〜13 days	64.7MSING	1.15	±0.02	〜5 days	80.8MRAVE (Ours)	3.01	±0.05	〜7 days	17.6MAs we can see, RAVE outperforms both NSynth and SING in terms of audio quality withoutrelying on autoregressive generation. Furthermore, it achieves high-quality audio synthesiswith at least 3.5 times less parameters. There is still a gap in the evaluation between theground truth and the other models. This might come from the difficulty of modeling thevariety of room acoustics conditions present in the original dataset (as discussed in Engelet al. (2019)), sometimes making it obvious that the evaluated samples are synthesized.
Table 2: Comparison of the synthesis speed for several modelsModel	CPU synthesis	GPU synthesisNSynth	18 Hz	57 HzSING	304 kHz	9.8 MHzRAVE (Ours) w/o multiband	38 kHz	3.7 MHzRAVE (Ours)	985 kHz	11.7 MHzBeing the only model relying on autoregressive synthesis, NSynth is also the slowest, peak-ing at 57Hz during generation. As expected, the parallel nature of SING and RAVE makesthem several orders of magnitude faster than NSynth. The addition of the multiband de-composition speeds up RAVE by a factor of 25, allowing our model to outperform SING onboth CPU and GPU. Overall, we obtain audio synthesis at 48kHz with a 20× faster thanrealtime factor on CPU, and up to 240× on GPU.
