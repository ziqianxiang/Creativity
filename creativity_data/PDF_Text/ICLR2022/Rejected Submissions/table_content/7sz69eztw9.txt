Table 1: Classification and forecasting accuracy using embeddings learnt with different losses. Forforecasting, the accuracy metric shown is P50 loss. Results are averages over 5 runs. The last threelines are baselines using classic time series features, Catch22, and replacing embeddings withmore historic values for the forecasting task, Linear and a pure forecasting method, DeepAR.
Table 2: AUROC results on the anomaly detection task with 5 seeds. Larger values are better.
