The reconstruction error achieved by the global model for each global round is adoptedas evaluation metric. Two adversarial attacks namely additive noise (i.e adding gaussian noise tothe model weight) and sign flip (i.e flipping the sign of the model weight) (Li et al., 2018) aregenerated by 10% of clients for each round. The results shown in Figure 4 demonstrate that theproposed method significantly outperforms the defense-based approaches for the considered attackscenarios. It can be seen that the proposed method achieves similar performance as the FedAvgalgorithm without attack, which proves the effectiveness of the anomaly detection model in detectingthe anomalous weights. The performances of the defense-based methods are worse as they are noteffective in defending against attacks for not identically and independently distributed (iid) settings,8Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2022.5.05.0LLQSuo:PrLqSu。U①工
