Table 1: Results on NQ Test. For DPR Top-{1,5} performance we report the most recent numbers,the published performance Karpukhin et al. (2020) is slightly lower (47.3 and 68.1, respectively).
Table 2: Example of a T5-G4 agent session exhibiting multiple tactics. We only report three stepsand the top-3 results, for brevity. In red the answer spans wrongly predicted by the internal reader (inblue when correct). The score for the result set at each step is that of Equation 7.
Table A.1: Example state of the MuZero search agent that is the input to the BERT representationfunction. The ‘Type’ layer encodes the state part information for each token. The ‘IDF’ and ‘PS’ layerare additional layers with float values of the IDF and the PS score of the input tokens, respectively.
Table A.2: Example state (input) and prediction (target) of the T5 agent with linebreaks and emphasisadded for readability. We use a 30 token span in our experiments.
Table A.3: Hyperparameters for MuZero.
Table A.4: Hyperparameters for T5.
Table A.5: Results of all T5 Agents on NQ Dev.
Table A.6: Results on NQ Dev and Test.
Table A.7: Example of a Rocchio Query Expansion session.
Table A.8: Example of a MuZero agent search session.
