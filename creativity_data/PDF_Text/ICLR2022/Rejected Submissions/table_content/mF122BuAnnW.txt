Table 1: Comparison of the naive collective certificate baseline and localized smoothing for σ ∈{0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5} and different σmin and σmax. In all cases, the localized smoothing certificateretains an equal or higher accuracy and simultaneously provides stronger robustness guarantees.
Table 2: Comparison of the center smoothing baseline and localized smoothing for σ ∈{0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5} and different σmin and σmax. Safe for σ = 0.2, where the baseline has aslightly higher certified ratio AUC but a lower accuracy, localized smoothing retains an equal orhigher accuracy and simultaneously provides stronger robustness guarantees.
Table 3: Comparison of the naive collective certificate baseline and localized smoothing forσ ∈ {0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5} and different σmin and σmax. Unlike in Table 1, we also load themodel trained with σmin for the baselines. Safe for σ = 0.3, where the baseline has a higher accu-racy but much weaker certificates, localized smoothing again offers a higher accuracy and strongercertificates.
Table 4: Comparison of the center smoothing baseline and localized smoothing for σ ∈{0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5} and different σmin and σmax. Unlike in Table 2, we also load the modeltrained with σmin for the baselines. In all cases, the locally smoothed model has a higher accuracyand stronger certificates.
Table 5: Optimizing baseline standard deviation σ. For the same (σmin , σmax) as in Tables 1 and 2,we perform a grid search for σ ∈ [0, 0.5] that yield certified accuracy or certified ratio curves withhigher AUC, and an accuracy that at least equals the locally smoothed models. Such a σ could notbe found. Localized smoothing appears to offer a better accuracy-robustness trade-off.
