Table 1: Performance of CFS and baseline methods on real-world datasets. Here we show theclassification accuracies of classifiers trained on varying numbers of features selected by CFS andvarious baseline methods (higher is better). For each method we selected k = 20 features (exceptfor the mice protein dataset, for which we use k = 5 because the data is lower dimensional). Weused an extremely randomized trees classifier and report performance on a held out test set.
Table 2: Characteristics of real-world datasets used for empirical evaluation. Each dataset con-tains both a background dataset, generated from irrelevant sources of variation, and a target dataset,generated from both the irrelevant source of variation as well as the salient source of variation usedto generate class labels. We note that CFS uses both target and background data points to selectfeatures, while all baseline methods are run solely on the target data points.
Table 3: Downstream classification performance of features selected by CFS and baselinemethods on real-world datasets assessed using gradient boosted tree classifiers. Here we showthe classification accuracies of classifiers trained on varying numbers of features selected by CFSand various baseline methods (higher is better). For each method we selected k = 20 features (ex-cept for the mice protein dataset, for which we use k = 5 because the data is lower dimensional).
