Table 1: Comparison with SOTA anomaly detectors: We compare STRIC with other anomaly detection methods(see Appendix A.8) on the experimental setup and the same evaluation metrics proposed in (Braei & Wagner, 2020;Munir et al., 2019). The baseline models are: MA, ARIMA, LOF (Shen et al., 2020), LSTM (Braei & Wagner,2020; Munir et al., 2019), Wavenet (Braei & Wagner, 2020) , Yahoo EGADS (Munir et al., 2019) , GOAD (Bergman& Hoshen, 2020), OmniAnomaly (Su et al., 2019), Twitter AD (Munir et al., 2019), TanoGAN (Bashar & Nayak,2020), TadGAN (Geiger et al., 2020) , DeepAR (Flunkert et al., 2017) and DeepAnT (Munir et al., 2019) . STRICoutperforms most of the other methods based on statistical models and based on DNNs. See Table 6 for the same tableobtained by looking at the relative performance w.r.t. STRIC.
Table 2: Ablation study on the RMSE of prediciton errors: We compare Test error and Generalization Gap (Gap.) ofa standard TCN model with our STRIC predictor and some variation of it (using the same training hyper-parameters).
Table 3: Datasets summaries. We report some properties of the datasets used (see (Geiger et al., 2020) for modedetails).
Table 4: Ablation study on the RMSE of prediciton errors with standard deviation on 10 different seeds: Wecompare a standard TCN model with our STRIC predictor and some variation of it (using the same train hyper-parameters). The effect of adding a linear interpretable model before a TCN improves generalization error. Fadingregularization has a beneficial effect in controlling the complexity of the TCN model and reducing the generalizationgap.
