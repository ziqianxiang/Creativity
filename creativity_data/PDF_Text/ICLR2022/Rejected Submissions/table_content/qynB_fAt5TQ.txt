Table 1:	Centroid approximation for confidence interval. The numbers in the table represent ∣α — α∣,where α is the estimated coverage probability. The errors bar is the standard deviation.
Table 2:	Results on the contextual bandit experiment. The numbers in the table represent the averagedreward with its standard deviation.
Table 3: Complete result on comparing centroid approximation with various bootstrap methods. Thebold number shows the best approach.
