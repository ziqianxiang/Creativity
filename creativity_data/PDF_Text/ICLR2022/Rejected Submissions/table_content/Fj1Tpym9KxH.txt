Table 1: Accuracy (%) on Office-Home for unsupervised domain adaptation (ResNet-50).
Table 2: Results on DomainNet with CDAN w/SDAT. The number in the parenthesis refers to theincrease in accuracy with respect to CDAN.
Table 4: Accuracy (%) on VisDA-2017 for unsupervised domain adaptation (ResNet-101). Themean column contains mean across all classes. SDAT particularly improves the accuracy in classesthat have comparatively low CDAN performance.
Table 3: Results on DA for object detection.
Table 5: Performance comparison across differ-ent loss smoothing techniques on Office-Home.
Table S1: The notations used in the paper and the corresponding meaning.
Table S2: Architecture used for featureclassifier and Domain classifier. C is thenumber of classes. Both classifiers willtake input from feature generator (gθ).
Table S3: Accuracy (%) on VisDA-2017 (ResNet-101).
Table S5: Accuracy(%) on DomainNet dataset for unsupervised domain adaptation (ResNet-101)across five distinct domains. The row indicates the source domain and the columns indicate thetarget domain.
Table S4: Results on Office-Home dataset with DANN (Ganin & Lempitsky, 2015). DANN w/SDAT improves the performance over DANN across the four splits of Office-Home dataset showingthe adaptability of the proposed method.
Table S6: Different Smoothing techniques. We refer to (Stutz et al., 2021) to compare the proposedSDAT with other techniques to show the efficacy of SDAT. It can be seen that SDAT outperformsthe other smoothing techniques significantly. Other smoothing techniques improve upon the perfor-mance of DAT showing that smoothing is indeed necessary for better adaptation.
