Table 1: Datasets with the number of classes (nc) and training samples (ns), the models and modelParameters (P), training rounds (n), batch size (b), learning rate (Ir), total numberof Clients (m), numberof malicious ones (c), and decay Parameter(Î¼) used in TESSER ACT. * variable learning rate, peaks at 0.1.
Table 2: Attack imPact - Test accuracy for Directed Deviation model Poisoning attacks (Full-Krum;Full-Trim), on different datasets with c/m = 0.2. For the ShakesPeare dataset, test loss has been rePorted.
Table 3: Fraction of malicious or benign clients allottedweights above 1e-4 averaged over 500 iterations. Theweakness of FoolsGold and FLTrust stems in part from thefact that they assign low weight to a significant fraction ofbenign clients for effective detection.
