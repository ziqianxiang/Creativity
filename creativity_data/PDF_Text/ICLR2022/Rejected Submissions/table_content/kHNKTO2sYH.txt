Table 1: Description of dataset and its corruption.
Table 2: Architecture of encoder and decoder for VAE and VAEGMM. Further, for binary pixels the decoderwill use a Sigmoid non-linearity at the end.
Table 3: Architecture of encoder and decoder for CVAE. Further, for binary pixels the decoder will use aSigmoid non-linearity at the end.
Table 4: Architecture of encoder and decoder for CCVAE. Further, for binary pixels the decoder will use aSigmoid non-linearity at the end.
Table 5: Architecture of encoder and decoder for CLSVAE. Note for CLSVAE latent space of size 15 is split:10 for zc and 5 for zd . Further, for binary pixels the decoder will use a Sigmoid non-linearity at the end.
