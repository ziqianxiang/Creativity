Table 1: Cross-play performance. We show results for both the full hint-guess game and the samehand condition. Each entry is the average performance is of 20 pairs of agents that are trained withdifferent random seeds. Please refer to Fig. 3 for visualization of performance for each individualpair. Cross-Play score is the nondiagonal mean of each grid. Self-Play score is the diagonal mean,i.e. the score attained when agents play with the peer they are trained with.
Table 2: Behavioral analysis for the Action-In model in the Figure 2 scenarios. We randomly chose10 agent-pairs from each cluster and simulated the same scenario 1K times. % Human denotes thefraction of games where the Hinter hints the card that corresponds to human interpretable choice(highlighted in yellow in Fig. 2), and % Win denotes the fraction of games where the Guessercorrectly guesses.
Table 3: Cross-play performance for card number N = 3 and N = 7. We show results for both thefull hint-guess game and the simplified version where both agents have the same hand. Each entryis the average performance is of 20 pairs of agents that are trained with different random seeds.
