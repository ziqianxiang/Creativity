Table 1: The absolute difference of local responses (per image) between test set images and theirpotentially adversarial examples on different layers. Left/Right denote standard/robust model.
Table 2: Left/Right denote successfully-attacked/failed adversarial examples on standard model.
Table 3: Left/Right denote original/transferred adversarial examples on adversarially-trained model.
Table 4: The absolute difference of local responses (per image) between test set images and theirpotentially adversarial examples on different layers. Left/Right denote successfully-attacked/failedadversarial examples on adversarially-trained model respectively.
Table 5: The absolute difference of local responses (per image) between test set images and their po-tentially adversarial versions on different layers of ResNet-18. Left/Right denote original/transferredadversarial examples on standard model respectively.
