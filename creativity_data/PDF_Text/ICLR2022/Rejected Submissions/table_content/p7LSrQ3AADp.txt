Table 1: Summary of saliency methods discussed throughout the framework.
Table A1: We situate 10 saliency methods along the nine dimensions of our framework, finding that they capture meaningful and distinct attributes about themethods. Some dimensions are characterized via our own experiments (e.g., computational efficiency) and others draw from tests described in existing work (e.g.,model and input sensitivity). In this way, our framework lets us systematically analyze the research landscape to understand gaps and opportunities for future work.
