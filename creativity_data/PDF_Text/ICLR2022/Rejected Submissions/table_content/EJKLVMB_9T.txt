Table 1: Regex synthesis performance (success rate, semantic regex accuracy, and the ratio of fullyaccurate regexes) of our model and baselines over three benchmark regex datasets. ‘AR’, ‘BF’, and‘RG’ are abbreviations for AlphaRegex, Blue-Fringe, and RegexGenerator++, respectively.
Table 2: Comparisons of different regex synthesis method using split positive examples.
Table 3: Examples of neural example splitting.
Table 4: Statistics of four benchmark datasets. Numbers in parentheses are the numbers of regexes inoriginal datasets and in front of the parentheses are the numbers of regexes used in our experiments.
Table 5: Split performance (%) of the NeuralSplitter under different settings of hyperparameters.
Table 6: Regex synthesis performance (success rate and semantic regex accuracy) of our model andbaselines over four benchmark regex datasets under different timeout values. ‘AR’ is abbreviationsfor AlphaRegex. ‘Random’ dataset consists of regular expressions over alphabet of size ten.
Table 7: Comparisons of regex synthesis performance of AlphaRegex algorithm with and withoutSplitRegex framework on practical regex datasets.
Table 8: Comparisons of regex synthesis performance evaluated for negative examples generatedfrom randomly perturbed regexes.
Table 9: Regex synthesis performance of our model in datasets used in TransRegex (Li et al., 2021).
