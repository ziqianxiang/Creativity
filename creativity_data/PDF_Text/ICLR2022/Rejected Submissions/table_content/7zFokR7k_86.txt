Table 1: Validation accuracies on the length split of SCAN with different λ+. ∞ means encodingdata consistency as hard constraints.
Table 2: Answer predicting accuracies on the OWA version of RuleTaker. The model is trained onD5 or D3, and tested on D5 (proof depth ≤ 5). Columns correspond to different proof depths withinthe test data. N/A means there is no proof since the test example can be neither proved nor disproved.
