Table 1: Resilience optimization algorithm under the fixed maximal rewiring number budget of20. We report the weighted combination of the graph connectivity-based resilience and the networkefficiency improvement (in percentage) with the weighted coefficient α ∈ {0, 0.5}. Results areaveraged over 3 runs. We report the rewiring number inside the bracket.
Table 2: Statistics of graphs used for resilience maximization. Both transductive and inductivesettings (?) are included. Consistent with our implementation, we report the number of edges bytransforming undirected graphs to directed graph so that the edge rewiring has the fixed executionorder. For the inductive setting, we report the maximum number of edges. The action space size ofthe edge rewiring is measured by 2|E|2 .
Table 3: Performance gain (in percentage) of ResiNet in optimizing varying objectives on the BA-15network. All objectives are optimized with the same hyper-parameters, which means that we did nottune hyper-parameters for objectives except for RD .
Table 4: Resilience optimization algorithm under the fixed maximal rewiring number budget of 200.
Table 5: Running speed (in second) of the resilience optimization algorithm under the fixed maximalrewiring number budget of 20 and 200 (in bracket). Results are averaged over 3 runs.
