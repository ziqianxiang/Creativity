Table 1: Results against dirty label backdoor adversary for select pairs of CIFAR-10 classes usinga single pixel trigger. The numbers in column 1 refer to the standard CIFAR-10 labels (e.g., 0 =airplane, 1 = automobile, etc.). Column 2 gives the (x, y) coordinates of the trigger. S = source class,T = target class, C = clean accuracy (higher is better), A = targeted misclassification rate (lower isbetter). Results for our method are in the last two columns under TW (this work).
Table 2: CIFAR-10 dirty label backdoor scenarios.
Table 3: Performance on CIFAR-10, dirty label backdoor scenario, using the PreActResNet18architecture. The S / T column lists the CIFAR-10 source and target classes. refers to the percentageof the source class which is poisoned. For the remainder of the columns, the top level column headersgive the defense type: L (clean), ND (no defense), SS (spectral signatures), AC (activation clustering),ITLM (iterative trimmed loss minimization, and TW (this work); the second level column headersgive the metric type: M (misclassification rate), C (clean accuracy, higher is better), A (targetedmisclassification rate, lower is better), FP (false positives, lower is better), FN (false negatives, loweris better). Please refer to the text for a more detailed explanation of the table.

Table 5: Ablation studies on CIFAR-10, dirty label backdoor scenario, using the PreActResNet18architecture, with various settings of α and β. The S / T column lists the CIFAR-10 source and targetclasses. refers to the percentage of the source class which is poisoned. The second level headingsare C (clean accuracy, higher is better), A (targeted misclassification rate, lower is better). Pleaserefer to the text for a more detailed explanation of the table.
