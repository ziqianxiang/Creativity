Table 2: Summary of datasets and models. A histogram of data per device is given in Figure 5 (Appendix B).
Table 3: Comparison of partial model personalization with full model personalization in terms of the averagetest accuracy % across all devices. The subscript denotes the standard deviation over 5 runs with differentrandom seeds. The boldfaced/highlighted numbers denote the accuracies within one standard deviation of themaximum in each row. For partial personalization, we show the accuracy of FedAlt; see Table 4 for FedSim.
Table 4: Comparing FedAlt and FedSim for partial model personalization. “FT (part.)” means finetuning thepersonal parameters vi while fixing the shared parameters u from non-personalized training. The numbers areaveraged over 5 runs with different random seeds. The standard deviations are given in Table 9 (Appendix C).

Table 9: This table shows Table 4 of the main paper along with the corresponding standard deviationsas subscripts. We compare FedAlt and FedSim for partial model personalization in this table. “FT (part.)”corresponds to finetuning the personal parameters vi locally while fixing the shared parameters u from a non-personalized training. The numbers are averaged over 5 random seeds; the boldfaced numbers denote thosewithin 1 standard deviation of the highest accuracy in each row.
Table 10: The change in accuracy (percentage points) from the final finetuning for FedAlt and FedSim withstateful devices. The subscript denotes the standard deviation over 5 random seeds.
Table 11: This is the counterpart of Table 4 to stateless devices. We compare FedAlt and FedSim for partialmodel personalization with stateless devices. “FT (part.)” corresponds to finetuning the personal parameters vilocally while fixing the shared parameters u from a non-personalized training. The numbers are averaged over 5random seeds; the boldfaced numbers denote the highest accuracy in each row.
