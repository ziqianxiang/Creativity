Table 1: Tokens most preferentially added when C5T5 is asked to make modifications resultinghigh vs. low logP values. Multipliers compare the actual rate of adding tokens compared to theexpected number if the model drew randomly from the data distribution independent of propertyvalue. Blue tokens are hydrocarbons (i.e. lipophilic groups). Red tokens contain hydrogen bondingdonors or acceptors (i.e. hydrophilic groups)Target: <high> Target: <low>trityl	77.0x	phospho	48.1xpentadecyl	20.2x	phosphonato	44.7xZ	17.7x	sulfinam	41.2xperylen	11.8x	hydrazon	34.3xundecyl	8.1x	sulfinato	26.3xheptadecyl	7.9x	Z	17.9xylium	7.6x	oxonium	10.3xisoindolo	5.9x	amoyl	9.3xbH	5.9x	carbamic acid	8.6xiod	5.8x	sulfin	6.9xFigure 5: Visualizations of base and logP-optimized molecules.

Table 2: Comparison of C5T5 to prior methodsa Whether or not the model makes targeted modifications - i.e. whether the user can specify which part ofthe molecule the model should modify.
Table 3: For each source molecule, we show the percent of generated molecules that are novel (notin PubChem, including invalid names) and valid (can be parsed by ChemAxon), the number of gen-erated molecules, the min/max logP of any generated molecule, the number of eligible compoundsin PubChem and the min/max logP of all molecules in PubChem that could be generated by maskingup to 5 consecutive tokens. IUPAC names of source molecules are listed in Table 4.

Table 5: Numerical ranges across properties for each property value token. Cutoffs for logP,PSA, and refractivity were chosen as common thresholds for druglikeness screening following(Ghose et al., 1999; Veber et al., 2002; Hitchcock & Pennington, 2006). We use the same cutofffor logD as logP.
