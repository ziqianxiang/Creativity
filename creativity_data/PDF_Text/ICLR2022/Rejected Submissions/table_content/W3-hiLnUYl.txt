Table 1: Taxonomy of DUMs. Methods are grouped according to their regularization of the hiddenrepresentations (rows), and their uncertainty estimation method (columns).
Table 2: We compare Softmax, MC Dropout (7), Deep Ensembles, SNGP, DDU, MIR, DUQ, DCUand PostNet on CIFAR10/100-C. We evaluate the accuracy (ACC) on the uncorrupted testset, AUROCand rAULC. Ensembles and MC dropout demonstrate better uncertainty calibration than most DUMs.
Table 3: We compare semantic segmentation using Softmax, MC Dropout (7), Deep Ensembles,SNGP, DDU and MIR on Cityscapes-C and CARLA-C. We evaluate the mIoU on the uncorruptedtestset and AUROC/rAULC across all levels of corruption. Again, ensembles and MC dropout yieldbetter calibrated uncertainty than most DUMs. Most notably, only SNGP consistently outperformsthe softmax entropy. DUMs using an explicit generative model of hidden representations to estimateuncertainty perform particular bad on realistic distributional shifts (CARLA-C).
