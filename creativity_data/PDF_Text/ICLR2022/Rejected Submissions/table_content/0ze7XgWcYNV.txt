Table 1: Main results on test sets. For success rate, we report both goal-finding (normal font) andrequest-fulfilling results (smaller grey font in parentheses). We also report the average number ofdifferent types of actions taken by the agent (across all task types).
Table 2: Success rates and numbers of actions taken with different stack sizes (on validation). Largerstack sizes significantly aid success rates in unseen environments, but not in seen environments.
