Table 1: Classification results for Sections 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3. C: Complex-valued weights. DP:(ζ -)DP-SGD. For the CIFAR-10 dataset, R2n indicates a network architecture utilising two channelsto simulate complex inputs/ model weights. GDP: GaUssian DP accounting. X: not used. X: used.
Table 2: Results on the MRI reconstruction task. NMSE: normalised mean squared error, PSNR:peak signal-to-noise ratio in dB, SSIM: structural similarity index metric. GDP: Gaussian DP.
Table 3: Comparison of privacy analyses using Renyi DP (RDP) and Gaussian DP (GDP).
Table 4: ROC-AUC (mean+STD) of complex-valued activation functions on the SPeechCommanddataset trained with identical settings and the same network architecture over five repetitions withζ-DP-SGD.
Table 5: Results for PhaseMNIST training in a private (ζ-DP-SGD) and non-private (non-DP) fash-ion. Results for real-valued MNIST are provided for approximate comparison using the same modelarchitecture (but with real-valued weights) trained with identical settings.
Table 6: Average computation times (100 repetitions) for a batched matrix multiplication with batchsize 64 and matrix dimensions (512 X 512) (Linear) and a convolution operation with input dimen-sions (64 X 3 X 224 X 224) (batch, channel, height, width) and kernel dimensions (3,16, 3) (in,out, kernel size) (Conv.). R: Real-valued input and weight matrix and C: complex-valued input andweight matrix. Times are given on CPU and GPU.
Table 7: Average computation times for a model consisting of a 2D convolutional layer with 3 inputchannels, 32 output channels and a kernel shape of 3 X 3 followed by a linear layer with matrixdimensions of p28800, 1q executed on an input of dimensionality p64, 3, 32, 32q (batch, channel,height, width) for 100 repetitions.
