Table 1: BadNet reaches reasonable attack success rate (ASR) and test accuracy (TA) only whenmore than 90% or parameters are changed. The baseline performance of BadNet achieves up to87.61% test accuracy and 99.88% attack success rate. Limiting the percentage of modificationsafter fine-tuning decreases the attack performance.
Table 2: Comparison of our methods CFT, CFT+BR with the baseline methods BadNet,FT and,TBT on CIFAR10 (Krizhevsky et al., 2009) with ResNet-20/32/18, and ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009)with ResNet-34/50. Our proposed CFT+BR results are written in bold. Note that the percentage ofthe backdoor parameter (θ*) bits that are actually flipable『m以小 must be near 100% for a viableRowhammer backdoor attack.
