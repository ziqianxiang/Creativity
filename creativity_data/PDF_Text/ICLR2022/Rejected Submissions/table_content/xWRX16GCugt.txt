Table 1: Sequoia’s methods, environments and metrics. Most of the RL settings in Sequoia canbe passed custom environments to use for each task. This makes it possible to use virtually anygym environment to create custom incremental RL settings. The environments listed here are thoseexplicitly supported in Sequoia, where multiple tasks can be sampled within a single environment.
