Table 1: Evaluation on LFW for ArcFace with ResNet100 backbone and different pre-trained models(AdaCos, CosFace, CurricularFace) with MobileFaceNet backbone. By ”original” we mean noEthical Module is added to the pre-trained model. The tuples correspond to the choices of κ0 (firstargument) and κ1 (second argument). FRR@FAR is expressed as a percentage (%).
Table 2: FRR@(FAR = α) on IJB-B for ArcFace withResNet100 backbone, for α = 10-i, i = 3, 4.
