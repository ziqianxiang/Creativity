Table 1: *In a game With finite steps, ζs,a,b is the probability that the game will end at state s, after takingactions a, b (Daskalakis et al., 2020, Section 2). *TX→s is the time that it takes to go from state S to states0 by using policy pair x, y (Wei et al., 2021, Assumption 1). JhiS O(c-4) complexity by Wei et al. (2021)requires using Euclidean projections onto the simplex instead of softmax updates and depends on the metricsubregularity constant. Hence it is not applicable to NPG.
