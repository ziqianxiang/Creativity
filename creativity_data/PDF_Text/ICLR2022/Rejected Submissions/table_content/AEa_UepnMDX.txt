Table 1: Pixel accuracy and class mean intersection over union on the Chesapeake Land Coverdataset. All models use only coarse NLCD labels as supervision. For our proposed methods, weevaluate both the trained predictor (qi) and the posterior under the implicit generative model (小).
Table 2: Land cover classification experiments for generalizing across cities. In each column, thescore of the best model not depending on auxiliary data as input is italicized. The score of the bestoverall model is bolded.
