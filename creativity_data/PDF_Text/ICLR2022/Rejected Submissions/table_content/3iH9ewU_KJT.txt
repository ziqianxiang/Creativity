Only thelabel of amount itself is not enough. We propose that a sub label is the volume of next day dividedby current day, while the main label is the volume of next day. Two labels have different orders ofmagnitude while the sub label is a number floating around 1.0 and the main label is great than 108.

In the risk management, fraudtransaction is often divided into many classes by the type of fraud. Table 2 shows the details of subtasks.
