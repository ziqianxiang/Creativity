Table 3: We observe mAP performance when testing on out of distribution data with respect to theaverage number of labels per sample.
Table 4: We compute the number of relevantrules in top 50 (#@50) as well as the meanreciprocal ranking (MRR) of the correct rules.
Table 5: Inference results for the urine outputtask.
Table 6: Here are the accuracies for the predicted atomic events. The results show accuracy predictingthe event only using the RGB image features and with the optical flow information. Further ruleswere used to predict contain.
Table 7: We ablate the different components of Neural TLP over the CATER predicted atomic eventsdata. We start by determining the efficacy of quantization, where t is the dimension after quantization.
Table 8: For j = 1 samples we compare model Hits@10 performances across different rule lengths.
