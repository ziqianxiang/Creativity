Table 1: Quantitative results and model parameters on four environments. SiT achieves superior and rea-sonable performance with less model parameters on all environments. When adding trainable abstract tokens,which introduce a few more parameters, SiT, marked by +, further improves performance in complex envi-ronments. As CConv is designed for fluid dynamics, we report the results on BoxBath for reference of thesimulation on fluid parts, which is marked by *.
Table 2: MSEs on generalizations. The lists of numbers in FluidShake and RiceGrip are the range of particles,while the tuples in BoxBath denotes number of fluid particles, number of rigid particles, and shape of rigidobjects respectively. Training settings are marked by *. We compare SiT with abstract tokens and DPI-Net.
Table 3: Ablation studies. We comprehensively explore the effectiveness of SiT, including the necessity ofinteraction tokens, the structure of sub-network, the value of α, β, and the usage of multi-head in uniformattention. We report MSEs(1e-2) on FluidShake, which is a complex environments involving outer forces.
Table 4: Ablation studies on sensitiveness to radius R and abstract tokens. The left parts are MSEs(1e-2) onFluidShake, which suggest that SiT is more robust within small range of R. Our default setting on all domainsis marked by *. The right parts are MSEs(Ie-2) on RiceGrip and BoxBath. We replace abstract tokens withdummy tokens, which are fixed value vectors but have same connectivities as abstract tokens.
Table 5: MSE and WMSE results from all models on generalizations. The lists of numbers inFluidShake and RiceGrip are the range of particles, while the tuples in BoxBath denotes number offluid particles, number of rigid particles, and shape of rigid objects respectively. Training settingsare marked by *.
