Table 1: Overview of Existing Works. NC, GC, LP, RP denote node classification, graph classification,link prediction, relation prediction, respectively. DP(∙) is dropout; BN(∙) is batch normalization;θ(∙) outputs the hidden representation after summarizing mixed operations (Zhao et al., 2021); hKdenotes the output from i-th operator of O in K-th layer of message function (see Sec. 3.1).
Table 2: The model comparison of the link prediction task on HKGs. The results of NNs andmulti-linear baselines are copied from Liu et al. (2020), those of Geo and S2S are copied from Diet al. (2021). And GNN baselines are re-implemented due to the task variance.
Table 3: The model comparison of the relation prediction task on HKGs. The results of NNs arecopied from Guan et al. (2020), others are based on our implementations.
Table 4: The model comparison of the link prediction task on facts with fixed arity. The results oftensor models are copied from Liu et al. (2020), others are copied from Di et al. (2021).
