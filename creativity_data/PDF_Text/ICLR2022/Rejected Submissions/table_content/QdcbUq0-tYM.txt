Table 1: Results on the Cartpole task. We report errors on the parameter estimation of μ (lower isbetter), as well as the overall task performance (higher is better). Mean and standard deviation arereported. Results are averaged over 3 models and 10 episodes. Task performance is defined as thenumber of simulation steps where the state of the cartpole is within certain thresholds.
Table 2: Results on the Half Cheetah task (trained on 6 seeds each for DR and UC, each modelevaluated on 3 random seeds).
Table 3: Results on the wiping task. We report errors on the parameter estimation of μ (lower isbetter), as well as the overall task performance (lower is better). Mean and standard deviation arereported. Results are averaged over 10 runs.
Table 4: Results on the Cartpole task with changing μ. We report errors on the parameter estimationof μ (lower is better), as well as the overall task performance (higher is better). Mean and standarddeviation are reported. Results are averaged over 3 episodes.
Table 5: Results on sim-to-sim transfer (Nimble to Bullet) on the Cartpole task. We report errorson the parameter estimation of μ (lower is better), as well as the overall task performance (higher isbetter). Mean and standard deviation are reported. Results are averaged over 20 models and 100Ktimesteps.
