Table 1: The AD performance under clean only data setting of GOAD in [7] and our implementation.
Table 2: The AD performance per class on CIFAR-10 dataset in terms of AUC and AP. Classrepresents the label of normal samples.
Table 3: The AD performance per class on MVTec dataset in terms of AUC and AP. Class representsthe label of normal samples.
Table 4: The AD performance per class on fMNIST dataset in terms of AUC and AP. Class representsthe label of normal samples.
Table 5: The AD performance per class on Dog-vs-Cat dataset in terms of AUC and AP. Classrepresents the label of normal samples.
Table 6: Additional ablation studies. SOTA OCC methods are [51] for CIFAR-10 dataset and GOAD[7] for Thyroid dataset. We introduce 6% noise on MVTec dataset and 1.5% noise on the Thyroiddataset. Metrics are (AUC/AP) for CIFAR-10 dataset and F1 score for Thyroid dataset.
Table 7: Additional ablation studies. SOTA OCC methods are CutPaste [33] for MVTec dataset and[51] for CIFAR-10 dataset. We introduce 6% noise on both datasets. Metrics are (AUC/AP).
Table 8: Additional experiments with extra baselines from robust anomaly detection literature. Weintroduce 6% noise on CIFAR-10 and KDD datasets. For Thyroid dataset, we introduce 1.5% noise.
