Table 6: Hyper-parameters for our experimentsC More experimental resultsC.1 Combination with distance-based and angle-based loss functionsIn addition to the matching loss defined in Eqn.(1) which is related to coordinates only, one maybe curious about whether using distance-based loss and angle-based can further improve the per-formance, since the latter two are equivariant to the transformation of coordinates. For ease of12Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2022reference, let R denote the groundtruth coordinate of atom Vi and R denote the predicted Coordi-nate of atom vi. Remind in Section 2, we use E to denote the collection of all bonds. We also defineE2 as {(i,j,k)|(i,j) ∈ E, (i, k) ∈ E, k 6= j}.

Table 10: Comparison of our method and ConfGF with different model sizesWe can see that: (i) when we reduce our model size to 0.98M, our method still outperforms Con-fGF on GEOM-Drugs; on GEOM-QM9, our method outperforms ConfGF evaluated by the median14Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2022values of COV and MAT. (ii) The performances of our model with 13.29M parameters and 0.98Mparameters are similar. (iii) When we increase the model size of ConfGF, the performance becomesworse, which shows that ConfGF cannot benefit from more parameters. We observe that a largerConfGF (12.28M) suffers from larger training loss than a smaller ConfGF (0.98M), which shows itslimitation.
