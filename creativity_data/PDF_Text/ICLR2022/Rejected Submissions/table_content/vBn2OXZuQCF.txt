Table 1: (Top) Test accuracy (%) of ERM with standard and SwAV augmentations, SENTRY, DANNwith standard and SwAV augmentations, SwAV, and SwAV + extra (abbreviated to SwAV+) on alldomain pairs of DomainNet. Here, SwAV is run on source + target, and SwAV+ is separated fromthe other algorithms as it uses additional data and is therefore not directly comparable. (Middle)Test accuracy (%) of ERM, SENTRY, DANN, SwAV (with various splits), and SwAV+ on BREEDS.
Table 2: Average separation error of Living-17 and DomainNet class-domain pairs. On both datasets,the classes become very distinguishable in the feature space learned by contrastive learning and onDomainNet, the domains additionally remain far apart in the pre-trained feature space. Classifiers weretrained on augmented images to distinguish class-domain pairs as a proxy for connectivity (higherseparation errors suggest greater connectivity).

Table 4: Cosine similarity of class and domain classifiers trained on SwAV representations (averageover all classes). Class classifiers trained on the source and target individually learn similar linearweights, evidenced by the cosine similarity in the range 0.13 to 0.33. However, domain classifierslearn linear weights that are nearly orthogonal to the class classifier weights, suggesting that SwAVpre-training learns features containing domain and class information in somewhat separate directions.
