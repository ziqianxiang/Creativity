Table 1: Comparison on constrained improvement of penalized LogP of specific moleculesFigure 3: Distribution of penalized LogPFigure 3 shows the distribution of how much penalized LogP has improved compared to the originalmolecules. The penalized LogP of molecules was maximized, and the distribution shifted from rightto left. In the case of the δ ≥ 0.4, it can be seen that the distribution of penalized LogP is more6Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2022skewed to the right than δ ≥ 0.6 because the structural restriction is lower. In Figure 4, moleculeswith maximized penalized LogP were visualized while maintaining structural constraints.
