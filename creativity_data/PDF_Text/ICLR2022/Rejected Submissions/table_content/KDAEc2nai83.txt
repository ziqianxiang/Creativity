Table 1: Measured runtimes for DQN with/without concurrent training and/or synchronized execution asthe number of sampling threads is varied. We report the mean and standard deviation over five trials(units: hours). All variants were evaluated on the same single-GPU system (see Section 5.1).
Table 2: Mean runtimes from Table 1 expressed asa percentage of DQN’s mean runtime.
Table 3: Mean runtimes from Table 1 expressed asthe speedup relative to DQN’s mean runtime.
Table 5: DQN hyperparameters for all experiments.
