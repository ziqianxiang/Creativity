Table 1: Evaluation results for MergeBERT and various neural baselines calculated for merge conflictsin TypeScript programming language test set. The table shows top-1 precision, recall, and F-scoremetrics.
Table 2: Comparison of MergeBERT to JDime and jsFSTMerge semi-structured merge tools. Thetable shows top-1 precision, recall, F-score of merge resolution synthesis, fraction of merge conflictsan approach generated resolutions for, and percentage of syntactically correct predictions. JDimeevaluation is on a Java data set and jsFSTMerge is on a JavaScript data set.
Table 3: Detailed evaluation results for monolingual and multilingual MergeBERT models, as well aszero-shot performance on an unseen language. The table shows precision, recall, F-score of mergeresolution synthesis, and percentage of syntactically correct predictions. Top: monolingual models,bottom: multilingual.
Table 4: Number of merge conflicts in the dataset.
Table 5: Evaluation results for MergeBERT and the model variant without edit-type embedding formerge conflicts in TypeScript programming language test set. The table shows top-1 precision, recall,and F-score metrics.
