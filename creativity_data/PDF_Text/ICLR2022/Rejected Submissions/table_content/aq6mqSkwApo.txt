Table 1: 5-way few-shot image classification comparisons on miniImageNet and tieredImageNetwith 95% confidence intervals. We conduct experiments with both shallow (Conv-4) and deep(ResNet-12) networks and compare the performance with various state-of-the-art methods. * de-notes performance obtained with leveraging query samples.
Table 2: Results on cross-domain few-shot image classification with the Conv-4 backbone, and 5-way few-shot image classification on the CUB dataset with both shallow and deep backbones. 1denotes performance obtained with leveraging query samples.

It is clearly shown that this task-specificadaptation plays crucial role when learning novel tasks.
