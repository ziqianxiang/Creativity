The lower values of d taken here in comparison to those takenfor the Cloudinary data set are due to this data set being easier to predict — indeed, the practices ofindividuals as recorded in the bike-share data set are simpler and more predictable than those of theclients in the Cloudinary data set, which are usually large companies of many users. This is alsothe reason we sufficed here with only a single experiment, utilizing the most advances (nine layer)model. The results are reported in Table 4.
