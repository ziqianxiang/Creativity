In particular, under the same data splitting setting described in Section 4.1, we choose to samplethe trajectories with different time intervals {10-2,1.5 ∙ 10-3, 5 ∙ 10-4,3 ∙ 10-4}, correspondingto 150, 1000, 3000 and 5000 training labels, respectively. The time interval of the test set remainsthe same as before (i.e., 10-3). Note that we avoid introducing new trajectories into the datasetbecause it may influence the problem complexity of the original interpolation and extrapolation
