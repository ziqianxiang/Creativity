Table 1: KD test accuracy comparison on CIFAR-100 when using different DA schemes. Each experiment is run 3 times and the mean and (standard deviation) are reported. De- fault DA: random crop and flip. Note (1) KD+CutMix is much worse than KD alone on Res56/Res20; (2) KD+TLCutMix consistently outperforms KD+CutMix on all the 3 pairs.	Table 2: KD test accuracy compari- son on CIFAR-100 when using different data picking schemes for the proposed “KD+TLCutMix+pick” method. “T/S” refers to teacher/student, “ent.” is short for entropy, and “kld” stands for KL divergence. The mean and (std) of 3 runs are reported for each entry.
Table 3: Student test accuracy comparison on CIFAR-100. Each result is obtained by 3 randomruns, mean (Std) accuracy reported. The best results are in bold and second best underlined. Thesubscript 960 means the total number of training epochs (default: 240).
Table 4: Student test accuracy comparison on Tiny ImageNet. Each result is obtained by 3 randomruns, mean (std) accuracy reported. The best results are in bold and second best underlined. Thesubscript 480 means the total number of training epochs (default: 480).

Table 9: Student test accuracy (standard deviation) of different KD methods on CIFAR-100 whenequipped with the proposed TLCutMix. The results of the different KD methods are directly citedfrom the CRD paper Table 7 (Tian et al., 2020) (where they did not report the standard deviation ofthe accuracies except for the original KD method (Hinton et al., 2014), so the standard deviation ofaccuracies of these methods are missing here as well). AT, CC, SP, PKT, and VID methods includethe original KD loss as part of their loss functions. Each our result is obtained by 3 random runs,mean (std) accuracy reported. Accuracy gains are colored in red (this table is best viewed in color).
