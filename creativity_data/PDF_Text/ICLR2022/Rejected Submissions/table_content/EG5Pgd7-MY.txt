Table 1: AUC Scores of all attacks on Purchase100 Dataset. Configurations Ia, Ib are trained on 2500 data-points, configurations IIa, IIb are trained on 5000 datapoints, and configurations III, IV are trained on 10000datapoints. Configurations Ib, IIb are trained using L2 regularization with regularization penalty 位 = 0.01.
Table 2: Agreement rate between ground truth (GT) membership values, and Attacks L, S, P, R, D for500 train and 500 test datapoints. The upper triangle of the table corresponds to the agreement ratesof train datapoints, whereas the lower triangle corresponds to the agreement rates of test datapoints.
Table 3: AUC Scores of all attacks on CIFAR10 Dataset. Configuration I is trained on 2500 datapoints, andconfiguration II is trained on 5000 datapoints. Configurations I and II are trained using AlexNet. ConfigurationIII is trained on 10000 datapoints using a 3-block VGGNet. Here we report the results of the attacks forConfigurations I and II using n = 400 (shadow, distilled, reference) models, and n = 30 for ConfigurationIII. All models have been trained using the SGD optimizer with momentum, and an L2 regularization penalty位 = 0.001.
