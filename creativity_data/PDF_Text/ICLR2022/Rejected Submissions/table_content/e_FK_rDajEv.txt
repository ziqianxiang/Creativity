(Sachs et al., 2005),there is some concern about the correctness of this graph and the different assumptions associatedwith the dataset (Mooij et al., 2020; Zemplenyi & Miller, 2021). Therefore, perfect identificationmay not be achievable by any method in practice in the Sachs setting.

All experiments are based on the framework DSDI.
