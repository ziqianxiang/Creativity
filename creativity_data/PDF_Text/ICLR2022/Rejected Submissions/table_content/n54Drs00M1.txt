Table 4: Comparing estimated affective meanings for “judge” as an identity and behavior.
Table 5: Correlation analysis for identities. (a) Correlation between estimated values (EA, EP, andEA) and the affective dictionary value (E, P, and A). We can also compare the correlation of thewords in the three dimensions shown in (b) and correlation of the estimated values of the threedimension shown in (c) to find how close the off-diagonal entries are in the estimation comparingto dictionary values.
