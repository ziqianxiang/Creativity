Table 1: Details of the datasets.
Table 2: Recommended models by MV, CV, andtest accuracy. The models in bold are the ground-truth ones whose decision boundaries match thedata patterns. The recommendation hit rate is 92%for MV, 53% for CV, 55% for test accuracy.
Table 4: Recommended hyperparameters across different runs. The third column shows the specificrecommended hyperparameters (we run the datasets 10 times); the last column shows the variance(the average of the squared differences from the Mean) across different runs. MV is more stable thanCV and test accuracy in recommending hyperparameters.
Table 5: Efficiency of MV, CV, and validation accuracy. The top/bottom sub-table shows the resultsfor classic/deep learning. We observe that the efficiency of MV is comparable to that of 3-fold CVand validation accuracy.
