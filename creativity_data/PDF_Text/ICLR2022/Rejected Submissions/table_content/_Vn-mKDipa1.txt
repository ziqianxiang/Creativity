Table 1: The tables show the WAPE/SMAPE test metrics for the M5, Tourism, and Favorita datasets,averaged over 10 runs. We present only the Mean metrics for the Tourism dataset due to lack ofspace. A complete set of results including the standard deviations can be found in Appendix B.6.
Table 2: We report the test WAPE/SMAPE metrics for an ablation study on the M5 dataset, for eachof the components in the HiReD model. We compare our model with two ablated variants: first, weremove the regularization (Î»E = 0), and second, we remove the BD component (TVAR only).
Table 3: Final model hyperparameters for various datasets tuned using the Mean WAPE metric on thevalidation set.
Table 4: WAPE/SMAPE test metrics for all the three datasets, averaged over 10 runs. The standarddeviations are shown in the parenthesis. We bold the smallest mean in each column and anything thatcomes within two standard deviations.
