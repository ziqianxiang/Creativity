Table 1: Clustering performance comparison on COIL20 and COIL100. Listed are error rates,NMCE is our method, see text for references for other methods.
Table 2: Supervised evaluation performance for different feature types and evaluation algorithms.
Table 3: Clustering performance comparisons. Clustering: clustering specific methods. SC: sub-space clustering methods. See text for details.
Table A.1: Result from synthetic experiment. Accuracy is in % (chance level is 50%), z-sim is theaverage absolute value of cosine similarity between feature vectors z for different pairs of z . TrueCluster: pairs of z are from different ground truth clusters. Found Clusters: pairs of z are from twodifferent found clusters. Within Cluster: pairs of z are randomly picked from the same found cluster,averaged between two found clusters.
Table A.2: Fine tuning backbone with NMCE objective. Results shown are from ResNet-18. Finetuning backbone improves result slightly but notably.
Table A.3: Effect of parameter λ.
Table B.1: Hyper-parameters for all experiments. lr: learning rate. wd: weight decay. : codingerror. dz : dimension of feature output. λ: regularization constant. bs: batch size. epochs (steps):total epochs trained, or total steps trained if the entire dataset is passed at once. S1, S2, S3 denote 3training stages.
