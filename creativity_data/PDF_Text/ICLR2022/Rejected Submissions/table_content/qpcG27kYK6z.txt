Table 1: ModelNet40 object classification overall accuracy, considering two types of rotations: z-axisaligned, and more general SO3 rotations. For example, SO3/SO3 indicates training and testing witharbitrary rotations of input data. Strategy refers to how rotations are handled. Number of parametersis in millions.
Table 2: Comparison of descriptors for resolving band energy from predicted density of states. Table2a shows overall error over test dataset. Table 2b further categorizes energy prediction error bystructure. CSGNN achieves lowest overall error, as well as lowest error in six out of eight structures.
Table 3: Ablation results in terms of SO3/SO3 accuracy on Modelnet40 dataset. KRC is radialconvolution kernel size. C to refers to concentric spheres grouped via input channels, while R refersto number of spheres represented spatially.
Table 4: Training and inference time comparison for ModelNet40 using batch size 32, while varyingthe number of spatial spheres. Training time reported is seconds per epoch, while inference time ismilliseconds per batch.
Table 5: Each carbon structure, and the number of atoms for each snapshot of the structure.
