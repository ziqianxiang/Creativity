Table 1: Summary of the errors of the various models over the various benchmarks (on out-of-sample testdata). Corresponding confidence intervals are available in Figure 14a in the appendix. In the model names, ”O”denotes optimized, ”E” denotes extended, and ”p” denotes polar, For example, OEKFp is an extended KF withpolar (spherical) representation of R and optimized parameters. For KFp, we also consider an oracle-realizationof R according to the true noise of the simulated radar in spherical coordinates (available only in sphericalbenchmarks). Note that (1) for any benchmark and any baseline, optimization yields lower errors than estimation;and (2) this remains true even in the oracle variant, where the noise ”estimation” is perfect.
