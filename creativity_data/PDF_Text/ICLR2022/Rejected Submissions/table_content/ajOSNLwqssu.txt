Table 1: Physical attributes of generated sequences. We use the percentage of peptides meeting therange to measure the performance. Uniq is the number of unique generated sequences. C, H, uHcorrespond to charge, hydrophobicity, hydrophobic moment described in Section 4.2.1. Combina-tion is the percentage satisfying three ranges at the same time. The best results are bold.
Table 2: The percentage of generated sequences being predicted as AMP. The classifiers are de-scribed in Section 4.2.2. The first part is the prediction results on AMP and non-AMP dataset as thereference. The bold ones are the best model results.
Table 3: Ablation Study on validation set ofDamp. ‘w/o’ means that we remove the mod-Ule from LSSAMP. J means lower is better,while ↑ means higher is better. The detaileddescriptions are in Section 4.3.
Table 4: The inflUence of the nUmber of code-books. ‘[1,2,4,8]’ indicates that we Use 4 code-books to captUre local featUres with windowsizes of 1,2,4,8. The meanings of symbols arethe same as Table 3.
Table 5: Ten generated peptides and their physical attributes and predicted structures. ‘H’ is theα-helix, ‘T’ is the Turn and ‘-’ is the coil.
Table 6: Physical attributes of sequences filtered by secondary structures. The notations are thesame with Table 1.
Table 7: The novelty of generated sequences.
Table 8: The mean and standard deviation of results on codebooks. The meanings of symbols arethe same as Table 4.
