Table 1: OOD detection for CIFAR-100 in-distribution dataset with ResNet-50 neural network. Thetop two results are shown in bold. Evaluation is done for three models trained with different seeds toestimate the standard deviation. Methods requiring a single pass over the data to compute uncertaintyestimates are marked with *.
Table 2: ROC-AUC score for ImageNet out-of-distribution detection tasks for different methods.
Table 3: Different types of kernels K(u) considered and corresponding values of the integralK (u)2 du.
Table 4: Comparison of DDU and NUQ predictions on different type of embeddings - logits (lastlayer) and features (second last layer).
Table 5: Probability density methods comparison - radial basis function kernel (RBF), logistic kernel,gaussian mixture models (GMM). ’f’ (Features) marks models, built on embeddings from a secondlast layer and ’l’ (logits) is for the ones built on embeddings from a last layer.
Table 6: Comparing the influence of spectral normalization on the model performance for OODdetection, ROC-AUC.
