Table 1: Evaluating RL algorithms using action matching. We evaluate FQI and NFQI on theirability to predict the clinicianâ€™s actions on test samples from the foreground (FG) and background(BG) datasets. We report accuracy (%) and F1 score across the three classes of repletion, both with95 % confidence intervals.
