Table 1: Rewards for the RL unit test. Note that the myopic defect action always increases rewardat the current time-step, but decreases reward at the next time-step - the incentive is hidden from thepoint of view of a myopic learner. A learner ‘fails’ the unit test if the hidden incentive to cooperateis revealed, i.e. if we see more cooperate (C) actions than defect (D).
Table 2: β controls the extent to which myopic and nonmyopic incentives are aligned.
