Table 1: Evaluation result for DoA task. For Segment-based evaluation, we report detection errorER20。, F measure F20。under DoA threshold 20。，and classification dependent localization errorLECD and localization recall LRCD. For event-based evaluation, we report mAP/mAR. The “Input”column labels are: 0. Raw waveform, 1. Log-MeL 2. GCC-Phat, 3. Intensity Vector.
Table 2: Ablation study report. Internally, we replace SELDNet, EIN and SoundDet head withSynPeriodic filter bank (denoted as _Synp). Externally, We test different modified SoundSynP versions.
Table 3: Physical location estimation result report. We set distance threshold 1.0m, which means adetected sound sources has to lie within this threshold in order to be treated true positive.
Table 4: SoundSynp neural network architecture. The layer follow name@kernelsize, strideformat, and synperiodic filter bank follow name@kernelsize, stride, groups format. FC is fullyconnection layer, AvgPool is the average pooling layer, MaxPool is max-pooling layer. B is the batch-size, T is input waveform time-length. All convolution layers are followed by a batch normalizationlayer and Relu activation layer. We represent the neural network architecture on FOA recordingformat with sampling rate 24k Hz and label resolution 100 ms. It can be easily adjusted to fit othercases. Please note that since the backbone neural network has two identical branches, we just showone branch here._________________________________________________________layer	filter num	output size	Input: [B,4,T]			Synperiodic Filter Bank Groups		SynPeriOdiCFilterBank@1024,600,3	256	[B, 256,T/600, 21]Backbone Conv block1		Conv2d@3,1	128	[B, 256, T/600, 128]Conv2d@3,1	128	—	[B, 256, T/600, 128]AvgPool@2,1	None	[B,128, T/600,128]一Backbone Conv block2		Conv2d@3,1	256	[B, 128, T/600, 256]Conv2d@3,1	256	—	[B, 128, T/600, 256]AvgPool@2,1	None	[B, 64, T/600, 256] 一
