Table 1: Comparisons on linear unit tests in terms of mean square error (regression, 1) in Example1/1s and classification error (classification, 1) in Examples 2/2s and 3/3s. The highlighted result perexample demonstrates the best performance. When #Envs=6, we do not report results on Example1/1s, since even the oracle cannot obtain stable results across different data seeds.
Table 2: Classification accuracy (↑) on MNIST-type datasets. Notice that the proposed Twins-ERMand Twins-IRM exhibit the best performance outperforming previous methods by a significant margin.
