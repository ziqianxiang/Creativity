Table 1: Training RL with SAFER, we give the mean Â± SD success rate and cumulative safetyviolations across different tasks and initializations. SAFER produces the lowest cumulative safetyviolations throughout training and outperforms the baseline methods in terms of success rate. Meth-ods without the use of a behavioral prior, namely SAC, are not able to learn during training (of50, 000 steps). These results demonstrate SAFER is highly effective at encouraging safe learning.
