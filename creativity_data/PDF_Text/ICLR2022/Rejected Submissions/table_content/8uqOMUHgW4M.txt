Table 1: Sherlock within-subject manifold classification. Within each subjectâ€™s data, a latent spacewas learned on one half of the data and extended to the held-out timepoints. A support vector classifierwas trained/tested on the latent representation of the unseen timepoints with 5-fold cross validationto predict features of the movie stimulus. The mean and standard deviation of test accuracy acrosssubjects and folds were reported. MRMD-AE outperformed all comparison methods suggestingefficient manifold extension to new time points and better preservation of factors from the stimulus.
Table 2: Forrest within-subject manifold classification. For Flow of Time and Time of Dayclassifications, latent spaces were learned on one half of the movie timepoints and then extended tothe held-out timepoints. For the Localizer classification, latent spaces were trained on the entiretyof the movie watching dataset and then extended to the localizer dataset, which was collected in aseparate session. Results are reported as the average and standard deviation across subjects and crossvalidation folds.
