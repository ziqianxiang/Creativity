Table 1: Test accuracy obtained using GD/GD+M on a Gaussian synthetic dataset trained using neural networkwith ReLU activations. The training dataset consists in 500 data points in dimension 30 and test set in 5000points. The student networks are trained for 1000 epochs to ensure zero training error. The results are averagedover 3 runs and we only report the mean (see Appendix for complete table).
