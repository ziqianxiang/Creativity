Table 1: A summary of common f -divergences. KL: Kullback-Leibler; JS: Jensen-Shannon; andSH: Squared Hellinger. ForJS, We define 夕(U) = -(U + 1) log 1++u + U log u. For the Pearson χ2,We take f *(t) = -1 if t ≤ -2. The Tsallis-α divergence is defined in Tsallis (1988) and we haveα > 1 for f -divergences. The Vincze-Le Cam (VLC) divergence can be found in Le Cam (2012,p.47), Which is closely related to the Pearson χ2 and Hellinger divergences. For the Vincze-Le Camdivergence we require -3 <t < 1 and f *(t) = -1 if t ≤ -3.
Table 2: Test classification accuracy (%) on the vision datasets. For the Wikipedia dataset weevaluate the semantic textual similarity (STS) via the Spearman’s correlation. For ImageNet wetrain for 100 epochs with batch size 256 due to computation limit. See Appendix C for detailedexperimental settings.

Table 4: A summary of common f -divergences. KL: Kullback-Leibler; JS: Jensen-Shannon; SH:Squared Hellinger. For JS, We define 夕(U) = -(U + 1) log 1+u + U log u. For Pearson χ2, Wetake f (t) = -1 if t ≤ -2. For Jeffrey, C = W + W-1 and W(∙) is the Lambert-W product logfunction. The Tsallis-α divergence is defined in Tsallis (1988) and We have α > 1 for f -divergences.
