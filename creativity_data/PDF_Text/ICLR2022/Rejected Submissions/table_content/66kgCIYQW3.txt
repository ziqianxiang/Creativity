Table 1: Inclusion and exclusion rules for candidate concepts.
Table 2: The number of concepts extracted by the Concept Discovery module from the explanationcorpus after every phase.
Table 3: Performance of Models. The full table can be found in Appendix A.7.
Table 4: Ablation Studies: Shows the effect of each step in CODEX on model performancestrained models, on both datasets. We also find that the addition of the attention layer improves theconcept prediction of the models. Table 3 shows that concept bottleneck models achieved comparabletask accuracy to standard black-box models on both tasks, despite the bottleneck constraint whileachieving high concept prediction performance. Appendix A.7 shows the performance with otherfeature extractors.

This resultindicates that the concepts extracted are meaningful for the classification task and there’s still anheadroom available if the concept bottleneck network was able to predict these initial concepts better.
