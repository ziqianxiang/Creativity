Table 1: Performance on downstream fairness, as measured by maximumgroup-wise MCE (lower is better). Experimental settings as described inSection 5.3. Mean and standard deviations are computed over 60 randomseeds for setting 1, and 20 for settings 2 and 3. Best results are bold.
Table 2: Pearson correlation between max group-wiseMCE and other calibration metrics (higher is better).
Table 3: Performance on global calibration metrics, formatted as meansd. Lower is better. Experimental settingsas described in Section 5.3. Best results are bold. Across all settings, LoRe generally achieves a globalcalibration error that is comparable to the baselines.
