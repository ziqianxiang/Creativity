The proposed methodsSO-DATA and FO-DATA are evaluated, and compared with Roth et al. (2019) in Riverraid, Road-Runner, Alien, Seaquest, Boxing, Pong, and Robotank games. More results for different FPR valuesare reported in the supplementary material.

Thus theabove optimization problem attempts to find adversarial examples with as small values of L(s) aspossible. Since the function L(s) involves taking the sign of the gradient, we use Backwards PassDifferentiable Approximation (BPDA) as introduced in Carlini & Wagner (2017b) to compute thegradients. However, we also tried designing an adversary with a fully differentiable cost functionby using a perturbation in the gradient direction (without the sign). We found that this fully dif-ferentiable adversary performed significantly worse than the one based on BPDA. We conductedexhaustive grid search over all the parameters in this optimization method: learning rate, iterationnumber, confidence parameter κ, and objective function parameter λ. In C&W we used up to 30000iterations to find adversarial examples to bypass detection methods. We searched the confidenceparameter from 0 to 50, the learning rate from 0.001 to 0.1, and λ from 0.001 to 10. In our gridsearch over these hyperparameters we found that there is a trade-off between the attack success rate
