In this section, we discuss and explain theseobservations, both empirically and theoretically. We explain why an analysis of the LFL can offerunique insights into the understanding of loss functions. Different characteristics of such a functionmay be important, and studying the LFL can help to choose an appropriate loss function. We alsoprovide a comparison of the different AUC surrogates.
