Table 1: Performance comparisons of different methods. The best score is in bold in each row, andthe second best is underlined.
Table 2: Performance comparison w.r.t. the variants of CL4SRec (CL4S.) and SRMA. M and Ddenote the model augmentation and data augmentation, respectively. p = 0 indicates no neuronmasking. The best score in each column are in bold, where the second-best are underlined.
Table 3: Performance comparison among SRMA without encoder complementing (w/o Enc.), withTransformer-based (-Trans) and with GRU-based (-GRU) complementary pre-trained encoder. Thebest score in each column is in bold.
