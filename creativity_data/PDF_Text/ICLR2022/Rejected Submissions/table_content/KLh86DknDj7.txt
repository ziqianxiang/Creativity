Table 1: The performances of Random Forest (RF), AdaBoost (ADA) as well as Rule Extraction applied toRF and ADA - denoted as RUX-RF and RUX-ADA. In the table, ACC., # RULES, and RULE LEN. stand foraccuracy, number of rules and rule length, respectively. The first value in each cell gives the mean, whereas thevalue in parenthesis gives the standard deviation.

Here, ACC., # RULES, and RULE LEN. stand for accuracy, number of rules, and rule length,respectively. The first value in each cell gives the mean, whereas the value in parenthesis gives the standarddeviation.
