Table 1: Time consuming and accuracy on MNIST and SVHN. Column 3-9 corresponds to variousstatistical accuracy(%). ? denotes that We repeat DHPO 10 times, and f represents a once DHPOwith three repeated independent experiments. BLANK corresponds to the blank group without anyhyper-parameter optimization by setting all the channel size to 8 and set all the kernel size to 3.
