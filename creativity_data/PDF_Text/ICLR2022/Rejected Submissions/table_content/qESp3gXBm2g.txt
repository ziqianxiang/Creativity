We found that training time for TRAKR is situated at the lower end of thespectrum, slower than it takes to obtain a measure of the distance between two traces using DTW,MI or Euc, but significantly faster than it takes to train the MLP or twiESN. While it does requireupfront fitting, our approach has the advantage that it does not require multiple rounds of optimiza-tion (like MLP or twiESN) because the signal is fit in one shot (see subsection 2.2 for details). Thisyields relatively fast training time.
