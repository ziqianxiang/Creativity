Table 1: Generalization performance of our framework with ground truth navigation (denotedGT navi.) inserted together with different types of pose perturbations. For reference, we alsoinclude results from HLSM Blukis et al. (2021), the previous state-of-the-art method on ALFRED.
Table 2: Performance on valid & test unseen data from ALFRED. Our method achieves newstate-of-the-art results with a substantial improvement over previously published methods.

Table 5: Success rates (%) of all 7 object interaction subgoals evaluated on valid unseen datain ALFRED. Overall, our method (object interaction transformer) generalizes better than E.T.+.
