We formulate our network usingPressure-Velocity coupling. The spatial and temporal co-ordinates of the domain are input whileinstantaneous pressure and velocity fields are output. We use the initial and boundary conditionsas supervised data-driven parts, while residual of the Navier-Stokes and Burgers equations as theunsupervised part in the loss function while training our network. We propose a more robust lossfunction to handle both the boundary conditions as well as initial conditions. We test the performanceour network using RMSE, divergence and TKE as the evaluation metrics. We demonstrate ourdesigned network is more robust while modelling the complex flow physics. In the future, we wouldlike to study the effect of attention mechanism for solving compressible and steady Navier StokesEquations.
