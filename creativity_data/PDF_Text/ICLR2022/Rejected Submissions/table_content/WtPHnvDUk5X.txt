Each font contains6,763 Chinese characters. We randomly selected 405 fonts as the training set and theremaining 6 fonts as the test set. Various metrics are used to evaluate the quality of thesynthesized glyphs. To measure the similarity between the generated image and the target,intersection over union(IOU) is utilized. We further employ two classifiers with Inception-v3
