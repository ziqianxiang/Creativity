Table 1: Summary of experimental work. All architectures include batch normalization layers fol-lowed by ReLU activations. Models are initialized using Kaiming normal scheme (fan-avg) andoptimized by SGD (momentum 0.9) with a stepwise LR schedule (10 Ã— drop factor applied on spec-ified drop epochs). The categorical cross-entropy loss function is used for all models.
