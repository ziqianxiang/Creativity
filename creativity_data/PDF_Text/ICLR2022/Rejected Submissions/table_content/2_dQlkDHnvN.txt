Table 1: Overview of noisy-label defending algorithms, which achieve robustness against up to 45%of pairwise flipping label noises.
Table 2: Performance on CIFAR 1 0. is the corruption rate.
Table 3: Performance on CIFAR 1 00. is the corruption rate.
Table 4: Ablation study on CIFAR10. is the corruption rate.
Table 5: Ablation study on CIFAR 1 00. is the corruption rate.
Table 7: Comparison of averaged performance across three random seed with other baselines onCIFAR10. The numbers are clean accuracy/poison accuracy. Note fine-pruning used 5% clean datadataset has almost binary feature value. When adding a small gaussian noise on feature x, the labelflipping attack cannot change the decision boundary much. That is why the noisy label algorithmseems is not as important as the noisy label algorithm in CIFAR dataset. We plot a two dimensionaltoy example in figure 3 to illustrate label flipping attack on continuous features and binary features.
Table 8: PRL-AT top 1 averaged accuracy across three random seeds. The first number is the cleanaccuracy while the second number is the poisoned accuracy. The is fixed to be 0.5.
