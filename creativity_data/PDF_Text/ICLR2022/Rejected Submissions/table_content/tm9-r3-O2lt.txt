Table 1: Correlations of memorability scores of square-shaped and oval-shaped faces. High corre-lation score suggests the assessor performs well on square faces too.
Table 2: Accuracy of the separating hyperplane, based on the method for dividing images intohighly-memorable and low-memorable images, the shape of the images, and the assessor.
Table 3: Memorability scores of the models pre-trained on face recognition (on VGGFaces database)and fine-tuned on 10K US face database. Note that all these computational models, produce largerSpearmanâ€™s rank correlation score when true hit rate scores are used.
Table 4: Accuracy of the separating hyperplane, based on the method for dividing images into high-memorable and low memorable images, the shape of the images, and the assessor. In this case latentspace (R512) is used to find the separating hyperplane. We can observe that the accuracy of thehyperplane is lower than the case when extended latent space is used.
Table 5: Accuracy of the separating hyperplane, based on the weights of the generator.
