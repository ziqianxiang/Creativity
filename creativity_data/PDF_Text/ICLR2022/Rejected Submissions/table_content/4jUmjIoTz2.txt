Table 6: the accuracy using different model structuresdepth	2	8	14	20single model	65.0	88.3	90.5	91.9collaboration	67.0	89.5	91.6	92.5gain	2.0	1.2	0.9	0.6From the Table 6, with the depth 2, the model has the insufficient model capacity to learn the featureextractor, collaboration can have a relatively large improvement (2.0). As the depth of the model is20, the model has sufficient model capacity to fit all data samples. Collaboration achieves a slightimprovement compared with a single model (0.6).
Table 7: the accuracy (%) on the clean dataCDA2	sub-model A sub-model B sub-model A85.6	83.9	84.2	83.9To experimentally verify this claim, we present the accuracies on clean data of all three sub-modelswith adversarial training ( = 0.02) in the Table 7. From the Table 7, all sub-models have a similarperformance on the clean data.
