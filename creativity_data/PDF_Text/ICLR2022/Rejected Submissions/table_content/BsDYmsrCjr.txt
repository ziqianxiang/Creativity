Table 1: CNNMnist, 8 clients, simulated LAN networkIn Table 1, we detail the time in seconds each part of the FL process takes for both the pairwise com-parison based median method, and our proposed bucketed median method. The bucketed methodhad the additional overhead on client and server side of converting to and from a bucketed format,and this takes around 5 seconds per transformation for a CNNMnist model. The time for bothmethods are dominated by the two server secure computation of median. We see that the pairwisecomparison based median FL system increases by a factor of 17.5, and the bucketed median FLsystem increases by a factor of 5.5.
