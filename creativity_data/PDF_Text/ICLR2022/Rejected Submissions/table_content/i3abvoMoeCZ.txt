Table 1: AUROC ↑ for Near and Far OOD detection. Results are averaged over 5 runs. Ourα(x)-only model is the same as Generalized ODIN (Hsu et al., 2020) (hI (x) variant) without itsinput processing. Hyper-free (Techapanurak et al., 2019) and Generalized ODIN (hC (x) variant)are the same. * denotes results from Mukhoti et al. (2021).
Table 2: Calibration on CIFAR10 averaged over 5 seed. f denotes results from LiU et al. (2020a).
Table 3: Calibration on CIFAR100 averaged over 5 seeds. f denotes results from Liu et al. (2020a).
Table 4: CIFAR100 Concept Shift Splits Small group numbers indicate less conceptual similarityto CIFAR10 classes. The similarity is calculated using inner product between the Glove embeddingsof a CIFAR100 class and a CIFAR10 class. For each CIFAR100 class, the largest similarity to eachCIFAR10 class is taken as the overall similarity to CIFAR10. The average shows average similarityto CIFAR10 and the standard deviation shows in-group variance.
