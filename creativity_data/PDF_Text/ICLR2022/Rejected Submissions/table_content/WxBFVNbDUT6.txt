Table 1: List of proposed metrics. Depending on if the value is fixed during training, we divide theminto static and dynamic metrics. Some metrics are more computationally expensive, i.e., requiring adynamics model or behavior policy.
Table 2: Performance of different priority metrics in the D4RL datasets. We report the averagenormalized score over the final 10 evaluations over 3 seeds (Â± standard deviation).
Table 3: Quantile number of the pseudo-count of each state-action pair in the offline dataset.
