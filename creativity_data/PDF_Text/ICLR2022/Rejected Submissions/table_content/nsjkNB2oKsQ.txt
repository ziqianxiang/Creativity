Table 1: Contribution of our algorithm in different problem settings. Notice that MDP is a degradedcase of DRMDP, which has signal interval length fixed as 1.
Table 2: Relative average performance in tasks with different signal interval length distribution qnover 4 environments: Hopper-v2, HalfCheetah-v2, Walker2d-v2, Ant-v2. δ(x) refers to a fixedinterval length as x and U (a, b) refers a uniform distribution in range [a, b]. All results show themean of 6-7 seeds and NA refers to no result due to limited computation resources.
