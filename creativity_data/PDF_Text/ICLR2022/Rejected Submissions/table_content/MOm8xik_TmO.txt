Table 1: Variational Sampling. Example sentence (in bold) wasused as input to the VAT, with the decoded mean representationand samples from the latent distribution (in italics).
Table 3: Interpolation. First andlast sentence (in bold) were givenas input to the VAT. Intermedi-ate sentences were obtained bytoken-wise linear interpolation be-tween the two latent representa-tions padded to the same length.
Table 2: Variational Sampling. Example sentence (in bold) thatwas used as input to the VAT, with only the underlined tokenbeing sampled. Samples from the latent distribution in italics.
Table 4: Spearman rank correlation between the cosine similarity of sentence representations andgold label similarity for different semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks without fine-tuning theunderlying models to the target data.
Table 5: Dev/test accuracies on the SentEval transfer classification tasks. A single dense layer withnonlinear activation and Adam optimizer is used as classification layer. Bold values indicate the besttest result for each task in the feature-based and fine-tuning approach.
