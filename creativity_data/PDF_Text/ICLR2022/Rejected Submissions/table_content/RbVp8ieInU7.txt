We can see this fromthe problem formulation in (13), where the cost matrix C(∙)can be constructed in other ways as long as itis a function ofapermutation. Typically, M3O can be used to solve a challeng-ing face image recovery problem. The original face imagewith size 180 × 180 in Figure 4(a) comes from the Extend YaleB database (Georghiades et al., 2001). The corrupted imageis visualized in Figure 4(b), where the pixel blocks with size30 × 30 in the upper left are shuffled randomly, and 30% of thetotal pixels are removed. This kind of problem is recently con-
