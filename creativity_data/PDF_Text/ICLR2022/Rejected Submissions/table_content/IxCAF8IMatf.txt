Table 1: FID of different methods after learning new distributions on CelebA dataset. Columns Oldshow FID between the generated images and real images on old distribution. A(+B) denotes thatFID is increased by B to A after learning new distributions. Columns New illustrate FID betweengenerated images and real images on new distributions. FID and (+B): lower is better.

(2016). The DGM structure of its generative model (decoder) is shown in Fig. 6(a).
