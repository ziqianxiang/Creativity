Table 1: TextWorld games statistics (averaged across all games within a difficulty level). The gamesand statistics are generated by (Adhikari et al., 2020).
Table 2: Discovered abstract supporting edges of the “cut” action type in difficulty level 1 ofTextWorld environments. The importance of each edge is computed by the metric mentioned inSec 4.4.2. The right column gives an example action and the corresponding supporting edge set,which is obtained by instantiating the abstract supporting edge set. The underlined words are abstractnames for some certain words. For example, “verb” in action can be instantiated to “slice”, “dice” or“chop”，and "verb_passive” can be instantiated to “sliced”, “diced” or “chopped” accordingly.
Table 3: Evaluation results on both training environments and test environment in TextWorld. Thenumbers show the agent’s normalized scores.
Table 4: Robustness analysis of our method and vanilla RL baseline. We evaluate the performanceof agents on training environments under different noise levels, e.g., “add 0.2 drop 0.03” meanswe randomly add 20% additional edges while randomly dropping 3% existing edges in graph. Thenumbers out of parentheses are normalized scores and the numbers in parentheses are relativeperformance change comparing to the performance without input noise. The bold numbers indicatewhich method performs better in each setting.
