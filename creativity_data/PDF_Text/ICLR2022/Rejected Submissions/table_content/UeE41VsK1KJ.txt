Table 1: Results of OSL and the baselines on open-ended classification tasks. We report subjectiveand model errors on Number (Num) and Color (Col) domains of Colored MNIST, Gender (Gen),Category (Cat) and Color (Col) domains of Fashion Product Images, and Superclass (Sup) andClass (Cla) domains of CIFAR-100 respectively.
Table 2: Results of OSL on multi-dimensional regression task on gas sensor array under dynamicgas mixtures dataset. We report RMSE on each domain and the macro-average RMSE over bothdomains.
Table 3: Results of OSL on simulated concept shift classification task. We report subjective andmodel errors on both domains.
Table 4: Wall-clock training and inference time of OSL and baselines on the Fashion Product Imagesdataset. The training time of ProbCon, Pseodu-L, LabelProp and OSL is measured over 50 epochs,and the training time of Full-L and Full-T is measured over 10 epochs. The inference time of allmethods is measured using an average over 3,000 test samples.
