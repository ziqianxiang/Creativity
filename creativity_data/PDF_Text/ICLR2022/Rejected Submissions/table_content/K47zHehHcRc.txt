Table 2: Average self consistency under posterior,hybrid and uniform sampling for AE (left), XAE(middle) and XCAE (right). The average is takenover the latent dimension for the S MNIST mod-els.
Table 1: Sparsity levels per varying latentsize. The right column records the percent-age of edges in the Xblock over the set ofpossible connections based on the learnedmask.
Table 3: Overview of the architecture variants. The Depth entry refers to the number of convolutionallayers employed in the encoder. The decoder has depth equal to that of the encoder.
Table 4: Number of trainable parameters for all the models in the experiments. The ’XC’ modelvariants have the same size as the ’X’ variants and thus are not reported in this table. The trainingtime varies between 3 hours (for the smaller models) to 2 days (for the bigger ones, with consistencytraining).
