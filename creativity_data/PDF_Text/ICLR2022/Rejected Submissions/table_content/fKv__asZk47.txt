Table 1: Top: performance comparison of different metrics for 3D data via the SRCC, where valuescloser to 1 indicate a better reconstruction of the ground truth distances. Bold+underlined valuesshow the best method for each data set, bold values are within a 0.01 margin of the best performing.
Table 2: Performance comparison of further ablation study models via the SRCC. Shown are amodel trained with ground truth distances where the proposed logarithmic similarity model was re-placed with an identity transformation (top block), and two models without a multiscale architecture(middle and bottom block). The upper row in each block is the corresponding baseline.
