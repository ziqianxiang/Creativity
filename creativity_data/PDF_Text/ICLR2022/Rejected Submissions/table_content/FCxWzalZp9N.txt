Table 1: Experiments on 3 aerial imagery datasets. For iSAID val set, we show the mIoU scoreand the category with a significant improvement, such as: baseball court (BC), large vehicle (LV),helicopter (HC), swimming pool (SP) and roundabout (RA). All the experiments use ResNet-50 withweights pretrained on ImageNet as backbone for fair comparison except HRNet (Sun et al., 2019).

The foreground ratio means foreground pixels proportion of the current pixelsets (i e Klabelij is fg. | (Oj)∈Vι}k)Method	r	Prediction Ratio (%) level-4 level-3 level-2			Foreground Rat level-4 level-3		io (%) level-2	mIoU (%)AFPN	-	-	-	100	-	-	3.3	63.3AF2-AFPN	0.9	2.2	1.8	96.0	3.3	3.5	3.6	65.4AF2-AFPN	0.7	9.7	16.3	74.0	3.3	3.8	4.3	65.8AF2-AFPN	0.5	32.7	41.2	26.0	3.3	4.7	8.8	66.4AF2-AFPN	0.3	73.7	20.0	6.3	3.3	8.8	27.6	67.4AF2-AFPN	0.1	91.4	7.0	1.6	3.3	22.7	41.3	64.7Hierarchical Features Extractor with Different Neural Architectures. In this experiment, weaim to evaluate the extendibility and flexibility of the proposed AF2 in terms of feature extraction.

Table 6: Experimental results on iSAID val set. The bold values in each column represent thebest entries. The category are defined as: ship (Ship), storage tank (ST), baseball diamond (BD),tennis court (TC),baseball court (BC), ground field track (GTF), bridge (Bridge), large vehicle (LV),small vehicle (SV), helicopter (HC), swimming pool (SP), roundabout (RA), soccerball field (SBF),plane (Plane), harbor (Harbor). All the models are trained under the same setting following theFarSeg(Zheng et al., 2020) and PointFlow (Li et al., 2021).
Table 7: Experimental results on the Vaihingen Dataset. The results are reported with single scaleinput. The bold values in each column represent the best entries. The category are defined as:impervious surfaces (Imp.surf.), buildings (Build), low vegetation (Low veg), trees (Tree), cars(Car), cluster/background (Cluster). All the models are trained under the same setting following thePointFlow (Li et al., 2021).
