Table 1: Datasets used for benchmarking.
Table 2: RMSE scores (lower is better) in (a) SED and (b) Ged. Genn-A* does not scale ongraphs beyond 10 nodes and hence the results in IMDB are not reported.
Table 3: Kendall’s tau scores (higher is better).
Table 4: Running times of all methods in seconds per 10k pair (lower is better).
Table 5: (a) Querying time (s) for Sed in the three largest datasets. L-Scan indicates time takenby linear scan in NeuroSed (times differs based on whether executed on a CPU or in GPU).
Table 6: Frequently used symbolsPROOF. The node map π in the above proof contains only non-insert operations. So, S in the aboveproof is a subgraph of G1 ignoring node and edge labels. Since equality holds in Lemma 3, this πgives an optimal edit distance. Thus, S in the above proof is also a nearest subgraph to G1 in G2 .
Table 7: MAE scores (lower is better) in (a) Sed and (b) Ged.
Table 8: R2 scores (higher is better, 1 is maximum) in (a) Sed and (b) Ged.
Table 10: Ablation studies: GIN vs others. RMSE produced by different methods are shownand NeuroSed with Gin produces the best results.
Table 9: Querying time (s) for Sed in the three largest datasets. L-Scan indicates time takenby linear scan in NeuroSed (times differs based on whether executed on a CPU or in GPU).
Table 11: Ablation studies: sum-pool vs others. The sum-pool is the best choice among theconsidered alternatives.
Table 12: The average running times in seconds per top-10 query. Our technique is much fasterthan MIP-F2 alignment.
Table 13: RMSE of prediCtion quality. NeuroSed-50 indiCates NeuroSed trained on a datasetContaining queries of size up to 50. NEUROSED-25 is defined analogously.
