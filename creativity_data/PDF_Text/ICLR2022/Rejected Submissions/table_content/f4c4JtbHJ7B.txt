Table 1: #COPIn Figure 4, (b)-(d) indicate which part of the input image the specific channels of the activationtensor focus on (Masking input image with upsampled channels.). Channel (b) is focusing onlyon the target part, channel (c) is focusing on both the target and non-target part and channel (d) isfocusing only on the non-target part. We investigated the weights for channels (b)-(d), and it wasconfirmed that Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, Score-CAM, Ablation-CAM, and XGrad-CAM all gavehigh weights to channels (b) and (c) and low weights to channel (d). In other words, regardlessof whether a specific channel contains a non-target part or not, as long as it contains a target part,that channel tends to be given a high weight. However, since channel-wise weight-based methodsassign one weight per channel, all pixels in the channel share a single weight. As a result, for achannel like (c), pixels in the non-target part are also given a high weight. As shown in Appendix A,these channels are commonly found in the activation tensor. Since the explanation map of previousmethods is generated by a linear combination of channels, if the number of channels with overes-timated pixels(COP) increases, the overestimated pixels also appear in the explanation map. Theseoverestimated pixels suppress other pixels, so the explanation map may highlight the wrong placesor only part of the target. Table 1 shows the average number of channels focusing on both the targetand non-target part among the channels with the top 100 weights(Inception V3 has 2048 channels).

Increase in Confidence (IIC)(Chattopadhay et al., 2018) measures whetherthe part that confuses correct decisions in the image has been sufficiently removed. Compactness isthe metric proposed for the first time in this paper to measure how large the area the explanation mapoccupies in an image. An ideal explanation map should be of a suitable size to cover the target com-Pactly. Compactness is expressed as N PN=1(Pα Pb Lc(a b)), where Lc(a b)is the explanationmap value at spatial location (a, b) for the i-th input Xi and N is the number of evaluation images.
