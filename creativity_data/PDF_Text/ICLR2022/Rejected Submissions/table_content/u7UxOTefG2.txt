Table 1: Empirical risk, KL divergence, PAC bound (Î´ = 0.01)and log marginal likelihood for the examples shown in Fig. 6.
Table S1: GP regression on SplitMNIST tasks. We perform GP regression on a single SplitMNISTtask using the kernels reported in the first column (entries show mean and standard deviation whenusing different SplitMNIST tasks for training). AUROC values are computed when consideringthe test data from all remaining SplitMNIST tasks as OOD data, or by taking the test data ofFashionMNIST as OOD.
