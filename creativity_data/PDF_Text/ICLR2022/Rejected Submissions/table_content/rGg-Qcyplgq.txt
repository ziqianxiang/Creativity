Table 1: Mean and median of best scores across 55 Atari games on 50M frames, measured as Per-centages of human baseline (Castro et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2019; Quan & Ostrovski, 2020)Table 1 Provides the mean and median human normalized scores across 55 Atari games. Due tothe high comPutational cost, our algorithm was evaluated on 50M frames to Provide results over asmany environments as Possible. It is observed that PQR shows better Performance in terms of bothmean and median metrics than QR-DQN. Since our method is based on QR-DQN, we would exPectthat PDBOO can be combined with IQN (Dabney et al., 2018a) or techniques in Rainbow (Hesselet al., 2018) as an efficient exPloration method, and the Performance can be further imProved. Sinceourmethod is based on QR-DQN, PDBOO can be combined with IQN (Dabney et al., 2018a) orthe techniques in Rainbow (Hessel et al., 2018), such as double q-learning, n-steP uPdates, duelingnetworks and Prioritized exPerience rePlay. We would exPect that PQR for efficient exPlorationwould benefit from the additional imProvement of Performance as IQN and Rainbow outPerformQR-DQN.
