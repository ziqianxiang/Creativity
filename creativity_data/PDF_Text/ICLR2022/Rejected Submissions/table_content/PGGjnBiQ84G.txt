Table 1: Comparison with (Das et al., 2019) on syntheticscenes: all views refers to the mean error metric on all sceneimages, best view refers to the lowest possible error from animage in a scene.
Table 2: Comparison of OCR error metrics: We improve the OCR performance of Das et al. (2019)by ~25% in terms of Edit Distance (ED), Character Error Rate (CER), and Word Error Rate (WER).
Table 3: Weighted Lz , and conformality effects: b is for the model trained without conformalityconstraints and with wp = 1; w is for weighted Lz and c is for the use of conformality constraints.
