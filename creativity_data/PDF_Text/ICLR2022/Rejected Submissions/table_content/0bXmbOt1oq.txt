Table 1: Mean evaluation reward of the two-concept experiments with varying channelnoise. The results for no lossy communica-tion channel is also shown. The 95% confi-dence for all values falls within 0.01.
Table 3: Compositionality metrics of the unconstrained multi-concept Speaker agents. The meanevaluation metrics and 95% confidence bounds are showntopism	posdis	bosdisacoustic comm.	0.265	(±0.041)	0.103 (±0.015)	0.116	(±0.018)discrete comm.	0.244	(±0.032)	0.087 (±0.017)	0.118	(±0.017)meaning. Bag-of-symbols disentanglement (bosdis) measures distinct symbol meaning but does so ina permutation-invariant language way. We record all 3 metrics for the case where the average SNRis 30 dB, taking measurements between the input space and the sequence of discrete phones. Theresults are shown in Table 3. For topism, we average 0.265, which is comparable to the results of(Lazaridou et al., 2018). For posdis and bosdis, we average 0.103 and 0.116, respectively. This fallswithin the lower end of the results of (Chaabouni et al., 2020). All three metrics yield similar resultsfor both acoustic and discrete communication.
