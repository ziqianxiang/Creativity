Table 2: Averaged performances and performance gains against the PLM for Question Answeringon 1% few-shot subset data of MS-MARCO. The gain indicates the averaged performance gainagainst the PLM’s one with the standard deviation of the gain in the blacket. See the results of theother few-shots in Appendix A.
