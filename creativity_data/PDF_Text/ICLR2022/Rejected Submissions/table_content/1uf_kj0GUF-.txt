Table 1: Means / Standard deviations of net-work estimate errors for different networkweights. Values are computed from the processof learning 128 different ground-truth networkswith d = 16. 512 training samples are drawnfor each learning trial.
Table 2: Learning success rate of vanilla LR on residual units with input X LÂêß.N (0,1). Thesuccess rates shows an exponentially decreasing trend with the same number of samples. The samplesizes to achieve close to the same rate grows exponentially as the number of dimensions growslinearly.
Table 3: Learning success rate of vanilla LR on residual units with input X ' N (0.1,1). Withthe non-zero Gaussian mean, the success rates show an overall decline compared with the rates shownin Tab. 2 for zero-mean Gaussian inputs.
