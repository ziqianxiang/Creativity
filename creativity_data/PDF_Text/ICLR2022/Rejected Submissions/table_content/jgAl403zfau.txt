Table 1: ImageNet structural pruning results. We compare HALP for ResNet50 with two differentdense baselines (left), ResNet101 and VGG16 (right up), MobileNet-V1 and MobileNet-V2 (rightbottom) pruning experiments, with detailed comparison to state-of-the-art pruning methods overvarying performance metrics.
Table 3: Comparison of extra computation required by pruning methodson ImageNet. Our approach is around 4.3× faster than the next bestmethod. Sub-network selection timing is approximated as running onsame device (a NVIDIA V100).

Table 7: Pruning ResNet50 on the ImageNet dataset with FLOPs constraint and comparison withstate-of-the-art method EagleEye (ECCV’20) Li et al. (2020). We remeasure the FLOPs, top1 andtop5 accuracy of EagleEye to get results with two digits.

For each model, we list thenumber of neurons remaining in each convolution layer, starting from the input to the output. ForResNets We use [∙] to denote a residual block and (∙) to denote the neuron number of the residualbypass layer.
