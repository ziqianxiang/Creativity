Table 1: Test performance comparison of optimizers. We report the mean and the standard deviations(as the subscripts) of the optimal test errors computed over three runs. Our methods, including Adaiand AdaiW, consistently outperforms all other popular optimizers.
Table 2: Test performance comparison of optimizers with the weight decay hyperparmeter Î» = 0.0001.
