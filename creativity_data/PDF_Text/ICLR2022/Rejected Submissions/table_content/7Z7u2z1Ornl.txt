Table 1: Particle partitioning results. On three jet types performance measured in F1 score andadjusted rand index (ARI) for 11 different seeds. Our method outperforms the baselines on bottomand charm jets, while being competitive on light jets.
Table 2: Convex hull results measured as F1 score. Our method outperforms all baselines consid-erably for all settings and set sizes (n).
Table 3: Delaunay triangulation results for different set sizes (n). Our method outperformsSet2Graph on all metrics.
Table 4: Additional particle partitioning results. On three jet types performance measured as randindex (RI). Our method outperforms the baselines on bottom and charm jets, while being competitiveon light jets.
