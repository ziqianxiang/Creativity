The better performance of GemNets could be due to the operation of GemNet-Q on quadruplets of atoms (the geometric algebra attention networks learned here only operate onpairs of bonds from a central atom), the incorporation of energy in addition to force labels in theGemNet training scheme (in this work, we choose to only train on force data, rather than using a3For applications of this method to systems at nonzero temperature, we would expect to be better-servedby using an architecture that generates output distributions instead of only point values, but we disregard thishere for simplicity; in other words, here we are teaching models to memorize training data directly, rather than
Table 2: Terms arising from the geometric product AB = (As +Av +Ab+At)(Bs +Bv +Bb+Bt)in R3 . In three dimensions, multivectors Aand B consist of scalars (s), vectors (v), bivectors (b),and trivectors (t).	__________________________________Bs	Bv	Bb	Bts	v	b	tv	s+b	v+t	bb	v+t	s+b	vt	b	v	sFrom Table 2, we can see that successive products of vectors—such as pijk... in Equation 1—alternate between producing two types of multivectors: products of even numbers of vectors yield ascalar and bivector ((v + t)v = vv + tv = (s + b) + b → s + b), while products of odd numbersof vectors produce a vector and trivector ((s + b)v = sv + bv = v + (v + t) → v + t). Generatingrotation-invariant quantities from these products as described in the main text is the primary applica-tion of geometric algebra in this work, although in general the method could be used to incorporatedifferent types of scalar, vector, bivector, and trivector quantities; for example, rotations could beinput as quaternions, which are isomorphic to the scalar-and-bivector product of even numbers ofvectors.
