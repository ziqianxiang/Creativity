Table 1: Main results. Accuracies (%) of grounding referring expressions in zero-shot, few-shot andfully supervised settings. We report mean and standard deviation performance over 5 random splits.
Table 2: Top-6 colors from the frequency-based baseline and our CPS. Visual appearances and colortexts are reported. Best viewed in color.
Table 3: Predicate classification results on Visual Genome. ZS: zero-shot, FS: fully supervised. Wereport the mean and standard deviation performance over 2 random splits.
Table 4: Results of large size VL-PTMs. Accuracies (%) of grounding referring expressions in zero-shot, few-shot and fully supervised settings. We report mean and standard deviation performanceover 5 random splits. ZS: zero-shot. Blk: colored block, Seg: colored segmentation mask.
Table 5: Relations in Visual Genome dataset (Krishna et al., 2017). Some relations are renamed(shown in parentheses) to better fit the query template.
