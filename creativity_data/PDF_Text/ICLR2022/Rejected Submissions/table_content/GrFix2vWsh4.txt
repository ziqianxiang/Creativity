Table 1: Notations, formulations and approximations used in this paper. F and K denotesthe random variables associated with the learned features and the labels, respectively. P denotesprobability. |.| denotes cardinality when the input is a set and the standard absolute value when theinput is a scalar. Note that network parameters Î¸ are omitted in the prediction quantities, so as tosimplify notations, as this does not lead to ambiguity.
Table 2: Quantitative evaluations of different losses on Retinal Lesions. Average DSC and HD95values (and standard deviation over three independent runs) achieved on the test set are reported.
Table 3: Results on Cityscapes validation set. (Top: Res50-FPN, Bottom: Res101-FPN) Thesecond row indicates the average region proportion (mRegProp) for each class. mIoU denotes themean IoU score over all classes.
Table 4: mIoU on Cityscapes test set.
Table F.1: Per-class Results on Cityscapes test set. (Top: Res50-FPN, Bottom: Res101-FPN) Thesecond row indicates the average region proportion (mRegProp) for each class. mIoU denotes themean IoU score over all classes.
