Table 1: Default hyperparameters shared between PPO and PPG.
Table 2:	Default PPO-specific hyperparameter.
Table 3:	Default PPG-specific hyperparameters.
Table 4:	Default PPO-EWMA and PPG-EWMA specific hyperparameter.
Table 5: Effect sizes (and Z-scores, in parentheses) for each of our hypotheses. The effect size is adifference of differences in final normalized return, between the ablation and the original experimentand between the different batch sizes. In bold are the effect sizes found to be signifcant at the0.1% level after applying a Bonferroni correction (i.e., with a one-tailed p-value below 0.001/16, orequivalently, a Z-score above 3.84).
