Table 4: Industry impact on acceptance, Google, Facebook, and Microsoft, ICLR 2021. Logisticregression predicting paper acceptance as a function of 3 industry indicators. The model achieves70% accuracy on a hold-out set containing 30% of 2021 papers.
Table 5: Return rate for first authors as a function of mean reviewer score for men (top) andwomen (bottom). The logistic regression models have a 69.2% and 78.1% accuracy and a hold-outset containing 30% of 1,848 male and 30% of 243 female first authors. Mean reviewer score is astronger factor on the return rate of women than men.
Table 6: Experience level of the first author on return rate The logistic regression models have69.5% and 67.84%, accuracy, respectively, on a hold-out set containing 30% of 2122 first authors.
Table 7: Experience of the last author on the return rate of the first author The logistic regres-sion models have 64.78% accuracy on a hold-out set containing 30% of 2,122 first authors.
Table 8: Return rate for first authors as a function of a gender indicator. The logistic regressionmodel had a 70.8% accuracy and a hold-out set containing 30% of 2122 first authors.
