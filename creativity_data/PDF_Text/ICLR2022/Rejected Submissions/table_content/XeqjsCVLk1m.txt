Table 1: Numerical results from main experiments/figures in each domain—mean ± standard devi-ation across seeds. Results are average performance (% correct) across evaluations during the last1% of training.
Table 2: Hyperparameters used in main experiments. Where only one value is listed across bothcolumns, it applies to both.
