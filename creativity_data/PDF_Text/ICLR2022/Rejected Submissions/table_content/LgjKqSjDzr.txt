Table 1: The parameters comparing to SAINT onsix datasets5 Results5.1 Embedding layersWe evaluate the three types of embedding layer on sixdatasets. As mentioned in Section 3.5, the first method isusing the multiplication with embedding matrices and valuesprojected by layers. The second is using simple mlp for pro-jection. Our proposed embedding method improves the firstmethod and outperforms the others. See Table 2.
