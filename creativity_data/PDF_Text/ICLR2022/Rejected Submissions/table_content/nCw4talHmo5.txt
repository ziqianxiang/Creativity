Table 1: Impact of different hyperparameters on the training of ParaDiS (MobileNet v1 + ImageNet).
Table 2: Impact of the distillation of the activation when training Resnet-50 for ImageNet.
Table 3: Impact of using a wider configuration on the training of US Nets (MobileNet v1 + Ima-geNet) and US/slimmable Nets (ResNet-50 + ImageNet).
Table 4: Accuracy comparison for different switches of MobileNet v1. This table summarizes morein details the results plotted on Figure 4. As for US results, the accuracy of the switch having theclosest complexity to the corresponding ParaDiS switch is given every time.
Table 5: Accuracy comparison for different switches of ResNet-50. This table summarizes morein details the results plotted on Figure 5. As for US results, the accuracy of the switch having theclosest complexity to the corresponding ParaDiS switch is given every time.
