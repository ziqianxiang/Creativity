Table 1: HNPF vs. existing OR and MTL methods. OR methods are accurate and can handle constraints, withlimited scalability for high-dimensional Neural MOO problems. MTL approaches scale well but do not supportconstraints or provide benchmark comparisons against known analytic solutions for non-convex problems.
Table 2: Extracted Pareto point density (100*#extracted Pareto points/#function evaluations). HNPFâ€™s Paretopoint density is higher. NR - Not Reported, NS - Not Supported, F - Fails. Remaining Cases in Appendix I.
