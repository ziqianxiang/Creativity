Table 1: Comparing our framework (ROCO) with FGSM (Goodfellow et al., 2015) and RL-S2V (Dai et al., 2018). -perturb. means the change of one pixel should be bounded in . B-hopneighbourhood means the new attack edges can only connect two nodes with distance less than B .
Table 3: DAG attack results of Ratio (%) ↑ ± Std. Baseline denotes mean finish time (real timeshould ×5000) on test set. Ratio represents time improvement after attack w.r.t. baselines. Thelarger the ratio, the better attack performance the adversarial attack method achieve. Random, OG-search, SA are tested for 10 trials to calculate the mean and std.________Solver	TPC-H job#	Baseline	Attack Method (Ratio ± Std)						Random	OG-Search	SA	RLShortest Job First	50	20.9228	1.08 ± 0.12	1.33 ± 0.18	1.54 ± 0.07	1.41Critical Path	50	17,3900	8.13 ± 0.44	9.03 ± 0.25	9.58 ± 0.15	9.26Tetris (Grandl et al., 2014)	50	16.4538	11.57 ± 0.60	12.05 ± 0.80	14.02 ± 0.52	14.22Shortest Job First	-100-	38,3202	0.26 ± 0.03	0.41 ± 0.04	0.48 ± 0.02	0.54Critical Path	100	32,0355	8.57 ± 0.28	8.98 ± 0.27	9.13 ± 0.02	9.24Tetris (Grandl et al., 2014)	100	30,3722	13.27 ± 0.36	12.60 ± 0.73	14.70 ± 0.49	15.41Shortest Job First	-150-	57,1554	0.84 ± 0.07	1.12 ± 0.08	1.30 ± 0.05	1.35Critical Path	150	48,7963	5.33 ± 0.37	6.27 ± 0.37	6.65 ± 0.12	6.85Tetris (Grandl et al., 2014)	150	44,9376	11.21 ± 0.85	11.44 ± 0.90	13.04 ± 0.26	12.73Table 4: DAG attack and defense results of Time ] and Ratio (%) ].

For fair comparison of different attackers Random, OG-search, SAand RL, we set the parameters to ensure similar evaluation time. According to the time complexitywe discuss in Table 2, we specify the following parameters: number of iterations N, beam searchsize B and number of different actions M in each iteration.
