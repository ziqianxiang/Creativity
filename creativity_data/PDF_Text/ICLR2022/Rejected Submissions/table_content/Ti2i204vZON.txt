Table 1: Truly value-aware objectives. We report average final score after 500K steps across six standarddomains from DMC.
Table 2: RAD additional ablations. We report average final score after 500K steps across Cheetah Run andWalker Walk domains from DMC. This illustrates that the performance of augmentations is susceptible to qualityof data. Also, for the “Zoomed Out” setting, it is worth noting that both crop and flip settle to the same score.

Table 4: Dataset Categorizations. Dense+ refers to games under the ‘Human Optimal’ and ‘Score Exploit’category from the categorization provided in [6] and Table 7. The performance of baseline, state metric,contrastive, SSL w/o contrastive and reconstruction in each of the categories are shown in Figure 1. Thealgorithm corresponding to each method is shown in Appendix 7 (Table 5). Also, since augmentations onlymodify the data, they should be included in the evaluation categorizations.
Table 5: Categorizations and Methods. The algorithm corresponding to each of the methods is shown. Thealgorithms considered are DER [53], DRQ [33], SAC [23], RAD [35], PI-SAC [38], DBC [62], CURL [36],SPR ([46] and SPR**), Dreamer [25, 26] and TIA [19]. The performance of each of the methods in each ofthe categories are shown in Figure 1. For ALE, Dreamer scores after 1M steps were used for comparison.
Table 6: Categorizations and Environments. The environments included in each of the categories is shown.
Table 7: Individual performance scores for 25 games from Atari 100k benchmark categorized based on Bellemareet al. [6]. We observe that augmentations fail to work with DER [53] but perform reasonably well with OTR [32]as evident from the performance of DrQ [33]. Further, to analyse the reason behind the performance boost ofSPR [46], We perform an experiment by removing dropout and augmentations and denote it as SPR**. Theperformance drop for SPR** as compared with SPR is significant.
