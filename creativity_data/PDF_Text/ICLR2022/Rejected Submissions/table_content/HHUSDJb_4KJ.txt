Table 1: We compare baselines on CIFAR10-LT at β = 10%, from the simplest approaches thatinvolve no accommodations for class imbalance to stronger baselines which attempt to address it.
Table 2: Classification accuracy (%) over CIFAR10-LT and CIFAR100-LT under a variety of labelfractions β and imbalance ratios γ, each averaged over 5 folds.
Table 3: Classification accuracy (%) under DARP’s protocol (Kim et al., 2020) for CIFAR10.
Table 4: Evaluating the proposed method on ImageNet127 with imbalance factor γ = 286 whereβ = 10% samples are labeled. Supervised models are trained for 300 epochs with 100% labeled dataor equivalently 3000 epochs with 10% labeled data.
