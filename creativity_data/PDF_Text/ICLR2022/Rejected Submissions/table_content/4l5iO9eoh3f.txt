We show that our model is ableto jointly learn to solve the VRP assignment problem and the route length minimization. Our workfocuses on and showcases practical aspects for solving the VRP that are important for decision makersin the planning industry and shows that our method outperforms existing models when accountingfor fixed vehicle costs. In future work, we aim to alleviate the computational shortcomings of thetrain loss calculation, such that the modelâ€™s fast training capability can be extended to problems withlarger fleet sizes.

(2021) that are generated for graph-sizes of 100 followingthe data distribution documented in Uchoa et al. (2017). The underlying dataset in Table 6 is therejection-sampled version of the dataset used in Kool et al. (2019).

In this section,we provide comparative results to the original decoding procedure in Kaempfer & Wolf (2018).

"Beam Search 20" and "Beam Search 200" refer to the size of the beam, which is equal to 20 and200 respectively. The test dataset evaluated on, is the rejection-sampled VRP20 dataset.
