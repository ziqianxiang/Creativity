Table 1: Timing data for experiment 3 on the BBOB large-scale suite with a fixed number of blocks(left) and experiment 4 with a fixed block size (right, 5× larger budget).
Table 2: Experimental setup on the BBOB and the BBOB large-scale suites, in the format “numberof blocks / block size / # objective function evaluations per machine”. Experiments 1 and 3 scale theblock size (and correspondingly, the evaluation budget per compute node), while experiments 2 and 4scale the number of blocks.
