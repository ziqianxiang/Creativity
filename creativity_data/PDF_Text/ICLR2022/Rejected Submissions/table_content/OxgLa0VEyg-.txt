Table 7: DomainBed Single source domain recognition accuracy (%) with ResNet50 on VLCS,PACS, TerraIncognita and OfficeHome. Each cell reports the accuracy for a set of target domains,and the source domain used for training corresponding to the column. The performance of targetdomains is separated by ‘/‘. Average over target domains for a given source domain is given at thebottom of the cell.

Theterms only contain yi are removed from the polynomial since these do not generate gradients withrespect to the prediction of the network. The final form, only containing 12 learnable parameters, isgiven as:Lωi)(yi, yi) = ω2(^ - ωo) + ω3(yi - ωo)2 + ω4(yi - ω0)3 + ω5(yi - ω0)4+ ω6(yi - ω0)(y∙i - ωι) + 37g - ωo)(yi - ωι)2 + 3g(yi - ωo)2(yi - ωι)+ ω9(yi - ωo)3(yi - ωι) + ωιo(yi - ωo)(yi - ω1)3 + ωn(yi - ωo)2(yi - ω1)2.
