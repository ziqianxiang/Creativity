Table 1: A comparison between our βeff based approach and the baselines in model ranking. The no-tation LLC represents the length of the learning curve, and Imprv represents the relative improvementof our approach to the best baseline. Due to the failure of the supporting package6 of LC, there is amissing ρ at LLC of 10, which does not affect our conclusions.
Table G.2: Running time(in seconds) in learningcurve prediction, includ-ing the predictor estima-tion (if necessary, e.g.,Ours, CL and BGRN).
