Table 2: Top-k center identification accuracy. The best and sub-optimum results are highlighted in bold andunderline.
Table 3: Top-k synthon completion accuracy.
Table 4: Overall performance. The best and sub-optimum results are highlighted in bold and underline. Onlyopen source works participate in rigorous comparisons, such as GLN, G2G, and RetroXpert.
Table 5: Residual attachment algorithm. For easy and quick understanding, we demonstrate the core idea byvisual samples. The detailed implementation can be found in the open-source code.
Table 6: The training costs of different methods. We run the open-source code of these methods on the sameplatform, reporting the training time per epoch and occupied GPU memory per sample. We also show the totaltraining epochs mentioned in their paper (preferred) or code. If the author reports training steps, we calculateepochstotal = stepstotal/stepsinterval .
Table 7: Atom features for center identification.
Table 8: Bond features for center identification.
Table 9: Atom features for synthon completion. Note that synthon completion do not use bond features.
