While AutoMasker can achieve consistent improve-ment within all sparsity levels. Furthermore, the GNN model trained with more sparse graphs evenoutperforms the GNN trained with the original dense graphs, such as RED-B at 9.75% and RED-M5K at 9.75%~45.96%. It demonstrates that the pre-trained AutoMasker can transfer the learnedknowledge to small-scale downstream tasks, with lower computational cost and better performance.

Consistent with the work(Chen et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2019), we select the epoch with the best cross-validation accuracyaveraged over the 10 folds and report the average and standard deviation of test accuracies at theselected epoch over 10 folds.
