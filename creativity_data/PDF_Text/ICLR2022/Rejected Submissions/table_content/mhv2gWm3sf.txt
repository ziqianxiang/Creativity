Table 1: Difference divergences and their corresponding f function. Renyi α-divergence is notf -divergence, but it can be formulated with Hellinger divergence Ha(q∣∣p), which is an f-divergence.
Table 2: Test reconstruction errors of f -TVO VAEs. Lower is better. In most cases, f -TVOoutperform corresponding f -VI.
Table 3: Test RMSE of Bayesian Neural Network for f -VIs and f -TVOs. Lower is better. In mostcases, f -TVOs outperform corresponding f -VIs.
Table 4: Test negative log-likelihood of Bayesian Neural Network for f -VIs and f -TVOs. Lower isbetter. In most cases, f -TVOs outperform corresponding f -VIs.
