Table 1: Dataset description and parametersUser-level DPFL In order to study the user-level certified prediction under different privacy guar-antee, for MNIST, we set to be 0.2808, 0.4187, 0.6298, 0.8694, 1.8504, 2.8305, 4.8913, 6.9269,which are obtained by training UserDP-FedAvg FL model for 3 rounds with noise levelσ = 3.0, 2.3, 1.8, 1.5, 1.0, 0.8, 0.6, 0.5, respectively (Figure 1(a)). For CIFAR-10, we set tobe 0.1083, 0.1179, 0.1451, 0.2444, 0.3663, 0.4527, 0.5460, 0.8781, which are obtained by trainingUserDP-FedAvg FL model for one round with noise level σ = 10.0, 8.0, 6.0, 4.0, 3.0, 2.6, 2.3, 1.7,respectively (Figure 1(b)). The clean accuracy (average over 1000 runs) of UserDP-FedAvg undernon-DP training ( = ∞) and DP training (varying ) on MNIST and CIFAR-10 are reported inTable. 2 and Table. 3 respectively.
Table 3: Clean accuracy of UserDP-FedAvg model on CIFAR-10To certify the attack cost under different number of adversarial users k (Figure 2), for MNIST, we setthe noise level σ to be 2.5. When k = 0, after training UserDP-FedAvg for T = 3, 4, 5 rounds, weobtain FL models with privacy guarantee = 0.3672, 0.4025, 0.4344 and clean accuracy (averageover M runs) 86.69%, 88.76%, 88.99%. For CIFAR-10, we set the noise level σ to be 3.0. Aftertraining UserDP-FedAvg for T = 3, 4 rounds under k = 0, we obtain FL models with privacyguarantee = 0.5346, 0.5978 and clean accuracy 78.63%, 78.46%.

When k = 0, after training InsDP-FedAvg for T = 4, 9rounds, we obtain FL models with privacy guarantee = 0.2383, 0.304 and clean accuracy (averageover M runs) 96.40%, 96.93% (Figure 8(a)(b)). For CIFAR-10, we set the noise level σ to be 8.0.
