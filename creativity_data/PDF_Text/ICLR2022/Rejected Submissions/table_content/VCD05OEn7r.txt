Table 1: Causal Discovery over G for various pairs of attributes, (m1, m2). For each pair, the toprow corresponds to taking m1 as the treatment whilst the bottom utilizes m2 as the treatment. Plesesee appendix Â§D contains additional generated samples and a qualitative description of visual fidelityfor each pair of attributes.
