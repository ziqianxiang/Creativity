Table 1: Test accuracy (%) of different algorithms on the Colored MNIST task in 5 trials (mean ±standard deviation). δgap indicates the generalization gap of the model between i.i.d and OOD testenvironments. Note that the highest test accuracy for the i.i.d test environment does not guaranteehigh performance on the OOD.
Table 2: Train and OOD test accuracy (%) on the Camelyon17-wilds in 3 trials (mean ± standarddeviation). We consider average accuracy on the OOD test environment.
Table 3: The worst-region accuracy (%) for the OOD test environment on the FMoW-wilds in 3trials (mean ± standard deviation).
Table 4: Pearson correlation coefficient of the environment Male and Female between each attributeand the label across four attributes.
Table 5: Test accuracy across four attributes on CelebA dataset.
Table 6: Test accuracy of BLOOD for four different groups on the CelebA task. N/A indicates thatthere is no test data sample in the group.
