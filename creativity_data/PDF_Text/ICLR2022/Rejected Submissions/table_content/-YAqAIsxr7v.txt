Ba-sically, Figure 3(c) illustrates that the estimated aleatoric uncertainty of left is higher than that ofright, indicating that OVD-Explorer models aleatoric uncertainty properly. Further, OVD-explorerencourages to explore the right side at that time, since the value of exploration objective (in green) ishighest. It implies that OVD-explorer tends to explore areas with higher epistemic uncertainty andavoiding higher aleatoric uncertainty, which is in accordance with our exploration principle. On theother hand, if high epistemic uncertainty is considered only like in OAC(Ciosek et al., 2019), the7Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2022(a)Type

Table 5: The results for GridChaos. Noise setup shows the different setup for environmental het-erogeneous Gaussian noise scale, and the corresponding four columns represent the noise settingsin the four quadrants of the Cartesian coordinate system, as shown in Figure 5, in which the goallocates in the first quadrant, and the triangle is initialised in the second or third quadrants. Averagereturn shows the average episodic undiscounted return with half standard derivation in the last 100epoch before totally 1250 epochs. FRG epoch means the minimum training epoches in the trialsused to Firstly Reach the Goal before totally 1250 epochs. The row S is the standard GridChaos asshown in Figure 3(b), the others are shown in Figure 8	1	Noise setup			DSAC	Average return OVDE	DOAC	DSAC	FRG epoch OVDE	DOAC		2	3	4						S	0.1	0.5	0.5	0.1	0.00±0.00	59.30±48.42	3.02±6.03	1250+	229	1222A	0.0	0.5	0.1	0.1	18.94±37.87	58.99±48.18	38.42±47.08	1161	180	662B	0.0	0.05	0.01	0.01	39.78±48.72	79.52±39.77	18.71±37.41	694	144	846C	0.05	0.1	0.1	0.05	0.05±0.10	39.64±48.55	20.59±39.66	1250+	180	309D	0.001	0.005	0.005	0.001	20.00±40.00	40.46±48.61	39.99±48.97	284	276	321E	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.00±0.00	20.20±39.90	14.60±29.20	1250+	185	1118Concretely, from the results, the following observations deserve to be noticed. First, OVD-Explorercan significantly achieve better average return in all those settings, especially when the noise is sethigh, and can learn to reach the goal faster (see column about FRG). It shows the ability of OVD-Explorer to guide agent explore against higher aleatoric uncertainty on the left side (the second
