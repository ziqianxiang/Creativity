Table 1: Choice of common compressor parameters to achieve a convergence rate of O (1 / √T). Pmis the size of the m-th embedding. In scalar quantization, we let there be 2q quantization levels, andlet hmax and hmin be respectively the maximum and minimum components in hm(θmt ; xim) for alliterations t, parties m, and xim . We let V be the size of the lattice cell in vector quantization. We letk be the number of parameters sent in an embedding after top-k sparsification, and (khk2)max bethe maximum value of khm(θmt ; xim)k2 for all iterations t, parties m, and xim.
Table 2: Maximum F1 -Score and test accuracy reached during training, and communication cost toreach a target accuracy. For MIMIC-III, the target test F1-Score is 0.4, For ModelNet10, the targettest accuracy is 75%. In these experiments, Q = 10 and M = 4.
Table 3: MIMIC-III time in seconds to reacha target F1-Score for different local iterationsQ and communication latency tc with vectorquantization and b = 3.
