Table 1: Accuracy comparisons for Project A, project Compare A, project With-Lava-A and projectLava NOAV A. Acc = nreached target /4096. “No SRD” indicates no training: reasonable accuracyis attainable purely with design. SRD training generally increases the accuracies. Starred valuesreflect failure modes, matching their respective histograms; see fig. 6 and 7.
