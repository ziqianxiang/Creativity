Table 1: Comparison between function value worst-case and average-case convergence. κ is the condi-tion number in the smooth strongly convex case. Inthe smooth convex case ξ > -1 is the concentrationof eigenvalues around 0 (see Assumption 1) and inthe non-smooth case We consider dμ α λαe-λmin nf (x) := 1 (X — x?)>H(X — x?)0 .
