Table 1: Example tasks in our Text-Conditioned Frostbite dataset. Tasks are split into easy, medium,and hard categories for evaluation purposes.
Table 2: Comparing benefit of transferring vision encoder for different model context sizes. Im-provement is measured as percent increase in performance when pre-training with 200 unlabelledtasks compared to an untrained model. The improved transfer of the 20 context model indicates thatsequential trajectory-level information can be transferred.
Table 3: Example tasks in the Text-Conditioned Frostbite dataset. Some of these tasks are notincluded in evaluation so are not broken into easy, medium, and hard suites.
