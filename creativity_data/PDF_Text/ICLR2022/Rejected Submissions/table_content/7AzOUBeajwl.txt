(2020) and M guided by CERM have low punctuation accuracy (4.6%and 4.5%, respectively). Our full model achieves both high sentiment accuracy (84.3%) and highpunctuation accuracy (97.7%). The reliance on the orthogonal classifier Co is proved critical - itsomission results in dramatic drop of punctuation accuracy (5.5%). Output examples in Table 3provide multiple illustrations of these phenomena: Krishna et al. (2020) often paraphrases the inputwithout changing the sentiment, while other models consistently change punctuation; only our fullmodel successfully transfers the sentiment without changing the punctuation.
