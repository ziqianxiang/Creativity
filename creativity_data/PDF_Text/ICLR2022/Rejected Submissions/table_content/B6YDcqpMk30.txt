Table 1: The identification between the concepts of PRIMA/PRISA and that of RL at the t-th time step.
Table 2: Testing Accuracy and PSS of different variants of PRISA on different tasks. PRISA-MuZero achievesthe best performance on single-task reasoning, which confirms the strength of the MCTS-based Enhanced Plannerand the MuZero learning strategy. “m”: the problem size. “PSS”: Percentage of Successful Seeds.
Table 3: Testing Accuracy and PSS of PRIMA and other baselines on different reasoning tasks. The results of∂ILP, NLM, and DLM are merged in one row due to space constraints and are presented in the same order if theresults are different. Note that PRIMA,s test efficiency is superior to NLM-MTR,s as shown in Fig. ∣4] "m”: theproblem size. “PSS”: Percentage of Successful Seeds. Numbers in red denote < 100%.
Table 4: Hyper-parameter settings for NLM-MTR and DML-MTR.
Table 5: Hyper-parameter settings for PRISA and PRIMA. “lr-reasoner” refers to the learning ratefor the reasoner, “lr-policy” denotes the learning rate for the policy network, “lr-value” denotesthe learning rate for the value network, “residual” refers to the residual connection in the reasoner,“NumWarmups” refers to the number of warm-ups before starting the training, “NumRollouts” refersto the number of roll-outs in MCTS, “RwdDecay” refers to the constant exponential decay appliedon the reward, “ci and C2" refers to the same constants in PUCT formula in Section A.1, “RBsize”refers to the replay buffer size that is used to count the number of stored trajectories, “BatchSize”refers to the batch size for training, “TrainingSteps” refers to the number of training steps. ForPRISA-REINFORCE, PRISA-PPO, PRISA-MuZero, the “TrainingSteps” denotes the training stepsfor each task, while that of PRIMA represents the training steps for all 8 tasks.
