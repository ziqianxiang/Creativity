Table 1: The scores are reported in percentage and are averaged over three runs with differentrandom seeds. Except for the results from the cross entropy with hard targets, denoted as Basehereinafter, other scores are absolute difference from those of Base. Bold numbers indicate the bestperformance among the methods.
Table 2: We report Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Maximum Calibration Error (MCE), inpercentage, on the test sets of the corpora for evaluating the calibration ability.
Table 3: (+) denotes adding the followingcomponents to the base method. α(n) de-notes our adaptive α, and α↑ indicates a lin-ear increase in α in the course of training.
