Table 1: Test accuracy on the node classification task. “OOM” means “out of memory”.
Table 2: Algorithm analysis. We denote N, Nl , M and d as the number of nodes, the numberof labeled nodes, edges and feature dimensions respectively. P is the EP operation and T is theET operation. “SC” means “Skip Connection”, and k refers to the number of sampled nodes inGraphSAGE.
