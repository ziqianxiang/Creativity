Table 1: Overview of frameworks, backbones and neck methods. (*) Swin Transformer use hierarchical repre-sentations similar to FPN necks in CNNs. RegNetY is similar to RegNetX but implements the Squeeze-and-Excitation operation (Hu et al., 2018a). Yolo consists of darknet (D), spatial pyramid pooling (SSP) (He et al.,2014) and a Path Aggregation Network (PAN) (Liu et al., 2018) in varying combinations with CSPNet (C)(Wang et al., 2020a).
