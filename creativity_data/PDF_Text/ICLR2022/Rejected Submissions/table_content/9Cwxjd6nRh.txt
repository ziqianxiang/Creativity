Table 1: We depict here the final value of the input optimization step (x(T)). We experiment withdifferent distances (each column) and we provide the actual value of the distance along with a relativedistance which is obtained by 100- 100 × |d(f (x), f(x(0))) - d(f (x), f (x(T)))|/d(f (x), f (x(0))).
