Table 1: Performance of our work against previous one-dimensional quantile networks in fitting thethree-component Gaussian Mixture Model. Results are averaged over 5 runs of 10 epochs each withsame hyperparameters. Lower score is better. We use boldface for the lowest score.
Table 2: Performance evaluation on the multivariate time-series datasets Energy and Stocks. Re-sults are averaged over 5 runs. Lower score is better. We use boldface for the lowest score.
