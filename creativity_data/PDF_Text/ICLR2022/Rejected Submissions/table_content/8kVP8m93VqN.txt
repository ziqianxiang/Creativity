Table 1: Overview of the Dataset.
Table 2: Overall performance on dataset. We conduct each experiment (Flat-DQN and HRLs) 5times, and the reported number is the average, other numbers are copied from the correspondingliterature, - denotes missing numbers, and Acc., M.R, Avg. T are the abbreviations of Accuracy,Match Rate and Average Turns respectively.
