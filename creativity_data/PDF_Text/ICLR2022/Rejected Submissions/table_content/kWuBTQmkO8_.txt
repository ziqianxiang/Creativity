Table 1: Settings for the four datasets.
Table 2: Accuracy and runtime results on the NO2, Product, and Airfoil datasets. Four baselinesare compared with MixRL: (1) No data augmentation; (2) Original Mixup (Zhang et al., 2018); (3)Manifold Mixup (Verma et al., 2019); and (4) Global kNN. For each global kNN, we show the bestk value found with Bayesian optimization. We also integrate MixRL with Manifold Mixup.
