Table 3: Negative log likelihoods (bits/dim) in the few-step regime across various DDPMs trained onCIFAR10, as well as state-of-the-art unconditional generative models in the same dataset. The lastcolumn corresponds to 1,000 steps for Lsimple and 4,000 steps for all other models.
Table 4: Negative log likelihoods (bits/dim) in the few-step regime for a DDPM model trained withLhybrid on ImageNet 64x64 (Nichol & Dhariwal, 2021), as well as state-of-the-art unconditionalgenerative models in the same dataset. We underline that, with just 32 steps, our DP stride achieves ascore of ≤ 0.1 bits/dim higher than the same model with the original 4,000 step budget (*the authorsreport 3.57 bits/dim, but we trained the model for 3M rather than 1.5M steps).
Table 5: FID scores in the few-step regime across DDPMs trained on CIFAR10 and ImageNet 64x64,compared to DDPM and DDIM(η = 0) with different strides. The last column corresponds to1,000 steps for CIAFR10 Lsimple and 4,000 steps for ImageNet 64x64 Lhybrid. The best results arehighlighted in bold, and the second best are underlined.
