Table 1: ImageNet validation accuracy.
Table 2: Comparison of test performance of LAWN With other methods for controlling loss of adaptivity onMovielens-1M, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. The base optimizer used is Adam. TWo different batch sizes,BS are tried for each dataset. For LSR, the smoothing parameter Was fixed at 0.05. LAWN comprehensivelyoutperforms other methods, including Weight decay (WD).
Table 4: Test HR@10 on MovieLens and Pinterest recommendations. Standard error is in the range [0.15, 0.25];details are in Appendix B. Highlighted values indicate the better performing method between x and x-L.
Table 3: Test accuracy on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.
Table 5: Adam vs. Adam-LAWN when used with focal loss (FL). We tried 3 different values (0.5, 2 and 5) forÎ³ (focal loss parameter) and also compared the results to cross entropy (CE) loss. BS1 and BS2 refer to batchsizes. For MovieLens-1M, BS1 = 100k and BS2 = 1M. For the CIFAR datasets, BS1 =4kandBS2= 10k.
