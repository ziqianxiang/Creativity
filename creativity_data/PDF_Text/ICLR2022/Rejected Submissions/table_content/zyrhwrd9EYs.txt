Table 1: ATE results. For each setting we report an MSE between the predicted ATE and thesimulated (ground truth) ATE on 10 different train and test sets using 10 differently sampled simu-lations and averaged the results, standard deviation is m brackets. Imputing only X ( Selective ),consistently performs best across different ATE prediction methodologies and treatments. Lower isbetter, our proposal is shaded .
Table 2: CATE results. We report a PEHE on 10 different random train and test sets using 10differently sampled simulations and averaged the results, standard deviation is in brackets. Imputingonly X, while keeping X as is (marked as Selective below), consistently performs best acrosslearners and treatments. Lower is better, our proposal is shaded .
Table 3: CATE results with GAIN. We repeat our experiment form the main text. For each settingwe report a PEHE on 100 differently sampled simulations and averaged the results, standard devia-÷	今Imputing only tX, while keeping Xtion is reported in brackets.
Table 4: Validity of CIT and CIO. There are six criteria we argue missingness in CATE shouldfollow. These criteria are indicated in the column headers as directed dependencies missingnessshould, or should not, include. Assuming that there are no arrows going up from W and Y(W) (forexample, the potential outcomes Y(w), cannot influence the covariates X), we have 42 DAGs thatrespect Eq.(1) and one of Eq. (2) or Eq. (3). Only one of these DAGs (indicated in green ), respectseach criteria. This DAG (Fig. 5g) is a permutation of CIT, and a version of MCM that does notassume factors, Z and 告Z in Z. In below table,"/" means presence and "X” means absence, whenthese icons are black absence or presence is positive, when they are gray they are negative.
