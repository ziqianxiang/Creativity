Table 1: Attack success rate of the triggers constructed using our method, MESA (Qiao et al., 2019),random cropped patches (Random) and the original trigger.
Table 2: Average ASR of ourattack on poisoned classifiersfrom TrojAI datasets.
Table 4: We show the ASR of triggers constructedby participants, and the randomly cropped patcheson clean/poisoned classifiers.
Table 3: Average accuracy in each group foridentifying poisoned classifiers in the userstudy. Each group has 5 participants.
