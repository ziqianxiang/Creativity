Table 1: The properties of the datasets.
Table 2: The results on the KDDCup99 dataset. The bold score denotes the highest one in thecolumn. We report the best scores for S3ADNet.
Table 3: The results on the HASC dataset. The margin is the maximum allowed detection error (thenumber of data points from a ground truth to an estimated change point) that within this range, theestimation is still considered a true positive. In the columns, the bold and UnderIined scores denotethe highest and second-highest scores, respectively. We report the best F1-score of each method.
Table 4: Default hyperparameters for the ablation study. The meanings of the symbols are explainedin Appendix A.
Table 5: Best F1-scores obtained with different numbers of concepts on the two datasets.
Table 6: Best F1-scores obtained with different temperatures and adaptation functions on HASC(w=100).
