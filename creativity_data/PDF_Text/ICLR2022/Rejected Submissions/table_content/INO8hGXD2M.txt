Table 1: Evaluation of OOD detectors using the adversarial distributions. Test Set indicates the testsplit of a test OOD dataset. Dz denotes the dimension of the latent space of the generator. AUCscores are evaluated using 1,000 samples from adversarial distributions.
Table 2:	Statistics for datasets.
Table 3:	Autoencoder architecture. ConvN (M) indicates a 2D convolution operation with a N Ã— Nkernel and M output channels. BN denotes batch normalization, and ReLU means the rectifiedlinear unit activation.
