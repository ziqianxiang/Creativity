Table 1:  Results for a subset of binary quadratic problems from the MINLPLib benchmark, indi-cating the number of runs out of 20 for which the primal gap with respect to the best known primalfeasible solution is at most 0%, 1%, and 10%.
Table 2: Distribution of per-step MILP inner-optimization solve times in seconds for TfBind8 bench-marks when using different surrogate network architectures. The Network column denotes the num-ber of ReLUs in each fully-connected hidden layer. Runs were given a time limit (TL) of 300s. (*)means that the time limit was hit.
