Figure 9 shows a theoretical turbulencekinetic energy spectrum plot. The spectrum can describe the transfer of energy from large scales ofmotion to the small scales and provides a representation of the dependence of energy on frequency.
Table 4: We test that our design results in time-invariance (low time-shift error). The scaled time-shifterrors with and without time-shift invariant loss on the turbulent flow dataset are shown in the table.
Table 5: We tested concatenating zc to the input of the forecaster (concat input), using zc as thekernels of the forecaster (Kernel Gen), concatenating zc to the hidden states (concat hidden), addingzc to the hidden states(Sum), using zc as the biases in the convolutional layers (Bias). AdaIN workedbetter than any alternative we tested.
