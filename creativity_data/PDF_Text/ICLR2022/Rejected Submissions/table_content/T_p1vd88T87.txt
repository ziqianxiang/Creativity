Table 1: Relative error of the estimated parameters for the lake and city sequences. With N = 10frames our model is able to accurately infer the physical parameters of the underlying physicalphenomenon, while N = 5 frames are not sufficient to constrain all parameters. While the coloras well as the segmentation loss alone give similar results to the combined loss, both losses areneeded for the full model. The color loss enables the proposed approach to generate photorealisticrenderings on top of physical parameter inference. While using only the color loss gives goodaccuracy for synthetic data, we observed that the segmentation loss, especially in combination withusing image pyramids, greatly improves the convergence behaviour for initial conditions that arefarther away from the groundtruth parameters. Overall, both losses are necessary to obtain accuratephysical parameter estimates and photorealistic renderings in a robust manner.
