Table 1: Comparisons of F1 -scores (%). CORES, CL, TracIn: Train with noisy supervisions.
Table 2: Comparisons of F1-scores (%). CORES, CL, TracIn: Use logit layers. SimiRep-V/R: Useonly representations. All methods use the same extractor from CLIP. Top 2 are bold.
Table 4: Experiments on Clothing1M. None: Standard training with 1M noisy data. R50-Img (orViT-B/32-CLIP, R50-Img Warmup-1): Apply our method with ResNet50 pre-trained on ImageNet(or ViT-B/32 pre-trained by CLIP, R50-Img with 1-epoch warmup). Top-1 is bold.
Table 3: Comparisons of FI-ScoreS (%) using g(∙) with differ-ent δk (%). Model names are the same as Figure 2.
Table 5: Experiments on Clothing1M (Xiao et al., 2015) with or without balanced sampling.
