Table 1: Mean and standard deviation of various performance measures for the toy example, spleenand prostate. The standard deviation is reported in parentheses. The column Np is the approximatenumber of model parameters in millions, T is the inference time per image in milliseconds, and dbp-refers to a network trained without detail coefficients. The length of the encoder for the toy-exampleis six and five for the prostate and spleen.
