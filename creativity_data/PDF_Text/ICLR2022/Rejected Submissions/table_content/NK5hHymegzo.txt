Table 1: Summary of different algorithms for min-max optimization. IC stands for iteration complex-ity, ε-SP stands for ε-first order stationary point, and ε-optim stands for ε-close to the set of optimalsolutions. The last two lines are algorithms analyzed by us in this paper. BCG condition stands forthe bounded cumulative gradient assumption.
