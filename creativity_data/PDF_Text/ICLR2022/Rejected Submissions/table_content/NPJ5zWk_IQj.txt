Table 1: Evaluating Skill-Tuple Distribution Matching via our approach against various baselines, across alldomain pairs. Baselines are adapted from (1): Ganin et al. (2016), (2): Zhu et al. (2017), (3): Liu et al. (2020).
Table 2: Evaluating Task-Strategy Transfer: Evaluating average rewards over 10 episodes obtained via ourapproach with and without finetuning against a hierarchical RL baseline, adapted from Kulkarni et al. (2016),across 3 tasks. Source domain results are shared across approaches, and are trained via Kulkarni et al. (2016).
