For each dataset, we randomly split it to training,simulation, and test sets with a ratio of 4 : 3 : 3. We use the simulation set to create weak signals and

We use the same way as Wu et al. (2020) to process PartNet Mo et al. (2019). PartNetprovides point-wise semantic labels for point clouds. The original point clouds are used as completepoint clouds. To generate partial point clouds, we randomly removed parts from complete point15Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2022clouds, based on the semantic labels. We use Chair, Table, and Lamp categories. The summary ofthese three subsets are in Table 7.

Let Xc be the set of referred complete point clouds, and Xp be the set of input par-(p)tial point clouds. For each partial point cloud xi , we generate M complete point cloud samplesyi(1), ..., yi(M). All these samples form a new set of complete point clouds Y. In our experiments,we follow Wu et al. (2020) and set M = 10.
