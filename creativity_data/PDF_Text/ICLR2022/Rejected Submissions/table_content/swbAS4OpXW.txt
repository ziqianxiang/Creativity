Table 1: Quantitative comparison on one-shot adaptation between FreezeD (Mo et al., 2020),Cross-Domain (Ojha et al., 2021), and our proposed GenDA. Evaluation metrics include FID (loweris better), precision (higher means better quality), and recall (higher means higher diversity). Allresults are averaged over 5 training shots.
Table 2: Quantitative comparison on 10-shot adaptation. FID (lower is better) servesas the evaluation metric. Numbers in blue indicate our improvements over the state-of-the-artalternative (Ojha et al., 2021).
Table A1: Ablation study on the components proposed in GenDA, including the attribute adaptor(AA), the attribute classifier (AC), and the diversity-constraint strategy (DC). Evaluation metricsinclude FID (lower is better), precision (higher means better quality), and recall (higher meanshigher diversity).
Table A2: Ablation study on architecture designs. A two-layer multi-layer perceptron (MLP) isintroduced as the heavy version of the attribute adaptor and the attribute classifier, respectively.
Table A3: Ablation study on the strength of diversity-constraint strategy, which is noted as βin Eq. (5). Here, a smaller β denotes a stronger diversity constraint. Evaluation metrics include FID(lower is better), precision (higher means better quality), and recall (higher means higher diversity).
