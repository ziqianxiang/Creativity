Table 1: Benchmark datasets implemented in TorchGeo.
Table 2: Generic datasets implemented in TorchGeo.
Table 3: Benchmark results comparing TorchGeo trained models to previously reported results over sevendatasets. RESISC45, So2Sat, EuroSat, and UC Merced results are reported as overall top-1 accuracy whileLandCover.ai, Chesapeake Land Cover, and ETCI 2021 results are reported as mean class IoU. Resultsfrom TorchGeo models are reported as the mean with one standard deviation over 10 training runs fromdifferent random seeds. Results from related work are reported as is.
