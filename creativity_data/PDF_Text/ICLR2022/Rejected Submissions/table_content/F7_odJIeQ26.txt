Table 1: Accuracy of our models (in percentage (%)) and the Lample & Charton (2019)â€™s modelon integration and differential equation solving. The number of training samples used to train themodels in all tasks is 1 million. Results are tested on test data sets of size 5000 samples.
Table 2: Evaluation of accuracy of our Marian-MT model (in percentage (%)) on the in-tegration and differential equation solving for different pretrained languages. The highestaccuracy is indicated by bold case in each column (task). We see that the language has nospecific impact on the results of this fine-tuning.
Table 3: Accuracy of the models (in percentage (%)) on function integration. Results are testedon test data sets of size 5000 samples. The models are trained on the 1 million sample size trainingdata, as dicussed in section 5.1.
Table 4: Accuracy of our models (in percentage (%)) on the integration and differential equationsolving for different pretrained languages. Results are reported on test datasets of different types(polynomial, trigonometric and logarithmic.), and of size 5000.
