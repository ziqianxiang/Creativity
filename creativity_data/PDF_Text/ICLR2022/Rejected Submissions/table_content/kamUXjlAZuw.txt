Table 1: Frequent fairness definitions.
Table 2: Data sets desCriptionFigures 1 and 2 illustrate the trade off between average loss and disparity for a range of 位 values. 3On the train test (Figure 1, there is a Clear dependenCe between the value of 位 and the respeCtiveaverage loss and disparity between groups. As expeCted, an inCrease in 位 tends to deCrease disparity,while inCreasing the average loss, and viCe versa. However, this is not always the Case on the testset, as some intermediate values of 位 aChieve both lower average loss and lower disparity, whereasmore (or totally) debiased models Clearly overfit.
