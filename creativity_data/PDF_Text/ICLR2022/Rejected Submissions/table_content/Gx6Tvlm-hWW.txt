Table 1: Results for the in-silico screening task over the ChEMBL dataset. TPR and FP ≤ k areexpressed as percents (i.e., ×100). We see that our FP-CP methods meet our target thresholds; usingthe Inner Sets formulation does too, but is conservative (as expected). Applying FP-CP calibrationwith our DeepSets model (see NN) yields substantially higher TPR across various tolerance levels k.
Table B.1: Outer Sets results applied at coverage level 1 - = 0.90. Note that since some examplesdo not have any positives, full coverage in the typical sense isn’t always achievable.
Table C.1: Dataset statistics (test split). Numbers are reported with respect to the top B = 100candidates per example. The median number of positives and negatives per example is given, inaddition to their 16th and 84th percentiles. Examples with no positives (|z| = 0) are treated as empty.
