Table 1: RCF model accuracy on NTK-perturbed binary MNIST & CIFAR data. We consider attacksthat use the analytical kernel, an empirical approximation and the random baseline. The batch sizefor empirical kernels is 1500 for CIFAR and 256 (500) for training (test) MNIST, while for theanalytical method we use full-batch (the entire dataset). MNIST accuracy is averaged over the 45different classification tasks.

Table 3: Accuracy of fully connected nets on NTK-perturbed ( = 0.3) multiclass MNIST trainingdata (generated with the sum-of-∆z).
Table 4: Transfer results on MNIST (train & test) with NTK-noise generated from the analyticalkernel of the RCF model with the sum-of-∆z attack. We compare with PGD perturbed data pro-duced by a trained RCF with cross-entropy loss and we, also, report accuracy on clean data.
