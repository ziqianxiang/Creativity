Table 1: Comparison between Factored World Models, baselines and ablations in Cubes and Shapesenvironments. We evaluate the models both on the tasks they were trained on (top section) and on un-seen tasks without additional fine-tuning (bottom section). While the bottom section reports resultsfor generalization to unseen tasks, reaching high scores in the top section requires in-distributiongeneralization to known structures built in new positions in the workspace. Hence the terms ”TestSet” and ”Zero-Shot”. We report block position error (RMSE, the lower the better, unbounded) andaction sequence ranking score (Hits@1, the higher the better, bounded 0 - 100) (Section 3.1). Eachmodel was run with 8 random seeds and we report means and 95% confidence intervals.
Table 2: Block position predictions results for a real-world evaluation dataset. The first row is abreakdown of results previously reported in Table 1 (FWM). The second row reports results for amodel trained in simulation and evaluated on trajectories captured on a physical robot. 4-Stack,Wall, Stairs, Wall Ground (WG) and Stairs Ground (SG) correspond to the tasks shown in Figure 3.
