Table 1: Emotion taxonomies used by different datasets.
Table 2: Ranges encoded by each style value’s distribution compared to the true label values (thelatent space is clipped according to the distributions’ standard deviation, considering one standarddeviation away from the mean.)Style value	Distribution,s range	Size %	Label,s range	Size %far-left-hp	(-2.32,-1.45]	19.8%	010	17.2%left-hp	(-1.45, -0.72]	16.6%	[11, 25]	23.4%center-hp	(-0.72,0.11]	18.9%	[26, 37]	18.8%right-hp	(0.11,0.98]	19.8%	[38, 52]	23.4%far-right-hp	(0.98,1.94)	21.8%	[53, 63]	17.2%get a fair comparison. It is true that, by using multidimensional style vectors, better results couldbe achieved. The encoding latent space, however, would be completely unrelated to the originalgenerative factors, and a comparison between different categorical models unfeasible.
