In this session, we conducted ablation exPeriments to validate the effectivenessof ProPosed method. Firstly, we exPlore the role of each comPonent we ProPosed. SPecifically, weaPPend each module gradually and observe the Performance of the model on Normal→Foggy. Theresults are shown in Table 4. It can be found that the Performance increases when any comPonent isaPPended, which Proves that all comPonent are designed reasonably and contribute to the adaPtation.
