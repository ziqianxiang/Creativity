Table 1: Results on CIFAR-100. We used Places365 as far-OOD and CIFAR-10 as near-OODdatasets. The reported values are means and standard errors over 10 runs. Bold numbers are withinone standard error of the best performing model. Our model outperforms the baselines in terms ofaccuracy on corrupted data and performs on par with the best models on OOD detection.
Table 2: Results on Imagenet. We used Imagenet-C as near-OOD and Imagenet-A as far-OOD. We report the mean and standard error over 10 runs. Bold numbers are within one standard error of the best model. HetSNGP performs best in terms of accuracy on Imagenet-C and Imagenet-A.

We measurethe OOD detection performance in terms of area under the receiver-operator-characteristic curve(ROC) and false-positive-rate at 95% confidence (FPR95). We also evaluated the methods’ gen-eralization performance on corrupted CIFAR-100 (Hendrycks & Dietterich, 2019). In Table 1 wesee that HetSNGP yields a performance between the heteroscedastic and SNGP methods in termsof in-distribution accuracy, but outperforms all baselines in accuracy on the corrupted data. More-over, it performs on par with the best performing models on both near- and far-OOD detection.

Table 4: Results on Imagenet. Ensemble size=4. Imagenet-C is used as the OOD dataset. HetSNGPoutperforms the baselines in terms of in-distribution accuracy and all on OOD metrics.
