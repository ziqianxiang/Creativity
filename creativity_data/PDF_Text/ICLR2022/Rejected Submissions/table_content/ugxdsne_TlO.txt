Table 1: Simulation results on datasets with different DRFs where number of samples n =1000, pX = 50, pY = 5,pZ = 5. Standard deviations are in parenthesis over 100 simulations.
Table 2: Qini scores of models under different treatmentsMethods	d5	d4	d3	d2	d1Xgboost	0.253	0.171	0.177	0.206	0.177CF	0.253	0.194	0.202	0.272	0.300GCF	0.309	0.248	0.305	0.444	0.780The Qini scores of different models are summarized in Table 2. The performance of GCF is superiorthan the companyâ€™s current models as GCF has the highest Qini scores across all levels of discounts.
