Table 1: We report the range of β values used to obtain the range of acceptance rates in Figure 9.
Table 2: Additional results comparing MC sampling methods on obtaining samples from the “female-science” EBM described in Section 3.2.2. We do not compute perplexity for IMH and RWMHwithout reset as it does not yield i.i.d. samples. As noted, TVD and KL for MCMC methods areunknown (i.e. we have no way of estimating them). Where available we show mean ± one standarddeviation over 10 runs.
Table 3: Additional results comparing MC sampling methods on the task of obtaining samples froman EBM with a point-wise constraint to include the word “amazing” in the sequence. We do notcompute perplexity for IMH and RWMH without reset as it does not yield i.i.d. samples. As noted,TVD and KL for MCMC methods are unknown (i.e. we have no way of estimating them). Whereavailable we show mean ± one standard deviation over 10 runs.
Table 4: Means and standard deviation of importance sampling estimates of acceptance rate, TVDwith the target distribution and KL-divergence to the target distribution for various β on debiasingscientist biographies (see Section 3.2.2). We perform 10 runs using 1,000,000 samples each tocompute the means and standard deviations. Values of β are chosen within the range used for ourexperiments as reported in Table 1.
