Table 1: Results on multiple speech analysis tasks, evaluated on the LibriSpeech test-clean set that isreverberated with our environmental simulator (with the exception of the “Anechoic (Upper bound)”setting, which is evaluated on the original audio). WER-FT and EER-FT refer to tests where theASR and verification models are finetuned with the audio-enhanced data, respectively. The relativeimprovement compared to Reverberant is included in parentheses.
Table 2: Results on real data demonstrating sim2real transfer. Gain vs. Reverberant in parens.
Table 3: Breakdown of word error rate (WER) for Audio-only dereverb. / VIDA on real test data.
Table 4: Distribution of average RT60 when the speaker is 1m away from mic.
Table 5: Results on the LibriSpeech test-clean set mixed with ambient sounds at a 20 dB signal-to-noise ratio.
Table 6: Augmenting Audio-only dereverb. with predicted room acoustics characteristics.
Table 7: Ablations on visual sensors. Percentages in parenthesis represent relative improvements overthe reverberant baseline.
