Table 1: The minimum depth and arity of RelNNs for solving graph classification and regression tasks. The ? symbol indicates that these are conjectured lower bounds.			GNN, we use two message-passing subroutines: (edge update) the representation associated witheach edge is updated by representations of its both ends, and (node update): the representation ofeach node is updated by all edge presentations connected to it. This message passing scheme caneasily fit in the RelNN: edge update can be realized by the expand and permute operations, whilenode update can be realized by the reduce operation.
Table 2: Overall accuracy on relational reasoning problems. All models are trained on n = 10, andtested on n = 30. The standard error of all values are computed based on three random seeds.
Table 3: Overall accuracy on relational reasoning problems. Models for family-relationship predictionare trained on n = 20, while models for connectivity problems are trained on n = 10. All model aretested on n = 80. The standard error of all values are computed based on three random seeds. The3-ary NLMs marked with “HE” have hyperedges in inputs, where each family is represented by a3-ary hyperedge instead of two parent-child edges, and the results are similar to binary edges.
