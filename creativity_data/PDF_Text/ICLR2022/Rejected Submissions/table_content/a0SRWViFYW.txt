Table 1: Parameter Values for S-TsengThe work of Bohm et al. (2020) also introduced FBFp, a stochastic version of Tseng’s method thatreuses a previously-computed gradient and therefore only needs one additional gradient calculationper iteration. In our experiments, the performance of the two methods was about the same, so weonly report the performance of stoch. Tseng’s method.
