Table 1: BD-rates over full-preCision model. The RD data is the same as that in Figure 5(b).
Table 2: Decoding error rates of Minnen et al. (2018) when inference with or without PTQ. Theresults are tested on NVIDIA GTX 1060 (marked as GPU) and Intel Core i7-7700 (marked asCPU). The decoding is cross-evaluated on the two platforms, i.e. encoding on one and decoding onthe other.
Table 3: Discretization latency with different approaches (unit: microsecond).
Table 4: Relative BPP increment on Kodak when using (or not) different weight rounding recon-struction approaches, compared with full-precision model.
