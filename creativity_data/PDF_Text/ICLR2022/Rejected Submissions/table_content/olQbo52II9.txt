Table 1: Agent scores trained on ER40 (best in bold). Error bars denote 68 % confidence intervals.
Table 2: ECORD, ECO-DQN and MCA-soft performance on the GSet graphs given a time budgetof 10, 30, and 180s (best in bold).
Table 3: Parameters used for ECORD unless otherwise stated.
Table 4: Scores for agents trained on BA40. Error bars denote 68 % confidence intervals. RL base-line scores are taken directly from Barrett et al. (2020) to provide the fairest possible comparison.
Table 5: Comparison of the approximation ratios for the Greedy (MCA and MCA-soft), branch-and-bound (CPLEX), simulated annealing (SimCIM and Leleu), and RL (S2V-DQN and ECO-DQN)Max-Cut solver baselines.
Table 6: ECORD, including both a GNN and RNN trained with M-DQN, and ablations (as describedin the text) on the GSet graphs given a time budget of 10, 30, and 180 s (best in bold).
