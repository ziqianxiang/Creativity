Table 1: Ablation study accuracy values taken from the hyper-parameter combination that led to thebest mean overall accuracy, indicated by a cross in Figure 13.
Table 2: Regularization results in the case distinction task with output taken across all tokens. Thetop three rows correspond to the best mean training accuracy, while the bottom three rows corre-spond to the best mean validation accuracy when validating on sequences of half the length.
Table 3: Regularization results in the case distinction task with output from the first token. The topthree rows correspond to the best mean training accuracy, while the bottom three rows correspondto the best mean validation accuracy when validating on sequences of half the length.
Table 4: Regularization results in the mode finding task. The top three rows correspond to the bestmean training accuracy, while the bottom rows correspond to the best mean validation accuracywhen validating on sequences of twice the length.
Table 5: Best mean accuracy per vocabulary size, taken from the combinations indicated in Fig-ure 26. First six rows correspond to training accuracies, bottom six rows correspond to validationaccuracies. Bold numbers indicate a min-accuracy higher than the best max accuracy of all othermodels.
Table 6: Hyperparameters used in the reinforcement learning experiment. These are based on thehyperparameters which Loynd et al. (2020) report in their Appendix in Table 8.
