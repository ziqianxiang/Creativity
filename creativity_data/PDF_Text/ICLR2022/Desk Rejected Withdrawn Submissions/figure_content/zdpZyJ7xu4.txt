Figure 1: Some uncommon images in the FOCUS dataset. The images in the first column depictuncommon time of day, those in the second column depict uncommon weather, and the ones in thethird column depict uncommon locations.
Figure 2: Classwise top-1 accuracy for ResNet50. The large error bars at P2 are due to insufficientnumber of samples in this partition. Similar plots for other models are in appendix D.
