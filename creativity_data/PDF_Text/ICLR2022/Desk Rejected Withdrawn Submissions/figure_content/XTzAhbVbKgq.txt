Figure 1: Partition and elimination process of BLiN (Algorithm 1). The i-th subfigure shoWs the pattern after the i-thbatch for 1 ≤ i ≤ 5. Shaded cubes are those eliminated, While darkgray ones are eliminated at the current batch. For thetotal time horizon T = 80000, BLiN needs only 6 batches.
Figure 2: Resulting partition and regret of BLiN (Algorithm 1). In Figure 2(a), we show the resulting partition ofAlgorithm 1. The background color denotes the true value of expected reward μ, and blue means high values. The figureshows that the partition is finer for larger values of μ. In Figure 2(b), we show accumulated regret of BLiN. In the figure,different background colors represent different batches. For the total time horizon T = 80000, BLiN needs only 6 batches(the first two batches are too small and are combined with the third batch in the plot).
