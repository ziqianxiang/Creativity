Figure 1: An illustration of label distributions for long-tailed CIFAR-10 dataset with imbalanceratio 100. (1a) Original label prior, (1b) Class Balanced distribution, (1c) Minimum ComplementaryDistribution, (1d) and (1e) are Complementary Distributions with different values of α.
Figure 2: Analytical experiments of Open-sampling on long-tailed CIFAR-10: (2a)(2b) with variouslabel distributions, (2c) with various values of the α, (2d) with various open-set auxiliary datasets,including simulated noise datasets and real-world datasets. All the datasets contain 50,000 instances.
Figure 3: t-SNE visualization of test set on long-tailed CIFAR-10 with imbalance ratio 100. We canobserve that LDAM and our method appear to learn more separable representations than Standardtraining and the other algorithms.
