Figure 1: In cluster-level (supervised), the high-dimensional data is supported on its classes sub-manifold Mi , while a neighborhood systems {Sj } is defined by their augmented views. We hopethat the mixed samples can prompt the representation to be learned more discriminative.
Figure 2: (a) Illustration of the cross-view pipeline for instance-level mixup training. (b) Analysis ofmixup in CL, whether to use the cross-view pipeline and combining the mixup infoNCE loss. (c) Aheat map that represents the effects of using MixUp and CutMix as the inter- and intra-class mixup.
