Figure 1: Learning curves for reward, cost, and cost rate on Gym ships with three pre-made robot.
Figure 2: In the Circle task, reward is maximized by moving along the green circle. The agent is notallowed to enter the blue regions, so its optimal constrained path follows the line segments AD andBC (figure and caption taken from (Achiam et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2020)).
Figure 3: Fig (a), (c), (e) show the pre-made robots in Safety Gym. These robots are used in thebenchmark environments. Fig (b), (d), (f) show the tasks for our environments. From left to right:Goal, Button, Push. In “Goal,” the objective is to move the robot inside the green goal area. In“Button,” the objective is to press the highlighted button (visually indicated with a faint gray cylinder).
