Figure 3: Visualization of adjacent matrix8Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2022Ablation study: We take METR-LA as the observation object to study the sensitivity of SFL per-formance to the choice of hyper-parameter. First, we fixed the rest of the framework and looked atthe training epoch of the structure learning process, the result shows only a small amount of trainingis needed to obtain relatively stable results without a heavy computing burden on the server. Sec-ond, we study the effect of communication frequency and communication round, with a consistenttotal client training epoch, only a small amount of communication is required to ensure a relativelysmooth performance. However, blindly increasing the total training epoch of the client model couldnot guarantee better performance. Overall, the performance of SFL does not rely on radical param-eter adjustment, it only takes a little extra resource to get the stable performance. The observationfigures related are in Appendix.
