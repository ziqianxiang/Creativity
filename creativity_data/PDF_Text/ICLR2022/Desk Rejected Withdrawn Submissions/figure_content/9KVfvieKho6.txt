Figure 1: Overall architecture of LPMARL.
Figure 2: Visual description on the experiment environmentswhere Z* is the optimal solution used in forward computation and Z； is the optimal solution of LPwith perturbed coefficient. In a backward pass, equation 13 replaces ∂JJ ∙":，in equation 12.
Figure 3: Training curve on single-step grouping environment.
Figure 4: Visual description of extreme pointsFigure 4 illustrates the extreme points of the linear programming in 3-dimensional case, where thedecision variables are (z1 , z2, z3) ∈ R3. The boundary constraints are illustrated as the surfaceof the cube, and additional constraints other than boundary constraints are illustrated as the surfacegenerated by blue lines. In figure 4 (left), extreme points corresponding only to boundary constraintsare marked as black dots, and other extreme points are marked as blue dots.
