Figure 3: OUr methods successfullyboost the influence of high-order Shap-ley values and high-order marginal ben-efits, and reduce the influence of low-order Shapley values and low-ordermarginal benefits, computed on a func-tion in (Tsang et al., 2018).

Figure 5: The learned baseline values (left) and Shapley values computed with different baselinevalues (right) on the UCI Census Income dataset. Results on the UCI South German Credit datasetare shown in Appendix E.4.
Figure 6: Sketch for the multi-variate interaction. The model output of a DNN can be decomposedinto interaction benefits I(S) of different patterns.
