Figure 1: An overview of SSR-GNNs. We take ”R” for example. The image ”R” is composed of 4 strokess = {s1, s2, s3, s4}. Each stroke is composed of 5 control points. s2 = {c12, c22, c32, c24, c25}. The 4 strokes areassociates with 4 vertices v = {v1, v2, v3, v4} in graph g. The value of vertex is the pairwise distance betweencontrol points. v2 = {φ(c2p , xq2)}pp==15,,qq==15 . The value of edge is the pairwise distance between two connectingcontrol point. e2,3 = {φ(c2p, cq3)}pp==15,,qq==15 . After passing to a learnable graph neural network(GNN), the z isthe high level representation of the image x.
Figure 2: Spatial transformation on MNIST, Quickdraw(shape), Quickdraw(body). The grid of eachrow is the rotation of -θ, 0, θ. The grid of each column is the translation of (-δx, -δy), (0, 0), (δx , δy). ForMNIST, θ = 30° ,δχ = δy = 3px. For Quickdraw, θ = 30° ,δχ = δy = 10px.

In the literature ofComputer Vision and Signal Processing, there are some notable work compositing the part represen-tation. The structural description models (Biederman, 1987; Hummel & Biederman, 1992; van denHengel et al., 2015; Kodratoff et al., 1984) is one such method, which combines the descriptionof the part components. Particularly for stroke as the part representation, one sketch image can beparsed into parts and sub-parts as strokes (Lake et al., 2015). Both take strokes as the part repre-sentation, (Lake et al., 2015) adopts a Bayesian program learning framework, which is an iterativeoptimization process searching an optimal parse, while our method yields an end-to-end trainableframework.
