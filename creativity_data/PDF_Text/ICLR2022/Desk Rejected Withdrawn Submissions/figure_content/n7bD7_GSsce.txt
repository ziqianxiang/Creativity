Figure 1: Diagram of a modular predictively cashed RL architecture.
Figure 2: Maze disambiguation experiment. A) The two possible environments. The green squarerepresents reward (+1) while the red square represents punishment (-7). The blue/purple circles aredisambiguation cues that indicate the location of the reward. The optimal course of action is to visitthe cue and then go towards the reward. B) Results of tabular PCR q-learning. The black line denotesthe median collected reward (q-loss for bottom panel) over 15 repetitions as a function of epoch.
Figure 3: The ”treasure map” experiment. A) Total training reward as function of the epoch ofPCR-TD (red), TD (blue) and Vi-TD (green) for the three grid-world environments. The dashedline denotes the average over the runs. B) Example trajectory of trained PCR-TD. No other methodlearned how to systematically reach the map.
