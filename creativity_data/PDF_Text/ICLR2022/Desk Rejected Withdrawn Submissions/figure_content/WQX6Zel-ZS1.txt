Figure 1: Illustration of the camera bias problem and our proposed camera bias regularization. (a):The positive pair (A) and (C) are far away from each other, while the negative pair (A) and (C)are close as they share the same background. (b): The gap between intra-camera and inter-cameradistance distribution is reduced by the proposed CBR.
Figure 2:	The difference between conventional Re-ID loss and camera bias regularization.
Figure 3:	Pair-wise distance distribution from a clustering-and-finetuning based unsupervised Re-IDlearning method. The experiment is conducted on Market-1501 (Zheng et al. (2015)) dataset. Themethod is based on the baseline proposed in (Ge et al. (2020a)).
