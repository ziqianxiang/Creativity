Figure 1: Consistent v.s. inconsistent taxonomy. In (a)-(f), the upper row is the source domain classes,and the lower row is the target domain classes. Circles represent classes while an arrow representsa mapping from the source domain class to the target domain class. The (a)-(c) and (d)-(f) are theexamples of the consistent and inconsistent taxonomy, respectively.
Figure 2: Framework overview. Class A is an inconsistent taxonomy class (e.g., “person”) in thesource domain, related to class A1 (e.g., “pedestrian”) and A2 (e.g., “rider”) in the target domain.
Figure 3: Performance of inconsistent taxonomy classes under open taxonomy setting, varying nt.
Figure 4: Left: Qualitative segmentation results under different inconsistent taxonomy settings. Eachgroup has the RGB image (left), the results without adaptation (middle) and adapted with our pipeline(right). Refer to the red box region for the adaptation of the inconsistent taxonomy classes. Right:t-SNE visualization of the features with/without contrastive learning under the open taxonomy setting.
Figure S1: Qualitative semantic segmentation results on the target domain under different inconsistenttaxonomy settings, open taxonomy, coarse-to-fine taxonomy and partially-overlapping taxonomy. (a)shows the RGB target domain image. (b) gives the ground truth semantic segmentation map. (c) is thesemantic segmentation result without adaptation. (d) is the semantic segmentation result adapted bythe IAST (Mei et al., 2020) method. (e) is the semantic segmentation result adapted by our proposedmethod. Refer to the red box region for the adaptation results of the inconsistent taxonomy classes.
