Figure 1: Different schedulers for multi-task learning (a) Single scheduler that adjusts the trainingpriority of one task compared to others, (b) All scheduler that dynamically adjusts the relativeimportance of each task compared to others using key performance indicators (e.g., validation loss) oftasks, (c) Proposed scheduler that learns an optimal scheduling policy by employing deep Q-learningon task uncertainties. Similar scheduling effect can be achieved via adjusting learning rate andgradient manipulation, and training queue is depicted as an example of scheduling methods.
