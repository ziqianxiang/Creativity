Figure 1: The proposed algorithm RICE on the PACS dataset. The training data are from domains{art, cartoon, photo}, and we would like the model to perform well on the sketch data. This figuredescribes the training procedure of RICE when an training image is from the art domain.
Figure 2: Squared prediction error on test data from distributions with different values of a.
Figure 3: Performance of RICE and ERM on the PACS (a-d) and VLCS (e-h) datasets with trainingdata from single domains. Figure title indicates the test domain, and the blue dashed line representsthe test accuracy when the training data are from three domains, as reported in Section 5.
Figure 4: Images of the C-MNIST dataset.
Figure 5: Synthetic data of PACS generated by CycleGAN. Columns from left to right correspond todomains of {photo, art, cartoon, sketch}, respectively. Figure title indicates the domain of originaldata, based on which the data of the rest domains in the figure are generated by CycleGAN.
Figure 6: Synthetic data of VLCS generated by CycleGAN. Columns from left to right correspondto domains of {VOC2007, LabelMe, Caltech101, SUN09}, respectively. Figure title indicates thedomain of original data, based on which the data of the rest domains in the figure are generated byCycleGAN.
