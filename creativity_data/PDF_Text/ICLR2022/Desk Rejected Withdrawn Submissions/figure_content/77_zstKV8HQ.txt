Figure 1: SimMER architecture. For a batch of B images (xb)bB=1, each image xb is augmented Ktimes through the stochastic augmentation function T to generate K views (xb,k)kK=1. All views areencoded by the encoder network FÎ¸ (backbone plus projection MLP) to generate K representations(zb,k)kK=1. To encourage consistency, we minimize the total variance across all representations ofa single image. To encourage diversity and decoupling of the feature dimension, we maximize theentropy and rank (linear independence) across the averaged representations of a batch of images.
