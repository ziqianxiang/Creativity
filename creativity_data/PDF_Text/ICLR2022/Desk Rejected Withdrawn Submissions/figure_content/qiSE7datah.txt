Figure 1: An example of applying joint pruning and quantization of both weight and feature on a convolutionlayer.
Figure 3: Generated images from CycleGAN, which can sufferfrom underpresentation of quantization because of outliers infeatures, as shown in the fourth image (rightmost).
Figure 2: Feature distribution of Cycle-GAN, and MobileNetV2 for image clas-sification, which displays a long-tailednature.
Figure 4: Evaluation of window size Tfor unstructured feature pruning5Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2022sliding window for unstructured feature pruning. Specifically, let ft denote an input feature map at time t, Tdenote the size of sliding window, s denote the target sparsity, (i, j) be row and column indices, instead ofcalculating the binary mask as in Eq. 4, we write Mft ,s in Eq. 8.
