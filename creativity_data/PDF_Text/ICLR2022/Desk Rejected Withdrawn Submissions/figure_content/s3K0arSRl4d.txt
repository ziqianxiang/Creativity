Figure 1: RSSM and TSSM. The red arrow in RSSM makes sequential computational necessary. In TSSM,we replace this by a transformer. In addition, the purple arrow should also be removed in TSSM because it alsoprevents parallelizing the updates of all time steps.

Figure 3: Comparison between DreamerV2 and TransDreamer in Hidden Order Discovery tasks5.2	Hidden Order Discovery in 3D Object RoomTo evaluate this task in a more realistic environment, we also implemented a 3D version of HiddenOrder Discovery in Unity (Juliani et al., 2020). The reward structure is the same as the 2D task,but the agent view is a 3D first-person view. Figure 2b shows an overview view of the differentconfigurations and Figure 2c shows the agent’s first-person view. Compared to the 2D environment,since the environment is larger, it takes more steps to navigate to the balls, especially in the sparsesetting. Therefore, with the 3D environment, we can evaluate how TransDreamer can handle long-term dependency and complex reasoning more clearly.
Figure 4: Imagined trajectories comparison between DreamerV2 and TransDreameractually very comparable. This may be because when the environment is sparse, the agent sees theforeground objects less frequently.
Figure 5: Comparison between Dreamer and TransDreamer on a few DMC (upper row) and Atari tasks (bottomrow) for short-term memory test. As expected, TransDreamer converges to a similar return value but slowly.

Figure 7: Image from Unity Foreground Camerabetween TransDreamer and Dreamer is 119.8, while 70.7 of the error occurs in the foreground.
Figure 8: Imagined trajectories comparison between DreamerV2 and TransDreamer given same contextA.5 World Model Imagination with Same ContextDifferent from Figure 4, in Figure 8, we illustrated imagined trajectories from TransDreamer andDreamer given the same contexts. This 5-Ball Dense sample is collected from Dreamer’s agentlearning process, so for TransDreamer, it is an out of distribution sample. This is the same contextgiven to Dreamer in Figure 4. Despite being an out of distribution sample, TransDreamer can stillcorrectly imagine the balls and predicts rewards for the purple and white balls (Green box) correctly.
