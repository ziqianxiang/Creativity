Figure 6: Training DA-ERM loss and (SQ Regularizer) for first 10 and last 140 iterations on Colored MNISTWith Adv Aug for DAIR (λ = 100). The regularizer loss on DA-ERM groWs large as it is uncontrolled. DAIR-L1is optimizing an L1 regularizer, but for unified illustration We evaluate it using (SQ Regularizer).
