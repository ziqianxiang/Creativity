Figure 1: RCL of low-level visual representationsfor noisy inputs. We use the framework of Sim-CLR (Chen et al., 2020) to illustrate the main con-cept. x is a noisy image. Xi and Xj are two ran-dom crops from the same X (a positive pair). r (âˆ™)is a residual function, defined in Eq. (4). ni andnj are two corresponding residual tensors.
Figure 2: Comparison of residual contrastive loss(illustrated with EMD) before and after training.
