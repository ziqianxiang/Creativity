Figure 1: The scheme of VQAs and quantum distributed optimization scheme (QUDIO). The left panelillustrates the workflow of conventional VQAs. The right panel presents the workflow of QUDIO, whichconsists of multiple local nodes and a central server. Each local node only manipulates a subgroup of the givenproblem in parallel, while the central server communicates with all local nodes and synchronizes their results.
Figure 2: Simulation results of QUDIO towards hand-written digits image classification. (a) Avisualization of some training examples sampled from the MNIST dataset. (b) Scaling behavior of QUDIO inclock-time for increasing number of local nodes Q for varied number of local steps W. The labels â€˜ W = a(I)' and 'W = a (N)' refer that the total number of local iterations is W = a under the ideal and NISQscenarios respectively. The hyper-parameters settings for the NISQ case are p = 10-5 and K = 100. (c) Theachieved test accuracy of QUDIO with varied W and Q in the NISQ scenario, where the hyper-parameterssettings are same with those described in (b).

Figure 5: The test accuracy of QUDIO with varied depolarization rate and the number ofmeasurements. The label 'K = a' refers that the number of measurements K is set as a.
