Figure 1: A toy example ofIL frompurely safe expert trajectories.
Figure 2: Learning curves of LGAIL and the other baselines on Safety Gym benchmarks. Perfor-mance is measured with Cost, Cost Rate, and Return. The x-axis represents time steps of interactionswith the environment. Each algorithm is evaluated with 5 random seeds.
Figure 3: Impact of the cost limit on LGAIL With purely unsafe expert data. In the legendlGaiL.CL{x}, X represents the cost limit d0.
Figure 4: Impact of the number of expert data on GAIL with purely safe expert data. In the legendGAILTraj{x}, x represents the number of expert trajectories.
