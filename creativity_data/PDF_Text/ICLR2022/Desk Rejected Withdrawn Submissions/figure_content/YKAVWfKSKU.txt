Figure 1:	The performance of the presented methods improve significantly using the learned fea-tures, demonstrating DDPM's ability of learning better representation. The experiment is conductedon HAR(ISt row) and MNIST(2nd row). 81-means means k-means with k = 81, etc.
Figure 2:	The generated numbers of MNIST from DDPM cluster centers with noise scale 4.5.
Figure 3:	The representation learning process of DDPM on MNIST. See the most evident example:the cluster of number 1 gets denser and more concentrated as the training progresses.
