Figure 1: Randomly selected example perturbations to ImageNet datapoint (class “schooner"). Left:unaltered base image. Middle: ε = 8/255 perturbation. Right: ε = 16/255 perturbation.
Figure 2: Example CIFAR-10 Image crafted with different regularizers. From left to right: cleanimage, no regularizer, `2 regularization, SSIM regularization, TV regularization. All crafted withperturbation bound ε = 8/255.
Figure 3: Samples of poisoned CelebA images. Top: unaltered images. Middle: ε = 8/255. Bottom:ε= 16/255.
