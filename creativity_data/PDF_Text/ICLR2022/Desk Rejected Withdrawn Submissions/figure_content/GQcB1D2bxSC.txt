Figure 2: Median test win % for hard (a-C), and super-hard (d-f) maps of SMAC.
Figure 3: Visualisation of the evaluation for SHAQ and baselines on 3m in SMAC: each coloredcircle is the centered attacking range of a controllable agent (in red), and each agent’s factorisedQ-value is reported on the right. We mark the direction that each agent face by an arrow for clearness.

Figure 6:	Median test win % for easy (1st row) and hard (2nd row) maps of SMAC for W-QMIXwith different α.
Figure 7: Median test win % for 3 maps of SMAC to Compare SHAQ with SQDDPG.
Figure 8:	Visualisation of the evaluation for SHAQ and baselines on 3s5z_vs_3s6z in SMAC: eachcolored circle is the centered attacking range of a controllable agent (in red), and each agent’sfactorised Q-value is reported on the right. We mark the direction that each moving agent face by anarrow.
Figure 9:	Median test return for Predator-Prey evaluated with SQDDPG and W-QMIX (inlcudingCW-QMIX and OW-QMIX). For SQDDPG, p=-2 and the epsilon annealing steps are 1 mil. ForW-QMIX, we evaluate the performances on p=-0.5,-1,-2 and the epsilon annealing steps are 50k.
