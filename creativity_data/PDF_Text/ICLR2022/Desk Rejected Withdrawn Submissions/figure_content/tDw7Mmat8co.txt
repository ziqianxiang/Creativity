Figure 1: Cumulative reward curves for VPG, TRPO, PPO and our CPPO. The x-axes indicate thenumber of steps interacting with the environment, and the y-axes indicate the performance of theagent, including average rewards with standard deviations.
Figure 2: Cumulative reward curves for VPG, TRPO, PPO and our CPPO under observation dis-turbance. The x-axes indicate the range of the disturbance, and the y-axes indicate the averageperformance of the algorithm under the state disturbance.
