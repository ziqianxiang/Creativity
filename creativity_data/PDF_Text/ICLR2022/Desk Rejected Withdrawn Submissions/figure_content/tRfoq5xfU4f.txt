Figure 1: Finetuning LCCS has best performance when support set is extremely small (k â‰¤ 3).
Figure 2:	Challenges in applying time-time BN statistics, demonstrated on VisDA dataset with t-SNE plots of features at last BN layer of ResNet-101. Best viewed in color.
Figure 3:	When using nearest-neighbor classifier, finetuning LCCS almost always has better per-formance than FLUTE for all values of k tested. Finetuning LCCS followed by FLUTE tends toimprove performance further with larger k, eXcept on VisDA.
Figure 4: LCCS values selected at ini-tialization stage.
Figure 5: VisDA (k = 1): Cross entropy, compared to en-tropy, on support set is more indicative of test performance.
