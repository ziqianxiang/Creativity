Figure 1: Sharpness-Generalization plots of VGG11 (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2015) trained on CIFAR-10. To measure the correlation between sharpness and generalization, we compute the R2 score betweenlog (sharpness) and test accuracy. We found all three sharpness measures have negative correlations with gen-eralization performance. Results on other metrics, datasets, and network architectures are presented in Ap-pendix B.
Figure 2: Evolution of parameters and corresponding C for no-bias decayed ResNet18 trained on CIFAR-10dataset with 8k batch and LAMB optimizer.
Figure 3: Evolution of parameters and corresponding C for ResNet18 with weight decay on correspondingparameter on CIFAR-10 dataset with 8k batch and LAMB optimizer. (a) shows the relationship on β decayednetwork, (b) shows the relationship on γ-decayed network and (c) shows the relationship on original weightdecayed network (apply weight decay on all parameters). Note that in all three cases, the weight decay on otherparameters except β, γ is applied following the standard.
