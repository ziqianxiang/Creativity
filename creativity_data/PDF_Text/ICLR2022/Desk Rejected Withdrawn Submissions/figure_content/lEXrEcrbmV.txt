Figure 1: (Left) Generation of hard samples and pairs of hard positives, and the training of the mainmodel and generator. We generate two similar but distinct raw samples, and use two views of eachraw sample (four views in total) as positives. No labels are used in the generation of these twosimilar raw samples. (Right) The generated positive pair becomes progressively harder by trackingthe training state of the main model.
Figure 2: Effectiveness of hard samples, positive pairs, and hard positive pairs. Enabling thecomponents in the proposed approaches one by one accumulatively improves the performance. Gis using a separate generator, G+Hard is jointly optimizing G and the main model to generate hardsamples, G+Pos. is G with positive pair generation, and G+P. +Hard is the proposed approach withall the components enabled. Top-1 accuracy of linear classification is reported.
