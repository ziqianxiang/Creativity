Figure 1: Test accuracy against training time of all the methods in classification with pairwiseconstraints (We stop the algorithms if the training time is more than 10000 seconds).
Figure 2: Test accuracy against training time of all the methods in classification with fairnessconstraints (We stop the algorithms if the training time is more than 10000 seconds).
