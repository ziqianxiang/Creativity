Figure 1: A schematic of the sound model factory is shown in this figure. (a) Curated datasetsand optionally parameters from meta-data (b) are used to train the GAN (c). A subspace is chosenfrom the resulting latent space which is then adaptively adjusted using a Self-Organizing Map (d).
Figure 2: The SOM adapting to reduce differences between mesh neighbors of the function value.
Figure 3: (a) Parameter changes and spectrogram of RNN output for (a) an arpeggio over an octave(midi number 64, 68, 71, 76) followed by a one octave glide. The PRT is more precisely quantifiedin (b) for a descending one-octave glide (MIDI note 76-64), the period of the waveform centeredat the 11000 sample mark matches the gliding pitch parameter of MIDI note 70.5 (34.35 samplewavelength) exactly at that point, and (c) for pitch step where we identify peaks before and afterthe pitch change (green line) to show that the wave period changes immediately after the pitch stepsfrom MIDI 64 (48.56 sample wavelength) to 68 (38.53 sample wavelength).
Figure 4: Logit values from the penultimate output layer of the audio classifier for the two sets of 143test audio files, one set from the GAN, and the other from the proposed SMF model (GAN+RNN).
Figure 5: Spectrograms of a steady-pitch trumpet-clarinet-trumpet glide with an RNN (a) trained atendpoints only, (b) trained with intermediate synthetic data from GAN. (c) Parameter sequence for a“reinterpreted” opening segment of George Gershwin’s Rhapsody in Blue with glides, various notelengths, vibrato, and a continuous clarinet-to-trumpet instrument morph (audition online6).
