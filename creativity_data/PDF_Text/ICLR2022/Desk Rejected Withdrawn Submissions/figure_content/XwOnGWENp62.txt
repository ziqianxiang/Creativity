We experimented three network sizes (see Table. 2) and all the resulting displace-ment field solutions are close to the benchmark solution. For the stress concentration point andthe corresponding maximum von Mises stress σvm , we found larger network size performs betterw.r.t the approximation of this near singular point’s stress. A four layer network with 32 neurons ineach hidden layer can archive closer maximum σvm , see the last row in Table 2. One problem weencountered is that beyond this 2-32-32-32-2 network structure, we are not able to further increasethe estimated value of the maximum σvm comparing to the benchmark solution. One explanationis that when the network gets larger, it also introduces more and more local minimums for this non-convex nonlinear optimization problem, and thus increases the training difficulties. Another factorthat might play a role here is the numerical quadrature. An adaptive quadrature point selection mighthelp for getting a more precise approximation of the energy functional for the numerical integration.
