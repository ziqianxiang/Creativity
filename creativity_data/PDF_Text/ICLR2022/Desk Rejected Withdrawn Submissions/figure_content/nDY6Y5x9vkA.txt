Figure 1: Attachment operation. The adopted ranges for sampled transformations in (Athalye et al.,2018) are α ∈ (-22.5°, 22.5°) and Y ∈ (0.9,1.4), and α, Y are sampled uniformly at random fromtheir ranges. Note the difference between background image X and image background Xback . Thiswork refers Xback to the remaining pixels in X except for the pixels of patch P .
Figure 2: EoT v.s. the two-stage data-free APG framework. All the patches are initialised withuniform random noise and are of the same target class y0 . DF-EoT differs from EoT in the followingstep: i) background update, ii) multiple-time patch update and iii) restart selection. It first takesa set of initialised patches {P1 , P2, ...} as input one by one, then generates adversarial patches{P1, P2>,...} of the same target class, and last selects the final output patch through the restartselection step. Note that, EoT can be used as the APG method in the PG stage, while this workapplies the proposed DF-EoT.
Figure 3: APS calculation process. The EoT takes initialised patches {P1, P2, ..., Pk} as inputone by one, and generates adversarial patches {Pj, P2,..., Pk=} of k different target classes. Thenotation P； (y1) denotes the patch P； of target class y1.
Figure 4: PS calculation process. Omitting T and L in the attachment operation A refers to that thepatch P = is put on the centre of the background image, and none of transformations is applied onP = .

Figure 7: APSs for different background image selection. The target model is VGG-19, the con-sidered background images for APS calculation includes a black image, white image and uniform-random-noise image.
