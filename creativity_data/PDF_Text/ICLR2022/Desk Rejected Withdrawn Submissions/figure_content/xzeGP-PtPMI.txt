Figure 1: Network architecture. The critic andpolicy of each agent take input as its own observa-tion and received message. The message includesthe observations of all other agents and actionsof upper-level agents. Note that the world modeltakes as input the received joint observation andestimated joint actions.
Figure 2: Sequential communication. There are two communication phases, negotiation phase (left)and launching phase (right). In the negotiation phase, agents communicate observations with othersand obtain their own intentions. The priority of decision-making is determined by sharing andcomparing the value of all the intentions. In the launching phase, the agents hold the upper-levelpositions will make decision prior to the lower-level agents. Besides, their actions will be shared toanyone that has not yet made a decision.

Figure 4: Illustration of learned priority of decision making in PP (upper panel) and CN (lowerpanel). Preys (landmarks) are viewed in black and predators (agents) are viewed in grey in PP(CN). From a to e, shown is the priority order. The smaller the level index, the higher priority ofdecision-making is.

Figure 6: Ablation studies on the priority of decision-making in PP, CN and 3s_vs_4z. Fix-C: thepriority of decision-making is fixed throughout one episode. Random-C: the priority of decision-making is determined randomly.
