Figure 1: An overview of the proposed framework. DynaShare for multi-task learning enablesdynamic selection of layers based on both the specific task and the individual input instance. Atinference time, the selected layers for tasks is fixed but the network operates dynamically based onthe input instance: the forward path is modified based on the computation needed for that particularinstance. The gating unit for instance decision making consists of two parts: a) estimating relevanceof an input to the layer b) making decision for executing the layer based on the relevance metric.
