Figure 1: Experiments on MNIST with DP budget (, δ) = (0.4, 10-5) after 5 × 103 steps for bothDP-SGD and proposed dynamic DP-SGD. In comparison to SGD without DP protection, DP-SGDis unstable and has a ramp-up period. In contrast, the gradient norm is stabilized by the proposeddynamic DP-SGD.
Figure 2: Consumption of privacy bud-get with different μt increasing rate.
Figure 3: Dynamic DP-SGD performance is robust to ρμ and ρc.
Figure 4: Upper bound (advanced RDP) and lower bound (extended GDP CLT) of the dynamicDP-SGD privacy budget cost curves. The true privacy cost curve must lie somewhere between thesetwo limits. The result of extended CLT for GDP is reasonable because the privacy cost differencesbetween these two limits are small, especially in the high privacy protection region.
