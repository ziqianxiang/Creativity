Figure 1: PairWise 3D geometric shape assembly. Neural Shape Mating (NSM) takes a Pair of point clouds ofthe fractured shapes as input and predicts the assembled configuration as output. NSM learns to assemble shapeswith self-supervision and does not require semantic information or target shape as guidance during test time.
Figure 2: Overview of Neural Shape Mating. Neural Shape Mating is composed of four main components:a point cloud encoder E, a pose estimation module that consists of a Transformer network T and a regressornetwork R, an implicit shape reconstruction module that learns signed distance functions (SDFs), and adiscriminator D for learning shape priors.
Figure 3: Dataset overview. (Left) Our dataset is composed of object meshes from three categories. (Middle)We define five different types of cut functions. Each object mesh can then be cut with many different ways usingvarying parametric cut functions. (Right) Finally, each pair of parts can be randomized with an initial SE(3)pose. In our dataset, we also generate solid and hollow/shell variations of each shape, when cutting a mesh tocreate different mating interfaces for the same problem instance.
