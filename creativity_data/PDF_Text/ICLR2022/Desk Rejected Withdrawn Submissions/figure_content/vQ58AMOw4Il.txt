Figure 1: A hermit is someone who chooses to live alone, thus someone who is not a member ofa group of other people. Analogous to this concept, we introduce the term hermitry to representhow close a data point is to a distribution. The further away a person (data point) is from a group(distribution), the more likely it is that they are a hermit (OOD). The threshold determines whethera data point is in-distribution (ID) or OOD. The value for this threshold is determined by the 95thpercentile of validation class distance from the training class data.
Figure 2: To measure the degree of hermitry of a data sample generated by a perturbation method,we measure the Mahalanobis distance from the encoding of the class dataset to the encoding of theperturbed sample. The larger the Mahalanobis distance, the further away from the true distributionthe data is. The features from model layer L are used as encodings of the data samples.
Figure 3: Mahalanobis distances (normalized) of perturbed sample encodings to the training dataset encodings. The gray parts of the distribution represent thesamples that are in distribution with low hermitry. The black parts represent the samples that are OOD with high hermitry. The threshold is determined using the 95thpercentile of the validation dataset,s Mahalanobis distances.
