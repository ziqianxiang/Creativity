Figure 2: Test MSE (mean±std.) of RF regression as a function of the ratio m/n on MNIST data set (digit 3 vs. 7)across the Gaussian kernel, for d = 784 and n = 600 in (a) and (b). The interpolation threshold occurs at 2m = n dueto σ(Wx) ∈ R2m. Under this setting, the trends of Bias and Variance are empirically given in (c) and (d).
