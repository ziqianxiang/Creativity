Figure 1: Illustration of rare event in images using solar burst and associated challenges todetect them. In the first row, we can see that there are different shapes of bursts. In the second row,we can see that positions of bursts are not fixed. In the third row, we can see that even color patchesof bursts are not the same. In the fourth row, we can observe that noise signals are also presentin burst images themselves. In the last row we can see Non-Burst signals but have similarity withbursts images.
Figure 2: The working pipeline of our proposed GMBM model. The guidance is provided to MCMCfor Bayesian Models that give importance to rare events in images while learning the image-eventdistribution.
Figure 3: Summary of Precision, Recall, F1 score on four synthetic Burst datasets of Burst class.
Figure 4: Samples of four solar radio images are shown here. The first two images contains Burstand last two images are Non-Burst which contains only noise signals.
Figure 5: Samples of four synthetic solar radio images are shown here. The first two images containsBurst and last two images are Non-Burst which contains only noise signals.
