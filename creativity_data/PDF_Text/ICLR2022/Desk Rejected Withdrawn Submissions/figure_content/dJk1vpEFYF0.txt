Figure 1: Performance on MNIST for different K With N = 40, α = 1, λ = 12, R = 10, S = 5.
Figure 2: Performance on FMNIST for different K with N = 40, α = 1, λ = 12, R = 10, S = 5.
Figure 3: Further evaluation on CGPFL-Heur on MNIST and FMNIST datasetsthat our designed heuristic algorithm CGPFL-Heur can effectively reach a near-optimal trade-offand consequently achieve the near-optimal model accuracy.
