Figure 2: Visualization of a random mutagen molecule from Mutagenicity and its importantsubstructures for accurate prediction captured by different interpretation techniques. Different nodecolors indicate different atom types. (a) depicts the original molecule with important mutagenic atomgroups circled in red, such as NO2 and NH2 . (b), (c), and (d) demonstrate important substructuresdetected by different methods. (e) is a heatmap for the edge importance scores computed by AWARE.
Figure S1:	Effect of T and r0 on the prediction performance on the 12 tasks in the Tox21 dataset.
Figure S2:	Effect of the number of linear layers L in the fully connected neural network for graph-level prediction and the vertex embedding dimension r on the prediction performance on the 2 tasksin the CLINTOX dataset. For each pair of L and r hyperparameter values, the model was run on 5different seeds of data and the average of the 5 runs is reported. Higher is better.
Figure S3: Additional examples for interpretation from the Mutagenicity dataset and their impor-tant substructures for accurate prediction captured by different interpretation techniques. Differentnode colors indicate different atom types. (a) depicts the original molecule with important mutagenicatom groups circled in red, such as NO2 and NH2 . (b), (c), and (d) demonstrate important substruc-tures detected by different methods. (e) is a heatmap showing the edge importances computed byAWARE ([S(T)]ij + [S(T)]ji for edge (i, j)). If the importance is greater than or equal to 1.0, theedge is considered important as in (d). AWARE successfully discovers the important substructures.
