Figure 1: Here we show an simulated example of evaluating image classification performance of twomodels with Top-1/5 Accuracy and NDCG@5. The Top-1/5 Accuracy of two models are exactly thesame, and can not differentiate the two models. While NDCG@5 can successfully tell that Model 1has a better classification performance than Model 2.
