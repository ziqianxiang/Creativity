Figure 1: Study on hyper-parametersaverage classification accuracy of RLGC* is significantly better than that of RLGC, which provethat the proposed AR-WWD metric is valuable for RLGLC. Compare RLGLC with RLGC*, we canobserve that the average classification accuracy of RLGLC is significantly better than that of RLGC*,which demonstrates that the local consistency module is effective.
