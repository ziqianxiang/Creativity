Figure 3: (a) Distribution of codeword assignment for each phoneme by IQ with |Y| = 824 and pre-dieted segmentation on TIMIT. Each row of the plot is the empirical distribution for P^∖z(∙∣z), 1 ≤Z ≤ K, where the phonemes are sorted top-to-bottom with decreasing max,，P*^∣z(z0∣z). (b) Theoverall phoneme discovery results of all models on TIMIT.
