Figure 1: Circles denote instances with clean positive labels, and triangles denote instances with cleannegative labels. Different signs represent different noisy labels. Black lines denote decision boundaries. Theexample which is far away from the black line is more confident. The confident examples are in the bluedashed box. (a) A binary training dataset contains asymmetric label noise. (b) An illustration of confidentexamples selected by current sample selection methods based on the small loss on noisy data. The instances(circles) in the class with a smaller noise rate are easier to learn based on the memorization effect. As a result,those instances are more confident and far away from the decision boundary. (c) An illustration of confidentexamples selected by our method, which are more robust to label noise. By exploiting the transition matrix,the estimated clean class posteriors can be employed to select and relabel confident examples.
