Figure 4: Haar FiltersA.3 Experimental ResultsIn this section, several experiments that demonstrate properties of SDT are presented.
Figure 5: The horizontal axis shows the iteration number of SDT for a single node. Vertical axisshows the impurity. The dashed line represents the impurity of the best feature and threshold. Thepoints on the curves represent exact impurity of the best split found by the algorithm at that iteration.
Figure 6: Feature importance of features by SDT at each iteration for problem of0 versus 1. Brighterpixels show higher value of FI and darker pixels show lower value of FI.
Figure 7:	Feature importance of features by SDT at each iteration for problem of 1 versus 7. Brighterpixels show higher value of FI and darker pixels show lower value of FI.
Figure 8:	Horizontal axis represents the computational complexity of training a model. The verticalaxis shows the error ratio. The colors represent the used value for N0 .
Figure 9:	Horizontal axis represents the computational complexity of training a model. The verticalaxis shows the error ratio. The colors represent the used value for N0 .
