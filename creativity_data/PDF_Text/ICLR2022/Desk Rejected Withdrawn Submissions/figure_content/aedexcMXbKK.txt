Figure 1: The performance of ResNet on CIFAR-10 by DP-SGD with ε = 2, δ = 0.0001. (a) isthe result in the training set, we see that both the ResNet 18 and ResNet 50 with noise or withoutnoise obtain 98% classification accuracy, respectively. (b) is the result in the test set, we see thatthe performance of ResNet 50 and ResNet 18 under noiseless condition is the same but ResNet50causes much lower test accuracy than ResNet18.
Figure 2: Distribution for classes in different situations. For the left figure, feature 1 of two distribu-tions is almost no overlap which means this feature is powerful to distinguish class while feature 2is not so powerful. For the right, both features have overlap. But feature 2 is merely over 1/2 whilefeature 1 is about 3/4, so feature 2 is more powerful now.
Figure 3: Comparison for different DP parameters and selection. For our algorithm, only 20 featurescan generate a model with the highest accuracy in all DP settings while no selection model cannotreach the best with noise.
Figure 4: Results for the numerical dataset. The left figure shows that our DFS maintains stablefor p < 30 while t-statistic climbing all the time. Right shows that for fixed p, comparing witht-statistic, DFS obtain higher accuracy with the same DP budget ε.
Figure 5: Results for RCV1. The left figure shows when the dimension of feature comes to 9, bothalgorithm reaches the best accuracy while DFS gets 0.06 test error. Right shows for DP budget εfrom 1 to 6, test error of DFS is much smaller than that of t-statistic.
