Figure 1: Proposed architecture. Our network takes an input shape in the form of a point cloud, andoutputs the spectral CoefiCients of our PDE-based distance field.
Figure 2: CaptionThe contributions of our 3D reconstruction method are three-fold:â€¢	We approach the problem of implicit shape representation by estimating the distance field asthe solution of a linear elliptic PDE.
Figure 3: Poisson distance learning results. We show the results of our approach on the first row,against the ground truth meshes in the second row. Notice that our method produces smooth surfacefrom no supervision.
