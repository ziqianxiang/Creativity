Figure 1: Watermarking framework of IP protection and ownership verification for NLG modelsUsera statistical model M such thatθ = argmax	Pθ (yt∣y<t, x)	(1)θ,(x,y)∈D t=1where y<t indicates all tokens before the time-step t. At each time-step t, M receives the wholesource sequence x and the partial target sequence y<t. Then M is trained to predict the token ytwith the maximum probability. We implement two downstream tasks in our experiments: NeuralMachine Translation and Dialog Generation. Both of them can be explained by Eq.1.
