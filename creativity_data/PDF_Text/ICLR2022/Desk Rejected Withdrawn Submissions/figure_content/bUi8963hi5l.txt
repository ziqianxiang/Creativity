Figure 1: (a) Deterministic embedding can hardly handle the multiplicity; b) Probabilistic embeddingsuffers from misaligned subspace; c) We propose a new method to enlarge the aligned subspace.
Figure 2: Evaluation of similarity cali-bration on limited training data.
Figure 3: Ablation study on the number of data augmentations. More augmentations contribute tohigher Recall-Precision due to more accurate distribution estimation.
