Figure 1: Motivating example: the architecture of (a) normal and (b)reduction cells discovered by our method. We observe that cells aredominated by 5x5 separable convolutions, which may not be wellrecommended in NAS literature. Nevertheless, its performance canbe improved by 0.5% by suited data augmentation policy, achieving97.91% accuracy on CIFAR-10. Detailed comparison on the defaultaugmentation policies and our searched ones is reported in Table 4.
