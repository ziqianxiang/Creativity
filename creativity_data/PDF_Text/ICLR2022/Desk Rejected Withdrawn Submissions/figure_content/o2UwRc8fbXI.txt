We add an experimenton the effect of AM on GIN, the model with the best classification performance in all the baselinemethods, and record its test accuracy results on different datasets in Table 3. Moreover, to showthe explainability of AdaGCCN on different datasets, we compare the D and W selected by theassistant module with the original depth and width in CapsGNN in Table 5 in Appendix A.
