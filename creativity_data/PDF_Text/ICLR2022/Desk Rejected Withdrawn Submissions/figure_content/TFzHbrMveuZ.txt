Figure 1: Left shows a 3rd order tensor. Middle describes the corresponding mode-i fibers of thetensor. Fibers are the higher-order analogue of matrix rows and columns. A fiber is defined by fixingevery index but one. Right describes the corresponding mode-i unfolding of the tensor. The mode-iunfolding of a tensor arranges the mode-i fibers to be the columns of the resulting matrix.
