Figure 1: Left three: compared with RMTPP, NHP and FullyNN, our E-NTPP (here only using theexpressive module) can more effectively approximate the limit of integral density F in Eq. 8, namelythe accumulated probability for next event occurrence is 1 for non-terminating TPP as embodied byHawkes, Self-Correcting simulation data and NYSE real-word data. Right most: actual inter-eventtime dj +1 = tj +1 - tj in blue and its prediction dj+1 = tj +1 - tj with expectation predictions in åorange by Eq. 9 for fitting Hawkes process by RMTPP. Note in this example, most prediction dj+1are below zero i.e. the prediction is earlier than the current time and meaningless.

Figure 6: Overview of EPI-NTPP. We propose E-NTPP to improve the expressiveness, P-NTPPto improve the predictability and I-NTPP to improve the interpretability of neural TPP. Thesethree components are orthogonal to each other, which can be used together to improve the overallperformance.

Figure 8: Error bars for RMSE results and negative log-likelihood on synthetic and real-worlddatasets. Median, adaptive and expectation predictions are shown in first three columns and thelast column is for NLLLoss. These error bars are statistically obtained by testing models on a largenumber of different batches of data.
