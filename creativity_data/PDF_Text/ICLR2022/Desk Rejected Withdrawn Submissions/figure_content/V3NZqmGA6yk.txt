Figure 2: Biased-MNIST and relative significance of different confounding variable according toMoSIP.
Figure 3: Trend in MoSIP sensitivity as a function of bias correlation and validation of MoSIP onBiased-MNIST metadata(b) Change in accuracy when different features ofBiased-MNIST are changed sequentially from most-to-least important (left) and vice-versa (right)MoSIP to ImageNet-1K (Russakovsky et al., 2015) and a subset of the CNN architectures. AlexNet,VGG-16, Inception-v3, and ResNet-50. In particular, we use MoSIP to explore how these CNNsevolved over time (Alom et al., 2018).
Figure 4: Average change in the accuracy of the models when certain percentage of regions aremasked based on μ*, σ, and μ* + σ. (TOP) Most important. (BOTTOM) Least important.
Figure 5: Results from local experiments testing the difference in important regions betweenAlexNet and more modern CNNs.
Figure 6: Evolution of CNN’s over time with respect to use of correlated featuresThese results imply that the difference between AlexNet and modern CNNs is not the extractionof fundamentally different semantic features, but more pronounced use of non-linearities and in-teractions in these features. The stronger use of interactions can lead to stronger exploitation ofcorrelations in the data when making decision.

Figure 8: Architecture that is trained on Biased-MNIST data, and used to perform sensitivity analy-sis on test data.
Figure 9: Average change in score of the ground truth component of the model output when certainpercentage of regions are masked. The top graphs show When the most important μ*, σ, and μ* + σare masked. The bottom shows when the least important are changed. All the inputs used in this testare those for which the model made accurate predictions.
Figure 10: Average change in the accuracy of the models when certain percentage of regions aremasked using global values of μ*, σ, and μ* + σ. (TOP) Most Important. (BOTTOM) LeastImportant.
