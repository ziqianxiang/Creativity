Figure 1: Illustration of the proposed GCL framework, consisting of multilayer perceptrons, labelprediction head f θ (∙), neighborhood prediction head gγ (∙), which is mainly optimized by three con-sistency constraints: Neighborhood Consistency, Label Consistency, and Class-center Lonsistency.
Figure 2: Ablation study on three consistency constraints.
