Figure 1: Influence decomposition. The traditional influence (including Stability and Plasticity)refer to the testing phase, where the training set influence the testing set via the trained model. Bydecomposing, the task-level influence can be expressed as the gather of example-level influence,which may guide the LL training itself.
Figure 2: One-step update of MetaSP Algorithm. At each iteration in LL training, MetaSP ini-tializes two weights for Stability and Plasticity and update in pseudo to obtain the Stability-awareand Plasticity-aware parameters. Then, two validation sets for old tasks (Vold) sampled from mem-ory buffer and for new task (Vnew) from the current training dataset are used to update the weights.
