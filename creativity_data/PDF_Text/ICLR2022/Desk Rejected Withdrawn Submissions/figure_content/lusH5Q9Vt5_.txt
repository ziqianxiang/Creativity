Figure 1: t-SNE visualization for 5 randomly sampled novel classes for DC (left) and our methodDC+ (right) in miniImagenet dataset. The support points are indicated with a ’+’ sign within blackcircles, sampled points are semi-transparent indicated with a ’o’ sign, and the query points areopaque denoted by ’*’. Note that our sampled points are on average closer to the query points.
Figure 2: Left: Novel class estimate X0 as a function of μi for a 1 dimensional example. X is atorigin. Note that as base class i moves away from X, the error in DC's estimation of X0 accumulates.
Figure 3: Left: Accuracy v/s n the number of sampled features for validation and novel classesin 5way-1shot Stanford Dogs dataset. Right: Accuracy v/s α1, α2 in 5way-1shot Stanford Dogsdataset. The accuracy for each point for both n and α1, α2 experiment is an average over 200 tasks.
Figure 4: t-SNE visualization for 5 randomly sampled novel classes for DC (left) and our methodDC+ (right) for miniImagenet, supplementing the visualization in the main text section. The sup-port points are indicated with a ’+’ sign within black circles, sampled points are semi-transparentindicated with a ’o’ sign, and the query points are opaque denoted by ’*’. Note that our sampledpoints ( o ) are on average closer to the ground truth query points ( * ).
Figure 5: Histogram visualization of weights wi for meta-tieredImagenet (top) and miniImagenet(bottom) for both 5way-1shot (left) and 5way-5shot (right) tasks. Note how the weights in meta-tieredImagenet are at least an order of magnitude smaller than miniImagenet.
