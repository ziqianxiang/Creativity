Figure 1: Shortcomings present in existing facial identification datasetsFurther, many categories in CelebA are subjective and/or harmful. For example, there is a label for“Attractive,” “Big Nose/Lips,” or “Chubby.”We found that some identities have exclusively black and white images (Figure 1c), making ittrivial to identity two photos as being of the same label.
