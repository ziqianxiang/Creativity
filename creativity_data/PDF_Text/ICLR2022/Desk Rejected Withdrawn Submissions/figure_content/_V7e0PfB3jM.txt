Figure 1: The SDP violation rate with respect to λ for noisy '0-SSC, Noisy-DR-'0-SSC and Noisy-DR-'0-SSC-OSNAP with different noise levels σ2. The SDP violation rates of Noisy-DR-'0-SSCand that for Noisy-DR-'0-SSC-OSNAP are almost the same, so their curves largely overlap eachother.
Figure 2: illustration of an external subspace. All the data Y are normalized to have unit norm forillustration purpose, so they lie on the surface of the sphere. S1 and S2 are tWo subspaces in thethree-dimensional ambient space. The subspace spanned by yi ∈ S1 and yj ∈ S2 is an externalsubspace, and the intersection of this external subspace and S1 is a dashed line yi OA.
