Figure 1: Transfer learning framework consisting of feature extractor f , classifier hS on the sourcedomain and hT on the target domain. For input x, f(x)	= z returns the representations, whilehS(z)	= hS (f (x)) and hT (z) = hT (f (x)) return the predictions on source and target domainrespectively. To make transfer learning provably robust, we propose to apply median smoothing onf, and to enforce a Lipschitz constraint on hS and hT. Then, given a ball Br (x) of radius r aroundthe clean x, we can compute a set that is guaranteed to contain the representations z0 = f(x0) for allx0 âˆˆBr (x) (grey box). After propagating this set through hT we check if the prediction changes.
