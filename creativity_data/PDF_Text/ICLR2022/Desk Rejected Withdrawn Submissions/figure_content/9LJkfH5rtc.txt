Figure 1: A diagram illustrating the proposed anomaly detection pipelinegreater representation power. With our method, a comparison between one class model vs all-classesmodel, on the MVTec Anomaly Detection Dataset, would only be possible using networks with fewchannels in the activation maps: we do not have enough examples for each class to adopt deeperlayers. As it is shown later, this would noticeably lower the performance.
Figure 2: The graph shows the average reconstruction error for each spatial location of the activationmap, over the training dataset. With the settings of experiments of subsection A.1, the learneddictionaries have a lower reconstruction error than the fixed DCT dictionary.
Figure 3: The graph on the top shows the average reconstruction error for each spatial location ofthe activation map, over the training dataset. With the settings of experiments of subsection A.2, thehigher the number of iterations the lower the reconstruction error. The surface plot on the bottomshows the same average reconstruction error for 50 iterations run only. Spatial dimension are herepreserved.
Figure 4: The graph shows the average reconstruction error for each spatial location of the activationmap, over the training dataset. The increased sparsity level is causing a higher reconstruction error.
Figure 5: The graph on the top shows the average reconstruction error for each spatial location ofthe activation map over the test set, for the experiment run with 64 as sparsity level. The graph onthe bottom shows the same error for the experiment run with 192 as sparsity level.
