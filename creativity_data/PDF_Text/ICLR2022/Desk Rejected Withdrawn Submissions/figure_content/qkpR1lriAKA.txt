Figure 1: Few-shot Counting. Given an image containing multiple instances of a novel class andfew examples of the class to be counted (shown in red), few-shot counting requires predicting theoverall count for the novel class in the image. We present a density map estimation based approachfor few-shot counting, and the overall count for the novel class is obtained by summing all of thevalues in the density map.
Figure 2: Vicinal Counting Net consists of a generator which augments the training data, and aregressor which learns to predict the density map. The count can be obtained by summing all thevalues in the density map. The regressor is trained on the original and synthesized images. Thegenerator is used only during training.
