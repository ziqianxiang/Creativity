Figure 1: Problem setup and motivation. (a) Different from previous FSL settings, CDCS-FSLassumes a domain gap exists between the support set and query set, and additional unlabeled targetdata are provided in the meta-training stage. (b) To address CDCS-FSL, we propose a bi-directionalprototypical alignment strategy, which pushes feature vectors of one domain to be gathered aroundthe prototypes in the other domain, and separates feature vectors of different classes.
Figure 2: Framework. In the representation learning phase, we pre-train a feature extractor withthe proposed bi-directional prototypical alignment strategy to learn compact and aligned representa-tions. In the evaluation phase, we fix the feature extractor and train a new linear classification headwith the support set. The entire model is tested on the query set.
Figure 3: (a)-(d) t-SNE visualization of feature distribution at different training epochs. Samplesof the same class are painted in similar colors, where darker triangles represent source samples andlighter reverted triangles represent target samples (best viewed in color). Class centers are markedin black border. (e) Domain distance on novel classes. (f)-(g) Separability among novel classes inthe source and target domains. Separability is represented by the average distance ratio, the lowerthe better.
