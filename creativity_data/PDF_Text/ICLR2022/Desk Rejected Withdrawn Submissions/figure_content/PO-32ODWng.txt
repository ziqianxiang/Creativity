Figure 1: In probe scaling, d linear probes are injected into the intermediate representations of theneural network. Each probe is trained to maximize a proper score, such as the cross-entropy. Af-terward, the logits of all probes are concatenated together to form a new representation. Finally, aclassifier with d parameters (shown as β's) is trained to output the calibrated scores using a 1D Con-volutional layer with strides d (equivalent to matrix multiplication) followed by softmax activations.
Figure 2: Reliability diagrams are plotted for all five calibration methods when ResNet50 is trainedon CIFAR100. Red shaded regions indicate the discrepancy between the confidence of the classifierand its accuracy. In general, both temperature scaling and probe scaling perform better than theother post-hoc methods with probe scaling performing best overall (see details in Section 3).
Figure 3: The relative contribution of each probe is plotted as a function of its relative depth. Inclassical VGG architectures with no skip connections, probes assigned to the early layers play asignificant role in estimating the model’s uncertainty. This is not the case in ResNet architectureswith skip connections, where only the probes assigned to the upper layers are used for calibration.
