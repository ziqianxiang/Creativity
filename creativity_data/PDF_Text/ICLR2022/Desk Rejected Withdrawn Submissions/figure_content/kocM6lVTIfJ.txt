Figure 1: The additional gain between the linear regression (LR) and comparing methods for CTRprediction on the Frappe Dataset. By considering only three feature interactions, our methods (i.e.,LR (Shapley) and NN (Shapley)) significantly boost the AUC performance. Best viewed in color.
Figure 2: (a)(b) Mean of feature/feature interactions to the model predictions on MovieLens andFrappe dataset, respectively. (c) The toy test on MovieLens dataset. The red points are the result offeature interaction set {[1, 3], [2, 3]}, achieving the best performance evaluated by AUC and Logloss.
Figure 3: The correlation between the market-risk feature and the HML feature.
