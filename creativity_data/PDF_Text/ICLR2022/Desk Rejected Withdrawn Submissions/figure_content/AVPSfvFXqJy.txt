Figure 1: Visualizations of self-attention maps from the last layerof DeiT-S (Touvron et al. (2021)).
Figure 2: CKA similaritiesbetween layers across differ-ent learning paradigms.
Figure 4: Accuracy curves during training. (a) exhibits that both the SL teacher and SSL teachercan accelerate the convergence of the student in the early stage, and the acceleration of SSL teacheris more significant. However, this superiority disappear in the later stage. (b) demonstrates that ourmethod can take advantage of the ability of SSL teacher to accelerate convergence in the early stage,allowing students to converge faster in the early stage while stably surpassing the baseline in thelater stage. The distillation is stopped at 100 epoch.
Figure 5: Prediction distribution. The abscissa is the top 10 categories in the validation dataset ofImageNet predicted by SL teacher and SSL teacher, and the ordinate is the specific number.
Figure 6: Visualizations of self-attention from the last layer. DeiT-Ti(Ours) consists of 3 heads, andthe 1st head and 2nd head are distilled from SSL teacher (SSTA) and SL teacher respectively.
