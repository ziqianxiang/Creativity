Figure 1: Differentially private cloud-based control scheme (e.g., Tanaka et al. (2017)).
Figure 2: Tracking errors p(t) - pr (t)Results. The resulting tracking errors are presented in Fig. 2, where the tracking velocity erroris asymptotically vanishing, while the tracking position error is not vanishing in the mean-squaresense due to presence of noises for privacy preservation. We also show the relationship betweenthe tracking performance and the privacy requirements. The simulation results are presented inFig. 3. It is clear that a higher privacy level (i.e., a smaller ) leads to larger tracking errors ofboth position and velocity in the mean square senses, demonstrating the trade-off between the datautility and the differential privacy guarantee. Besides, in Fig. 3 we also compare the trackingperformance by calibrating the noises via the proposed structured noise injection approach (r = 1)to the common approach of using i.i.d. noises (r = T). It can be seen that the calibrated noisesfollowing Algorithm 1 shows better tracking performances under the same privacy requirement,implying that the proposed structured noise injection approach may improve the data utility.
