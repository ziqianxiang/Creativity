Figure 1: (a) Two examples about classification game and misclassification game. x and x0 are twoinstances from the data set that used to train the black-box model, where x is predicted correctlyand x0 is predicted incorrectly. Ï„ is set to zero. (b) Example of top three important features for theclassification (blue) and misclassification (red) game.
Figure 2: (a) Ranks and masked image for each method. (A) Shows the input instance. (B) Showsthe explanation created by each algorithm. The features colored in blue have a positive featureimportance according to each method. (C) Shows the masked image which is no longer predicted as7. (b) Shows the tree created by McXai from the example of (a). The state x is the input instance.
