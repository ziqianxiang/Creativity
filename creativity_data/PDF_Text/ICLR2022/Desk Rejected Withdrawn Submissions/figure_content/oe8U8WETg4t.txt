Figure 1: LinBP leads to more powerful white-box adversarialoptimal ones.
Figure 2: LinBP leads to lower training loss and better approximation to the teacher model, especiallyat the early stage of training.
Figure 3: Compare the training loss and training accuracy of the MLP and LeNet-5 on MNIST usingLinBP and BP.
Figure 4: Compare the test loss and test accuracyand BP.
Figure 5:	Compare the training loss and training accuracy of ResNet-50, DenseNet-161, and Mo-bileNetV2 on CIFAR-10 using LinBP and BP.
Figure 6:	Compare the test loss and test accuracy of ResNet-50, DenseNet-161, and MobileNetV2 onCIFAR-10 using LinBP and BP.
Figure 7: Compare the robustness of MobileNetV2 models shielded with different adversarial trainingmethods. We use “LinBP∣” and “LinBP*" to indicate models trained using the first strategy and thecombination of the two strategies as described in the above paragraph, respectively.
Figure 8: The influence of setting different learning rate to LinBP and BP for training the MLP andLeNet-5 on MNIST.
