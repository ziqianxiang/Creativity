Figure 1: Overview. HoloFormer provides unified optimizations to induce N:M sparsity sparsity andinteger quantization for compressing pre-trained Transformer networks. The resulting compressedmodel can be trivially converted to the deployment format for compatible hardware.
Figure 2: Visualization of optimization surface under asymmetric quantization constraints. Alongboth the offset and scale axes, we have smooth parabolas.
