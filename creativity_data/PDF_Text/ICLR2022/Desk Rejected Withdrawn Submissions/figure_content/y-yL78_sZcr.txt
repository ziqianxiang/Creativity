Figure 1: The NP rate (rate in the figures) of the CIFAR100/TinyImagnet experiments with thetwo optimizers. The buffer size is 1000. We choose four different tasks and plot their NP rates assubsequent tasks are learned. In the last two figures, we separately report the four tasksâ€™ average testaccuracy after training a new task in the CIFAR100/TinyImagnet experiment.
Figure 2: The accumulated A-NP rate (rate in the figures) for each class (x-axis) after the last taskis trained. The buffer size is 1000. In the last two sub-figures, we report the test accuracy of eachclass and the accumulated gradient (A-NP) rate after the training of the last task.
Figure 3: Execution time of all baselines and GAD on the CIFAR10 dataset.
