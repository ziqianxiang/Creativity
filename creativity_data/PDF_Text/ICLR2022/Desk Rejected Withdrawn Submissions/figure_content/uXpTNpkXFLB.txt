Figure 1: Pipeline of TR-GBP. The forward propagation treats the bias as input maps fullfilled with1, and the back propagation procedure also attribute to the middle inputs. Then we aggregate thesemiddle input with upsampling, and minus the mean values of top5 results.
Figure 2: The illustration of important opera-tions.
Figure 3: Class discriminative results for TR-GBP. The middle heatmap is obtained from theclass ‘bull mastiff’, and the right heatmap is ob-tained from the class ‘tiger cat’.

Figure 5: Sanity check results by cascade randomizing resnet50 from fc layer to the conv1 layer forTR-GBP.
Figure 6: Pixel perturbation results on Imagenet 2012 validation set with VGG16 and ResNet50,both removing most relevant features(MoRF,higher is better) and removing least relevant fea-tures(LeRF, lower is better).
