Figure 1: Google NGram Data Michel et al. (2011) showing relative usage of machine learningrelated terms over time. Deep learning has quickly passed up the use of statistical terms like logisticregression. Computer Vision tasks like Object Detection and Image Recognition are growing atfaster rates than Binary Classification which fairness metrics can address.

Figure 3: Change-in-Top1, normalized CEV, and normalized SDE adjacency matrices of modelslisted in Table 2. Each entry displays the given metric calculated for the columns model w.r.t therows model. Reading the table row-wise you see trade offs going from the row model to another.
