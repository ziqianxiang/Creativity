Figure 1: Overview of our gait analysis pipeline, with the components we train highlighted in gray.
Figure 2: Two sample trajectories (left and right). Each row shows a different joint and each columnis a different approach.
Figure 3: The left two panels show the error histograms for the down and up events, respectively.
Figure 4: Top row: Bland-Altman plots of error for cadence, double support time and single supporttime with correlation coefficients. Horizontal bars are the 5% and 95% percentiles for error. Bottomrow: average parameter values over trials with the same condition (e.g. bracing versus none).
Figure 5: Left: Comparing our approach on four simultaneous views from Human 3.6 shows allviews produce consistent estimates. Darker traces for foot and pelvis velocity show ground truth.
Figure 6: DataJoint schema for computational pipeline. The right side shows the general video pro-cessing pipeline and the left side the organizational structure specific to the gait lab data. Lookuptables allow selecting different algorithms for video processing component. Circular nodes are com-puted can be computed once requisite parent nodes exist.
Figure 7: Two examples of the attention weights throughout the transformer (all layers and headsare shown), with the phase of the four gait events at the bottom. The attention scores were transposeto align with the gait phase traces below. The attention pattern period matches the gait period, andeven develops sharp transitions aligned with foot events despite the quadrature encoded phases beingsmooth.
