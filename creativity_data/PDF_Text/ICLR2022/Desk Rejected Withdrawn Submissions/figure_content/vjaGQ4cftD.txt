Figure 1: The framework of our method. Firstly, the referring models are aligned to the objectsin a real scene scan via physical data alignment, including random rotation, scaling, cropping, andmixing up with the scene. Secondly, we extract the point-wise feature from the mixed point cloudand map the point features into a convex hull space surrounded by a group of learned prototypes. Inthe end, the aligned point features are clustering with the class-specific anchors in metric space.
Figure 2: Visualization of inferring on an unseen scene by our method. We show the pairs of groundtruth (left) and the inferring results (right). From top to bottom are chair, bookshelf, sofa and table,respectively.
