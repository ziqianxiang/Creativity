Figure 2: (a) σ0 (u) = 1/(1 + |u - 1|)2) is defined following Zenke & Ganguli (2018), and theparameters of B(U) used here are: uo = Id = 1, gmax = 109.45, k = 1.18 and n = 124.33. (b)KBP = e * e, with Ts = 30 ms. The positive side of KSTDP = A+exp(-t∕τ+)H(t) has parameters:A+ = 0.0124, and τ+ = 89.73 ms.
Figure 3: Universal spike train approximator experiment5	Experimental Results5.1	Universal Spike Train ApproximatorTo test the learning ability of our proposed bio-plausible learning rules, we build up a 2-layers SNNto fit a random target spike train (PSC) from randomly generated inputs as shown in Figure 3 (a).
