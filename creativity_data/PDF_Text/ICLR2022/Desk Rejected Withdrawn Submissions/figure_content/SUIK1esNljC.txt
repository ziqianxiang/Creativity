Figure 1: The behavior of the loss and angular velocity for noisy quadratic model. An optimizeris run with different settings of the learning rate α = [0.06, 0.03, 0.01, 0, 001]. Angular velocity isaveraged over 20 iterations.
Figure 2: The behavior of the loss and angular velocity for an exemplary DL problem (trainingResNet-18 on CIFAR-10). An optimizer is run with different settings of the learning rate α =[0.3, 0.1, 0.03, 0.01, 0.003]. Angular velocity is calculated over a single epoch.
Figure 3: The behavior of the loss and angular velocity for the noisyquadratic model. An optimizer is using an automatic drop of thelearning rate guided by the saturation of the angular velocity. Angularvelocity is averaged over 20 iterations.
