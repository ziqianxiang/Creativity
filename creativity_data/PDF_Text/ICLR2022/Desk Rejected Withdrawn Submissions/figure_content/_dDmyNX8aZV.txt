Figure 1: The layer vulnerability of VGG16 and ResNet18 on CIFAR-10/100.
Figure 2: Architecture of the cells obtained on CIFAR-10.
Figure 3: The clean accuracy and robust accuracy of RNAS with different H value on differentdatasets. We use different H to search the architecture on CIFAR-10 and transfer the obtainedmodel to CIFAR-100 and SVHN.
