Figure 1: Cross-Modal Manifold Cutmix (CMMC) trains a visual encoder for Modality 1 with X1 as inputwhile mixing with input X2 . from modality 2. The mixing operation between the cross-modal feature mapsg1k and g2l is Cutmix which is illustrated at the right.
Figure 2: Accuracy graph illustrating the improve-ments with CMMC compared to representative base-lines without using mix, manifold mix, and alternatetraining in CMMC.
Figure 3: Training on UCF101 dataset. At left, we present the training loss of two models, one using videoaugmentation: Vi-Mix and the other not. At right, we provide the (K+1)-way accuracy on the pretext task whilelearning contrastive representation.
