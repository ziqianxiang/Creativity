Figure 1: (a) Causal structural with unmeasured confounders. (b) Causal structure of stage 2 regres-Sion in the nonlinear IV methods. The observed ConfoUnders would be affected both the predictedtreatment T and outcome Y, leading to confounding bias in stage 2 regression. In these figures,green nodes denote observable variables, and gray nodes mean unmeasured variables. The arrowswith solid line point from the cause variables to the effect variables; The dashed lines without arrowmean that the causal direction between the two variables is unknown.

Figure 3: Hyper-parameter sensitivity analysis on Data-mz-mÏ‡-mu. The green lines show theATE bias of the hyper-parameter a within the specified range {0,0.0001,0.001,0.01,0.1,1}. Thered line indicates the parameters chosen by CB-IvTable 3 shows the details of the structure networks of CB-IV in different datasets. In the TreatmentRegression Stage, the Loss would be an MSE-loss for continuous treatments and a log-loss for binarytreatments, and the treatment network has multiple hidden layers with IMLPLayers] units. In theTreatment Regression Stage, the Loss would be an MSE-loss for continuous outcomes and a log-lossfor binary outcomes. The representation network has multiple hidden layers with [MLPLayers-R]units, and the outcome network has multiple hidden layers with [MLPLayers_Y] units. Algorithm 1shows the pseudo-code of our methods (CB-IV).
