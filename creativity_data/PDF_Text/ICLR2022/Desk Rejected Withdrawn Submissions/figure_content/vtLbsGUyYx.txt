Figure 1: An overview of AutoCoG data-model co-search architecture and pipeline. On the left, wedeconstruct a layer into its components denoted in Eqn. (1). Yellow indicates searchable componentsin the model search space, while light-blue functions are fixed. The data (graph augmentation) searchspace is illustrated as a series of mathematical signs: (+) edge add, (-) edge permutation, (รท) nodedrop and (=) identity. The search is conducted in a differentiable and depth-progressive fashion.
