Figure 3: The accuracy of Lime, Kernel-Shap, L2X and SOInter as a function of input size. For eachenergy function E 1 and E 2 results on two outputs are reported. The SOInter performance is overallbetter than others.
Figure 4: The median rank obtained by Lime, Kernel-Shap, L2X and SOInter as a function of inputsize. For each energy function E 1 and E 2 results on two outputs are reported. The ground truthvalue in all situations is 2.5. The SOInter performance is overall better than others.
Figure 5: The red pixel shows the target and green ones are important features selected by SOInter.
