Figure 1: The workflow of the proposed framework, APPLE. Each client trains a local personalizedmodel, uploads its updated core model to the server, and downloads others’ core models from theserver as needed at the beginning of each round.
Figure 2: The training loss, test accuracy and client test accuracies of personalized methods underthe pathological non-IID setting.
Figure 3: Directed Relationships of different datasets under the pathological non-IID setting. Thefirst row shows the DRs on client 1. The second row shows the “self-relationships”, pi,i, for eachclient.
Figure 4: loss-scheduler•	a cosine-shaped scheduler: λ(r) = (cos(rπ∕L) + 1) /2 indicating the learning focus tran-sitions gradually from global to local.
Figure 5: Data distribution of the pathological non-IID setting. The first row represents which clientsthe data is assigned to. The second row represents the local label distribution of each client.
Figure 6: Data distribution of the practical non-IID setting. The first row represents which clientsthe data is assigned to. The second row represents the local label distribution of each client.
Figure 7: The training loss, test accuracy and client test accuracies of personalized methods underthe practical non-IID setting.
Figure 8: Directed Relationships of different datasets under the practical non-IID setting. The firstrow shows the DRs on client 1. The second row shows the “self-relationships”, pi,i, for each client.
