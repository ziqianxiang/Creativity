Figure 1: Comparison of previous UDA methods and our proposed method when facing class-imbalance challenge. (a) Previous UDA methods aim to align the source and target domain from theglobal perspective, leading the ambiguous boundary between different classes. (b) Traditional OT-based UDA algorithms further align the feature representation on the instance-level, which performspoorly in the face of class-imbalance challenge due to the false-assigned label on the sample withinthe target domain. (c) Our COT presents a cluster-based optimal transport alignment algorithm,which can get accurate fine-grained representation to resist the class-imbalance risk.
