Figure 1: Image showing the t-SNE visualization of the features for each class after training on asubset of the classes (e.g. cats and dogs). Both methods successfully learns the labeled classes (cats-orange, dogs-green). But our proposed method gives a larger freedom of the embedding features tothe unknown regions, facilitating learning new classes (sofa-red, monitor-purple).
