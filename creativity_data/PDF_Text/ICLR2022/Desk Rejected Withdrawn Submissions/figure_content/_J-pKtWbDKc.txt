Figure 1: Pipeline of our WEHG method. The example graph given in G shows the walking processfor inferring the relationship between {v0 , v3}. The red arrows indicate the walking v0 → v1 →v3 → v1 , while the blue arrows show the walking v3 → v1 → v2 → v0 .
Figure 2: Pair embedding visualization. The bluecolor denotes the true positive samples, the redpoints are unobserved negative, the green pointsare unobserved positive, and the yellow points arefalse negatives.
Figure 3: Subgraph showing trajectories of walksstarting from each node in the node pair (yellownodes) and terminating at the nodes with the stickfigures.
