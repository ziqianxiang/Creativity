Figure 1: Overview of the proposed anomaly detection method. At training stage, our proposedA2B-GAN learns to generate healthy images utilizing an unannotated dataset mixed with bothhealthy and potential diseased/anomalous images, in addition to, a set of healthy images. At testingstage, we translate any given image to a corresponding healthy image using the trained A2B-GAN.
Figure 2: Overview of a single training iteration of the proposed A2B-GAN. Detailed training pro-cess is described in section 3 and hyper-parameters for all applications are provided in section 4.4.
Figure 3: Qualitative results of COVID-19 and Cardiomegaly detection by A2B-GAN. As seen,A2B-GAN has resulted high response in the difference maps both for COVID-19 and Cardiomegalypositive samples. In contrast, the difference maps of the negative samples are almost empty.
Figure 4: Qualitative results of the simulated anomaly detection by A2B-GAN. The red arrows pointthe locations of the anomalies. As seen, the difference maps for the anomalous images activate theanomalous locations. In contrast, the difference maps appear empty for the normal images.
