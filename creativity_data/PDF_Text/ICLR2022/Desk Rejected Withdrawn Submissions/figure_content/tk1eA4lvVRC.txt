Figure 1: Inner loop steps of Reptile, Eigen-Reptile. Reptile updates meta-parameters towards thelast task-specific parameters, which is biased. Eigen-Reptile considers all samples more fair with themain direction of historical task-specific parameters. Note that the main direction is the eigenvectorcorresponding to the largest eigenvalue.

Figure 3: Eigen-Reptile (ER) and Reptile (R) training process on the regression toy test. (a), (b), (c),(d) and (e), (f), (g), (h) show that after the gradient update 0, 8, 16, 24, 32 times based on initializationlearned by Eigen-Reptile and Reptile respectively.
