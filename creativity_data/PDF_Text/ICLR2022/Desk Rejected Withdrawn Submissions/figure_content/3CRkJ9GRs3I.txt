Figure 1: Basic network mudule and ResNet modules. (a) is the backbone module of general convo-lutional neural networks, i.e., there are only convolution processing, batch normalization and nonlin-ear activation function. (b) denotes the ordinary ResNet module, which introduce ReLU activationfunction between two convolution kernels of the same size in a single module. (c) is that the inputvector first perform batch normalization (BN), then pass activation fuction (ReLU) and convolution.
Figure 2: Comparison of the accuracy in different networks. (a) shows the comparison of the basenetwork with 18 convolution layers, where the horizontal scale is the number of epochs, and theordinate is the median principal angle (MPA). In-1 represents the median principal angle of the firstclass (Cats), in-2 represents the median principal angle of another class (Dogs), and out representsthe median principal angle between cats and dogs; (b) represents the median principal angle whenthere is no BN in the ResNet18; (c) represents the median principal angle of ResNet18 that BN isadded in this network.
Figure 3: Comparison of the training iteration process of ResNet 34, ResNet 50, ResNet 101. (a)represents the training iteration process of ResNet34, intra-1, intra-2, and inter-1,2 are the same asthose shown in Figure 2; (b) represents the training iteration process of ResNet50; (c) represents thetraining iteration process of ResNet101.
Figure 4: Comparison of the accuracy of different datasets on ResNet34. (a) represents the two-category iterative process of ResNet34 on the Animal 10 data set. (b) represents the three-categoryiterative process of ResNet34 on the Imagenet-2012 dataset, in-1, in-2, and in-3 represent the me-dian principal in the first category, the second category, and the third category, out-1, out-2, out-3respectively represent the median principal angle between the first and second classes, the medianprincipal angle between the first and third classes, and the second and third classes.
Figure 5: The trend of the median principal angle of the three different types of ResNet with differentdepths. (a) represents the changing trend of the median principal angle within and between classesin ResNet34 as the number of layers increases. (b) represents the changing trend of the medianprincipal angle within and between classes in ResNet50 as the number of layers increases. (c)represents the changing trend of the median principal angle within and between classes in ResNet101as the number of layers increases.
