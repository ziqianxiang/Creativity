Figure 1: Inconsistency between metric and re-gression loss in rotated object detection.
Figure 2: SkewIoU approximation process in two-dimensional space based on Kalman filter.
Figure 3: Behavior comparison of different loss in different cases. Zoom in for better view.
Figure 4: Comparison of the detection results between Smooth L1 loss-based (left), GWD-based(middle) and the KFIoU loss-based (right) detectors on DOTA (2-D) and KITTI (3-D). For 3-Dobject detection, red and blue box denotes ground-truth and predict bounding box, respectively.
