Figure 1:	Accuracy results of models on full datasetsTable 1 and Figure 1 shows the results of six models on full datasets. Nonetheless, we notice thatall our models fail to predict ‘other’ in our target, corona result. Thus, we decide to rerun all modelsbased on a reduced dataset ('other' removed from Corona_Tesult). Below are the results.
Figure 2:	Accuracy results of models on reduced datasets, With 'other' removed from Corona_resultAS Shown in Table 2 and Figure 2, all evaluation indicatorS improve Significantly after we delete'other' from Corona_result. Therefore, we decide to use the reduced datasets in our follow-up exper-iments.
