Figure 1: Overview of the GRASSY architecture including the 1) geometric scattering moments Scomputed on the input graph, passed to an 2) encoder network E whose latent space is regularizedfor property prediction and for graph generation and trained for reconstruction via the 3) decoder D,and the 4) Molecular generation network trained with GAN and interpolation losses.
Figure 2: Learned geometric scattering wavelet coefficients for 3 ZINC tranches.
Figure 3: Latent representations of molecules in the ZINC dataset, visualized using PHATE, coloredby value of physicochemical properties.
Figure 4: Latent representations obtained using ablations of the GRASSY model trained on theBBAB tranche of the ZINC dataset, color-coded by QED for different models.
Figure 5: Latent representations obtained using ablations of the GRASSY model trained on theBindingDB dataset, color-coded by QED.
