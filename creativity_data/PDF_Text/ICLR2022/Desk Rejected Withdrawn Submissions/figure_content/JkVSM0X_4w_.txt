Figure 1: Example of a switchspace where N “ 3, K “ 2 andthe initial three spaces are Poincare,Spherical, and Euclidean spaces. Itgenerates 3 C2 “ 3 resulting prod-uct spaces including P X D (or writ-ten as PD), P X E, and D X E.
Figure 2: Architecture of the proposed SwisE. Only K out of N spaces are active for each KG triple.
