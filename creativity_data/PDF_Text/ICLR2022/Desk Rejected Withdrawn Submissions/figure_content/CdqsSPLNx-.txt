Figure 1: Architecture of one encoding-decoding procedure in the DDAM-GMFigure 1 shows the architecture of one encoding-decoding procedure in the proposed DDAM-GM. The model input It represents TDVRPs-related feature values of the depot node and N cus-tomer nodes in the road network at the tth encoding-decoding procedure. Let Ti,j,t denote thetravel time from node i to node j at time step t. We set fi,j,t = (xih, xiv , xid, Ti,j,t) and haveIt = {fi,j,t}B×(N+1)×(N+1), where B represents the number of problem instances (i.e. batch size).
