Figure 1: Comparisons of three methods in the 3-way 1-shot scenario where every colored paneindicates an image and particles within each pane represents the dense features of that image. Thesolid lines indicate a query-to-support paradigm while the dotted lines indicate a support-to-queryparadigm. Among them, (a) Li et al. (2019) accumulates local similarities φ(∙, ∙) between all querydense features and their nearest support dense features in a Naive-Bayes way as an image-to-classsimilarity; (b) Zhang et al. (2020) finds the optimal matching flow that have the minimum earthmover,s distance d(∙, ∙); (c) We use the features, accessibility (i.e., the expected number of visitsto support features of each class) in a bidirectional Markov random walk {Xt} to measure theimage-to-class relevance. A major difference is that we consider the mutual affiliations betweendense features instead of following the unidirectional query-to-support paradigm.
Figure 2: Ablative of 5-way FSL results on tieredImageNet with ResNet-12 and VanillaFCN featureextractor. (a) studies the influences from different choices of parameters. (b) compares performancesbetween infinite length of Markov process and those from varying finite lengths.
Figure 3: Dense feature extractors to extract local embeddings of the input image. (a) VanillaFCNsimply treats the feature map output of fully convolutional network as dense features. (b) PyramidFCNapplies pyramid structures on top of the native feature map to extract dense features of differentscales. (c) PyramidGrid crops image into grid patches of different scales and encodes each patch to afeature vector with the embedding network. "GAP" indicates a single global average pooling layer.
