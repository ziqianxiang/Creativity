Figure 1: Simple illustration of decision boundaries (black solid lines) given by combinatorial clas-sification with three seen classes, where three binary meta-classifiers are added one-by-one from(a) to (c). Unlike the standard classifier that creates decision boundaries for seen classes only, thecombinatorial classification generates partitions using multiple coarse-grained classifiers, which areuseful to discover novel classes.

Figure 4: t-SNE visualization of the evolution of unlabeled data representations when we train theproposed model on CIFAR-10 with 7 seen classes and 3 novel classes.
Figure 5: t-SNE visualization of CIFAR-10 using VGG, learned by GPQ, k-means and the proposedmethod. Visualization is based on 7 seen classes and 3 novel classes on CIFAR-10. Colors representtheir ground-truth labels. Note that the proposed method embeds known and novel classes in amore discriminative way than other baselines. t-SNE hyperparameters are consistent in all threevisualizations.
Figure 6: t-SNE visualization of CIFAR-10 using VGG, learned by DTC, Rankstats and the pro-posed method. Visualization is based on 7 seen classes and 3 novel classes on CIFAR-10. Colorsrepresent their ground-truth labels. t-SNE hyperparameters are consistent in all three visualizations.
