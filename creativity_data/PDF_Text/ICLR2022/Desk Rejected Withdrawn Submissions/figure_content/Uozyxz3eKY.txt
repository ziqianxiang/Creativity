Figure 1: The overall framework of DM-CT. x and xi are the original data and the noised (augmented)version. Each Msi represents one sampled sub-model. ‘M-CT’ is the model-level consistency trainingloss, and ‘D-CT’ is the data-level consistency training loss.
Figure 3: The Accuracy with different weight on MRPC andRTE tasksfor selected tasks, then assign weight by product of weight scale and the fixed proportion pattern(e.g., 1:1:1 or 1:2:7). For example, we get the weight scale 0.1 and proportion 1 : 3 : 1 for specifictask, Then, we can calculate the specific coefficient α1 = 0.2, α2 = 0.6, and β = 0.4. As shownin Figure 3, we get the best hyper-parameter that the weight scale 0.1 and the different proportion5 : 3 : 2 and 7 : 2 : 1 for MRPC and RTE respectively.
