Figure 1: Top-k estimation with diversity. Top row: A comparison of methods on the Alpine-2 function,showing the set of ground-truth top-k diverse design points (blue squares), queries Dt taken (black dots),acquisition function optimizer (pink dot), and the estimated set of top-k diverse design points (gold stars).
Figure 2: Level set estimation. Top and middle rows: A comparison of methods on the Multihills (top) andPennsylvania Night Light (middle) functions, showing the ground-truth level set boundary (dashed line) andqueries Dt taken (black or red dots). Bottom row: Plots of accuracy versus iteration for the set of comparisonmethods, on three functions, each averaged over 3 trials, where error bars represent one standard error.
Figure 3: Multi-value sequence search. Left: Visualization of the Vaccination function, along with thequeries Dt taken by HES (black dots), and the estimated sequence (x~,..., x~) (red diamonds), SUCh that(f (x~),..., f (x~)) = (30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%). Middle and right: Plots of â€”'(f, a*) versus iteration forthe set of comparison methods, on the Vaccination and Multihills functions, averaged over 3 trials, where errorbars represent one standard error.
Figure 4: Level set estimation for Alpine-2 function. We show the ground-truth level set boundary with reddashed line and queries Dt taken with black dots.
