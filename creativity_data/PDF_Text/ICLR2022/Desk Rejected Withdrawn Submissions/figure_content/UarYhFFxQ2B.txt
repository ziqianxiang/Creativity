Figure 1: An illustrative example of thegrouped action space, where 6 features aregrouped into 3 clusters. The grayed circles rep-resent the current observed features (or fullyobserved groups) and are not considered ascandidates anymore. The dashed line showsone acquisition at the current step, which ac-quires the feature g2(1) . The corresponding cir-cles will be grayed after this acquisition step.
