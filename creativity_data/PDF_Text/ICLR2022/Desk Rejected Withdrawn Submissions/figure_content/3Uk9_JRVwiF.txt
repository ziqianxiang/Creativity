Figure 1: Summary of four existing purifiers. The upper diagrams show algorithm overviews. Wedenote main classification network as C , auxiliary network as Aux, network with frozen weightsin gray, and network to be trained in green. The lower diagrams show the conceptual relationshipsbetween xclean, xadv , and xpur .
Figure 2: Algorithm overview and conceptual relation-ship of AID-Purifier. D is the discriminator network.
Figure 3: AID-Purifier. An auxiliary network D is attached to the main classification network C .
Figure 4: Robust accuracy against auxiliary-aware PGD attacks. When λ is large (redcircle), the attack successfully generates ex-amples that cannot be purified, but the attackto main network becomes weak. When λ issmall (green circle), the main network attackis strong but the purification remains effective.
Figure 5: Robust accuracy before (blue) and after (orange) purification are evaluated againstauxiliary-aware PGD attacks. The evaluation is over natural training, Madry, Zhang, and Lee forSVHN.
Figure 6: Robust accuracy for Madry+AID-Purifier is shown with respect to the variationsin the defense epsilon (SVHN under PGD attack;Madry is used to train the main classification net-work).
