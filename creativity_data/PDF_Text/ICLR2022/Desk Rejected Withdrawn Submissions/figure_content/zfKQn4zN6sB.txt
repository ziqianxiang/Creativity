Figure 1: Overview of neural network training using coreset selection.
Figure 2: Relative error vs. speed up curves for different versions of adversarial coreset selection intraining CIFAR-10 models using the TRADES objective. In each curve, the coreset size is changedfrom 50% to 10% (left to right). (a, b) Clean and robust error vs. speed up compared to full TRADESfor different version of Adversarial Craig. (c, d) Clean and robust error vs. speed up compared tofull TRADES for different version of Adversarial GradMatch.
