Figure 1: The proposed model architecture of MimCE, X refers to input features, E refers to share-bottom encoder, D refers to task-specific decoder, {Γ, ∆, Υ} are disentangled factors, CLUB is theupper bound of the mutual information. Ω = CONCAT(γ, ∆), Φ = CONCAT(Υ, ∆), Y and t areused to calculate the discrepancy IPM.
Figure 2: Radar charts that visualize the capability of DR-CFR, WmoCE, IpoCE (+wmo) andMimCE (+wmo) in identifying the factors {Γ, Υ, ∆}, The polygons’ radii denotes M% and eachvertex on the polygons refers to factors’ dimension (k∆, kΓ and kΥ) of synthetic dataset.
Figure 3: Examples of MimCE (+wmo) in identifying the factors {Γ, Υ, ∆}. The x-axis and y-axisdenote variable dimension ki and percentage of each dimension on W respectively. k-k-k refers tofactors' dimension, 1 〜k refers to Γ, k + 1 〜2k refers to ∆ and 2k + 1 〜3k refers to Υ.
Figure 4: Robustness analysis of the influence of layer size on the √cPEHE metric for IHDP-A, fromwhich we observe that MimCE performs more robust than other methods as the blue line shows.
Figure 5: (a) refers to the collider in which X means confounding factors. (b) represents do(t) withremoving all incoming edges of T. (c) represents our disentangled causal graph and z are noisevariables.
