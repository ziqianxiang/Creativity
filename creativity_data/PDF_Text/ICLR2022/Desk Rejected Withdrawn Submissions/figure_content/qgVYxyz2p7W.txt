Figure 1: Benefit of Semi-Supervised Classification & Clustering (S2C2) over Semi-SupervisedLearning (SSL) - Real-world datasets often suffer from intra- or interoberserver variability (IIV)during the annotation and thus no clear separation of classes is given as in common benchmarkdatasets. Images with a high variability between the annotations have therefore an ambiguous label.
Figure 2: Our method S2C2 and an extended arbitrary SSL method - The SSL algorithm passes animage x through the network Î¦ and outputs a classification pn (x). We add two additional outputs:an overclustering po(x) and a ambiguity estimation pa(x). The ambiguity estimation pa(x) is usedto determine if the classification or the overclustering output is used for our method S2C2.
Figure 3: Example images for the ambiguous real-world datasets - All datasets have certain im-ages (red & blue) and ambiguous images between these classes (grey). The classes are Bubble &Copepod, Not Injured & Injured, Similar & Dissimilar Orientations and Dog & Cat respectively.
Figure 4: Comparison of SSL and S2C2 - Each datapoint rep-resents an independent training run depending on the weightedF1-Score (F1) and the mean inner distance (d). The color andmarker types define the used dataset and method respectively.
