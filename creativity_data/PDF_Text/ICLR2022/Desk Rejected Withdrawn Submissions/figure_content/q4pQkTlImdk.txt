Figure 1: Dropout patterns with AttendOut, where we show the proportion of the kept units (0 meanscompletely dropout). For conciseness, we uniformly take four attention layers.
Figure 2: Total evaluation loss with AttendOut and Vanilla Dropout.
Figure 3: Parameter sweeps between AttendOut (red bars) and Vanilla Dropout. The experimentIDs from 1-5 refer to the dropout probabilities from 0 to 0.4, while the IDs 6, 7, 8 refer to "0.1 first","0.2 first", "0.1 first 0.2 second" settings respectively.
Figure 4: Confidence intervals between AttendOut (red bars) and Vanilla Dropout on a variety oftasks. The results here are on development sets.
Figure 5:	Dropout patterns of both the lowest and highest two layers. The tasks we choose here arethe same with those in Figure 1.
Figure 6:	Dropout patterns on more tasks. For conciseness, we uniformly take four attention layers.
