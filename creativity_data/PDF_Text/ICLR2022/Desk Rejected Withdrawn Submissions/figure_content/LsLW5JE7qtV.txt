Figure 1: While traditional methods only consider per-class data volume as a factor for long-tailed effects, sev-eral other factors such as head pose and ethnicity man-ifest as long-tailed effects in MS-Celeb-1M Guo et al.
Figure 2: The proposed method flowchart. In Sec. 3.1, we firstly show that traditional re-weighting methods areequivalent to the margin-modulated cosine loss. Tojointly tackle multiple variations that cause the long-taileddistribution, we propose the Multi-variation Cosine Margin (MVCOM) (Sec. 3.2). Then, MvCoM is learned via alearning-to-learn scheme specified as three steps (Sec. 3.2.2): (1) recognition model pseudo update. (2) MvCoMmeta-update with pseudo recognition model. (3) recognition model real update with updated MvCoM.
Figure 3: (a) Sample level margin visualization across all the factors. Larger margin corresponds to more tailedclass. (b) Curve of validation loss magnitude versus the tail to head classes. With our MVCOM (in green),the validation error is significantly reduced (lower) compared to baseline and a re-weighting state-of-the-artLDAM-CosFace Cao et al. (2019). (c) Histogram of the learned residual magnitude over the proposed fourlong-tailed variations. For tail classes, the learned margin is clearly larger, which expectedly highlights the tailclasses in the loss function.
