Figure 1: CIFAR-10 "Airplane" class. Average cosine similarity between features on training setvs. training epoch. (a) Similarity between pairs of images. Similarity between images and theiraugmentation for (b) Contrastive objective (c) Mean-shifted contrastive objective.
Figure 2: Top: The angular representation in relation to the origin. Lcon enlarging the angles betweenpositive and negative samples, thus increasing their Euclidean distance to c. Bottom: The mean-shifted representation. Lmsc does not affect the Euclidean distance between c and the mean-shiftedrepresentations while maximizes the angles between the negative pairs.
Figure 3: An illustration of our feature adaptation. (a) The initialized feature space derived by φ0 .
Figure 4: Sensitivity of the mean-shifted loss to class confidence. (a): The angular representation inrelation to the origin without confidence normalization. (b): The mean-shifted representation enlargesthe angle between the positive samples. (c): The angular representation after confidence normalization.
Figure 5: Confidence histogram ofCIFAR-10 "Bird" class. The `2 normconfidence of the extracted features de-rived by φ does not differentiate betweennormal and anomalous samples.
Figure 6: CIFAR-10 Mean ROC-AUC %. Catastrophic collapse of various objective functions.
Figure 7: CIFAR-10 "Airplane" class. Ablation study of different temperature parameters whileoptimizing standard contrastive loss and mean-shifted contrastive loss with τ = 0.25. (a) Similaritybetween pairs of images. (b) The standard contrastive objective is unsuitable for OCC featureadaptation as it results in very fast catastrophic collapse independently of the chosen τ .
