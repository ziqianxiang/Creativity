Figure 2: Visualisation of input and output changes to data changes(b) Neural change after data additionIn addition, the other key factor that plays a role in developing the chatbot’s knowledge capabilitiesin the system is by applying transfer learning (Pan & Yang, 2009). Hence, the model does not needto do training from the start, but from the previous checkpoint or weight (Torrey & Shavlik, 2010).
Figure 3: Training LossFor every existing incline, it occurs because there is additional data to the model during trainingso that the model is still trying to adjust to both old and new data. There is a significant inclinein the 1800th epoch, that’s because the added data has more patterns, so the model requires moreadjustments when compared to adding data as before.
