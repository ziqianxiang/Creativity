Figure 1: Commonsense knowledge paths generated by our task agnostic CoSe-Co. The gener-ated knowledge can be augmented in downstream tasks to improve performance. For interpretingpurposes, ‘library _atlocation read_newspaper’ is equivalent to ‘read_newspaper atlocation library’To address these limitations, We propose CommonSense Contextualizer - CoSe-CO, a generativeframework which generates relevant commonsense knowledge given any natural language sentenceas input. We condition it on sentences to make it generically applicable and enable it to dynamicallyselect entities/phrases from an input sentence as well as generate novel yet relevant entities in theinferences being generated. Figure 1 shows how CoSe-Co could be used to generate common-sense inferences for a variety of tasks. We consider commonsense knowledge in the form of paths,i.e., sequence of entities connected through relations. Relation vocabulary is determined based onschema ofKG used for training CoSe-Co. We first create sentence-path paired dataset by - 1) sam-pling paths from an underlying KG; 2) sampling a subset of entities from a path; and 3) retrieving& filtering sentences (from a sentence corpus) that are semantically similar to the path. The paireddata is then used to train a generative language model to generate a path given a sentence as input.
Figure 2: Our proposed approach consists of three main steps: (1) Path to Sentence Alignmentto create the training data for CoSe-CO, (2) Training a CommonSense Contextualizer (CoSe-Co) to generate commonsense inferences relevant to a given natural language sentence, and (3)Augmenting inferred knowledge to the input as additional context in a downstream task.
Figure 3: Obtaining the sentence-path paired dataset. We begin with paths from the knowledge graphand employ a two-step matching and filtering process to obtain relevant paired sentences from thegiven text corpora. Here we accompany each step with corresponding examples that we observed.
