Figure 1: Framework (left) of the proposed m-mix, where the revised module is discussed in “bridgemixing with prior knowledge” and We provide two different revised modules. Green and red dashlines in left figure denote mixing weights λi = 0 and λ% = 0, respectively. The blue dash line in theright figure means that only m-mix-wp uses the prior knowledge while m-mix-op doesn,t. For graphclassification, We additionally add graph level contrastive objective function in Eq. 9.
Figure 2: Classification accuracy on Pubmed dataset withdifferent sample sizes and different hidden dimensions.
Figure 3:	Accuracy with different batch / hidden pairs overtraining epochs. For instance, (10000, 2048) means trainingwith N = 10000, F0 = 2048.
