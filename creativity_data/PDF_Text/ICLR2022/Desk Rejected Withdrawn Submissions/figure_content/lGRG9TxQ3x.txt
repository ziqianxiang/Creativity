Figure 1: The motivation behind Feature Grinding illustrated at the example of a binary classificationproblem given two features. Before, the backdoor and clean samples from class 1 are co-located inthe same region of the feature space. After Feature Grinding, the model has been fine-tuned ontransformed features and the distance between clean and backdoored samples is higher.
Figure 2: Figures (a-e) show the Area Under the Pareto-Optimal Curve (AUPOC) for each surveyedbackdoor sanitation method versus each surveyed backdoor attack on CIFAR-10. A defense witha higher AUPOC is more effective. Figure (f) shows the highest Attack Recovery Rate (ARR) foreach backdoor defense and the dashed line indicates the CDA. Each data point represents the meanvalue over three repetitions with the defenseâ€™s parameters.
