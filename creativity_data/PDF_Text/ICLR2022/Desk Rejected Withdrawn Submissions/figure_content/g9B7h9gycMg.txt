Figure 1:OUr LCReg first projects the image features into the latent category features which sharethe commonality, such as the legs of cats and dogs. By performing the class semantic transforma-tions along with the latent category, We aim to enrich the cat,s feature by leveraging the commonalityfeatures, e.g., change the yellow cat leg by leveraging the dog,s leg features.
Figure 2: Our LCReg re-represent each object from the original long-tailed distribution dataset bythe similarity-weighted sum of latent categories. The latent categories are shareable among the headand tailed classes and form a new balanced distributed dataset.

Figure 4: We visualize the weight histogram of latent categories contributing to the reconstructionof the image features. As shown in the figures, the 79th latent category (green) is highlighted bythe 'hare’(Image D), and 'dogs’(Image E and F), while all of them contain the similar shape of thelimbs. Furthermore, the 'cow’(Image A), ‘human arm,(Image B), and ‘fisher'(Image C) share somecommonalities captured by the 98th latent category(red).
