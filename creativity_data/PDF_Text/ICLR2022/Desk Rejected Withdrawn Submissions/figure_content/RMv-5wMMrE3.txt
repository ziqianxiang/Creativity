Figure 1: Cell divides and differentiates, mod-eled as a Markov branching process.
Figure 3: Cell2state analysis and dimension reduction of of single-cell reprogrammingdata (Biddy et al., 2018). a. The single-cell reprogramming data (Biddy et al. (2018)) visualizedin tSNE(van der Maaten & Hinton (2008)). b. Transition network between day-12 and day-21cells recovered from cell barcodes. c. Cell2state maps day-12 cells to a tetrahedron with 4 visiblevertices (top three dimensions visualized). Unit ball projection of top 3 dimensions of cell2statefeatures (upper left) and exhibit diverse growth rates(lower left). d. Four vertices identified byday-12 Cell2state features lead to distinct descendent distributions visualized in UMAP(McInneset al. (2020)). e-g. Cluster assignment learnt based on cell2state features, visualized via UMAPwith Day-12 raw data (e), Day-12 cell2state feature space (f), and Day-21 descendent data (g). h.

Figure 5: Simulation experiment with synthetic nonlinear transition dynamics. a-b. AMarkov branching process, with the number of descendants sampled from a Poisson distribution,generates transitions from day 2 cells to day 6 cells. c. Cell2states maps day-2 cells into a polytope.
