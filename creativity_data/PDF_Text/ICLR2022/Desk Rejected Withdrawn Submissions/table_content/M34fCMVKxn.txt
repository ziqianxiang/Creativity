Table 1: Object discovery evaluation results on the Tetrominoes dataset. PCDNet outperforms SOTAmethods, while using a small number of learned parameters. Moreover, our PCDNet has the highestthroughput out of all evaluated methods. For each metric, the best result is highlighted in boldface,whereas the second best is underlined.
