Table 1: Expected regret of different policies at T = 20000 in each experiment. For each experiment we mark bold textfor the best result and "*" if UCB-DT outperforms UCB, UCBt and UCBV-Tune.
Table 2: Expected regret of UCB and UCB-DT on more distances in each experiment. Î³ is set to 0.02 in allexperiments, m is set to 0.05.
