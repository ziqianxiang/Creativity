Table 1: The performance comparison to core-set methods and tensor-based methods. This tableshows the testing accuracies (%) of different methods on three compression ratios. ResNet18 is usedfor training and testing. “Whole” indicates an approximate upper-bound performance that is obtainedby training the models on the whole dataset.
Table 2: Evaluations on different network architectures. This table shows the testing accuracy (%) ofdifferent methods at a compression ratio of 70%.
Table 3: The performance comparison with the ICE method, both our proposed approach and the ICEmethod have a compression ratio of 75%.
Table 4: MPS structures of CIFAR10, CIFAR100, FashionMNIST and ImageNet datasets.
