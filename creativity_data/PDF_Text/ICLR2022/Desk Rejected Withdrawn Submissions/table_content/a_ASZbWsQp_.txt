For the j -th instance with backdoor trigger, the malicious agent i doesnot update its local feature extractor (parameterized by θi ) like benign agents via using the combined∂hgradient '> Qi . Instead, it replaces the intermediate gradient received from the server d'-1 by∂hi{j} ∂θi	∂hi{j}Y 加garget} and uses the manipulated gradient Yd`∂hj∂h{target} ∂θito update its local feature extractor,where 加：±§电 is the intermediate gradient received from the server for any instance belongingto the target class, and Y is the gradient amplify ratio. In our experiments, we use Y = 10 forNUS-WIDE and Y = 1 for CIFAR-10. Moreover, since the label owned by the server is clean, theattacker would submit zero vector to the server to prevent the server mapping the poisoned embeddingto the true label.
