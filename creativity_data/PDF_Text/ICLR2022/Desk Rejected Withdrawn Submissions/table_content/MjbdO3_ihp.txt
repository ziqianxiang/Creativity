It makes sense thatwell-generalized feature representations not only minimize the intra-similarities of positive pairs andenlarge the inter-distances of negative pairs but also keep the feature distributed uniformly to retainenough information. Therefore we follow Wang & Isola (2020) to make the assessments. Figure4 and Figure 5 show the results of alignment and uniformity respectively. Compared with previousSOTA TNC and supervised results, our BTSF gets the highest mean value about feature distanceof positive pairs, which means that BTSF achieves the best alignment. Additionally, the featureextracted BTSF is evenly distributed in the encoding space which preserves maximal information ofthe data, much better than TNC and supervised models.
