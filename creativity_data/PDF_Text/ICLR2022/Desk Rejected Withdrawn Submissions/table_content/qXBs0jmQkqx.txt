Table 1: Quantitative results in mean intersection over union (mIoU) on three real foggy datasets—Foggy Zurich (FZ) test v2, Foggy Driving Dense (FDD), Foggy Driving (FD), and a clear weatherdataset—Cityscapes lindau 40.
Table 2: Analysis on the impact of domain pairs.
Table 3: Analysis on the impact of the fog stylematching loss, the prediction consistency loss, andthe fog-pass filtering.
Table 4: Classwise performance of baseline model, i.e., RefineNet-lw pretrained Cityscapes dataset.
Table 5: Classwise performance of FIFO. We report IoU for each class and mIoU as the evaluationmetric.
Table 6: Performance of FIFO trained with different density levels of synthetic fog images. β =0.005 denotes FIFO in the main paper, and β = 0 indicates the model trained only with clearweather and real foggy images. The reported scores are mIoU on the Foggy Zurich (FZ) test v2,Foggy Driving Dense (FDD), Foggy Driving (FD).
Table 7: Ablation study on layers where fog style matching loss is applied. FIFO utilizes the outputof the first convolutional layer and first residual blocks to apply the fog style matching loss. Wereport mIoU as the evaluation metric.
