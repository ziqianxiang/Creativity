Table 1: Here We report on prior adversarial text generation examples models on SNLI (Bowman etal., 2015) dataset. Adversarial text generated by word substitution based methods (Textfooler & NL-adv) may semantics constraints or diversity; GAN based methods (Natural-GAN) tend to generatesentences not conforming to the semantics constraints.
Table 4: Accuracy for various attacks over a re-trained model and a different architecture. Note thatthe accuracy on the original model is zero since the evaluation contains a hold-out 1K set with onlysuccessful attacks.
Table 2: Successful adversarial examples generated by our Text-Gen model on the Movie Review Dataset.
Table 3: We augment the original training set with adversarial attacks (rows) and evaluate the accuracyon hold-out 1K adversarial attacks (columns) generated by our method and two other baselines5 Conclusion and Future WorkIn this paper, we propose Text-Gen, a simple and efficient adversarial-example generation modelthat can generate semantically-preserving, grammatically correct, and diverse adversarial texts. Weargue that our model creates more meaningful adversarial examples to real-world tasks bydemonstrating our attacks are more robust against model re-training and across model architectures.
