The network is built using keras framework with tensorflow as the backend, supposedby python, opencv, h5py, etc.

The extreme point after 12th epoch is at 20th epoch. Thus the model at 20th epochis used as the representative model of the proposed algorithm in this paper to compare with otheralgorithms.

VAE generates fewer and more concentrated abnormal scores, the candidate valUesof the category segmentation threshold are relatively less and the data has Poor seParability, resUltingin a higher binary classification error rate and a concave state of the ROC cUrve. In contrast, the GRPconsiders more scene information and reflects it on the abnormal score, so the obtained abnormalscore set Performs better Under the established rUles.
