The standard ( = 0) and 9 robust variants of three surrogate models(ResNet18, ResNet50, WRN50-2) are evaluated. The presented ASRs are the average over fourstandard target models. All experiments are performed for 5 different targeted FGSM variants withthe CE-loss. Bold numbers indicate the best ASR for a specific attack. The best result for a surrogatemodel are indicated by an asterisk (*). Detailed results are available in the appendix.

As in our previous observations, robust models for bothadversarial training techniques result in significantly higher transferability compared to standardtraining. The adversarial examples generated from the robust model trained with PGD adversarialtraining transfer overall better than those for FAT for the same s . The adversarial examples fromrobust models with s=0.5 lead to the highest ASR; moreover, we can find that the DI attack methodyields the largest ASR under the same epsilon value for both PGD and FAT adversarial training.

AllExperiments are performed for I-FGSM, MI, DI, TI, MI-DI-TI untargeted attack with cross entropyloss. It should be noted that ASR values presented here are the average values of 4 target models:ResNet18, DenseNet121, VGG16, MobileNetV2. Detailed results are available in the appendix.
