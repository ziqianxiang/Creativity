Table 1: Random generation results on the QM9 dataset. Results of baselines are obtained by runningopen-source codes. We report the mean and the standard deviation of 3 different runs.
Table 2: Random generation results on the ZINC250k dataset. Result With f is taken from PoPova et al.
Table 3: Docking score optimization results with parp1 target protein. Results of baselines are obtainedby running open-source codes. We report the mean and the standard deviation of 3 different runs.
Table 4: Docking score optimization results with fa7 target protein. Results of baselines are obtained byrunning open-source codes. We report the mean and the standard deviation of 3 different runs.
Table 5: Docking score optimization results with 5ht1b target protein. Results of baselines are obtainedby running open-source codes. We report the mean and the standard deviation of 3 different runs.
Table 6: GSK3Î²+JNK3+QED+SA optimization results. MARS+OOD indicates MARS augmented withthe EBM energy score. Results of MARS are obtained by running its open-source code. Results of otherbaselines are taken from Xie et al. (2020). We report the mean and the standard deviation of 5 different runsof 5000 generated molecules. Because of the high variance of MARS that comes from MCMC sampling, wemark both the best results and their comparable results (p > 0.05 from the t-test) as bold.
Table 7: parp1 docking score optimization results without energy pivots and the property network. Wereport the mean and the standard deviation of 3 different runs of 3000 generated molecules.
Table 8: Information of the QM9 and ZINC250k datasets. The maximum number of nodes and the numberof node types correspond to n and a of the notation in Section 3, respectively.
