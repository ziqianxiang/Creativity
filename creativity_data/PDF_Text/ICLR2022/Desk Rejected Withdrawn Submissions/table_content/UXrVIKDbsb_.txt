Table 1: Classification accuracy (mean ± std %) of different schemes. We evaluate the effectivenessof our DDL with different baselines, including DANN (Ganin et al., 2016), CDAN (Long et al.,2018), GVB (Cui et al., 2020b), on the Digit-Five/Office31 datasets with Cov3FC2 (Peng et al.,2019)/ResNet-50 (He et al., 2016) as backbone. Note that, we re-implement all the baselines, thusthe results are sightly different from the reported ones in the original papers.
