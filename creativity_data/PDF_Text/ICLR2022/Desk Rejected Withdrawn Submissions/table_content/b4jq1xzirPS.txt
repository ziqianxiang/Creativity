Table 1: TSP-D results on Random locations dataset. Averages and standard deviation of 100 probleminstances. ‘Cost’ refers to the average cost value (1), where the small numbers represent the standarddeviation. ‘Gap’ is the relative difference to the average cost of the best algorithm for the setting (23).
