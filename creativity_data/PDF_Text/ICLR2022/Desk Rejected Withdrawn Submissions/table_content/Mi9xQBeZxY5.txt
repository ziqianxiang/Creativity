Table 1: Node classification accuracy (%) on different number of layers. (Bold: best)5.2	Experimental ResultsAlleviating the Performance Drop in Deeper GNNs. We aim to study the performance of deeperGNNs when equipped with DeCorr and answer RQ 1. Following the previous settings in (Zhouet al., 2020), we perform experiments on Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed and CoauthorCS datasets. Notethat “None” indicates vanilla GNNs without equipping any methods. We report the performanceof GNNs with 2/15/30 layers in Table 1 due to space limit while similar patterns are observed inother numbers of layers. Table 1 show that the proposed DeCorr can greatly improve deeper GNNs.
