Table 1: Consistency evaluation. We measure the similarity of feature attribution on different size of upsam-pling. For every measurement in SSIM and PC metrics, the standard deviation was smaller than 0.05, and inPSNR it was under 0.5. We can not report RealTime results on MNIST as this explainer fundamentally usesfeatures extracted from ResNet50 pre-trained on ImageNet not applicable for MNIST dataset.
Table 3: Perturbation evaluation. We measure the faithfulness of each explanation method by perturbing theinput. The area between plots of top-k and low-k perturbations on k = {0,10, 20,… ,100} is reported. KLdivergence values on CUB are ×10-2 and on ImageNet are ×10-3.
Table 4: Perturbation evaluation. We measure the faithfulness of each explanation methods by perturbing aninput. For every measurements on probability difference, the standard deviation was below 0.05. KL divergencevalues on CUB are ×10-2 and on ImageNet are ×10-3.
