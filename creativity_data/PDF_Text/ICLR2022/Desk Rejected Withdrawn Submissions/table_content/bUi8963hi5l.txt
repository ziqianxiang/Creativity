Table 1: Comparison (%) on Flickr30K (Young et al., 2014). Our method outperforms all baselinesby a large margin in both Image-to-Text and Text-to-Image retrieval.
Table 2: Comparison (%) on MS-COCO (Lin et al., 2014) 5K test set . Our approach achieves thebest results in Text-to-Image retrieval on the 5K test set.

Table 4: Ablation study of similarity calibration on Flickr30K (Young et al., 2014) and MS-COCO (Lin et al., 2014). The proposed similarity calibration significantly improves both Image-to-Text and Text-to-Image retrieval.
Table 5: Comparison (%) of pre-training tasks on Flickr30K (Young et al., 2014). SimCSE (su)outperforms other tasks in both Image-to-Text and Text-to-Image retrieval.
