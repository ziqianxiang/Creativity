Table 1: Comparison between different adjoint approaches for forward Euler.
Table 2: Comparison between different implementations of neural ODEs for one ODE block. Thecomputational complexity is measured in terms of the number of function evaluations (f).
Table 3: Performance statistics on POWER, MINIBOONE, and BSDS300. *Note that for BSDS300,the batchsize is 1, 000 for discrete adjoint methods (to fit into the memory capacity) and 10, 000 forthe continuous adjoint method.
