Table 1: Results of the planning task, evaluatedas the success rate in completing the specifiedtask. The maximum number of expanded nodesfor all planners is 5000. All models are trainedon the compositional split, and tested on the com-positional and the novel split.
Table 2: Results of the inverse planning task, eval-uated as the percentage of trajectories with a cor-rect task prediction. All models are trained onthe compositional data splits and evaluated on thecompositional and the novel split.
