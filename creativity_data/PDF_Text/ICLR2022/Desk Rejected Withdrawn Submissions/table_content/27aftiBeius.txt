Table 1: A list of indicator attributes and their meaningsIndicator	Attribute	MeaningTarget distance threat Target attack threat determined by the opponent’s type, range, and lethality of the weapon. Target speed threat Terrain visibility threat Environmental indicator threat is conducive to concealment, mobility is more dangerous. Target defence value	Cost type Benefit type Benefit type Intervisibility > no intervisibility Benefit type Cost type	Distance between the two parties will influence the kill probability. Threat degrees should be The threat of speed from our opponents. Whether or not the terrain is visible will directly impact the threat. While the opponent’s environment The stronger the opponent’s armor, the harder it is to destroy it.

This paper does not limitevaluation to subjective analysis of experts, but also introduces reinforcement learning, associatesthe reinforcement learning algorithm through a reward function and analyses the actual wargameAI’s winning rate.
