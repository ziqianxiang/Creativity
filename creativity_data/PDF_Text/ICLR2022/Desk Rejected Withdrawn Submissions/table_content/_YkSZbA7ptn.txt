Table 1: Classification accuracies on 5 benchmarks (%). The best results are highlighted inboldface. On datasets where WL-ET and ETL are not strictly the highest-scoring models among thebaselines, our methods still achieve competitive results; thus, their accuracies are still highlighted inboldface. For the results of the baselines, we highlight those that are significantly higher than thoseof all other methods.
