Table 1: Comparison of the three features as discussed in this paper. For the difficulty of combiningmethods with our proposed techniques (see the last two columns), ‘difficult’ means more computingoverhead than the ‘moderate’ methods. ‘easy’ means that the methods do not need to calculatethe numerical integral for P-NTPP, which costs less than the ‘moderate’ methods. See details inAppendix J. °Note for combination, it refers to E-NTPP rather than the complete EPI-NTPP.
