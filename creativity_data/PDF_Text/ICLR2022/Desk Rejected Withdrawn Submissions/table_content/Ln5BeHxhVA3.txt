Table 1: Test Accuracy of different FL methods on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100.
Table 2: Evaluation of different FL methods on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, in terms of the numberof communication rounds to reach target test accuracy (acc). Note that we highlight the best andsecond best results in bold, respectively.
Table 3: The impact ofFL optimizer on FLBoost and other methods, and the impact of feature-levelgeneration on FLBoost. We display the test accuracy on CIFAR10, α = 0.3 and 0.6, and the roundnumber to reach the target accuracy (acc = 75% and acc = 80%) when α = 0.3.
Table 4: Impact of the each components inFLBoost (CIFAR10, α = 0.3).
