Table 1: Quantitative comparison on the DiLiGenT dataset. The metric here is mean angular error(MAE); the lower MAE is preferred.
Table 2: Quantitative comparison on the different specular models and number of basis. The metrichere is MAE; lower is preferred.
Table 3: Evaluations of the different variants of the proposed method. The second row is the methodwithout the shadow factor; the third row is without using the early stage smoothness constraint. Themetric here is MAE; lower is preferred.
Table 4: Quantitative comparison on using only the shadow guidance versus using only the shadowrendering during the training. The metric here is MAE; lower is preferred.
Table 5: Quantitative comparison on different variants of surface modeling. The metric here isMAE; lower is preferred. Below, we present the average MAE of ten objects in DiLiGenT.
