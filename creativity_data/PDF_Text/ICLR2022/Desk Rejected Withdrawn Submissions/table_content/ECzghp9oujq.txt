Table 5: Average feature vector similarity between the original and augmented samples by a super-vised version of the cutout, mixup, cutmix, and Cut&Remain. Each vector was obtained from thelast convolution layer of the ResNet-50 trained with the clavicle datasetFigure 7: Effect of the Cut&Remain and augmented images in the training dataset (in Clavicle X-raydataset)4.4.3	Performance according the number of annotationsWe evaluated the performance according amounts of the training dataset applying Cut&Remain. Theratio γ of the training data applying Cut&Remain was {0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0}. The performance ofCut&Remain with different γ is given in Figure 6. The Cut&Remain achieved the best performanceafter augmentation was applied to the overall training dataset (i.e., γ = 1.0). Furthermore, theAUC-ROC and F1-score monotonically increased with γ ; therefore, the performance improvementis guaranteed even if limited number of annotations are available.
