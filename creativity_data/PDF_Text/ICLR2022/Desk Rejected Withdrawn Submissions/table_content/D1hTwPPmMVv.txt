On the above basis, we presented a novel enhancedadversarial defense method, namely IDFR, which consists of an enhanced input denoiser ID and anefficient hidden lossy feature restorer FR with the convex hull optimization. Extensive experimentalresults have verified the effectiveness of the proposed IDFR, and have clearly shown that the IDFRhas achieved a new SOTA adversarial defense robustness performance compared to many state-of-the-art adversarial attack defense methods. How to further improve the defense performance of theproposed IDFR is our future research direction.
