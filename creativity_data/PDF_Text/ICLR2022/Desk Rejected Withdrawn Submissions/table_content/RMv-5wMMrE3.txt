Table 1: Grid search results over the various hyperparameter/architecture settings in the stochasticsetting. The third column represents the best validation accuracy among the various values of λ andinitial learning rates for a given architecture. The second column is the training accuracy associatedwith the value of λ and initial learning rate that gave the best validation accuracy.
