Table 1: Consistent Taxonomy: SYNTHIA→Cityscapes. The mIoU are over 13 classes and 16classes, resp. In the UDA setting, we adopt the class-mixed sampling strategy in DACS to augmentthe target domain. *The 3 classes are not included when calculating the mIoU over 13 classes.
Table 2: Open Taxonomy: SYNTHIA→Cityscapes. There are 13 classes labeled in the SYNTHIAdataset, and 6 new classes few-shot labeled in Cityscapes. The gray columns are the 6 new classesand mean IoU of 6 new classes in Cityscapes. ”M” represents the BMS module.
Table 3: Coarse-to-Fine Taxonomy: GTA5→Cityscapes. There are 3 classes in the GTA5 datasetfine-grained into 6 classes in the Cityscapes dataset. The gray columns are the 6 fine-grained classesin the Cityscapes and corresponding mean IoU of these classes. ”M”: BMS. ”*” with SLM module.
Table 4: Partially-Overlapping Taxonomy: Synscapes→Cityscapes. There are 3 classes (in gray) inthe Cityscapes partially overlapping with the source domain classes. ”M”: BMS. "*"： with SLM.
Table S1:	Coarse-to-Fine Taxonomy: GTA5→Cityscapes. The ”moving object” class in the GTA5dataSet iS fine-grained into 8 claSSeS in the CityScapeS dataSet. The gray columnS are the 8 fine-grainedclaSSeS in the CityScapeS and correSponding mean IoU of theSe claSSeS.
Table S2:	ConSiStent Taxonomy: GTA5→CityScapeS. The mIoU iS over 19 claSSeS. In the UDASetting, we adopt the claSS-mixed Sampling Strategy in DACS to augment the target domain. The beStresults are denoted in bold. * is the performance reported in the DACS (Tranheden et al., 2021). * isthe peak performance model publicly provided by the author of DACS (Tranheden et al., 2021).
