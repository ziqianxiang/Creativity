Table 1: Image-based retrieval of the multimodal embeddings from the fusion module using uni-modal image embedding from the upstream image encoder.
Table 2: Comparison of the performance of ReFNet with non-transformer baselines for the multi-modal IMDB dataset as described in Arevalo et al. (2017).
Table 3: Comparison of the performance on Hateful Memes and MMIMDB datasets.
Table 4: Ablation study on the Hateful Meme dataset (V: validation set, T: test set, x%: fraction oflabels used, AUC: area under the ROC curve and ACC is the accuracy of the predicted model).
Table 5: Comparison of different REFINER targets using five different modality pooling operationson the test and validation performances.
Table 6: Ablation study on the MM-IMDB dataset. Fraction labeled is the fraction of labeled sam-ples used during training for the logit binary cross entropy function.
Table 7: Text-based retrieval of the Multimodal embeddings from the fusion module using unimodaltext encoder as the query, and with a weight of 0.2 for the modality refiners.
