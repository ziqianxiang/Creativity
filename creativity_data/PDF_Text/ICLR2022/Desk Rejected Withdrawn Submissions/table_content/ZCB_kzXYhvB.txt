Table 1: meta-parameters.
Table 2: learning rate and others parameters for experiment.None stands for no implementation ofparameter. The cfg-eta value is very different from the ICFG. We gives a insight explanation in themethodology. LMADA value of None stands for don not use this parameter4	Experiment4.1	DatasetsWe used MNIST(LeCun et al., 1998), ,FashionMNIST(Xiao et al., 2017), EMNIST(Cohen et al.,2017), CIFAR10(Krizhevsky et al., 2009), the Street View House Numbers dataset (SVHN)(Netzeret al., 2011), and the large-scale scene understanding (LSUN) dataset(Yu et al., 2015). We almostfollow the origin ICFG choosing for the datasets. We also give some addition datasets for our ex-Periments. These datasets are provided with class labels (digits '0’ - '9' for MNIST, FashionMNIS,EMNIST and SVHN and 10 scene types for LSUN). A number of studies have used only one LSUNclass ('bedroom’) for image generation. The origin paper employs a balanced two-class dataset us-ing the same number of training images from the 'bedroom’ class and the 'living room’ class (LSUNBR+LR)and a balanced dataset from 'tower’ and 'bridge’ (LSUN T+B). But we choose to use the’bedroom’(LSUN B) and the LSUN Tower(LSUN T) to make our experiment because the originICFG performance not very well in these database and we also present the result of the (LSUNT+B) and (LSUN BR+LR) in our supplements.
