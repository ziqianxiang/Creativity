Table 4: NMEl and FR0.1 results of training on 300W and testing on the COFW-68 test set.
Table 5: Evaluation of the influence of different values of β on the 300W common set. ’Train’means the training fraction of full landmarks used in sparsely-supervised face alignment. Samplelogic applies for ’Test’.
