Table 1: Dataset CompositionWe first conduct our experiments on four common datasets used in Chinese Named Entity Recogni-tion, Chinese Resume Zhang & Yang (2018), People Daily3, MSRA Levow (2006) and Weibo Peng& Dredze (2015); He & Sun (2017). Chinese Resume is mainly collected from resume materials.
Table 2: Hyper-parametersThe backbone of the NER model used in our work is mainly Multi-feature Fusion Embedding (MFE)+ BiLSTM + CRF. The BiLSTM+CRF model is stable and has been verified in many researchprojects. Meanwhile, we mainly focus on testing the efficiency of our Multi-feature Fusion Embed-ding. So, if it works well with the BiLSTM+CRF model, it would have a great chance to performwell in other model structures.
Table 3: Results on three datasets in formal language environments, Chinese Resume, People Daily,and MSRA. In this table, we compare pure semantic embeddings with those using MFE.
Table 4: Results on two datasets in informal language environments, Weibo, and Substitution. Inthis table, we also compare pure semantic embeddings with those using MFE.
Table 5: F1 scores of different fusion strategies using MFE (BERT) on the five datasets.
