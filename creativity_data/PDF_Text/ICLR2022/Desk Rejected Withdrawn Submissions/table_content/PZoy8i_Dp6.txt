Table 1: Our experiments results compared to those of baseline operations. FPN uses summing-upand FPN-cat replaces summing up with concatenation, for feature aggregation. All models are trainedon the MSCOCO train set for 12 epochs, and evaluated on MSCOCO val set with 8 A-100 cards.
Table 2: Comparing to state-of-the-art models for the object detection task. All models 1) useResNet-50 backbone; 2) are trained on the MSCOCO train set; and 3) are evaluated on the MSCOCOtest-dev set. Please note that “CasMRCN” is the abbreviation of “Cascade Mask-RCNN”.
Table 3: Experiments results of proposed modules based on Mask-RCNN frameworks. All themodels are trained with train set of the corresponding datasets for 12 epochs and evaluated on val set.
Table 4: Using different numbers of MSSA modules. All models are trained on the train set ofMSCOCO for 12 epochs and evaluated on the val set. We use ResNet-50 as the backbone.
Table 5: Using different types of pooling layers for MSSA. All models are trained on the train set ofMSCOCO for 12 epochs and evaluated on the val set. We use ResNet-50 as the backbone.
Table 6: Using the vision-transformer-based backbone called Swin-T and plugging MSSA in. Allmodels are trained on the train set of MSCOCO for 12 epochs and evaluated on the val set.
