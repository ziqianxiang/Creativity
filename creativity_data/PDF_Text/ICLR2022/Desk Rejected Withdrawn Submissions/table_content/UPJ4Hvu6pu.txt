Table 1: The mIoU (%) comparison of thebaseline and ADELE with or without class-adaptively correcting labels, on the test set ofSegTHOR (Lambert et al., 2020). We reportthe test mIoU of the model that performs beston the validation set (Best Val), the test mIoUat the last epoch (Last Epoch), and the high-est test performance during training (Max Test).
Table 2: Ablation study for ADELE on SegTHOR (Lambert et al., 2020) and PASCAL VOC2012 (Everingham et al., 2015). We report the mIoU achieved at the last epoch on the validation setfor both dataset. Class-adaptive label correction mechanism achieves the best performance whencombined with multi-scale consistency regularization.
Table 3: Comparison with state-of-the-art methods on the Pascal VOC 2012 dataset using mIoU (%).
Table 4: Comparison with previous works that use external saliency models (Jiang et al., 2013) onthe PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset (Everingham et al., 2015). I. stands for image-level labels, S. standsfor external saliency models.
Table 5: Category-wise comparison of the IoU (%) of SEAM (Wang et al., 2020b) and SEAMcombined with the proposed method ADELE on the validation set of PASCAL VOC 2012.
Table 6: The mIoU (%) comparison of the baseline and ADELE on the test set of SegTHOR (Lambertet al., 2020). We report the test mIoU of the model that achieves best mIoU on the validation set. Itcan be seen that ADELE stably improve the model performance across different noise levels.

Table 8: mIoU(%) of ADELE on SegTHOR when label correction is based on model output at theend of each iteration or each epoch. The former achieVes better results.
