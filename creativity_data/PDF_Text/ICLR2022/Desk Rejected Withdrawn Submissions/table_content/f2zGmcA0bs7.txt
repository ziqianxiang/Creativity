Table 1: Evaluation of zero-shot text-to-video retrieval. MIL-NCE* uses the same training procedureas (Miech et al., 2020) with different backbone features, f indicates trainable backbone. Modalityindicates the modalities used during inference, where V: video, T: text, A: audio.
Table 2: Evaluation of zero-shot temporal action localization. MIL-NCE* uses the same trainingprocedure as (Miech et al., 2020) with different backbone features, f indicates trainable backbone.
