Table 1: The Pearson correlations with human judges when using B ERTtext similarity and IMAG-inE similarities to augment ROUGE, BERTScore, and BLEURT on DUC2004. Here we computesthree sets of IMAGINEimage similarity scores (meanÂ±std) with three different image generationbackbones for IMAGINE, namely dVAE, BigGAN, and VQGAN. IE: IMAGINE.
Table 2: The Pearson correlations with human judgement for each individual metric. IE: ImaginE.
Table 3: Dataset statistics. #sample is the number of samples in the test set; #ref is the number ofparallel references per visual instance; #len is the average reference length.
Table 4: The Kendall correlations with human judgement for each individual metric. IE: ImaginE.
