Table 1: ImageNet top-1 accuracy, latency and cost comparison with other methods. Thetotal cost stands for the search and training cost of N networks. Latency is reported for (Left)Intel Xeon CPU and (Right) NVIDIA P100 GPU with a batch size of 1 and 64 respectively.
Table 2: Contribution of terms.
Table 3: Search space specifications and indexing. ”MBInvRes” is the basic block in Sandleret al. (2018). ”ElasticMBInvRes” denotes the elastic blocks (Section 3.1) to be searchedfor. ”Cout ” stands for the output channels. Act denotes the activation function used in astage. "b" is the number of blocks in a stage, where [b, b] is a discrete interval. If necessary,the down-sampling occurs at the first block of a stage. ”er” stands for the expansion ratioof the point-wise convolutions, ”k” stands for the kernel size of the depth-wise separableconvolutions and ”se” stands for Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) with on and off denotingwith and without SE respectively. The configurations are indexed according to their expectedlatency.
