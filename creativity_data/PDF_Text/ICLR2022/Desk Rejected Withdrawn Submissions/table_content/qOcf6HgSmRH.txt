Table 1: Ablation studies of aggregators on the ogbn-proteins dataset. Proposed generalizedmessage aggregators with learnable parameters outperforms the fixed parameters version as well asthe vanilla aggregators overall.
Table 2: Ablations of SoftMax_Agg against the vanilla oneson ogbg-molhiv and ogbl-collab.
Table 3: Comparisons with SOTA on seven OGB datasets. * denotes that virtual nodes are used.
Table 4: Ablation on Model Sizes on ogbn-proteins.
Table 5: Exploring the characteristics of Generalized Message Aggregators. ProposedSoftMax_Agg(・)and PowerMean_Agg(∙) can approximate vanilla aggregators (Mean(∙) or Max(∙))with corresponding parameters. SoftMax_Agg(j and PoWerMean_Agg(.) also go beyond Mean(∙)and Max(∙) through interpolation and have potentials to achieve better performance. Results reportedby measuring test ROC-AUC on the ogbn-protein dataset. Note that due to some numerical issues inPyTorch, we are not able to use larger p for PowerMean_Agg.
