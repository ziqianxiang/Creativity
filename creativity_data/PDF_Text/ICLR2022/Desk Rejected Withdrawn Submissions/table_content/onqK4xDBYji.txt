Table 1: Accuracy comparison between BERTBASE and BERMoBASE on the probing task from theSentEval dataset. The results in the table correspond to the average accuracy over 5 runs. Two of theruns diverged for the WC tasks on the BERTBASE model and hence the results for WC are averagedover three runs.

Table 4: Comparing accuracy/F1-score of BERTBASE and BERMoBASE for different pruning ap-proaches4.2.4	Knowledge DistillationMany approaches complement the pruning strategies with the knowledge distillation to recover theloss in performance caused by pruning. We also show improvement in the performance by Knowl-edge Distillation, see Table 5. Our approach gives better results on SQuAD and comparable resultsfor MNLI and QQP as compared to baseline with the optimal hyperparameters for the baseline(Contribution (v)).
Table 5: Knowledge Distillation performance of BERTBASE and BERMoBASE5	DiscussionSummary: This work presents BERMo, a model architecture which uses the features from differentlayers to obtain a complex feature representation. Our work shows that the proposed model performsbetter than the baseline on the semantic tasks. Further, we find that the proposed model is more stableand converges faster (supports higher pruning rates) when subject to the compression techniques. Wefind our approach gives better parameter efficiency than the baseline on the QQP task for penaltybased pruning approaches. Moreover, our approach is comparable to BERTBASE when tested withKnowledge Distillation.
