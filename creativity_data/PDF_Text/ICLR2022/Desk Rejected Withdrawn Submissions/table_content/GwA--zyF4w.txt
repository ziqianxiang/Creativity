Emb.	18	20OUrS	10	13we compare with the following two baselines:Sharma & Ovsjanikov (2020). This baseline relies on learning LBO alignment and thus, is de-pendent on class that needs to be retrained for each of the 8 classes. We include their results eventhough our results are class agnostic and thus, significantly more robust and efficient. We obtainthese results by running the code provided by the authors.
