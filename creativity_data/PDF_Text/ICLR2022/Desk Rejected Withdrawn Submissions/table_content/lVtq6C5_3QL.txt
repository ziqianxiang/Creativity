Table 1: Results of dodging (untargeted) attack and impersonation (targeted) attack against FaceNet, ArcFace34,ArcFace50, CosFace50, and commercial API in the black-box setting. We report ASR and average NQ requiredfor simultaneous optimization. Three single models and their ensemble version are used as surrogate models.
Table 2: Comparison results of the ASR and NQ between our method and the method that only depends ontransfer, only changes the position (RHDE), and only changes the perturbation (ZO-AdaMM).

Table 5: Results of the ASR and NQ required for simultaneous optimization combined with Zeroth-Orderoptimization. We conduct dodging attack and impersonation attack against FaceNet, ArcFace34, ArcFace50,and CosFace50 in the black-box setting. Three single models and their ensemble version are used as surrogatemodels.
