Table 4: PreResNet-164 CIFAR-100	Table 5: WideResNet-28 × 10 CIFAR-100Table 6: Generalisation and Sharpness both increase with greater L2 regularis-taion. For typical neural networks trained on well known datasets commonly used Hessianmetrics, the trace, frobenius and spectral norms all increase as we increase the weight decaycoefficient γ . However our general g and approximate a metrics both indicate decreasedgeneralistaion difference.

We the classical Wide-Residual-Network on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-32both with and without a trace regularisation term, given by η. Whilst we report a singleshot result for ImageNet-32 due to the computational expense, the result is statisticallysignificant for CIFAR-100, where we run 4 seeds.
