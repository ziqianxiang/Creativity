We used the standard hypergraph datasets from prior works, and these are listed inTable 1. We observe 4% of node labels and predict the remaining 96%. To demonstrate that NetVecproduces high-quality results, we compare NetVec with state-of-the-art hypergraph embeddingapproaches as well as a number of popular methods for multi-level graph embedding approaches. Inparticular, we compare our results with HyperGCN[Yadati et al. (2019)], GraphZoom[Deng et al.

In Table 8 we can seethe effect of the coarsening on the size of the hypergraph as well as accuracy and running time.
