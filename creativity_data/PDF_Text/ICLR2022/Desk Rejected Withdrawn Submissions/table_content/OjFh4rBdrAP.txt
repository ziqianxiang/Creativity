Table 1: The comparison between ChapterGen and existing datasetsEach video in ChapterGen is associated with uploaded chapter descriptions. The chapter descrip-tions provide a list of chapter beginning timestamps and chapter titles for introducing the main con-tent of video parts. We use the chapter descriptions as the training ground-truth for video chaptergeneration.
