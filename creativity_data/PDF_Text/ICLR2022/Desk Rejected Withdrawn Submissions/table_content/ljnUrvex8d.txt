We demonstrated that RTD coincides with the natural as-sessment of representations similarity. We used the RTD to gain insights on neural networks repre-sentations in computer vision and NLP domains for various problems: training dynamics analysis,data distribution shift, transfer learning, ensemble learning, disentanglement assessment.
