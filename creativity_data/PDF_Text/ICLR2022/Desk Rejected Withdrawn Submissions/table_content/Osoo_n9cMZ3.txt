Table 1: Linear classification results for different contrastive methods and datasets. R-Crop and C-Crop mean RandomCrop and ContrastiveCrop respectively. We adopt ResNet-18 as the base modeland reproduce all the methods with a unified training setup as described in Sec. 4.2.
Table 2: Linear classification results (100epochs) on IN-200 and IN-1K. We use ex-actly the same training setup for comparisonof a method.
Table 3: Ablation of other transformations used inMoCo V2. We combine ColorJitter and Grayscaleas one color transformation. The results are fromResNet-50 pre-trained on IN-200 for 100 epochs.
Table 4: Fine-tuning results on PASCAL VOC detection and COCO detection and instance seg-mentation. All models are pre-trained for 200 epochs on ImageNet-1K. On VOC, the training andevaluation sets are trainval2007+2012 and test2007, on COCO are the train2017 andval2017. All models are fine-tuned for 24K iterations on VOC and 90K on COCO.
