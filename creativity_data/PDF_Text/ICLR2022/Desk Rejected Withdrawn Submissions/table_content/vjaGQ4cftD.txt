Table 1: Evaluation on the ScanNet. MinkUNnet is the baseline method. DA, Mix and FA donatedata alignment, point mixing up and feature alignment by the prototypes, respectively. GT indicatestraining with ground truth.
Table 2: The performance when fine-tuning on the labelled data. We omit the % to show the per-formance. f means that the network is pre-trained on the referring models by our method. @x%indicates x% of labelled data are used for fine-tuning. The number in () donates the improved accu-racy compared with purely supervised training.
