These challengesinclude maintaining high correlation between source video and target videos, as well as optimizing multiplecompeting ranking objectives. We designed a multi-objective learning algorithm to solve these challenges. Morespecifically, we add a candidate generation stage and extract features from the video profile info to maintainrelevance between items. We also train ALS-CFs and Two-tower DNNs in parallel to capture both linear andnon-linear relationships from user-item interactions, and use coordinating networks to select samples for
