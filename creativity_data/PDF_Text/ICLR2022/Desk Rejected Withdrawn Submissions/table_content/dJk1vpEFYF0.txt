Table 1: Comparison of test accuracy. We set N = 40, α = 1, λ = 12, S = 5, lr = 0.005 and T = 200for MNIST and Fashion-MNIST (FMNIST), and T = 300, lr = 0.03 for CIFAR10, Where lr denotes thelearning rate.
Table 2: Comparisons with various λ. We set N = 40, α = 1, R = 10, S = 5, lr = 0.005 and T = 200 forMNIST and Fashion-MNIST (FMNIST), where lr denotes the learning rate.
