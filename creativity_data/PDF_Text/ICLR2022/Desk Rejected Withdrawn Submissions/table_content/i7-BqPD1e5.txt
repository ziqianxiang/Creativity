In this experiment, the source dataset and sourcemodel are Cifar-10 and ResNet-18 respectively, and the target dataset is CUB, which is a fine-grainedimage classification dataset and differs greatly from Cifar-10. The target models are ResNet-18 andDenseNet-26 trained on CUB. The two target models use a consistent input resolution of 112x112and achieve approximately 54.9% and 48.3% accuracies. The attack success rates on the two targetmodels are reported in Table 10.
