Table 1: Comparison of testing top-1 accuracy (%) on different data sets by fine-tuning the super-vised and self-supervised pre-trained model. The proposed data selection fine-tuning consistentlyimproves the vanilla fine-tuning, with UOT being the best method.
Table 2: Comparison of data selection methods on CUB. (a) The UOT-cos selection is better thanGreedy-OT selection in terms of bird classes recall rate. (b) On the supervised pre-trained model,the recall rate is not sensitive to ec ; on the self-supervised model, when ec is small, its sensitivity issmall.
