Table 1: Exact match score of different models over the test sets of NQ and TriviaQA datasets. ?means that additional knowledge source like tables is used in this method. * stands for hybrid modelswhere multiple readers are used. All the baseline results are directly taken from the original papersexcept the ones under Our Implementation.
Table 2: Exact match score of FiD (large) and KG-FiD (large) with different computation cost.
Table 3: Ablation study of our graph-based reranking method in retriever and reader modules. EMscores are reported.
Table 4: Ablation study on the effectiveness of KG in our proposed reranking method in two mod-ules. w/ KG refers to using GNN for passage reranking as our current model while w/o KG refersto using MLP instead of GNN. EM scores are reported.
Table 5: Passage Retrieval Results. H@K is the Hits@K metric, measuring the percentage of top-Kretrieved passages that contain the ground-truth passage.
Table 6: Exact match score of FiD (large) and KG-FiD (large) with different computation cost.
Table 7: EM scores on NQ dev data of ourmodel under different choices of filtered pas-sage numbers and weights of reranking loss.
Table 8: Passage Retrieval Results on NQdev data of our model under different GNNtypes and number of layers.
