Table 1: Classification accuracy (%) of 5-way 1/5-shot tasks trained on the dataset mini-ImageNet.
Table 2: Classification accuracy (%) of 5-way 1/5-shot tasks under the leave-one-out setting.
Table 3: Classification Accuracy (%) of our proposed method comparing with the state-of-the-artfew-shot learning methods. The model is trained/evaluated only on the dataset mini-ImageNet.
Table 4: Ablation study on our method and the objective function. We consider the dataset CUB asthe unseen domain. “GNN+IN” indicates that we only employ the instance normalization strategy,“w/o Lr-cl” indicates that we remove the Lr-cl term, and “w/o Lr+cl” indicates that we remove the Lr+clterm.

Table 6: Classification Accuracy (%) of our proposed method with different Nw . We consider theCUB dataset as the unseen domain under the leave-one-out setting.
Table 7: Ablation study on our method. “GNN+IN” indicates that we only employ the instancenormalization strategy, “w/o Lr-cl” indicates that we remove the Lr-cl term, and “w/o Lr+cl” indicatesthat we remove the Lr+cl term, “GNN+MemREIN w/o MB” represents that we remove memory bankand directly use the feature map D, and “GNN+MemREIN (D&G)” represents that the memorybank is operated both on feature map D and G (not shared).
