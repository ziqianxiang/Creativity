Table 1: Complexity for each tasks. max time horizon means the maximum steps when the task terminates.
Table 2: 1 million time-steps training or gradient steps for URPL, REDQ-off, BCQ and CQL. BC means behaviorcloning. The performance are represented by the last iteration average return (raw, un-normalized scores). BTmeans the best trajectories(BT) return from the offline data. The scores for BC/SAC-off/BEAR/BRAC-p/BEAC-v/AWR are directly taken from the paper D4RL (Fu, Kumar, Nachum, Tucker, and Levine, 2020).
Table 3: 1 million time-steps training or gradient steps. The performance are reported as the average returnobtained using SLA. "w" means with the SLA metric in our experiments.
Table 4: One million time-steps training or gradient steps. The performance are reported as the average return.
