Table 1: Basic properties according to Fig.3Uncertainty ObservedYeszNo Sensitivity dataFigure 4: Concept learning. A concept defined by twoconstraints c0 : "Triangle is on the bottom of Circle"and c1 : "Circle is large". Top row: positive samplesand bottom row: negative samples. Clearly, if a modelonly captures c0, it can correctly distinguish positiveand negative samples. Similarly, models that capturec1 or c0 &c1 can do so as well.
Table 2: Our vs. baselines. We report classification accuracy for concept learning. Move: the number of movesof perfect “prey”, # Pos - # Neg: the difference in the numbers of positive and negative objects, and Obsessivehit: # hit -1, where # hit means how many times of repeating hitting a negative object.
