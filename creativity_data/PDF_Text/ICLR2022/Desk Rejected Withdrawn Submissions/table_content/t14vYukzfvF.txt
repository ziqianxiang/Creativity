Table 1: The overall performance Comparison. For training and testing, “AvgTime” measures theaverage search time for a maximum of 50 trails. For search-based baselines, since they do not havea training stage, we directly apply them to the training data and testing data, respectively. For SEMFand Supervised methods, different search methods only affect the testing phase.
