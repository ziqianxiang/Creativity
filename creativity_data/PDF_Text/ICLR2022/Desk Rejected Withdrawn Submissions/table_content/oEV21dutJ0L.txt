Table 1: Performance of JS2RL and baselines on three tasks in the DeepMind Control suite. We trainfor 500K environment steps on Simple Distractor. We evaluate the trained model on the same SimpleDistractor for data efficiency experiments, and evaluate the model on unseen Natural Video forgeneralization experiments. The results show the mean and standard deviation over three differentseeds.
