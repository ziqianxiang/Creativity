Table 1: List of UCR datasets used in the study.
Table 2: NMI scores for transductive clustering. Presented are the averages of 10 repetitions applied to 10 different constraint sets, i.e. 100 repetitions in total. Boldindicates the highest NMI score in each dataset and constraint percentage.
Table 3: NMI scores for inductive learning in which embeddings are Ieamt on the training set and generalisation evaluated on the test set. Presented are the averagesof 10 repetitions applied to 10 different constraint sets, i.e. 100 repetitions in total. Bold indicates the highest NMI score in each dataset and constraint percentage.
