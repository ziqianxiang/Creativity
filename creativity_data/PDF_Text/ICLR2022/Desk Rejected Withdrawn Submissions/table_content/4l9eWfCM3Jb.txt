Table 1: Performance comparison when the source and target domain differ of a time-invariant force,i.e. linear velocity drag for quadrotor and fixed-wing aircraft, and a lateral force on the pendulum.
Table 2: Image-based control and identification for the task of CartPole balancing. We report thesample budget in parentheses. The source and target domains differ by a time-variant non-linearforce. Our approach outperforms the baselines in terms of performance and sample efficiency.
Table 3: Performance comparison of model-free and model-based RL baselines on the CartPole,quadrotor, and fixed-wing control tasks. Here, in addition to the results from in Table 1, the standarddeviation is shown.
Table 4: High-speed flight with a quadrotor. Our trained controller can track the Power Loop trajectoryat a speed of up to 5ms-1.
