Table 1: Mean and standard deviation of the classification accuracy over 10 trials for the Fashion-MNISTdataset. The proposed methods were compared with the baseline Weighted method and fully-supervised method,with different classes used for training. The best and equivalent methods are shown in bold based on the 5%t-test, excluding fully-supervised method.
