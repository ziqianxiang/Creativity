Table A: Datasets and tasks of the main paper.
Table B: Compared Methods. For unsupervised methods the objective is based on reconstruction,neighbor-supervised methods utilize nearest neighbors as pseudo-labels to learn, denoising learns toignore added Gaussian noise.
Table C: Summary of tasks and datasets for the first stage document retrieval experiments presentedin the Appendix.
Table D: Examples of queries and documents from all the document retrieval datasets we use.
Table E: Summary of the results on document retrieval. (L=0) and (L>0) indicate which version ofTLDR had better perfomance (linear and factorized linear respectively). Note that arguana is notsuitable for training (not represented) and that we are not interested in using the same dataset fordimensionality reduction and test (thus the empty cells).
