Itproves that CiiV is indeed a proactive defender that doesn’t rely on observing confounders. We alsofound that AT methods made the model significantly overfit the given attacker in all datasets. Be-sides, when replacing the training samples of CiiV with AT examples, i.e., CiiV+AT, the robustnesscame with the price of decreasing clean performances. However, augmenting CiiV with other AT-free methods like mixup and RandAug improved both clean and adversarial performances, whichfurther supported our efforts to design a proactive AT-free defender.
