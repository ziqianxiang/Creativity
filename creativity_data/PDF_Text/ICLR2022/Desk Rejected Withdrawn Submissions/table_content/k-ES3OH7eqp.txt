Table 1: Details about the drug-likeness metrics proposed in this work. We look at all three rewardfunctions outlined in the text: PM-GNN’s reward function, and 3D-MolGNNRL ’s two separatereward functions R1(s, t) and R2(s, t). For each method, the top 3 candidates are chosen and theirmetric scores listed.
Table 2: Table outlining the three metrics used to evaluate the compounds produced by varyingreward functions and RL models. Compounds were screened and scored for an overall percentagebased on validity, uniqueness, and novelty.
