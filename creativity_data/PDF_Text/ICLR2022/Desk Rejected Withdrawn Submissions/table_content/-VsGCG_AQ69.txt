Table 1: Predator Prey scores with different attack models against different CMARL algorithms. Alower score indicates that the attack is more effective. A 0% trigger size represents a clean map.
Table 2: Ablation study of action poisoning and reward hacking modules. TrojDRL1 and TrojDRL2are targeted and untargeted versions of trojDRL.
Table 3: Predator Prey scores using the QMIX algorithm. We fine-tune our backdoored model for1,000,000 episodes (Fine-tune1) and 2,000,000 episodes (Fine-tune2) respectively.
