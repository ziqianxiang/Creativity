Table 1: Quantitative comparison of 1D signal reconstruction performance of the Gaussian embedderagainst the standard deviation (σ). Memorization ability of the model increases with σ. In contrast,the model generalizes better for a mid-range σ. We use a 4-layer MLP with Gaussian positionalembedding for this experiment.
