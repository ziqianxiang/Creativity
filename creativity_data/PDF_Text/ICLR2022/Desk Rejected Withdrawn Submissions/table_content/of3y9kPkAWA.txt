Table 1: Scores of baselines and PCR (Ours) on DMControl100k and DMControl500k. We select6 representative environments for benchmarking. The results show the mean and standard deviationaveraged over five runs and the best results are indicated in bold. PCR (Ours) reaches state-of-the-art performance on 4 out of 6 tasks on both benchmarks and just below DrQ on Reacher easyand Walker walk. Particularly, PCR significantly outperforms DrQ on the most challenging taskCheetah-run with 47.4% improvement on data limited DMControl100k bechmark and 13.6% onasymptotic optimal DMControl500k benchmark.
Table 2: Scores of PCR and its variants: (i) PCR without Predictive Consistency and (ii) PCR withContrastive Loss on DMControl100k (Data Limited Regime). The results show the mean and stan-dard deviation averaged over five runs, and the best results are indicated in bold. All hyperparametersare identical except the corresponding loss module. Neither abandoning the Predictive Consistencymodule nor replacing Predictive Loss with Contrastive Loss yields better results.
