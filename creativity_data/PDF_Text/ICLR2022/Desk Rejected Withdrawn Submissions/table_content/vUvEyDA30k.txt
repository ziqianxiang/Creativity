Table 1: The success rate (%) of targeted FGSM-based/FGS2M-based attacks. We study fourmodels—Inc-v3, Inc-v4, Res-152 and IncRes-v2, and adversarial examples are crafted via an en-semble of three of them. In each column, “-” denote the hold-out model. We comprehensivelyreport the results from three metrics, i.e., Ensemble, AoE and Hold-out.
Table 2: The success rate (%) of targeted FGSM-based/FGS2M-based attacks. We study ninemodels—Inc-v3, Inc-v4, Res-152, Res-101, Res-50, IncRes-v2, Inc-v3ens3, Inc-v3ens4 and IncRes-v2ens, and adversarial examples are crafted via an ensemble of eight of them. In each column, “-”denote the hold-out model. We comprehensively report the results from three metrics, i.e., Ensem-ble, AoE and Hold-out._______________________________________________	Attacks	-Inc-v3ens3	-Inc-V3ens4	-IncRes-v2ens	Avg.
Table 3: The success rate (%) of non-targeted FGSM-based/FGS2M-based attacks w.r.t adversarialexamples crafted via Inc-v3. We study nine models—Inc-v3, Inc-v4, IncRes-v2, Res-152, Res-101,Res-50, Inc-v3ens3, Inc-v3ens4 and InCReS-v2ens here.
Table 4: The success rate (%) of non-targeted FGSM-based/FGS2M-based attacks w.r.t adversarialexamples crafted via Inc-v4. We study nine models—Inc-v3, Inc-v4, IncRes-v2, Res-152, Res-101,Res-50, Inc-v3ens3, Inc-v3ens4 and InCReS-v2ens here.
Table 5: The success rate (%) of non-targeted FGSM-based/FGS2M-based attacks w.r.t adversarialexamples crafted via IncRes-v2. We study nine models—Inc-v3, Inc-v4, IncRes-v2, Res-152, Res-101, Res-50, Inc-v3ens3 , Inc-v3ens4 and IncRes-v2ens here.
Table 6: The success rate (%) of non-targeted FGSM-based/FGS2M-based attacks w.r.t adversarialexamples crafted via Res-152. We study nine models—Inc-v3, Inc-v4, IncRes-v2, Res-152, Res-101, Res-50, Inc-v3ens3 , Inc-v3ens4 and IncRes-v2ens here.
