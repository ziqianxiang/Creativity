Table 1: A comparison of training time (in number of epochs) in each stage for RL-based attacksagainst FL with FLTrust defense rule on Fashion-MNIST with i.i.d. data. Key parameters: numberof workers = 1,000, number of attackers = 50, subsampling level = 20%. All other parameters are setas default.
Table 2: A comparison of variances in the attack magnitude and the cosine similarity between thecrafted updates and the normal model updates for white-box MARL (WM) attacks against FL withdifferent defense rules on CIFAR-10 with i.i.d. data. Key parameters: number of workers = 1,000,number of attackers = 50, subsampling level = 20%. All other parameters are set as default.
