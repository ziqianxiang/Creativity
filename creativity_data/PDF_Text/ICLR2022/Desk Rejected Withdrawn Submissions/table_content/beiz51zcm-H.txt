Table 1: Perturbation Generators EvaluationMetrics: In addition to the same evaluation matrix used in Section 5.1, we also measure the inherentproperties of perturbation generators like University evasion rate (UAR)Co et al. (2019) which refersto perturbation’s ability to apply across a dataset or to other models. Given a model f, a perturbations, input x ∈ X and a threshold , the UAR of s over X is:|{x ∈ X : arg max f(x + s) 6= τ (x)||X|∣s∣∞ ≤ EWhereT(X) is the true label of X and Weset e = 255.
