Table 1: Pose estimation without pose annotations at training. Median error and accuracyon the Pascal3D+ car and chair test sets. Pose estimates are obtained through nearest neighborlookup into 1800 synthetic images with associated GT pose; reported values are the average over tenrandomly sampled codebooks. The full ABC-X method outperforms everything else.
Table 2: Performance boost to spherical regression by incorporating ABC-X. We showthe effectiveness of incorporating ABC-X as an additional loss term when the data consists ofannotated synthetic images and unannotated real images. ABC-X provides a means to incorporatethe latter which helps bridge the domain gap.
