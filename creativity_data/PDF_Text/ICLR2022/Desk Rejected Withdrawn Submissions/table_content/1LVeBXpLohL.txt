Table 1: ECE (%) computed for different approaches for pre-scaling, post-single temperature scaling(TS) and post-single weight scaling (WS) (with the optimal weight (%) in brackets). W â‰ˆ 100indicates an innately calibrated model.
Table 2: ECE for top-1 predictions (in %) using 25 bins (with the lowest in bold and the secondlowest underlined) on various image classification datasets and models with different calibrationmethods.
Table 3: ECE for top-1 predictions (in %) using various numbers of bins on CIFAR-100 dataset andmodels with equal size bins (ECWS) and an equal number of samples in each bin (CWS). LowestECE in bold.
