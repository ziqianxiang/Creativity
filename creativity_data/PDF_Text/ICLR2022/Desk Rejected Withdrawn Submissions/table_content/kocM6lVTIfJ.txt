Table 1: DataStatiStics.
Table 2: The performance Comparison on all datasets. ”#FI” is short for number of explicit featureinteractions. We use 0*0 to denote statistically significant improvements (paired t-test with p-value< 0.05). Intuitively, better performance with fewer feature interactionS repreSent a better model,we hence highlight the best performance and the least feature interactions in this table. For eachempirical result, We run the experiments for 5 times and report their average value.
