Table 1: Statistics of the dataset.
Table 2: The optimal hyper-parameters on the validation set for each ReGVD setting. “Const”denotes the graph construction method, wherein “Idx” and “UniT” denote the index-focused con-struction and the unique token-focused one, respectively. “Init” denotes the feature initialization,wherein “CB” and “G-CB” denote using only the embedding layer of CodeBERT and GraphCode-BERT to initialize the node features, respectively.
Table 3: Vulnerability detection accuracies (%) on the test set. The best scores are in bold, while thesecond best scores are in underline. The results of BiLSTM, TextCNN, RoBERTa, and CodeBERTare taken from (Lu et al., 2021). ? denotes that we report our own results for other baselines.
