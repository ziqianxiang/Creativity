This benchmark, strongARMLatch, has non-linear behaviors and variation-sensitive performances. A large amount of tuningefforts is required. It can take days for the expert to achieve the design target. Now RoDesigner canachieve the same task and produce high-quality solutions within an hour.

Each circuit benchmark is wrapped up as an environment including the circuit netlist,PDK, and the simulator. For RL part, we leverage the open-source library, rlpyt. In summary,RoDesigner provides the following features: (1) It supports different netlist, PDK, and simulators.
