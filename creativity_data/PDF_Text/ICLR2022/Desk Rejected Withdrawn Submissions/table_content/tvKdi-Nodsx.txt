Table 1: Test accuracies on several benchmark datasets with different settings. Every result isaveraged over 3 different random runs. The best result is boldfaced. Results of competitors onMNIST and CIFAR10 are reported in (Zhou et al., 2021c). Results on SVHN are reproduced byourselves using the provided code. CnFm implies the network includes n convolutional layersfollowed by m fully-connected layers.
