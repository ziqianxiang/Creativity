Table 1: Causal-TGAN in full expert knowledge setting. Results on different types of simulateddatasets. For all metrics, higher values indicate better performances. Scores for each dataset areprovided in Appendix C.
Table 2: Machine learning efficacy on real-world datasets. Note that, Causal-TGAN-NK is excludedfrom comparison with baseline models since it is included for ablation study purposes.
Table 3: Summary of datasets. Note that, # denotes the number of and Col. is the abbreviation ofcolumns. The machine learning tasks for real-world datasets are listed in the last column, whereC stands for classification and R stands for regression. We separate the train and test datasets byrandomly sampling from the whole dataset.
Table 4: Classifier and Regressor used in the evaluation of Machine Learning Efficacy. The names ofall parameters that used in the description are consistent with those defined in scikit-learn.
Table 5: Benchmark results on discrete-only simulated datasets.
Table 6: Benchmark results on continuous-only and mixed-type simulated datasets. Specifically,ecoli70 and arth150 are continuous-only datasets and healthcare and mehra are mixed-type datasets.
