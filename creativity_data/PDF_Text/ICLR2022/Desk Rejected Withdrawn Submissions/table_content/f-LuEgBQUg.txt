Table 1: Testing results on automatic metrics and human evaluation (accumulated ranking points).							•	WCT (Li et al., 2017c): WCT applies an encoder-decoder architecture for style transfer, wherethe whitening transform and the coloring transform is to match the covariance of the style feature;•	AdaIn (Huang & Belongie, 2017): AdaIn is also a feed-forward-based method that incorporatesthe adaptive instance normalization to fuse the content feature and the style feature.
