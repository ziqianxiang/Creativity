BioLeaF leverages previous bio-plausible worksâ€™ lim-itation, and bridges the gap between the bio-plausible approach and the BP-based approach bothanalytically and experimentally. The equivalence of these two approaches are demonstrated under aspecial setting, and the comparable experimental performance of them are benchmarked on MNISTand CIFAR10 datasets. This work may provide new insights on both approaches.
