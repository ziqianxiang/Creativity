Table 1: Statistics of the experimental datasets. The refined version represents that graph has someauxiliary nodes.
Table 2: Link prediction results on FB15K237 and its refined version. Results of TransE is takenfrom (Nguyen et al., 2018), TransH and TransD from (Zhang et al., 2018), but for RotatE we used(Han et 1 2018) to produce scores.
