Table 1: Representative zeroth order methods for constrained optimization problems, where N/Cmeans nonconvex/convex, W/B means white/black-box function, and the last column shows the sizeof the constraints.
Table 2: Datasets used in classification with pairwise constraints (We give the approximate size ofconstraints).
Table 3:	Test accuracy (%) of all the methods in classification with pairwise constraints.
Table 4:	Datasets used in classification with fairness constraints.
Table 5: Test accuracy (%) of all the methods in classification with fairness constraints.
