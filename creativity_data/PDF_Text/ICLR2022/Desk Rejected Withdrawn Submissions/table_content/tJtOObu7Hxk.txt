Table 1: Setting 1. Forp =0.9 and p = 0.1, we show the original size of each split for a dataset of size 200 aswell as the size of each split after SPIRE’s or QCEC’s augmentation. Note that SPIRE produces the balanceddistribution, while QCEC does not even make Main and Spurious independent.
Table 2: A few examples of the SPs identified bySPIRE for the Full Experiment. For each pair, wereport several basic dataset statistics including bias,PSpUioUPManoUPSpUious), which captures how far Mainand Spurious are away from being independent as wellas the sign of their correlation.
