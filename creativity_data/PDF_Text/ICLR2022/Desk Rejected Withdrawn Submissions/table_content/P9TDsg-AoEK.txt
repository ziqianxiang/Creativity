Table 1: Overall performance and label coverage (hole rate) in the tasks collected in BEIR. Relativeimprovements of MoDIR over its base DR model ANCE is shown in percentages. Datasets areordered by ANCEâ€™s Hole rate. Lower hole rate indicates more robust evaluation.
Table 2: Ablation studies on TREC-COVID and Touche. Underlined scores are generated by thedefault experimental setting, and bold scores are the highest in the row. Scores are nDCG@10.
Table 3: K-Nearest Neighbor Source Percentage and nDCG@10 scores after different number oftraining steps: comparison between with and without momentum, on TREC-COVID.
Table 4: Case study: nearest source queries of a target query before and after MoDIR training.
Table 5: Detailed hyperparameter choices of MoDIR.
