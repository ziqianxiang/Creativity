Table 1: The number of entities, relations, timestamps and observed triples for four benchmarkdatasets.
Table 2: Results comparison on four datasets. Compared metrics are time-aware filtered MRR(%)and Hits@1/3/10 (%), which are multiplied by 100. The best results among all models are in bold.
Table 3: The comparison of three indicators in different combinations. We average the output often experiments with different random seeds and fixed hyperparameters. All metrics are multipliedby 100.
Table 4: Reasoning paths searched for the query (John Kerry, Make a visit , ?, 2014-11-11) andtheir scores respectively.
Table 5: Reasoning paths searched for the query (Citizen (Nigeria), Use unconventional violence, ?, 8016) and their scores respectively.
Table 6:	20 questions and the corresponding paths selected in YAGO.
Table 7:	20 questions and the corresponding paths selected in WIKI.
