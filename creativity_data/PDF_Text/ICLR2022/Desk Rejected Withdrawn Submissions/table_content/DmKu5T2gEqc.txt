Table 1: Results on the Human3.6M dataset. Lower MSE, MAE, LPIPS scores and higher SSIM,PSNR Scores mean better results.
Table 2: Ablation study on the human3.6m dataset. ”L1&L2” means that we use L1&L2 to con-strain the refined forecast of the last iteration. ”without G” means that we remove the global appear-ance information during the refinement phase. ”without mask” means that the predicted hidden stateis directed used in next refinement cell. ”without area loss” means that we train the network withoutrestriCtion for the motion LSTM.______________________________________________________Method	I MSE* ⑷	SSIM(↑)	PSNR(↑)	LPIPS* ⑷	MAE* (J)L1&L2	20.1	0.916	25.2	9.3	10.6without G	17.0	0.928	26.1	8.9	9.7without mask	16.3	0.928	26.3	9.0	9.7without area loss	18.1	0.924	25.7	9.3	10.3CDNet	I^^160	0.934	26.4	8.1	8.5Ablation study. We evaluate the effect of each module of our CDNet on human 3.6m dataset, andshow the Ablation study results in Table 2. It Can be seen that the weighted loss and area lossContribute a lot to the improvement of performanCe, and the global information integration struCtureand mask struCture in the refine LSTM Can further improve the performanCe.
Table 3: Results on the UCF101 dataset. We test the CDNet in two settings, including predicting 10frames based on the past 10 frames at 64 × 88 resolution and predicting 10 frames based on the past4 frames at 160 × 120 resolution.
