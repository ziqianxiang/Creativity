Table 3: Accuracy of shape-biased classifiers against rotation and shifting of pixels on Geon3D underunseen viewpoints. We randomly add rotations of at most 30° and translations of at most 10% of theimage size in each x, y direction. We report the mean accuracy and standard deviation over 5 runs ofthis stochastic procedure over the entire evaluation set.
Table 4: Accuracy of classifiers against common corruptions under unseen viewpoints. All modelsare trained and evaluated on Geon3D-10 with random textured background. Pretraining on 3D shapereconstruction using DVR leads to broader robustness relative to other models.
Table 5: Accuracy of shape-biased classifiers against distributional shift in backgrounds. Here, allmodels are trained on Geon3D-10-CorrTextured (with background textures correlated with shapecategories) and evaluated on a test set where we break this correlation. See Appendix for resultsusing other common corruptions, where we find DVR+AT-L∞ provides broadest robustness acrossthe corruptions we tested.
