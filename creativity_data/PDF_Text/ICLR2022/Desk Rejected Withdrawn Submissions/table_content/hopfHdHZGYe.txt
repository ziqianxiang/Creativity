(kE k, kRk and kTk are the total number of entities, relationsand timestamps, respectively. ktraink, kvalidationk and ktestk are the number of quadruples intraining, validation and test sets. kGk is the sum of ktraink, kvalidationk and ktestk)Dataset	kEk	kRk	kTk	ktraink	kvalidationk	ktestk	kGkICEWS14	7,128	230	365	72,826	8,941	8,963	90,730ICEWS05-15	10,488	251	4017	368,962	46,275	46,092	461,329GDELT	500	20	366	2,735,685	341,961	341,961	3,419,607YAGO11k	10,622	10	398	16,408	2,050	2,051	20,509WIKIDATA12k	12,554	24	614	32,497	4,062	4,062	40,621YAGO15k	15,403	34	170	110,441	13,815	13,800	138,056Evaluation Metrics Metrics including Hits@1, Hits@3, Hits@10, and Mean Reciprocal Rank(MRR) are involved to measure the performances of TaCE against the baseline models. Metricformulations can be found in Appendix A.2.
Table 2: Link prediction results on ICEWS14, ICEWS05-15 and GDELT datasets. The best resultsfor each metric are marked in bold. All numbers of results are multiplied by 100%. Missing scoresnot reported are denoted by “一”. Due to limited space, We use H@1, H@3 and H@10 to representHits@1, Hits@3 and Hits@10, respectively.
