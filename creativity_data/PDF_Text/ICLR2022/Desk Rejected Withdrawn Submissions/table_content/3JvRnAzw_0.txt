To manifest the full power of our proposed per-turbation strategy and also benchmark the state-of-the-art robustness on CIFAR-10 under L∞ threatmodel, we conduct experiments on the large capacity network with different baseline methods. Wetrain Wide ResNet-34-10 for AT and TRADES, and Wide ResNet-28-10 for RST following theiroriginal papers. We evaluate the adversarial robustness of trained model with various test attackand report the “best” test robustness, with the results shown in Table 2. “Natural” denotes the accu-racy on natural test data. First, it is observed that the natural accuracy of RWP model consistentlyoutperforms AWP by a large margin. It is due to the benefits that our RWP avoids the excessiveweight perturbation. Moreover, RWP achieves the best adversarial robustness against all types ofattack across a wide range of baseline methods, which verifies that RWP is effective in general andimproves adversarial robustness reliably rather than improper tuning of hyper-parameters of attacks,
