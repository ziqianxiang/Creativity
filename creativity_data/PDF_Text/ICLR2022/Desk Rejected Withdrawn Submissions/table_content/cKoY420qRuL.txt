Table 1: Quantitative disentanglement results. We report median group-MIG and median MIGover five hyperparameter sweeps of different seeds (higher is better). Since the unsupervised ap-proaches and AdaGVAE do not learn group disentangled representations, we cannot report group-MIG for these groups and denote it with -. We highlight in bold the best results.
Table 2: Fair classification results on the test set of dSpriteUnfair and CelebA. We report testaccuracy and Demographic Parity (DP) for each sensitive attribute with an average of five experi-ments. We report the standard error for all test accuracies, but leave out the standard error for all DPresults as they were < 0.002. We highlight in bold the best results. The column Fair learning refersto whether a model uses any supervision during the fair representation learning phase. For the finalclassification, all models use full supervision.
Table 3: Evaluation of 3D point cloud reconstruction, classification, and transfer learning.
Table 4: Experimental setup for the disentanglement study. We list hyperparameters, modelarchitectures and hyperparamter common to the disentanglement study.
Table 5: Experimental settings for fair classification. We list hyperparameters of FFVAE and theMLP and CNN baselines.
