Table 1: CIFAR-10 experiments with pseudo-label-based SSL method FixMatch (Sohn et al., 2020),with 3 different folds. f: not a fair comparison with Us because it assumes balanced labeled dataavailable and leaks information about ground truth labels. * indicates results reported in FixMatch.
Table 2: CIFAR-10 experiments with transfer-learning-based SSL method, as proposed in Sim-CLRv2 (Chen et al., 2020b), with the mean and Std of 5 different folds and 2 runs in each fold. f:assumes prior label information and thus not a fair comparison.
Table 3: ImageNet experiments with fully supervised training and SSL algorithm FixMatch (Sohnet al., 2020) and Exponential Moving Average Normalization (EMAN) (Cai et al., 2021). * indicatesresults reported in EMAN. Note that f is not a fair comparison, as explained earlier.
Table 4: Comparison with active learning methods. Note that although MMA also experimentedwith k-Means, it does not benefit their performance. f: from Gao et al. (2020). *: We give allqueries in one round and do not need initial labels. CBSSAL considers interacting with FixMatchfor better performance, however DC-SSL can still yield better performance without any initial labels.
