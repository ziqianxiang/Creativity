Table 1: Mean accuracy of ADP-SGD/DP-SGD with polynomially decaying stepsizes. This table reportsAccuracy with the mean and the corresponding standard deviation over five independent runs given a pair of(ε, CG,T, Alg). The difference (“Gap”)between DP and ADP is provided for visualization purpose. Theresults suggest that the more iterations or epochs we use, the more improvements ADP-SGD can potentiallygain over DP-SGD. The results are reported in percentage (%). The highlight number is the best accuracy in arow among epoch 60, 120 and 200 for the same gradient clipping CG.
Table 2: Errors of ADP-SGD vs. DP-SGD with adaptive stepsizes. This table reports accuracy with themean and the corresponding standard deviation over five independent runs. The value inside the bracket is thehighest accuracy over the five runs. Each entry is the best value over 36 pairs of (β, C) for ADP-SGD and 6values ofβ for DP-SGD. See the corresponding (β, C) in Table 4. The results indicate that when using adaptivestepsizes, ADP-SGD with various C performs better than DP-SGD.
