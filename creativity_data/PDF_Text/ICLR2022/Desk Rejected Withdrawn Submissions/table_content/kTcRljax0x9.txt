Table 1: Impacts on the policy performance, perceptual similarity distances Psimilarity to the un-perturbed states, and raw scores for Carlini & Wagner (2017) formulation and natural perturbationframework components. We report all of the results with the standard error of the mean.
Table 2: Impacts of adversarially and vanilla trained policies with natural perturbation framework:brightness &contrast, blurring, rotation, shifting, compression artifacts and perspective transform.
