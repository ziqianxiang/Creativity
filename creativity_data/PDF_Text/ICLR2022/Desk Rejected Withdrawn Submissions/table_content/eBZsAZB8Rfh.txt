Table 1: The average precision (AP, in %) on all classes from different methods for cross-domainobject detection on the Clipartlk test set for PASCAL VOC → Clipartlk adaptation. The backboneis ResNet-IOl. We compare our method with SCL (Shen et al., 2019), SWDA (Saito et al., 2019),DM (Kim et al., 2019b), CRDA (Xu et al., 2020),HTCN (Chen et al., 2020), UMT (Deng et al.,2021), Source (F-RCNN), and Oracle (F-RCNN).
Table 2: The average precision (AP, in %) on all classes from different methods for cross-domainobject detection on the Watercolor2k test set for PASCAL VOC → Watercolor2k adaptation. Thebackbone is ResNet-101.
Table 3: The average precision (AP, in %) on all classes from different methods for cross-domainobject detection on the Foggy Cityscapes test set for Cityscapes → Foggy Cityscapes adaptation.
Table 4: The ablation studies on each of the losses and modules. We report mean average precision(mAP, in %) on each of the experimental datasets.
