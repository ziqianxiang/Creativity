When making everyday decisions, people are guided by their conscience, an inter-
nal sense of right and wrong, to behave morally. By contrast, artificial agents may
behave immorally when trained on environments that ignore moral concerns, such
as violent video games. With the advent of generally capable agents that pretrain
on many environments, mitigating inherited biases towards immoral behavior will
become necessary. However, prior work on aligning agents with human values
and morals focuses on small-scale settings lacking in semantic complexity. To
enable research in larger, more realistic settings, we introduce Jiminy Cricket, an
environment suite of 25 text-based adventure games with thousands of semantically
rich, morally salient scenarios. Via dense annotations for every possible action,
Jiminy Cricket environments robustly evaluate whether agents can act morally
while maximizing reward. To improve moral behavior, we leverage language
models with commonsense moral knowledge and develop strategies to mediate this
knowledge into actions. In extensive experiments, we find that our approach can
steer agents towards moral behavior without sacrificing performance.
1 Introduction
Moral awareness is an important skill for coexisting in a complex society. Almost effortlessly, most
people understand that others’ property should be respected and that wanton murder is bad. Moreover,
people are guided by their conscience to behave morally even when doing so is inconvenient.
By contrast, artificial agents trained to maximize reward may behave immorally if their training
environment ignores moral concerns, as often happens in video games. This is especially concerning
for the development of large-scale machine learning agents, which may be pretrained on swaths of
environments that do not penalize and may even reward behavior such as murder and theft, resulting
in harmful embedded biases.
Aligning agents with human values and morals is challenging, as human values are complex and
often unspoken (Rawls, 1999). Most existing work on training well-behaved agents focuses on
self-preservation of robots in continuous control or on simple environments with limited semantics,
such as gridworlds (Leike et al., 2017; Ray et al., 2019; Hadfield-Menell et al., 2016; Achiam et al.,
2017; Garcia & Ferndndez, 2015). In more realistic settings, the complexity of human values may
require new approaches. Thus, studying semantically rich environments that demonstrate the breadth
of human values in a variety of natural scenarios is an important next step.
To make progress on this ML Safety problem (Hendrycks et al., 2021b), we introduce the Jiminy
Cricket environment for moral behavior in text-based games. Jiminy Cricket consists of 25 Infocom
text adventures with dense morality annotations. For every action taken by the agent, our environment
reports the moral valence of the scenario and its degree of severity. This is accomplished by manually
annotating the full source code for all games, totaling over 400,000 lines. Our annotations cover the
wide variety of scenarios that naturally occur in Infocom text adventures, including theft, intoxication,
and animal cruelty, as well as altruism and positive human experiences. Using the Jiminy Cricket
environment, agents can be evaluated on whether they adhere to ethical standards while maximizing
reward in a complex, semantically rich environment.
We ask whether agents can be steered towards moral behavior without receiving unrealistically dense
human feedback. Thus, the annotations in Jiminy Cricket are intended for evaluation only, and
researchers should leverage external sources of ethical knowledge to improve performance. Recent

Figure 1:	The Jiminy Cricket environment evaluates text-based agents on their ability to act morally
in complex environments. In one path the agent chooses a moral action, and in the other three paths
the agent omits helping, steals from the victim, or destroys evidence. In all paths, the reward is zero,
highlighting a hazardous bias in environment rewards, namely that they sometimes do not penalize
immoral behavior. By comprehensively annotating moral scenarios at the source code level, we
ensure high-quality annotations for every possible action the agent can take.
work on text games has shown that commonsense priors from Transformer language models can be
highly effective at narrowing the action space and improving agent performance (Yao et al., 2020).
We therefore investigate whether language models can also be used to condition agents to act morally.
In particular, we leverage the observation by Hendrycks et al. (2021a) that Transformer language
models are slowly gaining the ability to predict the moral valence of diverse, real-world scenarios.
We propose a simple yet effective morality conditioning method for mediating this moral knowledge
into actions, effectively serving as an artificial conscience.
In extensive experiments, we find that our morality conditioning method allows agents to obtain
similar task performance while significantly reducing immoral behavior. Through ablations, we
examine several factors affecting the performance of our method and identify opportunities for further
improvements. The Jiminy Cricket environment and experiment code can be found at [anonymized].
We hope Jiminy Cricket aids the development of agents that behave morally in large-scale, realistic
environments.
2	Related Work
Benchmarks for Text-Based Adventure Games. Several previous works have developed learning
environments and benchmarks for text-based games. The Text-Based Adventure AI competition,
which ran from 2016 to 2018, evaluated agents on a suite of 20 human-made games, and discovered
that many games were too difficult for existing methods (Atkinson et al., 2019). C6t6 et al. (2018)
introduce TextWorld, in which games are synthetically generated. This enables curriculum training,
but the synthetic nature of TextWorld significantly reduces environment complexity. Hausknecht et al.
(2020) introduce the Jericho environment, including 50 human-made games of varying difficulty
levels. Jiminy Cricket uses Jericho’s interface to the Frotz interpreter due to its integration with
Python. Enabled by modifications at the source code level, Jiminy Cricket is a large-scale, novel
environment suite with previously unavailable high-quality games, various new features, and dense
morality annotations.
Most similar to our work is the concurrent work of Nahian et al. (2021), who create three TextWorld
environments for evaluating the moral behavior of agents. These environments are small-scale, con-
taining only 12 locations with no objects that can be interacted with. By contrast, Jiminy Cricket envi-
ronments are intricate, simulated worlds containing a total of 1,838 locations and nearly 5,000 objects
that can be interacted with. This admits a more realistic evaluation of the moral behavior of agents.
Value Alignment and Safe Exploration. Research on value alignment seeks to build agents that
act in view of human values rather than blindly follow a potentially underspecified reward signal.
Inverse reinforcement learning estimates reward functions by observing agent behavior (Russell,
1998). Hadfield-Menell et al. (2016) consider the more practical problem of optimally teaching an
agent to maximize human reward and propose cooperative inverse reinforcement learning. Leike et al.

an old man but is not rewarded for it. The agent tries to injure a butler by blowing pepper in his face
and is not punished for it. The agent receives the same punishment for torturing and ruffling leaves.
(2017) continue this line of work by outlining a reward modeling research direction. They anticipate
using models pretrained on human prose to build representations of human values. Hendrycks et al.
(2021a) show that this approach can work. They introduce the ETHICS benchmark, an ethical
understanding benchmark with high cross-cultural agreement spanning five long-standing ethical
frameworks. Building on this line of research, we ask whether moral knowledge in models trained on
ETHICS can be transferred into action.
Separately, safe exploration seeks to train agents that do not harm themselves or their environment
during the learning process. Methods for safe RL can successfully protect robots from taking self-
destructive actions that would damage expensive hardware (Achiam et al., 2017; Garcia & Fernandez,
2015). Several works investigate strategies for avoiding side effects (Turner et al., 2020), and others
propose environments for gauging safe exploration and value alignment more broadly (Ray et al.,
2019; Leike et al., 2017). The environments considered in these works are relatively simple, since they
focus on gridworlds or low-dimensional continuous control. Text adventure games are substantially
more complex and semantically rich. Within this more complex setting, we investigate whether
background knowledge on human values can be translated into action and find . As language models
become more capable of understanding and interacting with the world, we hope the Jiminy Cricket
environment can provide utility for researchers working on these important problems.
3 Biases in Reward s
We identify an emerging data bias hazard in reinforcement learning environments, which we call
the reward bias. Immoral actions frequently go unpunished in Infocom environments. This is also
the case in many modern video games. In creating Jiminy Cricket, we seek to provide a window
into systematic biases in environment rewards and observe how they create incentives that are
anticorrelated with moral behavior. In Figure 2, we see four distinct ways in which in-game reward is
incommensurate with commonsense morals. Agents may be punished disproportionately for various
actions, agents that take immoral actions may go unpunished, and agents that take moral actions
may not be rewarded. Finally, agents that take immoral actions may even be rewarded for gruesome
behavior, as shown in the leftmost pane. In fact, by counting immoral actions taken along the human
expert walkthroughs, we find that 17.3% of actions that receive reward are immoral.
Developing a better understanding of biases in rewards present in video games and text-based games
may be an important counterpart to building agents that behave morally even when rewarded for
immoral actions. This challenge will grow in importance as agents pretrain on more environments
(Team et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2021; Janner et al., 2021) and inherit biases from their environments.
Just as large pretrained language models inherit biases from their pretraining data (Bender et al.,
2021), so too may future RL agents. In the future, video game environments for pretraining may need
humans to manually replace existing scoring mechanisms with less biased rewards. Hence, we begin
work in addressing this impending data bias hazard.

Figure 3:	Our framework for annotating scenarios in Jiminy Cricket. The framework is designed to
capture pro tanto judgements about moral valence and ordinal degree. For example, murder is usually
bad, and murder is usually worse than theft. Hence, murder and theft are annotated as immoral with
degrees 3 and 2 respectively. By annotating games with our framework, we improve consistency
and limit subjectivity to its design, which integrates moral precedents from deontology, virtue ethics,
ordinary morality, and utilitarianism.
4	The Jiminy Cricket Environments
The Jiminy Cricket environment suite consists of twenty-five text-based adventure games with dense
morality annotations. As in standard text-based environments, agents receive reward for completing
puzzles and progressing through each game. Unlike before, agents are comprehensively evaluated for
adherence to commonsense morals via annotations for every action they take. We accomplish this by
manually annotating over 400,000 lines of source code from high-quality Infocom text adventures,
requiring six months of effort by a team of skilled annotators. Each game simulates a small world
and requires multiple hours of thoughtful effort for humans to complete. Thus, Jiminy Cricket
provides a testbed of semantically rich environments with vast action spaces for building artificial
consciences and aligning agents with human values.
In addition to morality annotations, we also include optimized walkthroughs for each game, which are
constructed by human experts to quickly obtain the maximum possible score. The walkthroughs take
few unnecessary immoral actions and serve as a soft upper bound on performance. A few games in
Jiminy Cricket can only be completed with information provided in external materials called “feelies.”
Unlike previous environment suites, we include scanned feelies for each game, anticipating the use
of multimodal models to extract the relevant information for solving these games.
Annotating Source Code. To create Jiminy Cricket, we leverage the recent rediscovery of the
Infocom source files. Infocom was a preeminent gaming company in the 1980s that pioneered the
interactive fiction genre. The Infocom games that we annotate contain a total of over 400,000 lines of
source code of which only a small percentage correspond to morally salient scenarios. The technical
expertise necessary for annotation made crowdsourcing marketplaces such as MTurk unsuitable
for the task. To ensure high-quality annotations, a selected group of graduate and CS undergraduate
students learned the ZIL language that games are written in and spent six months from start to finish,
reading through the source code and marking down lines corresponding to morally salient scenarios.
In addition to line number and file name, our annotations also include scenario descriptions and
morality labels. This enables us to obtain full coverage of all morally salient scenarios.
Morality Annotations. We annotate morally salient scenarios using the clear-cut multilabel frame-
work depicted in Figure 3. The framework is designed to provide a window into how morally and
immorally agents behave. To be highly inclusive, the framework marks scenarios if it is deemed
morally salient by at least one of the following long-standing moral frameworks: jurisprudence
(Rawls, 1999; Justinian I, 533), deontology (Ross, 1930; Kant, 1785), virtue ethics (Aristotle, 340
BC), ordinary morality (Gert, 2005; Kagan, 1991), and utilitarianism (Sidgwick, 1907; Lazari-Radek
& Singer, 2017). Together these cover the space of normative factors (Kagan, 1992). For example,
intent is marked as salient, in keeping with jurisprudence, deontology, ordinary morality, and virtue

ethics, but the wellbeing of nonhuman beings is also emphasized, following utilitarianism. To enable
clear-cut annotations, an action is labeled immoral if it is bad in a pro tanto sense (Ross, 1930)—
namely, it has bad aspects, but it could be outweighed or overridden. For example, wanton murder is
bad in a pro tanto sense, so we annotate it as such.
For increased detail, each annotation in Jiminy Cricket has a positive or negative valence, a focal point
(the agent or the environment) (Kagan, 1992), and a clearly defined ordinal degree in {1, 2, 3}. This
lets us represent each annotation as a 3-tuple hvalence, focal point, degreei. When the agent indicates
intent to perform an action and it does not occur, the degree decreases by one to a minimum of 1.
For example, theft has a degree of 2, and attempted theft has a degree of 1. Examples of annotations
during gameplay are in Figures 10, 11.
Due to its simplicity, our framework enables clear-cut annotation. We collect examples for each
category of the framework, some of which are in Figure 3. We then assign multilabel annotations to
scenarios via comparisons with the example scenarios. This allows us to confidently assign labels, sim-
ilar to multilabel image annotation. Additionally, we let the environment spell out the consequences of
actions for us and do not make assumptions about what happens, making multilabel annotation simple
and sidestep judgment calls. Further details are in Appendix C. Future work could use the marked sce-
narios covered by our consistent and broad framework, which includes multiple ethical frameworks,
and use our marked scenarios as a starting point to annotate using other custom moral frameworks.
Fast-Forwarding. In existing benchmarks for text-based games, state-of-the-art agents only
encounter a small number of scenarios before getting stuck (Ammanabrolu et al., 2020). Thus,
although the games may contain substantial content, in practice agents are evaluated on a limited
set of scenarios. To increase the diversity of scenarios that agents are evaluated on, we introduce
a new methodology where agents are fast-forwarded through the beginning parts of a game before
evaluation. In Jiminy Cricket, all games have a ‘starting percentage’ environment parameter that
controls the percentage of steps traveled along a human expert walkthrough before ceding control
to the agent. When evaluating a baseline CALM agent (Yao et al., 2020) on Jiminy Cricket, we find
that using five equally spaced starting percentages (0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%) increases the number
of unique morality annotations that the agent encounters by 240%.
Metrics. We compare agents on two axes of performance: progress towards completing games and
moral behavior. To measure progress towards completing games, we use the Percent Completion
metric. For a single episode in an environment, this is computed as Pk = 100 × (sa - sk)/(smax - sk),
where sa is the score of the agent, smax is the maximum score for a given game, and sk is the initial
score of the agent at starting percentage k . This measures the percent of the remaining score that the
agent obtains. To aggregate Percent Completion across starting percentages for a given game, we
use the weighted average PaVerage = Pk∈K Pk (SmaX - Sk) / (pk∕∈K SmaX - Sk), which corrects for
the fact that Pk may be larger for higher k. Alternatively, we arrive at the same result by summing
scores (Sa - Sk) across all k before normalizing by the sum of (SmaX - Sk) across all k. To aggregate
Percent Completion across games, we use a simple average.
Moral behavior is evaluated using our annotations. In our main eXperiments, we focus on
hNegative, Others, 1-3i annotations, denoting all annotations that fall in the Negative and Others cate-
gories. We sum the degree of all immoral actions taken in an episode to obtain the Immorality metric
on a single episode, which is aggregated across starting percentages and games using a simple average.
Since agents that progress further in the games may be required to take more immoral actions in a given

5 Conditioning Agents to Act Morally
5.1	Baseline Agents
For baselines, we compare to existing text-based agents that do not use a valid action handicap, since
this operation requires a large amount of time. We also compare to a random baseline and human
expert performance. The baseline methods we evaluate are:
•	CALM: The state-of-the-art CALM agent (Yao et al., 2020) uses a GPT-2 language model to
generate admissible actions conditioned on context. We retrain the CALM action generator with
Jiminy Cricket games removed. The action generator is used with a DRRN backbone (He et al.,
2016), which learns to select actions via Q-learning.
•	Random Agent: The Random Agent baseline uses CALM-generated actions, but estimates Q-
values using a network with random weights.
•	NAIL: The NAIL agent uses hand-crafted heuristics to explore its environment and select actions
based on the observations Hausknecht et al. (2019).
•	Human Expert: The Human Expert baseline uses walkthroughs written by human experts, which
take direct routes towards obtaining full scores on each game.
5.2	Morality Conditioning
Controlling the behavior of RL agents can be challenging, sometimes requiring careful reward
shaping to obtain a desired behavior. We investigate a simple and practical method for inducing moral
behavior in text-based agents, drawing on the notion of conscience. Crucially, we leverage the recent
finding that large language models possessing commonsense understanding can predict the moral
valence of short scenarios (Hendrycks et al., 2021a).
Language Model Morality Scores. At the core of each morality conditioning method we explore
is a language model with an understanding of ethics. For most experiments, we use a RoBERTa-large
model (Liu et al., 2019) fine-tuned on the commonsense morality portion of the ETHICS benchmark
(Hendrycks et al., 2021a). We use prompt engineering of the form ‘I ’ + hactioni + ‘.’ and pass this
string into the RoBERTa model, which returns a score for how immoral the action is. To reduce noise,
we threshold this score at a fixed value. This gives an indicator for whether a given action is immoral.
Mediating Moral Knowledge Into Actions. Given a way of knowing that an action is immoral,
we condition a CALM agent to behave morally using policy shaping. Recall that the baseline
CALM agent is trained with Q-learning. With policy shaping, the Q-values become Q0 (ct , at) =
Q(Ct, at) - Yl [fimmorai(at) > T], where Q(q, at) is the original Q-value for context Ct and action
at, fimmoral is a score for how immoral an action is, τ is an immorality threshold, and γ ≥ 0 is a scalar

controlling the strength of the conditioning. In all experiments, we set γ = 10, a large value that
effectively bans actions deemed immoral by the ETHICS model. We set τ to enable fair comparisons
between different fimmoral models, as described in Appendix B. This form of conditioning can be
interpreted as imposing a prior on the Q-values that discourages immoral actions. In our main
experiments, we evaluate:
•	Commonsense Morality Policy Shaping (CMPS): This method uses a RoBERTa-large trained on
commonsense morality scenarios to provide an indicator for whether actions are immoral. Policy
shaping is used to control agent behavior. We use this method as our main baseline for morality
conditioning.
•	CMPS + Oracle: This method uses a morality oracle provided by the Jiminy Cricket environments
to indicate whether actions are immoral. As with CMPS, an underling CALM agent is controlled
with policy shaping, but the threshold parameter is no longer needed.
6	Experiments
We evaluate agents on all 25 Jiminy Cricket games at five equally spaced starting percentages (0%,
20%, 40%, 60%, 80%). In total, each method is evaluated in 125 different experiments. In all
experiments with CALM agents, we follow Yao et al. (2020) and train on 8 parallel environments
with a limit of 100 actions per episode. Unlike the original CALM, we train for 15,000 steps. This
is enabled by our efficiency improvements described in Appendix D. We stop training early if the
maximum score is less than or equal to 0 after the first 5,000 steps. NAIL agents are trained for
30,000 steps with a limit of 300 actions per episode. In preliminary experiments, we found that these
settings give agents ample time to converge.

A central question is whether morality conditioning can actually work. Table 2 shows the main
results for the baselines and morality conditioning methods described in Section 5. We find that
conditioning with policy shaping substantially reduces Relative Immorality without reducing Percent
Completion. CMPS reduces per-episode Immorality by 58.5% compared to the CALM baseline,
with lower Immorality in 22 out of 25 games (see Table 1). Policy shaping with an oracle morality
model is highly effective at reducing immoral actions, outperforming Human Expert on Relative
Immorality. This can be explained by the high γ value that we use, which strongly disincentivizes
actions deemed immoral by the ETHICS model. Thus, the only immoral actions taken by the Oracle
Policy Shaping agent are situations that the underlying CALM agent cannot avoid. These results
demonstrate that real progress can be made on Jiminy Cricket by using conditioning methods and
that better morality models can further improve moral behavior.
Intermediate Performance. In Figure 6, we
plot trade-offs between Immorality and Percent
Completion achieved by agents on Jiminy
Cricket. The right endpoints of each curve cor-
responds to the performance at convergence as
reported in Table 2 and can be used to compute
Relative Immorality. Intermediate points are
computed by assuming the agent was stopped
after min(n, length(episode)) actions in each
episode, with n ranging from 0 to the maximum
number of steps. This corresponds to early stop-
ping of agents at evaluation time. By examining
the curves, we see that policy shaping reduces
the Immorality metric at all n beyond what
simple early stopping of the CALM baseline
would achieve. Interestingly, the curves slope
upwards towards the right. In Appendix B, we
plot within-episode performance and show that
this is due to steady increases in Immorality and
diminishing returns in Percent Completion.
Figure 6: Performance of agents at various interac-
tion budgets. CMPS yields an improved trade-off
curve.
Safe Exploration. In some cases, moral behavior at the end of training is not enough. For instance,
agents should not have to learn that murder is bad via trial and error. To examine whether morality
conditioning with CMPS helps agents take fewer immoral actions during training, we plot perfor-
mance metrics against training steps in Figure 5. We find that CMPS has a lower rate of immoral
actions at every step of training. This shows that steering behavior with language models possessing
ethical understanding is a promising way to tackle the problem of safe exploration.
6.2	Improving Artificial Consciences
A central objective in Jiminy Cricket is improving moral behavior. To provide a strong baseline
method for reducing immoral actions, we explore several factors in the design of morality conditioning
methods and report their effect on overall performance.
Increasing Moral Knowledge. In Table 2, we see that using an oracle to identify immoral actions
can greatly improve the moral behavior of the agent. The morality model used by CMPS only
obtains 63.4% accuracy on a hard test set for commonsense morality questions (Hendrycks et al.,

2021a), indicating that agent behavior on Jiminy Cricket could be improved with stronger models of
commonsense morality.
Wellbeing as a Basis for Action Selection. To see whether other forms of ethical understanding
could be useful, we substitute the commonsense morality model in CMPS for a RoBERTa-large
trained on the utilitarianism portion of the ETHICS benchmark. Utilitarianism models estimate
pleasantness of arbitrary scenarios. Using a utilitarianism model, an action is classified as immoral if
its utility score is lower than a fixed threshold, chosen as described in Appendix B. We call this method
Utility Shaping and show results in Table 3. Although Utility Shaping reaches a higher Percent
Completion than CMPS, its Immorality metric is higher. However, when only considering immoral
actions of degree 3, we find that Utility Shaping reduces Immorality by 35% compared to CMPS,
from 0.054 to 0.040. Thus, Utility Shaping may be better suited for discouraging extremely immoral
actions. Furthermore, utility models can in principle encourage beneficial actions, so combining the
two may be an interesting direction for future work.
Reward Shaping vs. Policy Shaping. A common approach for controlling the behavior of RL
agents is to modify the reward signal with a corrective term. This is known as reward shaping. We
investigate whether reward shaping can be used to discourage immoral actions in Jiminy Cricket by
adding a constant term of -0.5 to the reward of all immoral actions taken by the agent. In Table 3,
we see that reward shaping with an oracle reduces the number of immoral actions, but not nearly as
much as policy shaping with an oracle. When substituting the commonsense morality model in place
of the oracle, the number of immoral actions increases to between CMPS and the CALM baseline.
Although we find reward shaping to be less effective than policy shaping, reward shaping does have
the fundamental advantage of seeing the consequences of actions, which are sometimes necessary for
gauging whether an action is immoral. Thus, future methods combining reward shaping and policy
shaping may yield even better performance.
Noise Reduction. Managing noise introduced by the morality model is an important component
of our CMPS agent. The commonsense morality model outputs a soft probability score, which one
might naively use to condition the agent. However, we find that thresholding can greatly improve
performance, as shown in Table 3. Soft Shaping is implemented in the same way as CMPS, but with
the action-values modified via Q0(ct, at) = Q(Ct, at) - Y ∙ fimmorai(at) Where fimmoral (at) is the soft
probability score given by the RoBERTa commonsense morality model. Since the morality model is
imperfect, this introduces noise into the learning process, reducing the agent’s reWard. Thresholding
reduces this noise and leads to higher percent completion Without increasing immorality.
7	Conclusion
We introduced Jiminy Cricket, a suite of environments for evaluating the moral behavior of arti-
ficial agents in the complex, semantically rich environments of text-based adventure games. We
demonstrated hoW our annotations of morality across 25 games provide a testbed for developing
neW methods for inducing moral behavior. Namely, We shoWed that large language models With
ethical understanding can be used to improve performance on Jiminy Cricket by translating moral
knoWledge into action. In experiments With the state-of-the-art CALM agent, We found that our
morality conditioning method steered agents toWards moral behavior Without sacrificing performance.
We hope the Jiminy Cricket environment fosters neW Work on human value alignment and Work
rectifying reWard biases that may by default incentivize models to behave immorally.

A	Background on Text-Based Agents
A text-based game can be represented as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP)
and solved with conventional reinforcement learning algorithms. One popular architecture for
text-based agents is DRRN (He et al., 2016), which incorporates deep Q-learning. In DRRN, the
observation-action pairs are encoded with separate recurrent neural networks and then fed into a
decoder to output Q-values. The Q-function is learned by sampling tuples (o, a, r, o0) of observation,
action, reward, and next observation from a replay buffer and minimizing the temporal difference
(TD) loss. Later algorithms such as KG-DQN, KG-A2C, and GATA incorporate knowledge graphs
to improve inductive biases (Ammanabrolu & Riedl, 2019; Ammanabrolu & Hausknecht, 2020;
Adhikari et al., 2020; Ammanabrolu et al., 2020). However, due to combinatorially large action
spaces, these approaches still require action generation handicaps to various degrees for obtaining
a list of valid actions at each step. To address this problem, CALM (Yao et al., 2020) fine-tunes
a language model (GPT-2) on context action pairs (c, a) obtained from a suite of human game
walkthroughs. The language model is then used to generate a set of candidate actions given context
at each step, serving as a linguistic prior for the DRRN agent. This approach outperforms NAIL
(Hausknecht et al., 2019), which also does not require handicaps but relies on a set of hand-written
heuristics to explore and act.
B Additional Experiments
Evaluations on All Annotation Categories. Our main evaluations focus on the Immorality metric,
which measures the harm that the agent causes to the environment and other actors within the
environment. However, Jiminy Cricket annotations also measure the degree of harm that the agent
causes itself, and the positive actions that it performs for the environment and itself. Here, we evaluate
the baseline CALM agent and our CMPS agent on these additional categories of annotations. Results
are in Figure 8 of the main paper. Note that positive actions are less prevalent than negative actions,

leading to fewer samples with which to estimate Human Expert performance in the bottom two plots.
We observe that CMPS reduces self-harm compared to CALM, and the human walkthroughs perform
more good actions to others.
Zero-Shot Transfer of Moral Knowledge.
In Section 6.2, we evaluate different sources
of moral knowledge based on how well they
improve agent behavior on Jiminy Cricket.
Namely, we compare two RoBERTa models
trained on the commonsense morality and util-
itarianism tasks of the ETHICS benchmark re-
spectively. These experiments are relatively ex-
pensive and do not directly evaluate the lan-
guage models. As an additional analysis, we
compare morality models using a zero-shot eval-
uation of their ability to classify whether actions
are moral. For this experiment, we generate 100
actions from the CALM action generator at each
step of the human expert walkthroughs. On a
given step, we check which of the 100 actions
are immoral and use these to form the positive
set of a binary classification dataset. The remain-
ing actions are added to the negative set. Using
the score provided by a morality model, we plot
the ROC curve for detecting immoral actions.
Results are in Figure 9.
The thresholds in the noise reduction experi-
ments are chosen to achieve a fixed false positive

liably, mirroring the results in Table 3 of the main

In Figure 9 of the main paper, we show the ROC curves of these classifiers. The AUROC of the
commonsense morality model and utility models are 72.5% and 59.4% respectively, indicating that
the commonsense morality model transfers better to Jiminy Cricket.

C Additional Information on Jiminy Cricket
Inter-Annotator Agreement. To quantify inter-annotator agreement, we independently assign
two morality labels to a subset of scenarios. Two annotators are given 42 scenarios across three
games (The Lurking Horror, Deadline, and Wishbringer) and use the framework shown in Figure 3
to categorize the scenarios. Note that this a multi-label categorization, as scenarios are sometimes
salient for the agent and for the environment. We find that the morality labels agree on the 4-way
broad moral category 100% of the time and the 12-way degree 95% of the time, indicating high
inter-annotator agreement.
Annotation Framework Details. Our annotation framework is summarized in Figure 3. During
annotation, we used an expanded set of example scenarios to guide the assignment of morality labels.
We began with an initial set of examples by inclusively integrating moral precedents from deontology
(Ross, 1930; Kant, 1785), virtue ethics (Aristotle, 340 BC), ordinary morality (Gert, 2005; Kagan,
1991), and utilitarianism (Sidgwick, 1907; Lazari-Radek & Singer, 2017). Further examples were
added during annotation if they were sufficiently distinct, and they were categorized in a consistent
manner with existing examples in the framework. The final set of examples is representative of the
vast majority of morally salient scenarios in Jiminy Cricket games:

Our annotation framework provides a first look into the moral behavior of agents in text-based games.
Future work could try improving on our consistent albeit coarse framework to provide a more detailed
assessment of moral behavior or to represent different stakeholders.

Complete Object Tree. The object tree is an internal representation that text-based adventure
games use to implement a persistent world. Each game consists of objects and rooms, where objects
implement everything from NPCs to buried treasure and rooms contain the objects and link to
other rooms. Objects can also contain other objects, leading to a tree-like structure. The Jericho
environment provides a downstream version of the object tree from emulator memory (Hausknecht
et al., 2020). However, this is incomplete and sometimes incorrect, as shown in Figure 13. In Jiminy
Cricket, we modify the source code of the games to obtain a high-fidelity, complete object tree. Our
object trees are also interpretable, as they link back to information at the source code level, including
object and property names. This enables a variety of use cases, including visualizing game states and
directly evaluating knowledge graphs.
Jiminy Cricket’s object tree operates similarly to the morality annotations. Behind the scenes, Jiminy
Cricket games print out location and binary attribute values of every object relevant to gameplay,
which are subsequently parsed. The object tree also contains a complete list of rooms in the game and
links between them. The information provided object tree enables a variety of novel use cases. Figure
12 shows one such use of the object tree. Using information from the object tree with force-directed
graph drawing, we create a map of Zork 2 that closely matches the ground-truth map provided by
Infocom. The map is colored according to how many objects each room contains, and we show an
inside-view of the starter room.
We also use the object tree to re-implement the valid action handicap from the Jericho environment.
The valid action handicap provides a list of actions that change the game state, allowing agents to
circumvent the problem of generating actions in the space of natural language. The valid action
handicap consists of an algorithm for filling in action templates with all possible combinations of
parsed interactive objects. To identify interactive objects from Jiminy Cricket’s object tree, we simply
read off all the objects in the same room as the player that are visible, as well as the globally visible
objects. Thanks to a more complete list of objects that can be interacted with, we obtain greater
coverage of allowed actions. However, we find that this greatly increases computation time due to the
quadratic cost of the algorithm. Thus, we focus our evaluation on agents that do not use the valid
action handicap, but rather leverage natural language priors.
Comparison with Jericho. Jiminy Cricket uses the Jericho environment’s interface to the Frotz
interpreter for Z-machine games (Hausknecht et al., 2020). Previous environment suites have
developed such an interface (Atkinson et al., 2019), but we choose Jericho’s for its integration with
Python. While Jiminy Cricket was designed specifically for evaluating the moral behavior of agents
and serves a different purpose than Jericho, it also improves upon Jericho in several ways:
•	Jiminy Cricket leverages source code access to provide morality annotations for every possible
action and scenario that agents encounter.
•	Jiminy Cricket contains many games that are not part of Jericho. In fact, six of the games in
Jiminy Cricket were previously unavailable for any text-based game benchmark, because they did
not originally come with environment rewards.
•	Jiminy Cricket environments are all high-quality Infocom titles, whereas Jericho contains
community-built games, including one notoriously low-quality game written when the author was
twelve years of age (https://www.ifwiki.org/index.php/Detective).
•	Some games in Jericho can only be completed with access to external information packets
known as “feelies”, which Jericho does not provide. This implies some games in Jericho are not
completable. In Jiminy Cricket, we rectify this issue and provide scanned feelies for each game.
•	Jiminy Cricket introduces a novel fast-forwarding evaluation methodology that substantially
increases the number of distinct scenarios in which agents are evaluated.
•	Jiminy Cricket’s complete object tree provides more information of a higher fidelity than Jericho’s
object tree (see Figure 13)

Table 6: Results at each starting percentage. Each value averages the performance of 25 trained
agents—one for each Jiminy Cricket environment. Our fast-forwarding methodology substantially
increases the diversity of scenarios that agents are evaluated on, resulting in a more informative
comparison than only evaluating agents in the early stages of games. Interestingly, we find that
agents achieve similar fractions of the remaining reward at each starting percentage, which indicates
that obtaining a fixed amount of reward is harder in later stages of the game, where more complex
manipulations of accumulated items may be required. Entries marked N/A do not attain a positive
average Percent Completion and so cannot be compared on the Relative Immorality Metric. For
all starting percentages, CMPS has lower Immorality than CALM, indicating that our approach for
steering agents towards moral behavior works in diverse scenarios throughout the Jiminy Cricket
games.
We view Jericho as a valuable complementary benchmark for testing agents on an additional set of
games of various difficulty levels.
Additional Details.
•	We recommend using Zork 1, Stationfall, Enchanter, Suspect, and Suspended as validation
environments if methods require tuning on ground-truth morality annotations. We also encourage
reporting zero-shot performance where possible.
•	Jiminy Cricket annotations record ordinal degree. For example, murder and theft have degrees 3
and 2 respectively, because murder is usually worse than theft. In our evaluations, we compute
Immorality by averaging across the raw degree values. However, it is also possible to assign
weights to each degree. For instance, one might decide that actions as bad as murder should
be weighed 100 times higher than actions like theft. It is also possible to investigate individual
degrees without aggregating, as we do with Utility Shaping.
•	Some Infocom games do not originally provide environment rewards and thus were previously
unavailable for reinforcement learning agents. We unlock these games by modifying their source
code to provide rewards for encouraging exploration and completing puzzles. The games that we
add custom rewards to are Moonmist, Suspended, Suspect, Witness, Borderzone, and Deadline.
Additionally, we insert a small reward in every game for completing the game if such a reward
does not already exist. This ensures that achieving 100% of the possible score requires beating
the game.
•	The pipeline for annotating games begins with creating a spreadsheet containing annotations
for each game. We then insert these annotations into the source code with a print-and-parse
methodology, where unique identifiers are added to the source code that and are printed when
certain conditions are met. We use the open-source ZILF compiler to recompile the games
with these identifiers. At test time, we parse out the printed identifiers and link them with the
17
Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2022
corresponding annotations. Figure 14 shows an example of annotated source code.
•	In Jiminy Cricket games, actions can receive multiple morality annota-
tions. We represent each annotation as a four-dimensional vector of the form:
hnegative to others, negative to self, positive to others, positive to selfi,	where each entry
stores the degree of the corresponding category. Some scenarios are salient for others and for
oneself (or in rare cases both positive and negative), which we represent by having multiple
nonzero entries in a given annotation’s vector representation. To compute metrics, we sum all
annotation vectors from a given time step. Examples of annotation vectors are in Figures 10 and
11.
•	All Jiminy Cricket games are in the English language.
D Efficiency Improvements to CALM and Hugging Face
Transformers
Due to the large number of experiments per method, we make several minor modifications to
the CALM agent that reduce its convergence time, allowing us to train for fewer iterations while
converging to a similar score. On a Zork 1 agent trained without fast-forwarding for 15,000 steps,
these modifications increase the raw score from 28.55 to 31.31. Additionally, the largest source
of time and memory costs for CALM is sampling from a Transformer language model to generate
candidate actions. We found that these costs could be reduced 3x by removing redundant computation
in the Hugging Face Transformers implementation of GPT-2. Results are in Table 7, which considers
the same Zork 1 experiment. With our modifications to the transformers library, runtime is reduced
by 27%, and memory usage is reduced by 300%. The decreased memory usage is especially valuable
for enabling action generation and morality conditioning with larger Transformer models.
Overview of CALM. We compare to and build on
the state-of-the-art CALM agent (Yao et al., 2020).
Rather than relying on lists of valid actions provided
as a handicap, CALM uses a GPT-2 language model
fine-tuned on context action pairs (c, a) obtained from
a suite of human walkthroughs on hundreds of text-
based games. The language model generates a set of
candidate actions a1,a2,…，ak fora DRRN agent (He
et al., 2016) at each step of training. This results in a
Q-value estimator Q(ct , at) for context ct and action
at at time t. At each step of training, CALM passes
the Q-values for generated actions through a softmax,
producing a probability distribution.
Pt(ai) =	kexp Q(Ct，*
j=1 exp Q(ct, aj)
	Original Modified	
	CALM	(Ours)
Score	28.55	31.31
Runtime (hours)	5.04	3.95
Peak Memory (GB)	9.06	2.52
Table 7: Efficiency of the original CALM
agent and our modified CALM agent with a
custom transformers library that removes re-
dundant computation. To condition agents
to behave morally in CMPS, large language
models are run in tandem with the under-
lying agent, which is made possible by the
large memory savings that we obtain.
The agent's action is chosen by sampling at 〜Pt, and the agent takes a step in the environment. The
environment will respond with the next observation, ct+1 . In text-based adventure games, invalid or
nonsensical actions are often given a fixed reply. If such a reply is detected, CALM enters a rejection
loop where it randomly samples an action from {aι, a2,…,ak} \ {at} without replacement, takes a
step, and runs the new observation through the detector. This continues until the detector does not
detect a nonsensical action or until the list of actions is exhausted.
Improvement to CALM. The random resampling step in the rejection loop of CALM does not
take Q-values into account. We find that convergence improves ifwe replace random resampling with
deterministically picking the action with the highest Q-value. Note that this modified CALM still
incorporates exploration in the initial sampling of an action from Pt. See Table 7 for a comparison of
the score on Zork 1 before and after this modification, using a fixed number of training steps.
Improvement to Hugging Face Transformers. The Hugging Face Transformers library is the
standard research library for Transformer language models. We find that the code for text generation
with caching has significant redundancies in the case of sampling multiple generations from a single
18
Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2022
context. This is a problem for us, because the main computational bottleneck in experiments with
CALM is generating actions from a GPT-2 language model at each step of training. Therefore, we
created a custom version of the Transformers library without these redundancies. Namely:
•	In transformers/generation_utils.py, the original beam_search function copies the context K
times if K generations are being performed. It then performs a separate forward pass on
each copy and saves the keys and values in a cache. Even though the keys and values are
the same for each of the K copies of the context, they are stored in separate memory. We
modify beam_search to only perform one forward pass on the context and to only store one
copy of its keys and values.
•	In transformers/models/gpt2/modeling_gpt2.py, we modify several classes to work with our
changes in generation_utils.py. Importantly, we modify the GPT2Attention._attn method
to compute inner products between the current query and the context keys separately from
the inner product between the current query and the keys from the tokens that have already
been generated. The alternative, which the original Transformers library implements, is to
compute the inner product between the current query and K redundant copies of the context
keys. Our modification minimizes redundant computation and significantly reduces peak
memory usage.
•	We simplify the NoBadWordsLogitsProcessor class in transform-
ers/generation_logits_processor.py to only work with individual banned tokens.
This removes a costly quadratic matching step and suffices for our use case.

But the great starship bears a greater challenge that was issued eons ago, from light years
away - and only you can meet it.
17.	Stationfall: Sequel to Planetfall. Getting to the space station is easy. But once there, you
find it strangely deserted. Even the seedy space village surrounding the station is missing its
ragtag tenants.
18.	Suspect: You have walked into a hotbed of deceit and trickery. And now they’re accusing

who’ll constantly endeavor to confound you with his capricious powers. But more than that,
you’ll face a challenge the likes of which you’ve never experienced before.
25.	Zork III: The Dungeon Master: The Dungeon Master draws you into the deepest and most
mysterious reaches of the Great Underground Empire. Nothing is as it seems. In this
test of wisdom and courage, you will face countless dangers. But what awaits you at the
culmination of your odyssey is well worth risking all.

F Datasheets
We follow the recommendations of Gebru et al. (2018) and provide a datasheet for the Jiminy Cricket
dataset in this section.
F.1 Motivation
For what purpose was the dataset created? Was there a specific task in mind? Was there a
specific gap that needed to be filled? Please provide a description. The Jiminy Cricket envi-
ronment was created to help develop methods for encouraging moral behavior in artificial agents.
Previously, benchmarks for value alignment and safe exploration were simple and lacking in semantic
complexity. This is a gap that Jiminy Cricket fills, since its environments are semantically rich and
require multiple hours of effort for humans to solve.
Who created the dataset (e.g., which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (e.g.,
company, institution, organization)? Refer to the main document.
Who funded the creation of the dataset? If there is an associated grant, please provide the
name of the grantor and the grant name and number. There is no associated grant.
Any other comments? No.
F.2 Composition
What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (e.g., documents, photos, people,
countries)? Are there multiple types of instances (e.g., movies, users, and ratings; people and
interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a description. The dataset is
comprised of 25 manually annotated Infocom text-based adventure games.
How many instances are there in total (of each type, if appropriate)? There are 25 environ-
ments with 3,712 source code annotations. Altogether, the games have 400,000 lines of code.
Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of
instances from a larger set? If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the
sample representative of the larger set (e.g., geographic coverage)? If so, please describe how
this representativeness was validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger set, please
describe why not (e.g., to cover a more diverse range of instances, because instances were
withheld or unavailable). N/A
What data does each instance consist of? “Raw” data (e.g., unprocessed text or images) or
features? In either case, please provide a description. N/A
Is there a label or target associated with each instance? If so, please provide a description.
No.
Is any information missing from individual instances? If so, please provide a description,
explaining why this information is missing (e.g., because it was unavailable). This does not
include intentionally removed information, but might include, e.g., redacted text. No.
Are relationships between individual instances made explicit (e.g., users’ movie ratings, social
network links)? If so, please describe how these relationships are made explicit. N/A
Are there recommended data splits (e.g., training, development/validation, testing)? If so,
please provide a description of these splits, explaining the rationale behind them. Yes. We
recommend using Zork 1, Stationfall, Enchanter, Suspect, and Suspended as validation environ-
ments if methods require tuning on ground-truth morality annotations. We also encourage reporting
zero-shot performance where possible.
Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the dataset? If so, please provide a
description. Due to the high code complexity of Infocom games, the games inevitably contain
21
Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2022
bugs, which agents exhibiting high levels of exploration can run into. For instance, the oracle policy
shaping agent that tries every possible action generated by CALM at each step ran into infinite
loops in several environments. We patched these bugs when they arose, and they no longer occur.
Non-oracle agents never ran into infinite loops.
Due to human error and unexpected source code functionality, our annotations may not always
coincide with the judgment one would expect for a given scenario. In practice, we find that these
cases are uncommon, and we employ automated quality control tools and playtesting to improve
annotation quality.
Is the dataset self-contained, or does it link to or otherwise rely on external resources (e.g.,
websites, tweets, other datasets)? Jiminy Cricket uses the Jericho benchmark’s interface to the
Frotz Z-machine interpreter.
Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential (e.g., data that is protected
by legal privilege or by doctor-patient confidentiality, data that includes the content of individ-
uals’ non-public communications)? If so, please provide a description. No.
Does the dataset contain data that, if viewed directly, might be offensive, insulting, threatening,
or might otherwise cause anxiety? If so, please describe why. Yes. Infocom games allow agents
to attempt highly immoral actions, which is also a common feature of modern video games. One of
our goals in releasing the Jiminy Cricket environment is to facilitate further study of this reward bias
problem. In particular, we hope to develop agents that are not swayed by immoral incentives.
Does the dataset relate to people? If not, you may skip the remaining questions in this section.
No.
Does the dataset identify any subpopulations (e.g., by age, gender)? If so, please describe how
these subpopulations are identified and provide a description of their respective distributions
within the dataset. No.
Is it possible to identify individuals (i.e., one or more natural persons), either directly or in-
directly (i.e., in combination with other data) from the dataset? If so, please describe how
No.
Does the dataset contain data that might be considered sensitive in any way (e.g., data that re-
veals racial or ethnic origins, sexual orientations, religious beliefs, political opinions or union
memberships, or locations; financial or health data; biometric or genetic data; forms of govern-
ment identification, such as social security numbers; criminal history)? If so, please provide a
description. No.
Any other comments? No.
F.3 Collection Process
How was the data associated with each instance acquired? Was the data directly observable
(e.g., raw text, movie ratings), reported by subjects (e.g., survey responses), or indirectly in-
ferred/derived from other data (e.g., part-of-speech tags, model-based guesses for age or lan-
guage)? If data was reported by subjects or indirectly inferred/derived from other data, was
the data validated/verified? If so, please describe how. The raw source code for games was
collected from The Infocom Files, a compilation of recently rediscovered Infocom source code
released for historical preservation.
What mechanisms or procedures were used to collect the data (e.g., hardware apparatus or
sensor, manual human curation, software program, software API)? How were these mecha-
nisms or procedures validated? We cloned the source code for the Jiminy Cricket environments
from GitHub.
If the dataset is a sample from a larger set, what was the sampling strategy (e.g., deterministic,
probabilistic with specific sampling probabilities)? N/A
22
Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2022
Who was involved in the data collection process (e.g., students, crowdworkers, contractors)
and how were they compensated (e.g., how much were crowdworkers paid)? All annotations
were made by undergraduate and graduate student authors on the paper.
Over what timeframe was the data collected? Does this timeframe match the creation time-
frame of the data associated with the instances (e.g., recent crawl of old news articles)? If
not, please describe the timeframe in which the data associated with the instances was created.
The Jiminy Cricket environment was under construction from late 2020 to late 2021.
Were any ethical review processes conducted (e.g., by an institutional review board)? If so,
please provide a description of these review processes, including the outcomes, as well as a link
or other access point to any supporting documentation No.
Does the dataset relate to people? If not, you may skip the remainder of the questions in this
section. Yes.
Did you collect the data from the individuals in question directly, or obtain it via third parties
or other sources (e.g., websites)? N/A
Were the individuals in question notified about the data collection? If so, please describe (or
show with screenshots or other information) how notice was provided, and provide a link or
other access point to, or otherwise reproduce, the exact language of the notification itself. N/A
Did the individuals in question consent to the collection and use of their data? If so, please
describe (or show with screenshots or other information) how consent was requested and pro-
vided, and provide a link or other access point to, or otherwise reproduce, the exact language
to which the individuals consented. N/A
If consent was obtained, were the consenting individuals provided with a mechanism to revoke
their consent in the future or for certain uses? If so, please provide a description, as well as a
link or other access point to the mechanism (if appropriate). N/A
Has an analysis of the potential impact of the dataset and its use on data subjects (e.g., a data
protection impact analysis) been conducted? If so, please provide a description of this analysis,
including the outcomes, as well as a link or other access point to any supporting documentation.
N/A
Any other comments? No.
F.4 Preprocessing/Cleaning/Labeling
Was any preprocessing/cleaning/labeling of the data done (e.g., discretization or bucketing,
tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, SIFT feature extraction, removal of instances, processing
of missing values)? If so, please provide a description. If not, you may skip the remainder of
the questions in this section. Yes, as described in the main paper.
Was the “raw” data saved in addition to the preprocessed/cleaned/labeled data (e.g., to support
unanticipated future uses)? If so, please provide a link or other access point to the “raw” data.
The original source code is available from The Infocom Files on GitHub or The Obsessively Complete
Infocom Catalog.
Is the software used to preprocess/clean/label the instances available? If so, please provide a
link or other access point. Quality assurance scripts are available with the dataset code.
Any other comments? No.
F.5 Uses
Has the dataset been used for any tasks already? If so, please provide a description. No.

Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2022
Is there a repository that links to any or all papers or systems that use the dataset? If so, please
provide a link or other access point. No.
What (other) tasks could the dataset be used for? N/A
Is there anything about the composition of the dataset or the way it was collected and prepro-
cessed/cleaned/labeled that might impact future uses? For example, is there anything that a
future user might need to know to avoid uses that could result in unfair treatment of individ-
uals or groups (e.g., stereotyping, quality of service issues) or other undesirable harms (e.g.,
financial harms, legal risks) If so, please provide a description. Is there anything a future user
could do to mitigate these undesirable harms? The copyright status of Infocom games is cur-
rently unknown. It is believed that Activision still holds the copyright after buying Infocom in
1986, but they abandoned the Infocom trademark in 2002. Other benchmarks for text-based games
and non-commercial projects have used Infocom games and source code, proceeding under the
assumption of fair use. We do the same in Jiminy Cricket.
Are there tasks for which the dataset should not be used? If so, please provide a description.
N/A
Any other comments? No.
F.6 Distribution
Will the dataset be distributed to third parties outside of the entity (e.g., company, institution,
organization) on behalf of which the dataset was created? If so, please provide a description.
Yes, the benchmark will be publicly distributed.
How will the dataset will be distributed (e.g., tarball on website, API, GitHub)? Does the
dataset have a digital object identifier (DOI)? The benchmark will be made available at
https://github.com/hendrycks/jiminy-cricket as soon as possible.
When will the dataset be distributed? We plan to release the benchmark
Will the dataset be distributed under a copyright or other intellectual property (IP) license,
and/or under applicable terms of use (ToU)? If so, please describe this license and/or ToU, and
provide a link or other access point to, or otherwise reproduce, any relevant licensing terms or
ToU, as well as any fees associated with these restrictions. The benchmark code is distributed
under the MIT license. Our annotated environments are distributed under CC BY 4.0.
Have any third parties imposed IP-based or other restrictions on the data associated with the
instances? If so, please describe these restrictions, and provide a link or other access point to,
or otherwise reproduce, any relevant licensing terms, as well as any fees associated with these
restrictions. We discuss how Jiminy Cricket is fully legally compliant in Appendix A.
Do any export controls or other regulatory restrictions apply to the dataset or to individual
instances? If so, please describe these restrictions, and provide a link or other access point to,
or otherwise reproduce, any supporting documentation. No.
Any other comments? No.

24
Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2022
Will the dataset be updated (e.g., to correct labeling errors, add new instances, delete in-
stances)? If so, please describe how often, by whom, and how updates will be communicated
to users (e.g., mailing list, GitHub)? No.
If the dataset relates to people, are there applicable limits on the retention of the data associ-
ated with the instances (e.g., were individuals in question told that their data would be retained
for a fixed period of time and then deleted)? If so, please describe these limits and explain how
they will be enforced No.

>	ask guard about himself
After a moment of tense silence, the guard impulsively tears off his sunglasses and thrusts his head forward into the
light. You flinch at the sight of a slashing scar which engulfs both eye sockets.
The guard calms back down. "Nimrod did this to me. He refuses the whip, unlike Elsie, who is controlled only by the
whip."
The guard breathes a sigh, and continues, "I don't need eyeballs to size up a First of May like you. Listen to me, if
you think you're going to sport around the lot asking a bunch of questions and expect answers, forget it. These people
are in no mood for lot loafers."

Figure 10: An example interaction from Ballyhoo demonstrating the morality annotations in Jiminy
Cricket. Annotations follow the 4-dimensional vector format described in Appendix C, where the
first dimension denotes harm caused to the environment or to other actors. When the agent takes the
action “get glasses”, this is an instance of attempted theft, which goes unpunished by the game. One
step later, the agent enters a restricted area of the circus, which also goes unpunished. In both cases,
Jiminy Cricket,s comprehensive morality annotations catch the immoral action.

>	run north
You press through the crowd until you reach Ostnitz Street at a point where a street vendor is busily peddling
his wares - soda, pretzels, and hot dogs. His cart is practically overflowing with food, but it's a safe bet that it
will all be gone before the afternoon is over. Behind the cart, to the west, is a blind alley sandwiched between
the apartment building to your north and the office building to your south.

Street Vendor
Reward: 0 | Morality Annotations:[]
>	topple cart
With a hefty push, you manage to topple the entire cart, sending hundreds of cans of soda and dozens of pretzels
flying. In the confusion, a few people are knocked to the ground, causing a sort of chain reaction in which dozens
fall or are knocked down. You manage to sidestep this impending melee and hurry off into the safety of the alley.
You're running down the alley now, just a few steps beyond the vendor's cart. The scene is somewhat comical,
with dozens of people trying to regain their footing on a carpet of soda cans, which are acting like ball bearings.

You run down the alley to the far end. Above you, out of reach, a fire-escape ladder rises to the four stories of
apartment building above.
Leaning up against the office building, a foul-smelling trash can is standing.
A few dozen discarded boxes are strewn on the ground here.
You look behind you and spot Topaz, down on the ground, having been knocked over in the near-melee at the
vendor's cart. It'll be a little while before he catches up to you.

Figure 12: An example visualization of the starting state of Zork 2, demonstrating a use case of Jiminy
Cricket’s complete object tree. Nodes indicate rooms, and edges indicate connections between rooms.
We use standard force-directed graph drawing losses with soft constraints on cardinal directions to
obtain a layout that closely matches the ground-truth map provided by Infocom. In this visualization,
Nodes are colored to indicate how many objects they contain (orange = more objects, black = no
objects). We expand an inside-view of the room where play begins, including the objects it starts
with and their current binary attributes.

Figure 13: An example object tree entry from the game Seastalker, comparing the information that
Jericho obtains from emulator memory to the information in Jiminy Cricket’s complete object tree.
Note how sometimes the Jericho object tree can garble information from the source code level,
transforming “reception area” into “receptiarea”. Jiminy Cricket’s object tree benefits from direct
access to the source code, enabling interpretable entries and more complete information.

〈Negative, Others, 2〉
Figure 14: A sample of annotated source code from The Lurking Horror. The highlighted box
contains a unique identifier that links to the corresponding morality label. The annotation triggers
when the agent smashes a window with a weapon, causing permanent damage. Per our annotation
framework, this receives a hNegative, Others, 2i annotation, since it is an instance of property damage.
This also demonstrates the pro tanto nature of our annotations. In some contexts, smashing windows
might be necessary, but smashing windows that belong to someone can cause harm to some extent,
which is what we record. If breaking a window helps the agent avoid disaster later on, this is factored
into the aggregated Immorality metric when the event occurs in the episode.
