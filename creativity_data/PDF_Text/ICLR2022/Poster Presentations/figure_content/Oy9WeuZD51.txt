Figure 1:	p-values from MaSF and MeSF comparison to uniform [0,1] distribution. eCDFs areestimated using the training data.
Figure 2:	p-values from MaSF and MeSF comparison to uniform [0,1] distribution. eCDFs areestimated on holdout data from the validation set. CIFAR-100 was removed due to the small numberof observations.
Figure 3: Histogram visualization of max and mean spatial reductions in the ResNet34 for selectedlayers and channels for two in-distribution classes of CIFAR-10.
Figure 4: Comparing the correlation of layer level p-values for MaSF, between CIFAR-100 andSVHN with ResNet34. Red indicate positive correlation, and white neutral correlation.
Figure 5: Comparing the Max-Simes statistic correlation with the Max-Mahalannobis statistic acrosslayers for ResNet34 and SVHN. Red indicate positive correlation, and blue negative correlation.
Figure 6: Comparing Max-Simes statistic across layers on CIFAR100 and SVHN for DenseNet3model. Layer names are removed for eligibility. Red indicate positive correlation, and white neutralcorrelation.
Figure 7: The empirical distribution of the class conditional MaSF test statistic for digit "0" from the SVHNdataset (blue). The alternative distribution is based on the remaining digits.
Figure 8: ROC plots for Table-2, MaSF typically yields better TPR for small FPR budget (<0.1).
