Figure 1: An illustration of conver-gence of the CoopFlow algorithm.
Figure 2: Learning CoopFlows on two-dimensional data. The ground truth data distribution is shownin the red box and the models trained with different Langevin steps are in the three green boxes. Ineach green box, the first row shows the learned distributions of the normalizing flow and the EBM,and the second row shows the samples from the learned normalizing flow and the learned CoopFlow.
Figure 3: Generated examples (32 × 32 pixels) by the CoopFlow models trained on the CIFAR-10,SVHN and CelebA datasets respectively. Samples are obtained from the setting of CoopFlow(pre).

Figure 5: Image inpainting on the CelebA dataset (32 × 32 pixels). Each row represents one differentinitialization. The last two columns display the masked and original images respectively. From the1st column to the 17th column, we show the inpainted images at different optimization iterations.
Figure 6: Image interpolation results on the CelebA dataset (32 × 32 pixels). The leftmost andrightmost columns display the images we observed. The columns in the middle represent the inter-ploation results between the inferred latent vectors of the two end observed images.
Figure 7:	Generated examples by (a) the individual normalizing flow, (b) the individual Langevinflow, and (c) the CoopFlow, which are trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
Figure 8:	Generated examples (32 × 32 pixels) by the CoopFlow models trained on the CIFAR-10,SVHN and CelebA datasets respectively. Samples are obtained from the CoopFlow(T=30) setting.
Figure 9:	Generated examples (32 × 32 pixels) by the CoopFlow models trained on the CIFAR-10,SVHN and CelebA datasets respectively. Samples are obtained from the CoopFlow(T=200) setting.
