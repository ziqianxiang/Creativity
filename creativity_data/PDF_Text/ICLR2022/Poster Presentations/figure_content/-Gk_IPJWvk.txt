Figure 1: The graphical models for set generation. The number of points can either be sampled fromthe dataset distribution (a), or learned from the latent vector (b). While any equivariant function canbe used for the update h, the set creation g concentrates the challenges of set generation. For graphgeneration, edge weights are generated in addition to the node features matrices X0 and X .
Figure 2: Existing creation methods for mapping a latent vector z to a set of points X0 . First-ncreation empirically gives the best performance. It learns a reference set represented by a matrixXref, and concatenates the latent vector to each point of this set.
Figure 4: Training curves for all models. We observe that random i.i.d. generation is in generalharder to train than the other models, while the differences between the other methods are smaller.
