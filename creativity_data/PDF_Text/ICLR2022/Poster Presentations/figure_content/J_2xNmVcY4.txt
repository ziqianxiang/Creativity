Figure 1: Overview of the proposed gradient lexicase selection. Given the parent model, we firstgenerate candidates by running subset gradient descent (SubGD), then perform lexicase selection byassessing candidates on each individual case to obtain the parent model for the next generation.
Figure 2: Comparing representation diversity of normal SGD (Baseline in red) and gradient lexicaseselection (lexicase in blue). The flatter distribution shows that our method produces more diverserepresentations.
