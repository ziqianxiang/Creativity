Figure 1: Comparison of Naiveand I-BAU. I-BAU’s perfor-mance is more stable.
Figure 2: Evaluation of different l2 norm bound would impact the ACC/ASR on mitigating Trojan WM attackon the GTSRB dataset. Each of the results listed is averaged from 5 independent runs using different randomseeds.
Figure 3: Datasets and examples of backdoor attacks that considered in the main text. We consider two differentdatasets in this work, namely, the CIFAR-10 dataset and the GTSRB dataset. Nine different backdoor attacktriggers are included in the experimental part with one-trigger or multi-trigger attack patterns. Above, we showthe target label used during the one-trigger attacks (e.g., badnets targeting at label 8) of each backdoor attack.
Figure 4: TSNE analysis of the output features (flatten layer output of the NN, with a size of (N × 2048))before and after backdoor unlearning using CIFAR-10 BadNets (targeting at 8) poisoned model. Each colorin the color bar represents a different class from (0, . . . , 9). We mark the sample with triggers and withouttriggers as listed in the Figure.
Figure 5: I-BAU iterative records under mitigating BadNets in all-to-all attack cases. (a). the results on theCIFAR-10 where took more rounds for the I-BAU to mitigate the attack successfully. (b). the results on theGTSRB manage to mitigate the triggers with fewer rounds and less impact over the ACC.
Figure 6: I-BAU iterative records under mitigating 7-trigger-7-target attack cases. (a). the results on the CIFAR-10 where took more rounds for the I-BAU to mitigate the attacks successfully. (b). the results on the GTSRBmanage to mitigate the triggers with fewer rounds and less impact over the ACC.
