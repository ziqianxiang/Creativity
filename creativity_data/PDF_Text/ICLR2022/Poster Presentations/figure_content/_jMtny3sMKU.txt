Figure 1: An illustration of the supernet partitioning schema in Few-Shot NAS v.s. GM-NAS (ours)Despite the search efficiency, training the weight-sharing supernet also induces coupled optimizationamong child models. Consequently, the supernet suffers from degenerated search outcomes due toinaccurate performance estimation, especially on top architectures (Bender et al., 2018; Yu et al.,2020b; Pourchot et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020b; Zhao et al., 2021b). To reduce the level ofweight-sharing, Few-Shot NAS (Zhao et al., 2021b) proposes to split the One-Shot supernet intomultiple independent sub-supernets via edge-wise exhaustive partitioning. Concretely, it assignsevery operation on the selected edges to a separated sub-supernet, with weight-sharing enabled onlywithin each sub-supernet (Figure 1 (a)). This way, architectures containing different operations onthe split edge are divided into different sub-supernets, thereby disabling weight-sharing betweenthem. Although the performance of Few-Shot NAS surpasses its One-Shot counterpart, its splittingschema - naively assigning each operation on an edge to a separated sub-supernet - is not ideal.
