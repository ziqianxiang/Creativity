Figure 1: PEARL is a private learning framework that has i) no limitation in learning iterations, andii) well-reconstruction capability. Towards those preferable properties, our framework first obtains (1)private embedding and (2) auxiliary information from the sensitive data, then (3) trains a generatorwhile (4) optimizing a critic to distinguish between the real and generated data.
