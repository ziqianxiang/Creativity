Figure 1: The periodic structure of diamond. The left showsthe infinite periodic structure, the middle shows a unit cellrepresenting the periodic structure, and the right shows amulti-graph (Xie & Grossman, 2018) representation.
Figure 2:	Overview of the proposed CDVAE approach.
Figure 3:	Reconstructed structures of randomly selected materials in the test set. Note our modelreconstructs rotated (translated) version of the original material due to the SE(3) invariance.
Figure 4: Structures sampled from N(0, 1) and filtered by the validity test.
Figure 5: Different reconstructed structures from CDVAE from the same z, following 3 Langevindynamics sampling with different random seeds.
