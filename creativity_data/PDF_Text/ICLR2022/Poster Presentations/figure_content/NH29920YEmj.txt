Figure 1: Rates of training instances Predicted as Positive (PP rate) and error rates ofdisambiguation-free1 and fully supervised objectives on (a) FashionMNIST and (b) CIFAR-10 (Xiaoet al., 2017; Krizhevsky, 2016; Chen et al., 2020a). The disambiguation-free objective suffers frommuch lower PP rates than the real positive prior as well as the fully supervised objective. Thisimplies the decision boundary deviation phenomenon, which results in higher error rates.
