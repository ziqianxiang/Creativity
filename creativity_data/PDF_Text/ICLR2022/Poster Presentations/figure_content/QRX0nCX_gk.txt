Figure 1: (M-density) (a) A mixture of Gaussian in 1d. (b,c,d) The M-density (M = 2, σ1 = σ2), thecorresponding log-density and score function are visualized (based on calculations in Appendix A).
Figure 2: (WJS schematic) In this schematic, the Langevin walkis denoted by the dashed arrow. The jump is denoted by the solidarrow which is deterministic. The jumps in WJS are asynchronous(Remark 5). In presenting long chains in the paper we show jumpsat various frequencies denoted by ∆k (Remark 6). We use thesame MCMC parameters for all noise channels due to permutationsymmetry in σ 0 M models. See Appendix D for more details.
Figure 3: (WJS chains on FFHQ-256) The chains are shown skipping ∆k = 10 steps (no warmup).
Figure 4: (4 0 8 gallery) Samples from our FFHQ-256, MDAE, 4 0 8 model.
Figure 5: (single-step multidenoising) A clean data (x), a sample from MNM (y) for the 4 0 4 model(Fig. 3a), the outputs of MDAE (ν), and xbmean(y) are visualized from left to right. The outputs νθ(y)correspond to the Bayes estimator(s) which as expected from theory (Eq. 8) are indistinguishable.
Figure 6: MDAE training plots demonstrate that optimization is stable for all datasets. Loss valueson the y-axis in these plots represent the value of our objective function (Eq. 14).
Figure 7: (mixing time vs. image quality trade-off) WJS chains for 1 0 M models are presented in“real time” (∆k = 1) starting from noise (320 steps in total), for M = 1, 2, 4, 16 in order from toppannel to the bottom one. We used Algorithm 2 (δ = 1/2, γ = 1/2, u = 1) with the same initial seed.
Figure 8: MUVB, 1 0 4 model on MNIST, ∆k = 5 steps.
Figure 9: MDAE, 1 0 4 model on MNIST, ∆k = 5 steps.
Figure 10: MDAE, 1 0 4 model on MNIST, ∆k = 500 steps, 1 million+ steps in total.
Figure 11: Top panels use Algorithm 2 at two different checkpoints. The bottom panel uses Algorithm1. MCMC parameters are (δ = 0.1, γ = 2, u = 10) for the top and bottom panel, and u = 20 for themiddle panel. In all cases ∆k = 500 (≈ 2 × 105 steps). The FID scores are respectively 91 & 79.
Figure 12: WJS chain for MDAE 1 0 8, trained with spectral normalization, ∆k = 500.
Figure 13: The first 13 K steps of a WJS chain with 1M steps for MDAE 1 0 8 on CIFAR-10 with∆k = 10. We obtained the FID score of 43.95 by selecting 50K samples skipping ∆k = 20 steps.
