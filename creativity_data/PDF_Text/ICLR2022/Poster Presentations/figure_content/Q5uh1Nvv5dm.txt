Figure 1: AdaMatch diagram illustrating the loss computations.
Figure 2: Adamatch achieves state-of-the-art or competitive accuracy for the SSL task. Weevaluate on the DomainNet224, DomainNet64 and DigitFive benchmarks and vary the number oftarget labels. We report the average target accuracy across all source→target pairs. Average accuracyon the target datasets generally increases as we increase the number of target labels.
Figure 3: Adamatch achieves state-of-the-art or competitive accuracy for the SSDA task. Wereport the average target accuracy across all source→target pairs. Average accuracy on the targetdatasets generally increases as we increase the number of target labels.
Figure 4: Ablation studies of AdaMatch on 6 DA protocols of DomainNet.
Figure 5: When using pre-training, AdaMatch benefits significantly from early stopping. Wecompare AdaMatch and MCD with and without pre-training in the UDA setting on a randomlyselected dataset pair from DomainNet224, Sketch→Clipart.
