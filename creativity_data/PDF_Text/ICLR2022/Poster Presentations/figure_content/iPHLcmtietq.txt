Figure 1: Architecture of a Learned Scattering network with phase collapses. It has J + 1 layers withJ = 11 for ImageNet and J = 8 for CIFAR-10. Each layer is computed with a 1 × 1 convolutionaloperator Pj which linearly combines channels. It is followed by a phase collapse, computed witha spatial convolutional filtering with a complex wavelet W and a complex modulus ∣∙∣. A layerof depth j corresponds to a scale 2j/2 and a subsampling by 2 is applied every two layers, afterW . A skip-connection concatenates the outputs of WPj and WPj . A final 1 × 1 PJ reduces thedimension before a linear classifier.
Figure 2: First-layer filters from AlexNet (Krizhevsky et al., 2012). They have been paired so that theyapproximately correspond to two different phases of the same complex filter ψ . Figure reproducedfrom Shang et al. (2016).
