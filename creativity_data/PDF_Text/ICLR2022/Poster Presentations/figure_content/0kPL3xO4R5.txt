Figure 1: Graph filtration of four-node network G. As the filtration value increases, the number ofconnected components β0 monotonically increases while the number of cycles β1 monotonicallydecreases. Connected components are born at the edge weights e3, e5, e6 while cycles die at e1, e2, e4.
Figure 2: Example networkswith |V | = 60 nodes and m = 5modules exhibit different within-module connection probabilitiesr = 0.9, 0.8, 0.7 and 0.6.
Figure 3: Clustering performance comparison for the dataset of simulated networks with |V | = 60nodes and m = 2, 3, 5 modules with respect to average accuracy (left) and average p-values (right).

Figure 5: Representative data from a single subject (ID R376). For this subject there are 36 measurednetworks in each of three conditions: wake, sedated, and unresponsive states for a total of 108networks. (a) Sample mean networks during wake, sedated and unresponsive states of the subjectcomputed using ground truth labels. (b) Betti plots based on ground truth labels. Thick lines representtopological centroids. Shaded areas around the centroids represent standard deviation.

Figure 7: ARI performance for the brain network dataset. Data points (middle horizontal lines)indicate averages over 100 random initial conditions, and error bars indicate standard deviations.
Figure 8: Average confusion matrices over 100 random initializations for select methods for subjectR376 (see Figure 5). Results for the other methods are provided in Appendix B.
