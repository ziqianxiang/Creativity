Figure 1: The standard Cohen et al. (2019) smoothing-based robustness certificate relies on theclean and the adversarial distributions being isometric Gaussians (panel a). However, adding noiseto sequential observations in an RL setting (panels b-d) does not result in an isometric Gaussiandistribution over the space of observations. In all figures, the distributions associated with clean andadversarially-perturbed values are shown in blue and red, respectively.

Figure 4: Certified performance for various environments. The certified lower-bound on the meanreward is based on a 95% lower confidence interval estimate of the mean reward of the smoothedmodel, using 10,000 episodes.
