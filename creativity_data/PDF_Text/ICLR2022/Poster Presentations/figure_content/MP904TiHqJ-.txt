Figure 1: Experiment results with K(x, y) = sin(2πx) sin(2πy). The three figures show the KLdivergence of the empirical particle distribution to the uniform distribution of LGDA and QSLGDat different β, η and number of particles. Each point is an average of 5 experiments.
Figure 2: (Left) The NI error of the solutions found by different algorithms for the polynomial game(18), at different dimensions. Each point is an average of 10 experiments. (Middle left, Middleright) Generation results of mixture of GANs. The blue points are sampled from groundtruth dis-tribution, while the green points are generated by the a mixture of generators. (Right) The averagesquared distance of generated data to closest mode center for learning high dimensional Gaussianmixtures.
