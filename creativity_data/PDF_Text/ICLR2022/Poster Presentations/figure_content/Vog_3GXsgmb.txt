Figure 1: Discovery of governing PDEs With the proposed Physics-encoded DL framework. 1. Datareconstruction: data-driven model constructed from noisy and LR measurement is used to generateHR solution for sparse regression; 2. Sparse regression: STRidge algorithm is used to obtain thesparse coefficient vector Ξ; 3. Coefficients fine tuning: the PeRCNN built based on identified PDEstructure is employed to fine-tune the coefficient from the sparse regression.
Figure 2: Snapshots of the state variable at one time instance. (a)-(c) represent the 2D Burgers,, λ-Ωand GS RD systems. SiX columns starting from the left denote the LR measurement, HR groundtruth, reconstructed HR solution from our model, PDE-Net, FCNN and Chebyshev polynomial fit-ting (i.e., PDE-FIND) respectively. The reconstruction error of each model is also provided.
