Figure 1: -EnOrm (left) and BLEU scores (right) on De-En (20) for NMT as a function of epochs forthe two MH schemes (raw and norm) and the degenerate Gibbs sampling scheme (deg). We computeand report -EnOrm even for the samplers with Eraw parametrization.
Figure 2: Comparison as a function of epochs for the two energy parametrizations (red, blue) forMH approach with annealing toward modes of target energy functions: EraW and Enorm on De-En(20). Left: acceptance rates, locally normalized energy (green) as a function of epochs. Right: MTperformance.
Figure 3: Acceptance ratio on De-En (20) as a function of epochs for the two Block variants ofthe Metropolis Hastings schemes (raw and locally normalized energy parametrizations) and thedegenerate block Gibbs sampling scheme (deg).
