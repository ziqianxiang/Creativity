Figure 1: Comparison of the two decoding processes for detection-based methods (pink panel) and integralregression methods (green panel). They share the same encoding (yellow panel) but have different representa-tions of the ground truth (gray panel).
Figure 2: (a) The heatmap is only activated within Φ; (b) more heatmap activations are bounded by a (2s +1) × (2s + 1) region for integral regression than detection; (c) if the heatmap is approximated as a Gaussian,the resulting σ shrinks as samples shift from hard to easy; this shrinkage is faster and more extreme for integralregression compared to detection; (d) in detect methods, the optimal σ is around 2; smaller and larger σ hurtperformance.
Figure 3: Toy example of regression update (left) and detection update (right). The black triangle denotes theprediction (expectation value for regression and max value for detection) while the red dot denotes the groundtruth position. The arrow shows the movement of the prediction.
Figure 4: (a) Comparisons of detection and regression in real training on an image selected from the COCOvalidation set at epoch 1 and 10. Results of detection have already roughly stabilized while regression can onlylocalize to a small extent in epoch 10 with some background pixels still activated. We enlarge the right anklepart of regression in the red box for better visualization. More examples are shown in Appendix A.8. (b) Theregression method converges slower than the detection method.
Figure I: Activation Sum A(s) of both detection and regression method on easy, medium, hard, andoverall cases.
Figure II: Visualization of the training performance of integral pose regression on one single imageat epoch 0, 5, 10, 15, 20 (from top to down). Corner or edge pixels of the correct quadrant are largelyactivated in the epoch 0 (highlighted in the yellow boxes). Further training is focused on narrowingdown the activated region (shown in the red boxes).
