Figure 1: A comparison of communication costs between replica exchange (RE) and ICSGLD. Wesee RE takes many iterations to swap with all the other chains; by contrast, ICSGLD possesses apleasingly parallel mechanism where the only cost comes from sharing a light message.

Figure 3: Empirical behavior on a simulation dataset. Figure 3(c) and 3(f) show the simulation basedon a single chain with 5 times of iterations (×T5) and the others run 5 parallel chains (×P5).
