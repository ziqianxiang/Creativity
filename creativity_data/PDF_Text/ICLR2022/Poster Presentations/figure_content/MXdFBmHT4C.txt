Figure 2: Network diagrams of our Differentiable EM (DIEM) model. (Left) θ = emb(S; A) asa feed-forward network that performs the k-step MAP EM starting from the mode of the prior θ0 .
Figure 3: Average (per-batch) forward pass time (in milliseconds) for OTKE and DIEM with differentEM steps (k = 1 to 4) on the SCOP 1.75 dataset. In addition to the original set cardinality n = 1091(denoted by ×1 on the left corner), we increase n by two (×2) and four times (×4). To be fair withOTKE, we use OT E-steps during the k EM steps, denoted by sequences of 1’s in the legend (e.g.,k = 4 (1111) indicates that four OT E-steps are used during k = 4 EM steps).
Figure 4: Running time comparison among OTKE, SetTransformer, and DIEM. Average (Per-batch)forward pass time (in milliseconds) on the SCOP 1.75 dataset with three different set cardinalities(original, ×2, and ×4). DIEM takes three EM steps (k = 3 (111) indicates that three OT E-steps areused during k = 3 EM steps). SetTransformer uses a minimal network structure: one SAB block forthe encoder, one PMA block and one SAB block for the decoder.
Figure 5: OT E-steps vs. regular E-steps in our DIEM. Average (per-batch) forward pass time on theSCOP 1.75 dataset with three different set cardinalities (original, ×2, and ×4). We compare DIEMwith k = 3 (111) (all OT E-steps) with k = 3 (000) (all regular E-steps).
