Figure 1: PCT expansion illustrated using a 2D example (in Xoz plane) for simplicity and the number of allowedorientations |O| is 1 (see Appendix B for the 3D version). A newly added item introduces a series of emptyspaces and new candidate placements are generated, e.g., the left-bottom corner of the empty space.

Figure 3: The probability distribution for sampling item sizes. The area of the colored zone is normalized to 1.
Figure 4: Learning curves on setting 1. A goodexpansion scheme for PCT reduces the complex-ity and helps DRL methods for more efficientlearning and better performance. EVF means thefull EV leaf node set without an interception.
Figure 5: Full candidate positions generated by different PCT expansion schemes (all in Xoy plane). The graydashed lines are the boundaries of the bin. Circles in (a) and (b) represent corner points and extreme pointsrespectively. (c): The candidate positions (circles) introduced by different EMSs are rendered with differentcolors. All intersections of two dashed lines in (d) constitute event points.
Figure 6: A 3D PCT expansion schematic diagram. This PCT grows under the guidance of the EMS expansionscheme. For simplicity, we only choose the bottom-right-up corners of each EMS as candidate positions andwe set |O| = 1 here.
Figure 7: (a)ã€œ(d): Different packing stages of the same sequence. The learned policies assign little items(colored in blue) to gaps and save room for future uncertainty. (e): Online 3D-BPP where load balancing isconsidered. (f): Online 3D-BPP with isle-friendliness, different color means different item categories.
