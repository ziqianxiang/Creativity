Figure 1: Comparison of accuracy performance of two different label selection strategies.
Figure 2: Study of CAV attributes on various backbones and datasets. Note that here CAM couldonly been obtained in deep CNN architectures, namely ResNet and DenseNet.
Figure 3: Comparison of accuracy performance on five real-world datatsets obtained by IM andCAVL. Note that the training method is IM.
