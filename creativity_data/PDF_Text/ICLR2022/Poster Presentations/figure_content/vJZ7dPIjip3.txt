Figure 1: Adversarial examples can enhance thecoverage of problem space X and find model-specific regions with difficult examples. Left,shows the asymptotic coverage of an efficient,incomplete data generator (Yehuda et al., 2020).
Figure 2: Efficacy of adversarial attacks as introduced in § 4 and assessment of (un)robustness ofthe NeuroSAT model on the 10-40 dataset. Recall that SAT is the attack on the satisfiable probleminstances and ADC as well as DEL are the attacks on unsatisfiable problem instances.
