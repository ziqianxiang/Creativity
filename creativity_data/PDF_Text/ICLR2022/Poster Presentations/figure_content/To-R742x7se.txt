Figure 1: Comparison of the proposed GCIVR algorithm with unconstrained optimization and heavily-constrained algorithm Narasimhan et al. (2020b) in three different tasks of fairness and DRO. Eachrow shows the result for one task based on the error rate, max constraint violations and the runtime ofthe codes. In all the cases solutions learned by GCIVR dominates the heavily-constrained solutionand it converges way faster.
