Figure 1: Map induction: We propose how humans might infer the structure of unobserved spacesbased on priors constructed from observations of other environments or different parts of the samespacee. Map induction can minimize exploration cost by filling in incomplete or missing observa-tions from experience.
Figure 2: An example of an MIT task. A. A 2-dimensional grid discretization showing the mapused for modeling exploration trajectory. The black cells indicate walls, and the red cells indicatereward locations. B. The 3-dimensional world, in which subjects search for rewards (shown as bluediamonds on a red platform), seen from an overhead perspective in the Unity Design system. C.
Figure 3: Model architecture. A. Four steps required to solve the MIT task and the correspondingcomputational modules in our framework. B. Extracting the candidate regions (submaps) from theknown map, and generating possible map completions by composing these regions and their simpletransformations (e.g., mirror reflections) as defined in the generative grammar of the Map Generator.
Figure 4: Experiment 1 results. A. Exploration trajectories of a representative subject. B. Visitationheatmaps of three example environments aggregated across subjects and pairs of reflected environ-ments. The visited area was computed in a 2D grid projection, using a circular radius of five gridcells around the agent. C. Fractions of environments observed by the models and humans. Errorbars show 95% confidence intervals. D. Log-likelihood that the model takes the same actions asthe human (details in Appendix section A.3). Each marker is a subject-environment pair, with eachcolor showing a single environment: Env1-Env6 (blue-yellow). Error bars show standard error alongeach axis.
