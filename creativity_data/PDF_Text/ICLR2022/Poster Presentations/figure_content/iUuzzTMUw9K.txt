Figure 1: Synthesized 10242 images by StyleNeRF, with the low-resolution feature maps.
Figure 2: Internal representations and the outputs from StyleNeRF trained with different upsamplingoperators. With LIIF, patterns stick to the same pixel coordinates when the viewpoint changes; Withbilinear interpolation, bubble-shape artifacts can be seen on the feature maps and images. Ourproposed upsampler faithfully preserves 3D consistency while getting rid of bubble-shape artifacts.

Figure 4: Qualitative comparisons at 2562 . StyleNeRF achieves the best quality and 3D consistency.

Figure 6: Images synthesized from camera poses which starkly differ from training camera poses.
Figure 8: Failure results.

Figure 10: Example of sticking texture because of the injection of 2D noise at the test time. Notethat the texture cropped inside the red box does not change across different views.
Figure 11: Illustrations of the proposed two variants of progressive training for StyleNeRF. (a)is for progressive growing of the generator; (b) is the same generator by progressively insertingupsamplers; (c) is the corresponding discriminator.
