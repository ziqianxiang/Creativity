Figure 1: Normalized SC (top) and Bayesian generalization error (bottom) for GPR with the kernelkw(1/)o bias and the target functions in Table 1. The orange curves show the linear regression fit for theexperimental values (in blue) of the log Bayesian generalization error as a function of log n.
Figure 3:	Normalized SC (top) and Bayesian generalization error (bottom) for GPR with kernelkw(1/) bias and the target functions in Table 3. The orange curves show the linear regression fit for theexperimental values (in blue) of the log Bayesian generalization error as a function of log n.
Figure 4:	Normalized SC (top) and Bayesian generalization error (bottom) for GPR with kernelkw(2/)o bias and the target functions in Table 4.
