Figure 1: Disparate impacts in the model accuracy of SSL. MixMatch (Berthelot et al., 2019b) isapplied on CIFAR-10 with (a) 250 clean labels in the balanced case (25 labeled instances per class)and (b) 185 clean labels in the unbalanced case (25 labeled instances in each of the first 5 classes,12 labeled instances in each of the remaining classes). Other instances are used as unlabeled data.

Figure 3: Benefit ratios across implicit sub-populations. Experiments on CIFAR-100 are ran 5 timesfor stability. Mean (dashed line) and standard deviation (shaded area) are plotted in (a), where pointsin the shaded area indicate the converged local optima with a non-negligible probability.

Figure 6 shows the disparate impact on model accuracy across differentsub-populations (gender) on the Jigsaw Toxicity dataset.
