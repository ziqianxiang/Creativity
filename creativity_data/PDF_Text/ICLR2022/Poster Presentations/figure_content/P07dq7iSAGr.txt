Figure 1: The flow of TELLER. Italternates between a rule evaluationstage (master problem) and a ruleproposal stage (subproblem).
Figure 2: Feature constructions ofTLPP using a simple logic formulaf : Y — A ∧ B, as a template to gathercombinations of the body predicate his-tory events. A has 2 events and B has 3events, leading to 6 valid combinations.
Figure 3: TELLERgrounded 0-1 temporal predicate sequences. The likelihood will be maxi-mized to jointly learn the set of temporal logic formulas and their weights.
Figure 4: Overall flow of TELLER. It alternates be-tween rule evaluation stage and rule proposal stage. Thelogic rules and their weights are jointly lsubset of predicates for evaluation. When solving for the RMP, we can use a stochlearned.
