Figure 1: An example of WIS problem: the input consists of an unlabeled dataset, a label graph, andn indirect labeling functions (ILFs). The ILFs represent weak supervision sources such as pretrainedclassifiers, knowledge bases, heuristic rules, etc. We can see that the ILFs cannot predict desiredlabels i.e., {“dog”, “wolf”, “cat”, “lion”}. To address this, a label graph is given; here we onlyvisualize the subsuming relation. Finally, a label model, instantiated as a PGM, takes the ILF’soutputs and produces probabilistic labels in the target output space, which are in turn used to train anend machine learning model that can generalize beyond them.
