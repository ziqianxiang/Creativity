Figure 1: Non-cherrypicked samples from DDSS (ours) and strongest DDIM(η = 0) baseline for uncondi-tional DDPMs trained on LSUN churches 128×128. All samples are generated with the same random seed.
Figure 2: Illustration of GGDM. To improve sample quality, our novel family of samplers combinesinformation from all previous (noisier) images at every denoising step.
Figure 3: Non-cherrypicked samples for a DDPM trained on CIFAR10, comparing the strongestDDIM(η = 0) baseline and our approach. All samples were generated with the same random seeds.
