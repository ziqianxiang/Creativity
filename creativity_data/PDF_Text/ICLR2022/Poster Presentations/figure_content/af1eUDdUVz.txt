Figure 1: A visualization showing how a standard Lagrangian attack fails when ours succeedsover a non-convex loss landscape. Given two circular regions corresponding to when f (x) < 0(above) and g(x) < 0 (below), we would like to find the central region where both are satisfied.
Figure 2: Honeypot attack evaluation. Compared to the originally reported 2% success rate, ourattack reaches a 100% attack success rate under the same distortion bound. While the ROC curvedoes cross over the x = y line, this only occurs after a FPR of 70% which is completely unusable.
Figure 3: DLA attack evaluation. Our attack succeeds with 83% probability compared to the originalevaluation of 13% (with ε = 0.01), and 100% of the time under the more typical 8/255 constraint.
Figure 4:	SID attack evaluation. Our attack succeeds with 93% probability compared to the originalevaluation of 9% under a ε = 0.01-norm constraint, and 100% under a ε = 0.031.
Figure 5:	Steganalysis attack evaluation. We find it difficult to decrease the detection score lowerthan the original score on the non-adversarial input, thus the AUC is almost exactly 0.5.
