Figure 3: Visualization of the learned prototypes (red arrows) and features (green points) usingNormFaCe, CosFaCe, ArCFaCe and LM-SoftmaX on S2 for eight Classes. The optimal solution ofTammes problem for N = 8 have the class margin 74.86ο (Whyte, 1952), where the class margin oflearning with the losses NormFace, CosFace, ArcFace and LM-Softmax are 68.50ο, 71.86ο, 67.74οand 74.46ο, respeCtively. We note that this phenomenon CoinCides with the reCent popular ConCept—neural collapse (Papyan et al., 2020).
