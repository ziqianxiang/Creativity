Figure 4: Architecture of SPhereNet. LB2 denotes a linear block with two linear layers, σ(LB)denotes a linear layer followed by an activation function, k denotes concatenation, and Θ denoteselement-wise multiplication. Each LB2 aims at canceling bottlenecks by performing downprojection,followed by upprojection. Hence, it is related to three hyperparameters; these are, input embeddingsize, intermediate size, and output embedding size. Each linear block LB is related to hyperparametersincluding input embedding size and output embedding size. Description of each block is in Sec. B.
