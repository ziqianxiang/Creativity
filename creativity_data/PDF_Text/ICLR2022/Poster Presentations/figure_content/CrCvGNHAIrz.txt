Figure 1: Graphical representation of dataset D = {Author(Dostoessky, Crimeqnd-PUniShment),Author(Dostoessky, The-IdiOt), Likes(Crimeqnd-PUniShment)} and its encoding GDFigure 1 shows the encoding of the dataset D from the introduction. We introduce vertices vDs,Vcp, and Vι in GD to represent constants Dostoessky, TheJdiot, and Crime-and-Punishment. Torepresent relationships between constants, we introduce vertices vDs,CP, vCP,Ds, vDs,I, and vI,Ds ; wedo not introduce vertices VCP,I and VI,CP because the corresponding constants do not occur together ina fact of D. We then encode unary and binary predicates using feature vectors labelling the graph’svertices. To this end, we assign to each predicate a fixed position in the feature vectors; for example,we assign position 1 to predicate Likes and position 3 to predicate Author. Then, we represent factLikes(Crimeqnd-PUniShment) by setting the first element of the feature vector of VCP to one, andWe represent fact Author(Dostoessky, CrimeMnd-Punishment) by setting the third element of thefeature vector of VDs,CP to one. Finally, we connect with coloured edges all pairs of vertices of GDthat refer to related constants. For example, We connect vertices VDs and VDs,CP by an edge of colourc1 to indicate that Dostoessky occurs first in the constant pair of VDs,CP . We analogously connectVDs,CP and VCP by an edge of colour c2. We connect VCP,Ds and VDs,CP by an edge of colour c3to indicate that the constant pairs of the tWo vertices are inverses of each other. Finally, We connectVCP and VDs by an edge of colour c4 to indicate that the tWo constants occur jointly in a fact of D.
