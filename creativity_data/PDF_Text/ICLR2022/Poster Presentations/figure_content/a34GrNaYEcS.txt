Figure 1: Effect of label noise on performance(average test accuracy on BiasedSST) in para-metric and nonparametric DRO.
Figure 2: Evolution of RP-DRO’s robust ac-curacy as the adversary takes more gradientsteps than the classifier in a toy setting.
Figure 3: Effect of self-normalization coefficient β on robust and average accuracy. We report resultsof ERM (which corresponds to β = ∞) and batch level renormalization for comparison.
Figure 4: Effect of label noise on model performance on each individual group in parametric(R-PDRO) and non parametric DRO (NonParam-{KL,χ2,CVaR}).
Figure 5: Effect of self-normalization coefficient β on robust and average accuracy using Oraclestopping. We report results of ERM (which corresponds to β = ∞) and batch level renormalizationfor comparison.
Figure 6:	Evolution of training trajectories for in our toy setting as the linear adversary is able totake more steps than the classifier. We report accuracies on the two domains for multiple restarts.
Figure 7:	Evolution of training trajectories for in our toy setting as the MLP-2 adversary is able totake more steps than the classifier. We report accuracies on the two domains for multiple restarts.
