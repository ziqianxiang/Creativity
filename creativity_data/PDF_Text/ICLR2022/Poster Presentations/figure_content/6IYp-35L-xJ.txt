Figure 1: Averaged power spectral densityof N2 windows from one night sleep oftwo different subjects from the sleep Phy-sionet dataset (channel Pz-Oz used here)(Goldberger et al., 2000). We notice thatpeak frequencies are shifted. Applyinga 0.5 Hz frequency shift transform tosub ject 1 leads a power spectrum densitymore similar to subject 2.
Figure 2: (a) Improvement per class of the F1-score due to channels dropout, sign flipand the CW subpolicy, relative to a model trained with no data augmentation. Eachaugmentation encodes specific invariances that can be more relevant for some classes thanothers. (b) Improvement of the multi-class balanced-accuracy relative to a model trainedwith no data augmentation. The CW subpolicy outperforms class-agnostic ones. Bothboxplots show how values are spread out across 10 folds.
Figure 3: Median performance gains obtained by individual augmentation strategies on thePhysionet dataset while increasing the train set size. Results are relative improvements com-pared to the baseline without any augmentation. Two frequency transforms (FT surrogateand frequency shift) as well as time reverse lead to the best performance.
Figure 4: Median performance (over 5 folds) of different ADA strategies as a function ofthe computation time. (a) Class-agnostic setting: ADDA is 40% faster than Faster AA andreaches a performance 0.6% higher. It also outperforms DADA by 0.6% in accuracy, 4 GPUhours earlier. (b) CW setting: CADDA outperforms gradient-free methods in this setting, asit is 5x faster than AutoAugment and achieves higher performance than Fast AutoAugment.
