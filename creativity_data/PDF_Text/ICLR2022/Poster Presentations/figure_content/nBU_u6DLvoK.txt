Figure 2: Accuracy vs. per-video GFLOPs on Kinetics-400 and Something-Something V2. B-32(4) means we test UniFormer-B32f with 4 clips and S-16(3) means we test UniFormer-S16f with3 crops (more testing details can be found in Section 4.3). Our UniFormer achieves the best balancebetween accuracy and computation on both datasets.
Figure 3: Overall architecture of our Unified transFormer (UniFormer). A UniFormer block consistsof three key modules, i.e., Dynamic Position Embedding (DPE), Multi-Head Relation Aggregrator(MHRA), and Feed Forward Network (FFN). Detailed explanations can be found in Section 3.
Figure 4: Multi-clip/crop testing comparison on different datasets. Multi-clip testing is betterfor Kinetics and multi-crop testing is better for Something-Something.
Figure 5: Attention visualization of different structures. Videos are chosen from Kinetics-400 (Car-reira & Zisserman, 2017a).
