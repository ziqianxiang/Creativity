Figure 1: (a) Comparing α-EigenGame (GemP et al., 2021) and μ-EigenGame (this work)over 1000 trials with a batch size of 1. (top) The expected trajectory2 of each algorithm frominitialization () to the true value of the third eigenvector (?). (bottom) The distribution ofdistances between stochastic update trajectories and the expected trajectory of each algorithm as afunction of iteration count (bolder lines are later iterations and modes further left are more desirable).
Figure 2: (a) Extreme model parallelism as pro-posed in α-EigenGame. (b) Model and data par-allelism enabled by μ-EigenGame. Squares areseparate devices (here, M = 4). Copies of es-timates are color-coded. Updates are averagedacross copies for a larger effective batch size.
Figure 3: MNIST Experiment. Runtime (seconds) in legend on CPU (m = 1). Each columnevaluates a different minibatch size ∈ {1024, 256, 32}. Shading indicates ± standard error of themean. Learning rates were chosen from {10-3, . . . , 10-6} on 10 held out runs. Solid lines denoteresults with the best performing learning rate. All plots show means over 10 trials (randomnessarising from minibatches and initialization). Shaded regions highlight ± standard error of the mean.

Figure 5: (5a) Facebook Page Networks. (Left) Petals differentiate ground truth clusters; colorsdifferentiate learned clusters. Petals are ideally colored according to the color bar starting withthe rightmost petal and proceeding counterclockwise. Numbers indicate ground truth cluster size.

Figure 7: (a) Close in Euclidean distance can imply close in angular distance if the vectors are longenough. (b) The stable region for μ-EigenGame consists of an O(e) ball around the true optimum as→ 0.
Figure 8:	This diagram presents the relationships between utilities and updates. An arrow indicatesthe endpoint is reasonably derived from the origin; the lack of an arrow indicates the direction isunlikely. The link from equation (42) is explicitly crossed out with a hard stop for emphasis.

Figure 11: MNIST Experiment. SUbfigUres (a-c) correspond to μ-EigenGame, α-EigenGame, andthe gradient version of α-EigenGame discussed above respectively. Each experiment is conductedwith a minibatch size of 32 over five epochs of training and averaged over 10 trials. Each cUrve showsthe Update distance after each iteration for one of the top-16 eigenvectors. Cyan cUrves indicateeigenvectors higher in the hierarchy (e.g., v1) and magenta cUrves indicate eigenvectors lower in thehierarchy.
