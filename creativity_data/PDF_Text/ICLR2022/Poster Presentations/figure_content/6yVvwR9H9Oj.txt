Figure 1: Visualization of an MNAR example and its experimental results on CIFAR-10. (a) Classdistribution of the labeled and unlabeled training data. (b) Test accuracy of the supervised modelusing FixMatch and our CAP (Section 4.1). (c) The distribution of FixMatch’s confidence scoreson unlabeled data. Samples with confidence larger than a fixed threshold (0.95, yellow line) areimputed. The corresponding box-plots display the (minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile,maximum) summary. The confidence-axis is not equidistant scaling for better visualization.

Evaluation of average accuracies (Mean Accu) (%) / geometricmean accuracies (GM Accu) (%) using our method and FixMatch when a) varying imbalance ratioγu of the unlabeled data; b) selecting a sub-set randomly as labeled data. Experiments are conductedon (a) CIFAR-10 with Nmax = γl = 50, and (b) CIFAR-100 with 5,000 labeled samples.
