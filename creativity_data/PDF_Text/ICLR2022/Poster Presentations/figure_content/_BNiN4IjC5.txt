Figure 6: Scatter plots of waveform audio signals from the test set under different choices of theconditional information for PriorGrad vocoder. Left: V/UV label-based prior. Middle: Phonemelabel-based prior. Right: Energy-based prior.
Figure 7: Visualized example of PriorGrad acoustic model. Top: Baseline model generates datafrom the standard Gaussian, leading to higher level of noise and slow training. Middle: PriorGradmodel generates data from the data-dependent non-standard Gaussian that improves the quality andaccelerates model training. Bottom: Alternative model with jointly trainable diffusion prior, wherethe estimation is noisy and quality is worse. Right: ground-truth mel-spectrogram.
