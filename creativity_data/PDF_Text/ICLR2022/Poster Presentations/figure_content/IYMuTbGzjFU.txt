Figure 1: (a) The first and second rows show topic coherence (TC) and topic diversity (TD), respectively, fordifferent methods on five datasets. In each subfigure, the horizontal axis indicates the proportion of selectedtopics according to their NPMIs. For both TC and TD, higher is better. (b) topic quality (TQ = TC * TD)tendency of WeTe and its variants as the corpus size N grows. Where, WeTe(F) and WeTe(N) denote that wefinetune the word embeddings and learn it from scratch, respectively.
Figure 2: Parameter sensitivity ofWeTe on 20NG dataset, KMeans cluster-ing purity (Km-Purity) and Topic Qual-ity (TQ).
Figure 3: (a): t-SNE visualisation of selected topics and their top-6 words in the shared word embeddingspace. Different colors distinguish different topics; (b): Panoramic view of all words and learned topics; (c):Comparison of cherry-picked top-3 NSTM and WeTe topics on 20NG related to desktop keyword. In (a) and (b),stars and dots represent topic embeddings and word embeddings, respectively.
