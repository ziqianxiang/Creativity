Figure 1: Blue and red rodsdenote warps and wefts re-spectively. qs are the crossingnodes.
Figure 3: Fk and Ft are the static and kinetic friction. Coulomb model (left) is an indifferentiablemulti-value function. Stribeck effect (middle) is empirically observed (Stribeck, 1902). Our model(right) incorporates the Stribeck effect and also simulates self-excited vibrations around v = 0.
Figure 4: Shear force strength vs shear angle φ —φ, (left) and graphical illustration (right).
Figure 5: Woven patterns. Left-to-right: plain, satin, andtwill. Teal and coral indicate different yarns.
Figure 6: Simulation errors: data efficiency (left), long (middle) and big cloths simulation (right).
Figure 7: Simulation snapshots ofthe same step. The parameters es-timated by our model is visuallyclosest to the ground truth.
Figure 8: The MSE errorsagainst epochs. Our approachlearns faster than PPO.
