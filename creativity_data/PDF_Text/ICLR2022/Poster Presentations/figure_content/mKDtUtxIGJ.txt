Figure 1: Point cloud reconstruction.
Figure 2: Two-stage architecture for point cloud reconstruction. In this figure, point cloud hasbeen colorized for visualization purpose and we set the identical size of visualized points in Pin andPout for fair comparison.
Figure 3: Voxel generation network. We design sparse stacked hourglass network that hierarchi-cally and sequentially generates and prunes voxels in a coarse-to-fine manner.
Figure 4: Voxel re-localization network. The 2nd stage network involves transformers for voxel-to-point refinement. In particular, transformers are applied into self/cross-attention layers with ouramplified positional encoding to compute the relation between a query voxel and its neighbor voxels.
Figure 5: Point cloud reconstruction results using two baselines. Note that point cloud has beencolorized for a visualization purpose.
Figure 6: Point cloud reconstruction results using three baselines. Note that point cloud has beencolorized for a visualization purpose.
Figure 7: Point cloud reconstruction results. Note that point cloud has been colorized for a visu-alization purpose.
