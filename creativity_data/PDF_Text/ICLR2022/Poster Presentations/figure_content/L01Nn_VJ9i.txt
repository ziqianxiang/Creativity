Figure 1: BERR and STIME across feature type and regions, heat maps are log scaled.
Figure 2: Centroid BSEQ of each cluster, scaled between [0, 1], showing canonical backfill behaviorsnor region. Hence there is a non-trivial similarity across both signals and regions.
Figure 3: BERR vs model REVDIFFMAE.
Figure 4: Real-time vs sta-ble MAE.
Figure 5: B2F pipeline with all components	patterns irrespective of theexact nature of canonical behaviors which may vary across domains. We compute the sum of DTWdistances of BSEQs for each pair of nodes summed over t0 ∈ {1, 2, . . . , t - 5}. We threshold t0 tillt - 5 to make the BSEQs to be of reasonable length (at least 5) to capture temporal similarity withoutdiscounting too many BSEQs. Top τ node pairs with lowest total DTW distance are assigned an edge.
Figure 6: (a) B2F refines ENSEMBLE predictionssignificantly for most states. (b) efficacy of B2Framps up within 6 weeks of revision data.
Figure 7: B2F rectified MAE up to 74.2% for most model predictions (Figure 8b).
Figure 8: B2F adapts to abnormally high revisionsBack2Future (B2F), the novel deep-learning method to model this phenomenon, which exploits ourobservations of cross-signal similarities using Graph Recurrent Neural Networks to refine predictionsand rectify evaluations for a wide range of models. Our extensive experiments showed that leveragingsimilarity among backfill patterns as well as model bias via our proposed method leads to significant6 - 11% improvements in all the top models.
