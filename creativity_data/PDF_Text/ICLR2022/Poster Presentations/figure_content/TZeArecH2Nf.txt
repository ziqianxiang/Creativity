Figure 1: UserRec for an item. Users are considered positive if they indeed interact with the givenitem in a future time window. A matching hit requires both relevance and activeness of the user. Anactive user may have multiple hits with different items, whereas an inactive user may have zero. Inaddition, the user hits in a given item are often correlated with their past histories with similar items.
Figure 2: Bayesian paradox. We start with an ItemRec model p(y|x) that assigns nonzero scoresto all users, including cold or inactive users, who are abundant in RecSys due to power-law effects.

Figure S7: Average percentage of users actually delivered per item. We set β = 1% and α ≥ 1%,so the ideal outcome should be 1%. However, when we simulate OnlnMtch in a future period oftime, any biases in the empirical user-state distribution could cause the outcomes to be different.
