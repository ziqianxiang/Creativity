Figure 1:	A comparison of GDA (Center) and NHG dynamics (Right) in the task of solvingminθ maxφ Ψ (θ, φ) where p = f (θ), and q = g(φ). In NHG, the Lyapunov function (Left) ismonotonically decreasing, as opposed to GDA.
Figure 2:	A plot of the real sinusoid sampled on the interval from 0 to 2π (Left). GAN generatedsamples for NHG dynamics (Center). The performance of GDA vs. NHG dynamics on GANs asmeasured by Wasserstein-1 distance (Right).
Figure 3: An example of the RD of a 2-Team Hidden Matching Pennies (Center) with norestrictions applied in the parameters space (θ, 1 - θ) in (Left), and (Right). In this case, theRD cycles for any initial point (θ(0), 1 - θ(0)). The evolution of θ(t), as a function of time,t ∈ [0, 100] is depicted in (Bottom) along with the Lyapunov function given in (31).
Figure 4: An example of the RD of a 2-Team Hidden Matching Pennies (Center) in a re-Stricted setting where 2 ∈ Sk,i for all i ∈ [3], k ∈ [2] ((Left), and (Right)). In this case,the RD converges for any initial interior point (θ(0), 1 - θ(0)). The evolution of θ(t), as afunction of time, t ∈ [0, 100] is depicted in (Bottom).
Figure 5: An example of the RD of a 2-Team Hidden Matching Pennies (Center) in a re-stricted setting where 2 ∈ Sι,i, and 1 ∈ S2,i for all i ∈ [3] ((Left), and (Right)). In this casethe RD converges for any initial interior point (θ(0), 1 - θ(0)), but the point of convergencedepends on the value of θ(0). The evolution of θ(t), as a function of time, t ∈ [0, 100] isdepicted in (Bottom).
Figure 6: An example of the RD of a 2-Team Hidden Matching Pennies (Center) in a re-stricted setting where 1 ∈ Sι,i, and 1 ∈ S2,j for some i,j ∈ [3] ((Left), and (Right)). Inthis case the RD converge to a cycle defined by, at least, |S1 | + |S2 | - 1 linearly independentinvariant functions for any initial interior point (θ(0), 1 - θ(0)) The evolution of θ(t), as afunction of time, t ∈ [0, 100] is depicted in (Bottom).
