Figure 1: Dynamics of hidden neuronsThere are two noteworthy points from this figure. First, “good type” parameters are preserved undercoordinate descent. Second, there are no arrows coming into “bad type” except from itself.
Figure 2: Display of accuracy versus epoch forvarying n. Accuracy is computed on verticesdrawn from random SBM graphs. The accuracy in-creases with epoch, and we also see that the lowerbound on the accuracy increases with n, as ex-pected from our theory.

Figure 4: Dynamics of neurons of different types. The 1st, 2nd and 4th row correspond to neurons of“good" type satisfying (G2). The 3rd row corresponds to “harmless" satisfying (H2). The 5th rowcorresponds to “bad" type satisfying (B2). Their dynamics verify our results in Sections B.1, B.2,B.3 and Theorem 6.2.
