Figure 1: Schematics of the convolution between an input X ∈ RD×D×( and a kernel K ∈ Rd×d×(resulting in a D × D matrix.
Figure 2: Schematics of the use of two convolutions to approximate the operation depicted in Fig-ure 1. The elements of the set U = {U(1),..., U(n)} and V are random tensors. Notice that theintermediate tensor U * X has size D × D × n and yet the final output is a D × D matrix.
Figure 3: Relative error of random subset sum approximation of the convolution weights of a LeNet5trained on MNIST (left) and on Fashion-MNIST (right). The error is given in logarithmic scale asthe maximum distance between a weight and its approximation for different sample sizes.
Figure 4: Maximum relative output error for the convolutional portion of LeNet5 trained on MNIST(left) and Fashion-MNIST (right) for different sample sizes. The maximum is computed over allimages in the dataset.
