Figure 1: Accuracy-speed tradeoff on Model-Net40. Our PointMLP performs best. Pleaserefer to Section 4 for details.
Figure 2: Overview of one stage in PointMLP. Given an input point cloud, PointMLP progressivelyextracts local features using residual point MLP blocks. In each stage, we first transform the localpoints using a geometric affine module, then they are extracted before and after the aggregationoperation, respectively. PointMLP progressively enlarges the receptive field and models completepoint cloud geometric information by repeating multiple stages.
Figure 3: Four run results (mean Â± std) of PointMLP with/without our geometric affine module onScanObjectNN test set. We zoom in on the details of PointMLP40 to show the stability difference.
Figure 4: Loss landscape along two rand directions. By introduc-ing residual connection, we ease the optimization of PointMLP andachieve a flat landscape like a simple shallow network intuitively.
Figure 5: Part segmentation results on ShapeNetPart. Topline is ground truth and bottom line is our prediction.
