Figure 1: Non-ViSUal properties like mass and charge govern the interaction between objects andlead to different motion trajectories. a) Objects attract and repel each other according to the (signof) charge they carry. b) Mass determines how much an object’s trajectory is perturbed during aninteraction. Heavier objects have more stable motion.

Figure 3: The perception module detects objects’ location and visual appearance attributes. Thephysical property learner learns objects’ properties based on detected object trajectories. The dynamicpredictor predicts objects’ dynamics in the counterfactual scene based on objects’ properties andlocations. Finally, an execution engine runs the program parsed by the language parser on thepredicted dynamic scene to answer the question.
