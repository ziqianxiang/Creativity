Figure 8: Cross-class neighborhood similarity on Citeseer and Pubmed. On both graphs, theintra-class similarity is clearly higher than the inter-class ones.
Figure 9: Cross-class neighborhood similarity on Squirrel, Texas and Wisconsin. The inter-class similarity on Squirrel is slightly higher than intra-class similarity for most classes, whichsubstantiates the middling performance of GCN. Both Texas and Wisconsin are quite small,hence the cross-class similarity in these two graphs present severe bias and may not provide preciseinformation about these graphs.
Figure 10: 3-class CSBM in 2-dimensional space. The dashed circles demonstrate the standarddeviation for each class. The entire space is split to three areas (indicated by different colors) corre-sponding to the three classes for optimal decision making. The equilateral triangle indicates that thedistance between the means of any two classes is the same.

Figure 19:	Citeseer: all neighborhood distribution patternattracting increasing attention in the research community. However, it is not ideal for modelingsparse graphs, which are commonly observed in the real-world. Hence, itis important to devote moreefforts to analyzing more general graphs. We believe our results established a solid initial study forfurther investigation. Finally, our current theoretical analysis majorly focuses on the GCN model;we hope to extend this analysis in the future to more general message-passing neural networks.
