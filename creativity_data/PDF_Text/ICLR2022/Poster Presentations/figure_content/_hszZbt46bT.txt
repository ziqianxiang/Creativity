Figure 2: A Dolan-More profile for ODDSs F1scores. The x-axis is a varying threshold (θ). Theplot considers the performance of each method incomparison to the best performing method. They-axis is, for a given method, the ratio of datasetsin which the obtained score is above θ times themaximal score over all methods. Experimentswith missing baselines were omitted for fairness.
Figure 3: The negative log likelihood (Eq. 1) for matching between the sub-vectors (aij , bij ) withnetworks F, G for multiple ODDS datasets. The results are shown in each plot, from left to right,for in-class samples using the original order of vector elements, out-of-class samples using the sameorder, in-class samples with a fixed-permutation order of features, out-of-class samples with thispermuted order. The samples in the box plots were collected across all test samples xi and segmentindices j , without summing over j . The horizontal line indicates the negative log likelihood of arandom guess.
