Figure 1: Top: Convolutional dictionary learning (CDL) applied to a univariate signal (blue) de-composes it as the convolution of a temporal pattern (orange) and a sparse activation signal (black).
Figure 2: True and estimated intensity functions following a driving event at time zero for twodifferent kernels, on synthetic data. Left: "wide" kernel with σ = 0.2. Right: "sharp" kernel withσ = 0.05. Parameters used are T = 10000, P/S = 0.6. On synthetic data, the EM algorithmsuccessfully retrieves the true values of parameters, for both shapes of kernels.
Figure 3: Mean of the relative infinite norm as a function of process duration T and the percentage ofevents kept P/S, for two kernel shapes on synthetic data: wide kernel (left) and sharp kernel (right).
Figure 4: Spatial and temporal patterns of 4 atoms from sample dataset, and their respective estimatedintensity functions following a stimulus (cue at time = 0 s), for auditory and visual stimuli. Theheartbeat and eye-blink artifacts are not linked to any stimuli. An auditory stimulus will induce aneural response similar to atom 2, with a mean latency of 85 ms.
Figure 5: Spatial and temporal patterns of 3 atoms from Somato dataset, and their respective estimatedintensity functions following a somatosensory stimulus (cue at time = 0 s). The eye-blink artifact(atom 0) is not linked to the stimulus, and neither is the α-wave (atom 7). A somatosensory stimuluswill induce a neural response similar to atom 2, with a mean latency of 1 s.
