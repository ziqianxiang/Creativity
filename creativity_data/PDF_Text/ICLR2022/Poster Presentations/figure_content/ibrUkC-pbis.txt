Figure 1: An example Futoshiki Puzzle ofsize 3 Ã— 3 and the corresponding graphs. Avalue of -1 indicates an unassigned vari-able. Black and red edges are Constraintand Relation edges respectively. The digits5, 7, 1 in square boxes represent a random 3-permutation of kmax , used in multi-valuedmodel for initialization of node embeddings.

Figure 3: Hidden State Update at time-step t: We take a toy graph with 3 nodes, {a, b, c}, and 2edge-types, {q, r}, to illustrate edge-dependent message passing and hidden state update of node b.
