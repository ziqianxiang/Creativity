Figure 10: The structure of the network used in our experiments. The input is a matrix of shape(n, 3) representing the coordinates of all points in the set, and the output is a matrix of shape (n, 1)representing the potential of the corresponding points. mlp(x) represents a multi-layer perceptron(mlp) with the size x. For example, mlp(m, n) represents a mlp consisting of two layer, and thesize of each layer is m and n. We use ReLu activation function in all except the output layer. Theactivation function l(x; h) = max{-|x|, -h} is added to the output to clip the output to interval[-h, 0].
