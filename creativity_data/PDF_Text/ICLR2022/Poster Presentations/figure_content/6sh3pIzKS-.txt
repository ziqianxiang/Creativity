Figure 1: (a) Illustration of a GNN encoder processing a proline molecule. Hydrogen is omitted. (b)Illustration of Fischer esterification of propionic acid and propanol, and the corresponding reactiontemplate learned by our model. The reaction center is colored in orange, and atoms whose distancefrom the reaction center is 1 or 2 are colored in light orange. (c) Illustration of the contrastive lossfor a minibatch of chemical reactions. dij is Euclidean distance between embedding hRi and hPj .
