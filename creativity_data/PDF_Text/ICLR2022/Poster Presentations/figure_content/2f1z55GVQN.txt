Figure 1: Here we plot the distribution of found local minima found after 52 separate traininginstances using the randomized model on (a) 2n = 64- and (b) 2n = 256-dimensional models.
Figure 2: Here we plot the distribution of found local minima found after 52 separate traininginstances using the randomized model, with p = 48 and 2n = 64 model dimension. For evena small model size, qualitatively the expected distribution of critical points and the distribution ofcritical points for a fixed random ansatz are in agreement.
Figure 3: Here we plot the distribution of found local minima after 52 separate training instancesusing a Hamiltonian informed model. Dashed lines denote the predicted region local minima will lie.
