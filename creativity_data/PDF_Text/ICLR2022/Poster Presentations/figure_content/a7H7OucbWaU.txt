Figure 1: Averaged incremental accuracy and training time on ImageNet-sub. Using JPEG for datacompression can achieve comparable or better performance than recent strong approaches with lessextra computation (purple arrow), and can further improve their performance (gray arrow).
Figure 2: Memory replay with data compression on ImageNet-sub. We make a grid search of the JPEGquality in {10, 25, 50, 75, 90}. The quality of 100 refers to the original data without compression.
Figure 3: t-SNE visualization of features of the original subset (light dots) and its compressed subset(dark dots) after learning 5-phase ImageNet-sub with LUCIR. From left to right, the quantity isincreased from 37, 85 to 200, while the JPEG quality is reduced from 90, 50 to 10. We plot fiveclasses out of the latest task and label them in different colors. The crossed area is out-of-distribution.

Figure 5: For 5-phase ImageNet-sub, we present Rq in each incremental phase with various compres-sion qualities q, and the averaged Rq of all incremental phases.
Figure 6: Averaged incremental accuracy (the column, leftY-axis) and computational cost (the triangle, right Y-axis) onImageNet-sub. We run each baseline with one Tesla V100.
Figure 7: The effects of different storage space (equal to 10, 20, 40 and 80 original images per class)on ImageNet-sub. LUCIR (a) and PODNet (b) are reproduced from their officially-released codes.
Figure 8: We present the grid search results (left), Rq in eachincremental phase (middle), and the averaged Rq of all incre-mental phases (right) for SSCL on SODA10M. The qualitydetermined by our method is 50, which indeed achieves thebest performance in the grid search.
Figure 9: Limiting the storage space to the equivalent of(a) 20 original images per class for ImageNet and (b) 50original images per phase for SODA10M, we plot the relationbetween the quality and quantity of compressed data. Thequality of 100 refers to the original data without compression.

Figure 12: t-SNE visualization of features of original subsets (dark dots) and all training data (lightdots) for 5-phase ImageNet-sub with LUCIR. We randomly select five classes out of the latest taskand label them in different colors.
Figure 13: We present Rq in each incremental phase with various compression qualities (left), andthe averaged Rq of all incremental phases (right). From top to bottom are 5-, 10- and 25-phaseImageNet-Sub, respectively.
Figure 14: Determine the compression quality for AANets and DDE. We present Rq in eachincremental phase (left), and the averaged Rq of all incremental phases (right) for 5-phase ImageNet-sub. The quality of 100 refers to the original data without compression.
