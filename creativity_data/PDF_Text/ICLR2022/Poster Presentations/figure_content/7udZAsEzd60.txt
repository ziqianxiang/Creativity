Figure 1: Left: An arrangement of 3 hyperplanes {H1 , H2, H3} in R2. There are 7 sign patterns.
Figure 2: The HAC(d, r, k) concept class as a neural network where d = 4, r = 2 and k = 3. TheBoolean function h is realized as a neural network hθ .
Figure 3: Top left. ArchitectUreofHANN USedfortheMOONS dataset (make_moons in Sklearn).
Figure 4: Each blue tick above the x-axis represents a single dataset, where the x-coordinate of thetick is the difference of the accuracy of HANN and either SNN (left) or DENN (right) on the dataset.
Figure 5: Partition of [0,1]d into 1/k hypercubes via arrangement of d(k - 1) hyperplanes, whered = 2 and ⅛ = 3. Shaded region is [0,1]d. Dotted region is a cell of the hyperplane arrangement.
Figure 6: Each blue tick above the x-axis represents a single dataset, where the x-coordinate of thetick is the difference of the accuracy of HANN and either SNN (left) or DENN (right) on the dataset.
Figure 7: Four independent runs of HANN on the moons synthetic dataset. Similar to Figure 3.
