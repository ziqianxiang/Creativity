Figure 1: Example of a global multi-agent symmetry. When a rotated stateoccurs in the environment the optimalpolicy is permuted, both between andwithin agents.
Figure 3: Example of how a global transformation of a distributed traffic light control state can beviewed as 1) a permutation of the observations over the agents, 2) a permutation of the interactionedges, 3) a transformation of the local observations.
Figure 4: Example of the difference between a global trans-formation on the global state, and a set of local transforma-tions on local states. On the left we rotate the entire worldby 90 degrees clockwise, which involves rotating crossingsand streets. On the right we perform local uncoordinatedtransformations only at the street level. The latter is not asymmetry of the problem.
Figure 5: Results for the distributed drone wildlife monitoring task. 25%, 50% and 75% quantilesshown over 15 random seeds. All approaches tuned over 6 learning rates.
Figure 6: Average vehicle wait times for distributed set-tings of the traffic light control task. Graphs show 25%,50% and 75% quantiles over 20 independent trainingruns. All approaches tuned over 6 learning rates.
Figure 7: General overview of Multi-Agent MDP Homomorphic Networks. G-CNN refers to agroup-equivariant CNN encoder. Equivariant message passing refers to the proposed equivariantmessage passing networks. Encoding local states with group-CNNs ensure the state encodings zi aregroup-equivariant. The locations xi are input to the equivariant message passing network.
