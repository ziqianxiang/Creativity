Figure 1: Illustration of recovered triggers: (a) clean image, (b) poisoned image, (c) image with atrigger recovered without topological prior, (d)-(f) images with candidate triggers recovered withthe proposed method. Topological prior contributes to improved compactness. We run the triggerreconstruction for multiple rounds with a diversity prior to ensure a diverse set of trigger candidates.
Figure 2: Illustration of generating a diverse set oftrigger candidates to increase the chance of find-ing the true trigger, especially for scenarios withunknown target labels.

Figure 5: From the left to right: (a) a sample landscape for a continuous function. The values at thepeaks α0 < α1 < α2 < α3 < α4 < α5 . As we decrease the threshold, the topological structuresof the superlevel set change, (b) and (c) correspond to topological structures captured by differentthresholds, (d) highlighted region in (a), (e) the changes are captured by the persistence diagram(right figure). We focus on the 0-dimensional topological structures (connected components). Eachpersistent dot in the persistence diagram denotes a specific connected component. The topologicalloss is introduced to reduce the connected components, which means pushing most of the persistentdots to the diagonal (along the green lines).

From left to right: (a) cleanimage, (b) triggers recovered by (Wang et al., 2019), (c) triggers recovered by (Liu et al., 2019), (d)triggers recovered by (Guo et al., 2019), (e) triggers recovered by our method without topologicalprior, and (f) triggers recovered by our method with topological prior.
