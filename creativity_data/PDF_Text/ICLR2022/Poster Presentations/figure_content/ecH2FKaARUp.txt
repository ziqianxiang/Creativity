Figure 1: Illustration of the thought experiment. Assume we use identified noise transition matrix(NTM) to corrupt the instance with clean label [0, 1]. From the underlying distribution perspective,the noisy underlying distribution is [0.3, 0.7]. From the empirical distribution perspective, the labelof this sample is statistically either the same as (case 1) or different from (case 2) the clean label,leading to different PTM. In other words, the observed noisy labels (posterior information) provideinductive bias of label correction, which motivates the notion of PTM.
Figure 2: The overview of IF. NTM can be estimated beforehand based on the previous work (Xiaet al., 2020). PTM estimation is iteratively obtained based on model prediction and observed label.
