Figure 1: The diagram of the proposed model, GMR-Transformer-GMUS. We first represent thedomain as a graph and then select pivotal nodes (red/green/yellow) to encode information over theentire graph. The encoder GMR runs Message passing along graph edges so that the pivotal nodescollect information from nearby nodes. The latent vector zt summarizes information at the pivotalnodes, and represents the whole domain at the current step. The transformer will predict zt+1 basedon all previous state latent vectors. Finally, we decode zt+1 through message passing to obtain thenext-step prediction Yt+1.

Our model, particularly the transformer, show muchless error accUmUlation compared to the next-step model.
