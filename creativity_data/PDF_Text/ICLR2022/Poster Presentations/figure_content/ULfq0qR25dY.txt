Figure 1: Example of n-times coverage calculation.
Figure 2: The MarginalGreedy and NTimes-ILP algorithms outperform the greedy algorithmon both LARGE and SMALL toy examples. Superior performance is seen on both the n-TIMESSet Cover where a smaller number of overlays is used by MarginalGreedy and NTimes-ILPto achieve 100% coverage at different criteria of n, and on the MAXIMUM n-TIMES COVERAGEproblems where MarginalGreedy and NTimes-ILP achieve higher coverage given same numberof overlays. Shaded regions indicate 95% confidence intervals.

(a) EvalVax-Robust population coverage with n ≥ 1 peptide-HLA hitsper individual, performances of 3 variants of OptiVax are shown by curves and baseline performanceis shown by red crosses (labeled by name of first author). (b) EvalVax-Robust population coveragewith n ≥ 5 peptide-HLA hits. (c) EvalVax-Robust population coverage with n ≥ 8 peptide-HLAhits. (d) Comparison of OptiVax and baselines on expected number of peptide-HLA hits.
