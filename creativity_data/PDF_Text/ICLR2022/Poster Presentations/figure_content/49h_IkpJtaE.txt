Figure 1: The problem of permutations in label assignments, and the illustration of UNICORN-MAML.
Figure 2:	Heat maps of MAML's five-way one-shot accuracy on MiniImageNet, TieredImageNet, and CUBw.r.t. the inner loop learning rate α (x-axis) and the number of inner loop updates M (y-axis). For each heat map,we set accuracy below a threshold to a fixed value for clarity; we denote the best accuracy by a black box.
Figure 3:	We plot the change of the five-way one-shot classification accuracy (on the query set), averaged over10,000 tasks sampled from either the meta-training (red) or meta-testing classes (blue), along with the process ofinner loop updates, using the best model initialization learned by MAML. C: ConvNet; R: ResNet.
Figure 4: The histogram of the 120 meta-testing accuracy (averaged over 2, 000 tasks), each corresponds to aspecific position in the sorted list of each task’s accuracy among 120 permutations. The x-axis corresponds toaccuracy (range); the y-axis corresponds to counts. The backbone is ResNet-12.
Figure 5: The change of meta-testing accuracy (over 10,000 tasks) along with the process of inner loop updatesbased on UNICORN-MAML. We investigate updating/freezing the feature extractor φ.
Figure F: The support (left) and query (right) set accuracy on a randomly sampled five-way one-shotmeta-testing task from MiniImageNet. We plot the accuracy of each permutation (totally 120) alongwith the process of inner loop optimization (the same permutation is colored the same in the left andright images).
Figure G: Heat maps of MAML’s five-way five-shot accuracy on MiniImageNet, TieredImageNet,and CUB w.r.t. the inner loop learning rate α (x-axis) and the number of inner loop updates M(y-axis). For each map, we set accuracy below a threshold to a fixed value for clarity; we denotethe best accuracy by a black box.
Figure H: We plot the change of the five-way five-shot classification accuracy (on the query set),averaged over 10,000 tasks sampled from either the meta-training (red) or meta-testing classes (blue),along with the process of inner loop updates, using the best model initialization learned by MAML.
