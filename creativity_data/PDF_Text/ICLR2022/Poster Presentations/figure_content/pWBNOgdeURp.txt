Figure 1: Equivalence of Koopman and global magnitude pruning at convergence. Left, com-pression vs. accuracy of MnistNet trained on MNIST. Right, compression vs. accuracy of ResNet-20trained on CIFAR-10. Dashed lines are mean accuracy immediately after pruning and solid lines aremean accuracy after a single epoch of refining. Error bars are standard deviation.
Figure 2: Koopman and global magnitude pruning pre-convergence. Left column, compressionvs. accuracy of MnistNet trained on MNIST. Right column, compression vs. accuracy of ResNet-20trained on CIFAR-10. Top row, results of pruning DNN after 1 epoch of training. Bottom row,results of pruning DNN after 20 epochs of training. In both cases, only data from epoch 1 andepoch 20, respectively, are used to compute the Koopman mode decomposition. Dashed lines aremean accuracy immediately after pruning and solid lines are mean accuracy after a single epoch ofrefining. Error bars are standard deviation.
Figure 3: Overlap between Koopman and global magnitude pruning masks. Left, overlap ofsurviving parameters found via KMP and GMP on MnistNet training on MNIST. Right, overlap ofsurviving parameters found via KMP and GMP on ResNet-20 trained on CIFAR-10. Error bars areminimum and maximum of three seeds.
Figure 4: Koopman gradient pruning. Left, real and imaginary parts of the computed Koopmaneigenvalues. Red dots denote modes that had a norm of greater than 0.85. Here, λ1 = 1.000 andλ2 = 0.075. Right, compression vs. accuracy of ResNet-20 trained for 20 epochs on CIFAR-10.
Figure 5: Overlap between Koopman masks across epochs. Left, overlap of surviving parametersfound via KMP on MnistNet, trained on MNIST, at different epochs. Right, overlap of survivingparameters found via KMP on ResNet-20, trained on CIFAR-10, at different epochs. Error bars arestandard deviation.
