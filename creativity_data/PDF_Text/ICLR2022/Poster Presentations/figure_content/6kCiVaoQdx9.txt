Figure 1: Schematic illustrations of Voronoi Diagram (VD) and surrogate representation on Multi-DigitMNIST dataset (Sun, 2019). Left and central panels demonstrate the VD of base classes andnovel classes (5-way 1-shot) in R2, respectively. The colored squares stand for the 1-shot supportsamples. In the right panel, for each support sample, the surrogate representation (dotted line) ex-hibits a unique pattern which those of the query samples (colored lines) also follow.
