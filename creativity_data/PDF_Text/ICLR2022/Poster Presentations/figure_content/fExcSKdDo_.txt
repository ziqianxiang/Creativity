Figure 1: Decoder for CNFs (left) is the posterior of the encoder and the posteriors have unboundedsupport resulting in probability mass in all categories inp(xt|zt). ArgmaX flow (center) have boundedsupports that partitions the full latent space into regions where the posterior for each category isdeterministic, but (1) the naive thresholding (thresh.) requires the dimensionality of the space to beequal to the number of categories, and (2) the binary encoding partitions data into separate octants,sometimes leaving octants unsupported. TRUFL (right) allows bounded support for each category,and for latent dimensions to be different from the category size.
Figure 2: Left: Pseudo-code for rejection sampling. Centre: The untruncated prior P(Z). Right: Theprior truncated according to the unioned support of q. We denote this as Ptrunc (Z).
Figure 3: Rejection rate VS training iterations. The re-jection rate when sampling for evaluation for the graphcolouring task reduces during iteration, indicating (1)the rejection rate is not intractably high, and (2) theprior tries to match the support of TRUFL oVer time.
