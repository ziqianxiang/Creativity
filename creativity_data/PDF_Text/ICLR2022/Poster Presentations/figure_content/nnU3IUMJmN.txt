Figure 1: An example of incorporating structural locality in the computation flow of PkNN(Wt|q).
Figure 2: The relationship between nearest neighbor rank, negative distance, and the retrieval accuracy,grouped by different locality levels. Only top 200 nearest neighbors are shown for clarity. Negativedistance on x-axis represents the upper bound of the bin.
Figure 3: The relationship between nearest neighbor rank and the “modified” negative distance -gguided by our proposed locality features, grouped by different locality levels. Similarly to Figure 2,only top 200 nearest neighbors are shown for clarity.
