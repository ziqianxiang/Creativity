Figure 1: Experiments of '∞-distance net training on CIFAR-10 dataset using the hinge loss function. Trainingdetails can be found in Section 5.1. (a) The percentage of training samples with output margin greater than θthroughout training. We use very long training epochs, and the final percentage is still below 2.5%. The dashedlines indicate different p values of `p -distance neurons. (b) The certified accuracy on training dataset and testdataset respectively, trained using different hinge threshold θ. Training gets worse when θ ≤ 6.
Figure 2: Experiments of '∞-distance net training on CIFAR-10 dataset (e = 8/255) using the proposedobjective function (9). (a) The percentage of training samples with output margin greater than θ (blue), lessthan 0 (orange), or between 0 and θ (green) throughout training. The dashed lines indicate different p values of`p -relaxation. (b) The final performance of the trained network using different hinge threshold θ. (c) Heatmapof certified accuracy with different hyper-parameters λ0 and λend. Each grid shows the certified accuracy for apair of hyper-parameters.
Figure 3: Approximating the LiPschitz constant of 'p-distance net when P = 8, trained using differ-ent loss functions on CIFAR-10 dataset. The left figure plots the calculated value of (21) over thetest set at each quantile. The right table provides the statistical information.
