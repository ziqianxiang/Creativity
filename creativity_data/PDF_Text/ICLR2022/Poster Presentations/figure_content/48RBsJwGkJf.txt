Figure 1: Illustration of label space of domain adaptation (DA), domain generalization (DG), singledomain generalization (SDG), open domain generalization (ODG), and open-set single domaingeneralization (OS-SDG). Different colors represent different domains. As there is no prior knowledgeabout the target domains, existing DG and SDG methods cannot handle unknown classes (e.g., cameraand truck) in target domain. ODG provides multiple source domains to learn a model. However, ourproposed OS-SDG only supplies a single source domain, which is more challenging than ODG.
Figure 2: Overview of CrossMatch in SDG methods. xs represents source samples while xk andxu denote generated known class and auxiliary unknown class samples, respectively. G is thefeature extractor where gs = G(xs). The multi-binary classifier is Fb = {Fb1, . . . , Fb|Cs|} wherepbs = Fb (gs). F is the multi-class classifier where ps = F (gs). (a) At minimization stage, weadopt Lova (Eq. 5) and Lbent (Eq. 6) to optimize Fb while train F by cross-entropy loss Lce . We alsopropose a novel loss Lccr to improve the capability of F on unknown class identification. (b) Atmaximization stage, SDG methods maximize their defined losses, e.g., Lada (Eq. 3), to generatenew samples to enrich the diversity of source domain in Cs , while we propose an auxiliary samplegeneration loss Lunk to generate samples that are far way from Cs . After maximization stage, thegenerated xk is appended to source domain Ds .
