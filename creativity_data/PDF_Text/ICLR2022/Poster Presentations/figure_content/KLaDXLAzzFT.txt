Figure 1: Comparison between PEVI and VAPVI in the non-stationary linear MDP instance describedabove. In each figure, y-axis denotes suboptimality gap v? - vÏ€b , x-axis denotes number of episodesK. The problem horizons are fixed to be H = 20, 30, 50. The solid line denotes the averagesuboptimality gap over 50 trials and the error bar area is the corresponding standard deviation. Therange of K is from 5 to 1000.
