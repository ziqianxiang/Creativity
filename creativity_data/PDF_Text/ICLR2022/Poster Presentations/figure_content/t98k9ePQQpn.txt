Figure 1: Our proposed framework OTLM. The logit Φ (x) is fed into a single-layer feed-forwardnetwork to infer Z . The cost matrix M is set to - log Z. By solving the optimal transport problemvia Sinkhorn algorithm, we can obtain the refined prediction Y .
Figure 2: The left image shows the convergence of OTLM: The absolute error σ decreases withiterations on the ImageNet-LT validation data set (20k samples), and we used ResNet-50 as thebackbone to obtain the original predictions Z. The right image demonstrates the block in W, wetrained on CIFAR-100 to produce the original predictions with OTLM to minimise the differencebetween the ideal and actual distributions. For ease of display, the values of the diagonal elementsare relatively large and we will replace these values with zeros.
