Figure 1: Representation of a multivariate time series as a sequence of graphs. Red circles denotenodes with missing values, nodes are identified.
Figure 2: An overview of the bidirectional architecture. Here, each unidirectional GRIN module isprocessing the Ï„-th step ofan input sequence with 4 dimensions (sensors). Two values are missing atthe considered time step. GRIN performs a first imputation, which is then processed and refined bythe spatial decoder. These second-stage imputations are then used to continue the processing at thenext step. An MLP processes learned representations node and time wise to obtain final imputations.
Figure 3: Reconstruction of observations fromsensors removed from the training set. Plots showthat GRIN might be used for virtual sensing.
Figure 4: Adjacency matrices of the different datasets.
Figure 5: The plot shows graphically the results in Tab. 10.
