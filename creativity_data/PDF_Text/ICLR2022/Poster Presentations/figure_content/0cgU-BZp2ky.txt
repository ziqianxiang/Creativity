Figure 1: A. In the proposed human-in-the-loop method, human subjects will decide whether tointervene in the execution of the learning agent and demonstrate the correct action. Such interventionincurs a cost to the agent such that it learns to minimize the total cost during the training. B. Thehuman interface for copilot during the training. The human subject can steer the wheel or press thepaddle to start the intervention and then the demonstration data will be recorded. C. An illustrativedriving trajectory where the green segments are generated by the agent and the blue segments arethe demonstrations of the human expert to overcome the dangerous situations.

Figure 3: A. The performance of RL methods and HACO. HACO achieves superior training timesafety and test success rate. B. Dynamics of human cognitive cost. The takeover rate is the propor-tion of the human takeover steps in an episode. In the training process, the takeover rate and theepisodic intervention cost gradually reduce and the agent obtains higher level of autonomy.
