Figure 1: Example for a RegCCRF, showing NFA and unrolled factor graph. L describes the lan-guage (O | BI*O*BI*)*, the language of valid BIO sequences for an even number of spans. Wewould like to calculate Pθ(y | x, L) for y = hB, O, B, Ii. We show an unambiguous automaton Mfor L (left), and a factor graph (right) for the auxiliary CRF computing Pθ (y0 | x), where y0 ∈ Y0*corresponds to the sole accepting path of y through M (marked).
Figure 2: Model output probabilities, and NLL losses, plotted against sequence length k. As k in-creases, constrained decoding becomes a progressively worse approximation for the data distribu-tion, while constrained training is consistently able to match the data distribution.
