Figure 1: Illustrations of low-rank matrix parameterization and FedPara with the same number ofparameters 2R(m + n). (a) Low-rank parameterization is the summation of 2R number of rank-1 matrices, W = XY>, and rank(W) ≤ 2R. (b) FedPara is the Hadamard product of twolow-rank inner matrices, W = W1 W2 = (X1Y1>)	(X2Y2>), and rank(W) ≤ R2.
Figure 2: Diagrams of (a) FedPer and (b)pFedPara. The global part is transferred tothe server and shared across clients, while thelocal part remains private in each client.
Figure 3: (a-f): Accuracy [%] (y-axis) vs. communication costs [GBytes] (x-axis) of VGG16ori. andVGG16FedPara. Broken line and solid line represent VGG16ori. and VGG16FedPara, respectively.
Figure 4: Test accuracy [%] (y-axis) vs. parameters ratio [%] (x-axis) of VGG16FedPara at the targetrounds. The target rounds follow Table 2. The dotted line represents VGG16ori. with no parameterreduction, and the solid line VGG16FedPara adjusted by γ ∈ [0.1, 0.9] in 0.1 increments.
Figure 5: Average test accuracy over ten local models trained by each algorithm. (a) 100% of localtraining data on FEMNIST are used with the non-IID setting, which mimics enough local data totrain and evaluates each local model on their own data. (b) 20% of local training data on FEMNISTare used with the non-IID setting, which mimics insufficient local data to train local models. (c)100% of local training data on MNIST are used with the highly-skew non-IID setting, where eachclient has at most two classes. The error bars denote 95% confidence intervals obtained by 5 repeats.
Figure 6: Histogram of rank(W). We apply FedPara to W ∈ Ri00×i00 and set ri = r2 = 10.
