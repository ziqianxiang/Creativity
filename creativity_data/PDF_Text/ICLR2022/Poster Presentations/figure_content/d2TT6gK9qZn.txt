Figure 1: Pade Exponential Model. A recurrent neural architecture for computing the exponential of an operatorL using [p∕q] Pade approximation. The multiplicative scalar coefficients a,,bi are fixed-beforehand using eq.
Figure 2: (Left) Number of training samples N vs performance (relative L2 error) for neural operators evaluatedon the KdV equation With s=1024. For N V 1000, each smaller dataset is sampled uniformly randomly 5times from the complete dataset (N = 1000) and mean ± std.dev (shaded region) results are shown across thesampling experiments. (Right) Same analysis for KS equation With s=1024.
Figure 3: COVID19 Forecasting. Confirmed, Recovered, and Deaths count forecasting results for the 07/07/20一 07/13/20 (chosen arbitrarily) using previous 2 weeks as the input. The Pade Exp prediction and the bestnon-neural operator scheme from Table 3 (seq2seq) is shown. Top row: Most populous US state California withpopulation 39.77 M (2018 census). Bottom row: Same results for Massachusetts with a moderate population of6.89 M.
Figure 4: Polynomials degree p, q grid variation for [p∕q] Pade neural model of Figure 1. The performance isevaluated on the KdV equation with s=1024.
Figure 5: Relative L2 error when Pade model trained and tested on different (p, q). (Left) The KdV data usingpp, qq “ p5, 6q for training and other pp, qq for testing. (Right) The KdV data using pp, qq “ p4, 2q for trainingand other pp, q) for testing. For each plot, the Orange/Green color denotes best performance (lowest value) inthe corresponding row/column, respectively.
Figure 6: Relative L2 error vs epochs for MWT Leg With differentThe numerical values for the training number of OP basis k.
Figure 7: MultiWavelet Pade Exponential Model. The Pade exponential neural operator from Figure 1 is usedin the skeleton of the multiwavelet transform based neural operator model. The inputs and outputs are recursivelyupdated using the decomposition cell (Left) and reconstruction cell (Right).
Figure 8: COVID-19 Forecasting. The Pade ExP prediction and the best non-neural operator scheme fromTable 3(seq2seq)is shown. (Top 3 rows) Prediction for the week 06/12/20 - 06/18/20 using previous 2 weeksdata. This week is the test sample with least MAE averaged across Confirmed, Recovered, and Death countsfor Pade Exp; or the test sample with best averaged prediction. Next, row 1-3 are US states in the orderof best-middle-worst averaged prediction for this test sample. (Bottom 3 rows) Same analysis for the week03/07/21 - 03/13/21 which is having largest MAE, or the test sample with worst averaged prediction. Similarly,row 4-6 are US states in the order of best-middle-worst averaged prediction for this worst test sample. Themissing values are substituted with zeroes which is one of the reason for higher errors.
