Figure 1: Left: The difference between a hypergraph and clique-expanded graph. Right: Illustrationof our AllSet framework for the hypergraph depicted on the left. Included is an example on theaggregation rule for hyperedge b and node 4. The key idea is that fV→E and fE→V are two multisetfunctions, which by definition are permutation invariant with respect to their input multisets.
