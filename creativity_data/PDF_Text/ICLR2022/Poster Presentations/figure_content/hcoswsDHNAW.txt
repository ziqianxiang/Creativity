Figure 1: Comparison between AdvProp and Fast AdVProp. (a) AdvProp generates a paired adversar-ial image (with color orange) for each clean image (with color blue) in the sampled batch, thereforeincurring heavy training cost. Moreover, in addition to clean images, adversarial images are also fedinto networks for training, therefore further increasing the total training cost, i.e., 2x data is usedhere compared to the vanilla training. (b) Different from AdvProp, Fast AdvProp only uses a smallportion of the sampled batch to generate adversarial examples. Moreover, during the generation ofadversarial images, the gradient calculation of input images and the gradient calculation of networkparameters are merged into the same forward and backward pass as in (Shafahi et al., 2019; Zhanget al., 2019), therefore making generating adversarial examples for “free”.
