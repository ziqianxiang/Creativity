Figure 1: Overall pipeline of Hindsight. The pipeline is divided into four parts: (a) SQuaSHcomputation; (b) endowing the LiDAR scan by querying from SQuaSH; (c) detection with the en-dowed scan; (d) pre-computing SQuaSH off-line for deployment. The coloring on points in theendowed scan (the bottom-center and -right figures) means we endow history features in Rdhistory toeach of the points. Please refer to section 3 for definitions of the symbols. Best viewed in color.
Figure 2: Precision-recall curves for Pedestrianof PointRCNN with and without Hindsight,under metric BEV IoU=0.5 in 0-80m.
Figure 3: Qualitative visualization of detection results. We visualize two randomly picked scenesin the Lyft test set, and plot the detection results from the base detector (PointRCNN) with andwithout Hindsight on LiDARs (upper) and images (bottom, not used in detection). Ground-truthbounding boxes are shown in green, base and Hindsight detections are shown in yellow and cyan.
