Figure 1: Categorical distribution of noisy labels on CIFAR-100N (most imbalanced 6 super-classes):the red line in each subplot indicates that the number of each clean fine class is 500.
Figure 2: Top 3 wrongly annotated fine labels in selected fine classes. For “pine tree”, “shrew”,“streetcar”, the dominant class is the wrong class. The corresponding number of correct annotationsare highlighted with red lines.
Figure 3: Transition matrix of CIFAR-10N noisy labels (color bar is log-norm transformed).
Figure 4: Exemplary CIFAR-100 training images with multiple labels. The text below each picturedenotes the CIFAR-100 clean label (first row) and the human annotated noisy label (second row).
Figure 5: Illustration of noise transitions of human-level label noise and the synthetic version. Wedivide the representations of images from the same true class into 5 clusters by k-means. Therepresentations come from the output before the final fully-connected layer of ResNet34. The modelis trained on clean CIFAR-10. Negative cosine similarity measures the distance betWeen features.
Figure 6: Memorization of clean/correct and wrong labels on CIFAR-10N and synthetic noise withsame T: red line denotes the percentage of memorized (wrongly predicted) samples, blue line denotesthat of correctly predicted ones.

Figure 12: Hypothesis testing results: We adopt two samples ({di1)}i∈[κ],ν∈[5] and {d(2)}i∈[κ],ν∈[5])student t-tests. The p-value and the significance level are shown for each class. Significance levelsare denoted as ‘ns’: p > 0.05; ‘*’: p ≤ 0.05; ‘**’: p ≤ 0.01; ‘***’: p ≤ 0.001; ‘****’: p ≤ 0.0001.
Figure 13: Hypothesis testing results of CIFAR-100N: We adopt two samples ({d(,1)}i∈[κ],ν∈[5] and{di(,2ν)}i∈[K],ν ∈[5] student t-tests. The (a) p-value and the (b) significance level are shown for eachclass. Significance levels are denoted as ‘ns’: p > 0.05; ‘*’: p ≤ 0.05; ‘**’: p ≤ 0.01; ‘***’:p ≤ 0.001; ‘****’: p ≤ 0.0001. When removed the class constraint, p = 5.2e-16 for the whole data.
