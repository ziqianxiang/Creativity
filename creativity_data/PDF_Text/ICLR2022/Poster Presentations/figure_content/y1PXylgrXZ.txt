Figure 1: Illustration of method. We propose an equilibrium equation which takes as input vpxqand interval bounds s(x), v(x), and Solvesjointly for z<, the standard output of the DEQ, as well asz<,Z<, interval upper and lower bounds on z‹.
Figure 2: Difficulties of IBP with depth. Left: error v.s. depth for IBP and standard train-ing. We train deeper models with IBP on CIFAR10 With e “ 急. We find that final certifiederror increases with the depth of the model. On the other hand, depth does not hurt when mod-els are trained and evaluated on standard clean error. This suggests that IBP performs particularlypoorly with depth. Right: convergence of interval bounds for standard MonDEQs and ourIBP-MonDEQ. We plot the the average over coordinates of Zk — Zk, where Zk ,zk denote boundscomputed by the k-th iteration of the equilibrium solver for (3.3). This quantity blows up for thestandard MonDEQ (Winston & Kolter, 2020) as the solver fails to find a fixed point. In contrast, thesolver converges with our IBP-MonDEQ parameterization. Implementation details are in Section B.
