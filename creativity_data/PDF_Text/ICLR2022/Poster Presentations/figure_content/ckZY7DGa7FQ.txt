Figure 1: A graphical model depicting the belief state modeling problem. The Markov vari-able Xt and an externally specified control variable Zt stochastically determine the next Markovvariable Xt+1. Each Markov variable Xt+1 stochastically determines the contemporaneous emis-sion variable Y t+1. The belief state modeling problem is to approximate the posterior P(Xt |Y 1, Z1, . . . , Y t) over the current Markov variable given all past and present emission variables andall past control variables.
