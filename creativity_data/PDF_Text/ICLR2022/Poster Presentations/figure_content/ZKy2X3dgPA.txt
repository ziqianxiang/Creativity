Figure 1: Metrix (= Metric Mix) alloWs an an-chor to interact With positive (same class), neg-ative (different class) and interpolated examples,Which also have interpolated labels.
Figure 2: “Positivity” of mixed embeddings vs.
Figure 3: Exploring the embedding space when using (a) only clean examples (b) clean and mixedexamples. Given a query q, the distance d to its nearest training embedding (clean or mixed) issmaller with mixup (b) than without (a).
Figure 4: Retrieval results on CUB200 using Contrastive loss, with and without mixup. For eachquery, the top-5 retrieved images are shown. Images highlighted in green (red) are correctly (incor-rectly) retrieved images.
Figure 5: Embedding space visualization of CUB200 test examples of a given number of classesusing ContraStiVe loss, with and without mixup.
Figure 6: Effect of mixup strength for different mixup types using contrastive loss and R-50 withembedding size d = 512 on Cars196. Recall@K (%): higher is better.
