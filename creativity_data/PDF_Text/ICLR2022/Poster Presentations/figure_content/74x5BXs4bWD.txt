Figure 1: The selected solutions by Pareto-based selection and clustering-based selection on a synthetic problem. Fig-ure 1(a) shows the behavior space, where the color of the heat map shows the quality of the solution. Figure 1(b) showsthe quality and diversity of each solution.
Figure 2:	The AntWall-v0 environment and the performance of different algorithms.
Figure 3:	Performance of different algorithms in four standard MuJoCo environments.
Figure 4: Visualization of the clusters in different iterations of EDO-CS under the AntWall-v0 environment.
Figure 5: Performance of EDO-CS equipped with different clustering algorithms.
Figure 6:	Performance of EDO-CS with different population sizes K, given the same number of iterations.
Figure 7:	Performance of EDO-CS under different archive sizes.
