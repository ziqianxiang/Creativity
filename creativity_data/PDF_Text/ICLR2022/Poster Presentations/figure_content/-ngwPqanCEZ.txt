Figure 1: Vertical Axis: Performance; HorizontalAxis: Latency. Diverse backbones with (solidsymbols) and without RASF (hollow symbols) areevaluated. RASF could be seamlessly pluggedinto any 3D deep learning pipeline to improveperformance across diverse downstream tasksand datasets, with little code modification andcomputation cost.
Figure 2: (a) Inference of RASF. The process to obtain shape embedding of P via RASF grid.
Figure 3: (a) RASF visualization in 3D and 2D. (b) Wegenerate multiple Ellipsoids by deformation along Z-Axis andsee their responses in RASF embeddings. Some channels havestrong correspondence to the ellipsoid curvature.
Figure 4: The predicted shapes and ground-truths duringthe reconstruction task.
Figure 5: Sensitivity analysis of RASFhyper-parameters.
Figure 6: Visualization of RASF weights. For each channel, We show the 3D visualization and the2D figure after max-pooling on the x-axis. It is observed that each channel focus on a different area,representing a particular local shape.
Figure 7: left: The input semi-ellipsoids with different curvatures. right: The visualization ofshape embeddings given three groups of semi-ellipsoids input. (a)(b)(c) are the three groups ofsemi-ellipsoids (deformed along three axes) with their corresponding shape embeddings. The shapeembeddings are arranged in order row by row. Each row represents one shape embedding. It isobserved that the response of several channels changes gradually from large curvature shapes tosmall curvature shapes.
