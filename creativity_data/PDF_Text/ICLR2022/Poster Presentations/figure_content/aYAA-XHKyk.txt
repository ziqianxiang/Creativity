Figure 1: (a) The unlabeled data distribution Pu and the positive class-conditional distribution Ppare given. (b) Assume that the latent negative class-conditional distribution Pn is fixed, i.e., 0.5Pnis shown by the green curve, and that the class-prior π is 0.5, i.e., Pu = 0.5Pn + 0.5Pp. (c) Theexisting distributional-assumption-free CPE methods will output 0.7 instead of 0.5 because theyalways output the maximum proportion κ* of Pu in Pp. (d) Applying the proposed ReCPE method, aauxiliary distribution Pp0 will be created and the existing CPE methods will output π0 = 0.49 insteadof 0.7 with input Pp0 and Pu instead of Pp and Pu.
