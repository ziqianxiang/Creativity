Figure 1: Steps of our method3.2	Clustering filters into groupsThe first step of our method is to cluster filters from the same convolutional layer into n equal-sizedgroups. Known that for a layer W` We have C'ut filters, there shall be CouJn filters inside eachequal-sized filter group. We denote Fi to be the i-th filter in W' (namely, Fi = Wo :.・]) fori ∈ {Z+ | [1, Cout]}. Filter clustering is a maturely adopted technique in network pruning since itis a widely accepted assumption that when similar filters are clustered together, the representationpower of some filters can be covered by the rest of the filters in the same group (which thereforeenables the potential of pruning). Additionally, this technique drastically decomposes the scope ofthe problem, as we may now proceed to evaluate in a group-by-group fashion instead of evaluatingall of the filters from Wo at the same time.
