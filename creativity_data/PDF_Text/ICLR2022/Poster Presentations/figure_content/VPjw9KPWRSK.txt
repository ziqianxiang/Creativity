Figure 1: Best viewed on screen. Qualitative results of our work. To the noisy measurements (1stfrom left), we apply an extended Kalman smoother (2nd). From the noisy measurements, we learna recurrent model that does slightly better (3rd). Our recursive model combines expert knowledgewith inference (4th), yielding the best result. Ground truth provided for comparison (5th).

Figure 3: Our recursive model visualized. Data-Point yk is fed, together with hidden state h→,into a GRU unit. The new hidden state h→+ι is decoded into multiplicative component Fk+ι andadditive component ek+ι. Using these, the previous posterior mean Xk∣≤k is transformed into theprior estimate for time-step k + 1 Xk+ι≤k. y^+ι is used to obtain posterior mean Xk+ι∣≤(k+i).
Figure 4: Considers the linear dynam-ics experiment (section 8.1). The meansquared error on the test set (lower isbetter) as a function of the number ofexamples.
Figure 5: Considers the Lorenz experiment (sec-tion 8.2). The mean squared error on the test set (loweris better) as a function of the number of examples usedfor training.
