Figure 2: A 3-layer neural network in the AL form required for AL learning. Red arrows: theinference path; green arrows: the objective function; blue arrows: gradient flow; orange arrows:appended functions not in BP; black arrows: preserved functions in BP. We stop the gradient flowfrom an AL layer i to its previous layer i - 1 to ensure each layer is trained in isolation.
