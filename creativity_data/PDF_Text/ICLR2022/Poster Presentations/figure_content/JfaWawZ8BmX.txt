Figure 1: Test error, bias, and variance as a function of the overparameterization ratio (φ∕ψ = n1 /m)and the alignment θ for the 2-scale LJSD (Eq. (10)) with φ = n0/m = 10/9, σ = tanh, γ = 10-8and σε2 = 1/100. (a) The total test error exhibits the characteristic double descent behavior for allshift powers. (b) The bias is a nonincreasing function of φ∕ψ for all shift powers, as in Proposition3.1. (c) The variance is the source of the peak, and is a nonincreasing function of φ∕ψ for all shiftpowers in the overparameterized regime, as in Proposition 3.2. Blue, orange, and green lines in (a,b,c)indicate locations of vertical and horizontal slices shown in (d,e,f). (d) 1D horizontal slices of (a,b,c)more clearly demonstrate the monotonicity in φ∕ψ predicted by Propositions 3.1 and 3.2. (e) 1Dvertical slices demonstrate the monotonicity in θ of the test error and the bias predicted by Proposition3.3, and illustrate that the variance may not decrease in response to stronger alignment (solid greentrace). (f) Test error, bias, and variance normalized by the training error (ie. E /μμ+谷=0); similarlyfor Bμ, Vμ). Same legend as (e). Constancy of the blue traces illustrates how the train and test errorrespond identically to alignment. Simulations for m = 4000 (d,e; crosses) agree well with formulas.
Figure 2: Sample-wise multiple descent for anisotropic data as a function of nonlinearity strengthω. An panels refer to a 3-scale covariance model With α = 103, and ψ = 2, s = P =1,γ = 10-13and σε2 = 10. (a) Error exhibits multiple peaks as a function of the the sampling density φ-1. Asω is increased, peaks are attenuated and eventually disappear in sequence starting from those dueto the Weakest data scales (at m = n0) to those due to the strongest data scales (at m = n0 /3). (b)Limiting spectral density of the kernel matrix K(X, X) = FTF/n1. Vertical slices correspond tothe spectral density at the corresponding value of φ-1 for ω = 10-10. Peaks in the error curvesin (a) occur at critical values m = 3 n0, 2 n0, n0 where a new spectral component first appears. (C)Consistent With this, sample-Wise learning curves exhibiting multiple descent at loW ω pass throughseveral transitions in the number of spectral components, while those at higher ω with fewer peakspass through fewer component transitions.
Figure 3: Strong anisotropy causes steep cliffs in the test error as a function of the overparameteri-Zationratio φ∕ψ = n1 /m. φ = 5/6, γ = 10-22, s = P = 1,ω = 10-16 and σ∣ = 10-4. Top row:d = 2-scale model with α = 10-5; bottom row: 3-scale model with α = 10-6. (a,b) Test errorexhibits the characteristic peak at the interpolation threshold, but additionally displays steep cliffsat critical values of n1 corresponding to multiples of n0 /d (b, dashed lines; m also shown). Theθ value associated to each trace is indicated by the colored ticks in (a). (c) Unlike the peak at theinterpolation threshold, cliffs in the error traces in (b) persist under optimal regularization (errorvalues from analytical formulas were numerically optimized over γ). (d) The spectrum of the kernelmatrix K(X, X) = nɪ- F> F undergoes a phase transition at each of the critical values of n1 where acliff occurs (dashed lines). The phase transition associated to the interpolation threshold at n1 = mis also visible in the lower panel, but is out of range (at ≈ 10-17) in the upper panel.
