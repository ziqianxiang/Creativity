Figure 1: Comparison of BATS and beam search over different translation budgets under differenttranslation objectives on the WMT2020 Chinese-English test set. Each column illustrates the BLEU(top) and the model score (bottom) obtained using the two decoders on a different objective.
Figure 2: Illustration of the issue with the search bias in beam search where the decoder can delay thegeneration of low probability words, in this case the word “technological” in order to generate highinitial scores. Edges scores correspond to the token level log probability log p(yi | y1, . . . , yi-1, x)and nodes scores correspond to the value that is assigned to the state using the normalised partialsum of probabilities Ej≤i logp(y+iy1α…，yj-1,x With α = 0.8. This example is obtained from the()WMT2020 test set.
