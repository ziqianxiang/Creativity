Figure 1: (Left) Histograms of the locations visited by SGD. With truncated heavy-tailed noises,SGD hardly ever visits the two sharp minima m1 and m3 . The objective function f is plotted at thebottom, and dashed lines are added as references for the locations of local minima. (Middle) Typicaltrajectories of SGD in different cases: (a) Heavy-tailed noises, no gradient clipping; (b) Heavy-tailednoises, gradient clipping at b = 0.5; (c) Light-tailed noises, no gradient clipping; (d) Light-tailednoises, gradient clipping at b = 0.5. The objective function f is plotted at the right of each figure,and dashed lines are added as references for locations of the local minima. (Right) First Exit Timefrom Ω2 = (-1.3,0.2). Each dot represents the average of 20 samples of first exit time. Each dahsedline shows a polynomial function ci /ηβ where β is predicted by Theorem 1 and ci is chosen to fit thedots. The non-solid green dot indicates that for some of the 20 samples of the termination threshold5 × 107 was reached, and hence, it is an underestimation. Results in (Left) and (Middle) are obtainedunder learning rate η = 0.001 and initial condition X0 = 0.3.
Figure 2: Typical transition graphs G under different gradient clipping thresholds b. (Left) Thefunction f illustrated here has 3 attraction fields. For the second one Ω2 = (si, s2), We haves2 - m2 = 0.9, m2 - s1 = 0.6. (Middle) The typical transition graph induced by b = 0.5. The entiregraph G is irreducible since all nodes communicate With each other. (Right) The typical transitiongraph induced by b = 0.4. When b = 0.4, since 0.6 < 2b and 0.9 > 2b, the SGD can only exitΩ2 from the left with only 2 jumps if started from m2. Therefore, on the graph G there are twocommunication classes: G1 = {m1, m2}, G2 = {m3}; G1 is absorbing While G2 is transient.
