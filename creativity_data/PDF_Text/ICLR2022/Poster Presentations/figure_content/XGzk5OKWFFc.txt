Figure 1: (a): The heatmap of the cross-attention weights for a false positive pair (Car vs. Truck).
Figure 2: The proposed CDTrans framework. It consists of three weight-sharing transformers fedby inputs from the selected pairs using the two-way center-aware labeling method. Cross-entropy isadopted to source branch (HS) and target branch (HT), while the distillation loss is applied betweensource-target branch (HS+T) and HT.
