Figure 1: Comparison of audio-visual embodied navigation in clean and complex environment.
Figure 2: Comparison of different problem modeling methods. AVN is models as an MDP. Ourmodel has an attacker intervention, while the SA-MDP model has an adversary that can map onestate in the state space to another state.
Figure 3: Sound adversarial audio-visual navigation network. The agent and the sound attacker firstencode observations and learn state representation St respectively. Then, St are fed to actor-criticnetworks, which predict the next action a? and aV. Both the agent and the sound attacker receivetheir rewards from the environment. The sum of their rewards is zero.
