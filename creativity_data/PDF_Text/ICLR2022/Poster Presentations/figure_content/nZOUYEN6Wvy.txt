Figure 1: OVERVIEW (a) We extend the concept of Granger causality, previously applied only to sequentiallyordered observations, to partial orderings, i.e., where the information flow can be described as a directed acyclicgraph (DAG). (b) GrID-Net, our approach for inferring Granger causality on a DAG-structured system, is agraph neural network framework with lagged message-passing (`, L, h are defined in Sec. 2.2). (c) To identifygenomic loci whose accessibility Granger causes the expression of a specific gene, we apply GrID-Net onmultimodal single-cell data where chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq) and gene expression (RNA-seq) havebeen profiled in the same cell. We model the lag between them by relating the RNA-seq readouts of a cellnot to the ATAC-seq readouts of the same cell but to ATAC-seq readouts of cells slightly earlier in the profiledbiological process, applying GrID-Net on a DAG constructed from the kNN graph of cells with edges orientedas per pseudotime. (d) GrID-Net leverages the biological intuition that the accessibility of a specific genomiclocus (ATAC-seq) precedes the binding of regulator proteins to the locus, thus Granger causing the expressionlevels for its targeted gene (RNA-seq) to be changed.
