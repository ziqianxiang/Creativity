Figure 1: Test and LOO losses (a,c) and accuracies (b, d) as a function of sample size n. We use a5-layer fully-connected NTK model on MNIST and CIFAR10.
Figure 2: Test and LOO losses (a, c) and accuracies (b, d) as a function of noise. We use a 5-layerfully-connected NTK model on MNIST and CIFAR10 with n = 20000.
Figure 3: (a) Train, Test and LOO losses (a) and accuracies (b) as a function of width. We use arandom feature model on binary MNIST with n = 5000.
Figure 4: Kernel rank rank(K) as a function of complexity. For (a) we use a depth 1 random featuremodel σ(Wx), W ∈ Rm×d, where complexity is measured through width m. In (b) and (c) weuse a random feature model of depth 2, σ(V σ(W x)), W ∈ Rm1 ×d and V ∈ Rm2×m1 . For (b) wevisualize the rank as a function of m1, where m2 = 120 fixed and in (c) as a function of m2, wherem1 = 10 fixed. We use MNIST with n = 100 samples.
Figure 5: Rank dynamics of K for the linearization kernel of fθ (x) = wT σ(Uσ(V x)) wherew ∈ Rm2, U ∈ Rm2 ×m1, V ∈ Rm1 ×d and σ is the ReLU non-linearity.
Figure 6: Test and LOO losses (a, c) and accuracies (b, d) as a function of depth L. We use fully-connected NTK model on MNIST and CIFAR10.
Figure 7: Test and LOO losses (a) and accuracies (b) as a function of sample width m. We use arandom feature model on binary MNIST with random labels.
