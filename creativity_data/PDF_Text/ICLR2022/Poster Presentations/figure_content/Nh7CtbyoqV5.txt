Figure 1: Illustration on toy 2d data showing potential advantage of Spectral Normalization beyondcentering and length normalization. After center and length normalization all points are on the unitcircle, centered at the origin, but may have uneven clustering. The addition of Spectral Normaliza-tion can disperse these clusters allowing improved alignment.
