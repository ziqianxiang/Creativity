Table 1: Comparison of computational requirements on a set of standard benchmark graphs. OOM indicatesruuning out of memory on a 16GB V100 GPU.
Table 2: Statistics of datasets used in our experiments.
Table 3: Performance measured in terms of classification accuracy along with standard deviations. Ourexperiments, marked as ?, are over 20 random dataset splits and model initializations. The other results are takenfrom previously published reports. OOM indicates running out of memory on a 16GB V100 GPU. We report thebest result for GCA out of the proposed GCA-DE, GCA-PR, and GCA-EV models.
Table 4: Comparison of BGRL and GCA for simple versus complex augmentation heuristics on four benchmarkgraphs. For GCA, we report the numbers provided in their original paper.
Table 5: Performance on the ogbn-arXiv task measured in terms of classification accuracy along with standarddeviations. Our experiments, marked as ?, are averaged over 20 random model initializations. Other results aretaken from previously published reports. OOM indicates running out of memory on a 16GB V100 GPU.
Table 6: Performance on the PPI task measured in terms of Micro-F1 across the 121 labels along with standarddeviations. Our experiments, marked as ?, are averaged over 20 random model initializations. Other results aretaken from previously published reports.
