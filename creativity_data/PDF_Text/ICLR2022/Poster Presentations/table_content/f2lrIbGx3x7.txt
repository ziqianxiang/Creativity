Table 1: Several existing attacks can be interpreted as instances of our Bayesian framework. Weshow prior and conditional distribution for corresponding losses that each attack uses.
Table 2: PSNR of reconstructed images using approximate Bayes optimal attack, and attacks basedon `2, `1, and cosine distance between the gradients. We confirm our theoretical results that Bayesoptimal attack performs significantly better when it knows probability distribution of the gradients.
Table 3:	ConvBig architecture.
Table 4:	ConvNet architecture. Our benchmark instatiation uses a width of 64.
Table 5: Attack using l2 distance metric on MNIST trained for 500 steps with and without usingstronger prior that takes into account that pixels should be in the [0, 1] range.
Table 6: Our attacks on heuristic defenses can be interpreted as instances of our Bayesian framework.
