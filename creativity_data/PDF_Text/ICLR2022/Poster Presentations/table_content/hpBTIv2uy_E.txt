Table 2: Results for the tested datasets: Mean accuracy (%) ± standard deviation. Boldfaced lettersshaded grey are used to indicate the best result, while blue shaded boxes indicate results within onestandard deviation of the best result. NA indicates that the method has numerical precision issue.
Table 3: Full dataset statistics: |e| refers to the size of the hyperedges while dv refers to the nodedegree.
Table 4: Running times for the best hyperparameter choice: Mean (sec or hour) ± standard devia-tion.
Table 5: Average running times over all different choices of hyperparameters: Mean ± standarddeviation.
Table 6: Choice of hyperparameters for each method: lr refers to the learning rate, wd refers tothe weight decaying factor, h1 refers to the dimension of MLP hidden layer and heads refers to thenumber of attention heads. Remarkably, not all hyperparameters are used for some models. Forexample, MLP, CEGCN, HNHN, HGNN, HCHA and HyperGCN does not take heads as input.
