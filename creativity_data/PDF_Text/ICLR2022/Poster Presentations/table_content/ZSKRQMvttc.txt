Table 12: Wall-clock performance breakdown of a single training episode. The forward stage includessimulation, reward calculation, and observations. Backward includes the simulation gradient calculation andactor update. Critic training, which is specific to our method, is listed individually, and is generally a smallproportion of the overall training time.
