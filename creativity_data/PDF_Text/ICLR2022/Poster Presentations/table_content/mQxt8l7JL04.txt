Table 1: Precision at K retrieved images, i.e., P@K, averaged over the attributes. The best resultsamong unsupervised methods are colored red, while the second best results are colored blue.
Table 2: AverageS and Standard deviationS of the per-epoch runtimeS. 50,000 MNIST image trainingdata are uSed with 100 batch Size. For VAE, FMVAE, IRVAE, we uSe the 4 layerS of fully connectedneural networkS, and for FM, we uSe the RealNVP of depth 8.
Table 3: Averages and standard deviations of the condition numbers of the pullback metrics forVAE and IRVAE with respect to the latent space dimension. The lower the average and standarddeviations are, the more isometric the latent is.
Table 4: Single attribute retrieval results of Precision at 10, P@10 (for total 40 attributes). The bestresults among unsupervised methods are colored red, and the best results among all six methods aremarked bold.
