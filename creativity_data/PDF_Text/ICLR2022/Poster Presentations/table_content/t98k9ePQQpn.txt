Table 1: Comparison on the top-1 accuracy with post-hoc correction methods on CIFAR-100-LT dataset using ResNet-32 backbone, ImageNet-LT and iNaturalist data set using ResNeXt-50-32x4d andResNet-50 backbones respectively. Better results are marked in bold, the small red font indicates theincrease in accuracy when our method is compared to Logit Adjustment and RIDE. ’-’ means theresults are not reported. CE indicates that a cross-entropy loss function is used in the training stage.
Table 2: Comparison on the top-1 accuracy with state-of-the-arts on CIFAR-100-LT data set usingResNet-32 backbone, on ImageNet-LT and iNaturalist data set using ResNeXt-50-32x4d and ResNet-50 backbones respectively. - denotes the results are not reported, results underlined are the onesbeing compared, best results are marked in bold, the small red font denotes performance gain.
Table 3: Time for different methods to execute on the ImageNet-LT and iNaturalist data sets. Thetimes here are measured from the start of each method to the final best performance. Their runningtime are counted in seconds. Coupled with the prior results, an observation can be made that OT canbe the best coordinate to trade off performance and efficiency in post-hoc correction methods.
Table 4: KL distance between refined probability distribution and target distribution computed onImageNet-LT and iNaturalist data sets. Smaller distance indicates two distributions are more similar.
Table 5: Comparison of classification performance (bACC/GM) on CIFAR-100 with imbalancedratio R = 20, We report standard deviation and mean values for each evaluation metric. Better resultsare marked in bold.
