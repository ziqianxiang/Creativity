Table 1: Performance and activation sum of detection baseline, regression baseline, and regression baselineadded KLDiv loss with different σs. When σ = 0.5, 1, the results are not improved but even worsened. Whenσ= 2, the spread of heatmaps is smoothed and the results even exceed detection baselines.
Table I: Results of the Pearson Chi-square test between distribution of heatmap H and Gaussiantemplates T with different window size s and standard deviation σ in hard cases. σ = 5 is the best-matching template for both detection and regression. σ stops at 5 as the Gaussian templates withsize 8 become similar after.
Table II: Results of the Pearson Chi-square test between distribution of heatmap H and Gaussiantemplates T with different window size s and standard deviation σ in medium cases. For detection,best matched σ should be between 3 and 4; while for regression, optimal σ in medium case shouldbe between 1 and 2.
Table III: Results of Pearson Chi-square test between distribution of heatmap H and Gaussian tem-plates T with different window size s and standard deviation σ in easy cases. Accordingly, fordetection, σ should be approximately 2.5; while for regression, optimal σ should be between 0.5and 1.
Table IV: (a) Performance of the integral model adding different priors with different weight ratioswp : λwi . The performance depends largely on different σs, but less influenced with reasonablechange. (b) Ratio of the gradient magnitudes of combined model (integral+σ = 2) with differentweight ratios wp : λwi. The gradient ratio decreases over the course of training. After epoch 10, thegradient ratio is around the same scale or smaller.
Table V: Localization extent and performance of divided localized samples versus dispersed sam-ples. The extent of localization largely depends on the added prior. With an optimal σ = 2 chosen,the previously localized heatmaps have been dispersed with improved performance.
