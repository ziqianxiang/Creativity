Table 3: A list of nas methods papers (i.e. excluding, e.g. review or benchmark papers) published in the pastyear in top machine learning conferences. Cells-based means the work demonstrates at least one part of themajor results in the darts cell-based search space and/or highly related ones (such as the various NAS-Benchesand/or those otherwise highly resemble DARTS). Cells-only means the works only demonstrate the results inaforementioned search space(s). Whenever a paper is not cell-based or cells-only, other spaces evaluated showsthe alternative spaces the papers report results on. The list is potentially incomplete, as we only select papersthat explicitly mention nas in the title and/or the abstract.
