Table 1: Context FID-scores (lower is better) of PSA-GAN and baselines. We score 5120 randomlyselected windows and report the mean and standard deviation.
Table 2:	NRMSE accuracy compari-son of data augmentation experiments(lower is better, best method in bold).
Table 3:	NRMSE accuracy compari-son of forecasting experiments (loweris better, best method in bold). Meanand 95% confidence intervals are ob-tained by re-running each method fivetimes. DeepAR-C and PSA-GAN-Cuse the same 64 previous values as con-text. Among GAN models PSA-GANand PSA-GAN-C perform best.
Table S1: Pearson and Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient between the Context-FID scoreand NRMSE for different datasets. These results suggest that low Context-FID scores indicate lowerror in forecasting and therefore Context-FID could be a useful score to develop GAN models in thetime series domain.
Table S2: NRMSE of far-forecasting experiments with NBEATS as the forecasting model (lower isbetter). Mean and confidence intervals are obtained by re-running each method ten times.
Table S3:	NRMSE accuracy comparison of data augmentation experiments (lower is better) usingNBEATS as the forecasting model. Mean and 95% confidence intervals are obtained by re-runningeach method five times.
Table S4:	NRMSE of far-forecasting experiments with Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) as theforecasting model (lower is better). Mean and confidence intervals are obtained by re-running eachmethod ten times.
