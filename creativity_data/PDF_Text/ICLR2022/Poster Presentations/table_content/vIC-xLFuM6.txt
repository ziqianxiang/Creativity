For FFN (ours), we replace the first layer in the MLP a learned Fourier featureslayer (LFF). If d is the input dimension, both MLP and FFN have [40 Ã— d, 1024, 1024] as hiddendimension for each of their layers. Note that in the actor, d = observation dimension whereas in thecritic, d = observation dimension + actor dimension.
