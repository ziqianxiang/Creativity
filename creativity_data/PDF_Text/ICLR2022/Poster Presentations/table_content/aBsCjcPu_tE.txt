Table 1: SDEdit outperforms all the GAN baselines on stroke-based generation on LSUN (bed-room). The input strokes are created by human users. The rightmost two columns stand for thepercentage of MTurk workers that prefer SDEdit to the baseline for pairwise comparison.
Table 2: SDEdit outperforms all the GAN base-lines on both faithfulness and realism for stroke-based image generation. The input strokes aregenerated with the stroke-simulation algorithm.
Table 3: Image compositing experiments on CelebA-HQ. The middle two columns indicate the per-centage of MTurk workers that prefer SDEdit. We also report the masked LPIPS distance betweenedited and unchanged images to quantify undesired changes outside the masks. We observe thatSDEdit is able to achieve realistic editing while being more faithful than the baselines, beating thebaseline by up to 83.73% on overall satisfaction score by human evaluators.
Table 4: We compare SDEdit with baselines quantitatively on LSUN-church dataset on stroke-based generation. “# of colors” denotes the number of colors used to generate the synthetic strokepaintings, with fewer colors corresponding to a less accurate and less detailed input guide (seeFig. 9). We observe that SDEdit consistently achieves more realistic and more faithful outputs andoutperforms the baselines across all setups.
Table 5: Attribute classification results with simulated stroke inputs on CelebA. SDEdit (VP) out-performs all baseline methods in all attribute selected in the experiment. Details can be found inAppendix E.2.
