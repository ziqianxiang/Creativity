Table 1: Comparison with baselines. * means the training image resolution is 256 X 256.
Table 2: The results on a wide range of image synthesis tasks. f means the condition C is 1 in the studentgenerator and 0 in the student discriminator. âˆ£ means We remove the semantic diversity loss (Eq. 7) from finalobjective (Eq. 8). Left: text-to-image. Middle: audio-to-image. Right: semitic segmentation (SS) to image.
