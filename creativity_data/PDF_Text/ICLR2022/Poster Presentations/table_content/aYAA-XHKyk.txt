Table 1: Absolute estimation errors on real-world datasets. The first column provides the names of thedatasets and sample size. We bold the smaller average estimation errors by comparing each baselinemethod with its regrouped version. The smallest average estimation error among all methods foreach row is highlighted with *. The last row is obtained by averaging the results of all experiments.
