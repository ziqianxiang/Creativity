Table 1: Performance comparison of OCS and other baselines on balanced and imbalanced continual learning.
Table 2: Performance comparison of OCS and other baselines on varying proportions of noise instances duringnoisy continual learning. We report the mean and standard-deviation of the average accuracy (Accuracy) andaverage forgetting (Forgetting) across five independent runs. The best results are highlighted in bold.
