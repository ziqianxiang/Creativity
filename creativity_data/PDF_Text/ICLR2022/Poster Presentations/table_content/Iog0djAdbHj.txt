Table 3: Quantitative comparison of generalization performance for ResNet18 self-distillation(mean value of 5 runs). Refer to Table 6 for detailed results.
Table 4: The influence of temperature in self-distillation on CIFAR10/100 dataset.
Table 5: The influence of the smoothing factor in FilterKD on CIFAR100 (mean of 3 runs). Forcomparison, OHT obtained 77.64.
Table 6: Each run of results in Table 3. In each run, the initialization of student networks for differentmethods are controlled to be the same.
