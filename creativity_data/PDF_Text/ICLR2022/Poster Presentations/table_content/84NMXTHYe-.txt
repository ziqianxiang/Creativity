Table 1: Ablation Table. Deactivating the components of ETP one at a time equates it to state-of-the-art methods. We curate ENP as a surrogate for the Attentive NP (ANP) of (Kim et al., 2019), whichrequires test-time context, and an improved NP variant with reduced estimator variance thanks to π .
Table 2: Quantitative results on five data sets showing mean ± standard deviation across 10 repetitions.
Table 3: The neural network architectures used for the FMNIST, CIFAR10, and SVHN data set withReLU activations between the layers.
Table 4: Quantitative results of models on the FMNIST-C, CIFAR10-C and SVHN-C test datasetusing the LeNet5. The table below reports mean ± three standard deviations.
