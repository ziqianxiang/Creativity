Table 1: Comparison with prior works on Class-IL and Domain-IL settings. The baseline results arefrom Buzzega et al. (2020a) (- indicates the experiments that the authors were unable to run).
Table 2: Comparison with prior works on MNIST-360 test set. The baseline results are from Buzzegaet al. (2020a).
Table 3: Comparison with prior works on GCIL-CIFAR-100 dataset.
Table S1: CLS-ER components performance analysis for each of the experimental setting.
Table S2:	Comparison of CLS-ER with Mean-ER (single semantic memory) on Class-IL andDomain-IL settings. We report the mean and 1 std of 10 runs with different initializations.
Table S3:	The effect of different hyperparameter settings on the individual components of CLS-ERtrained on S-CIFAR-10 with 500 buffer size. For all the experiments αS and αP are fixed to 0.999and the performance is averaged over 3 runs with different initialization.
Table S4: The hyperparameters used for each of the experimental settings for CLS-ER.
Table S5: The hyperparameters used for DER++ on GCIL-CIFAR-100 experiments. CLS-ER usesthe same hyperparameters for both Uniform and Longtail settings (Table S4).
Table S6: The hyperparameters used for each of the experimental settings for Mean-ER.
