Table 1: Exclusion and Inclusion AUCs. Evaluation of each method on the basis of Exclusion AUC (loweris better) and Inclusion AUC (higher is better) calculated using top-1 accuracy. Parentheses indicate 95%confidence intervals, and the best methods are bolded in each column.
Table 3: FastSHAP ablation results. The distance to the ground truth Shapley values is displayed for severalFastSHAP variations, showing that normalization helps and that the penalty is unnecessary.
Table 4: Exclusion and Inclusion AUCs calculated using the average log-odds of the predicted class.
