Table 1: Wall-clock comparison (time to 5000 iterations). hmws is faster in terms of absolute time to reach afixed number of iterations regardless of the setting of the number of likelihood evaluations. Note that hmws iseven able to run with higher number of samples (e.g, K(M + N) = 72), unlike RWS - which fails to run due tocomputationally prohibitive memory requirements.
Table 2: Comparison of GPU memory consumption. hmws is more memory-efficient than rws over arange of hyperparameter settings. Note that hmws is even able to run with higher number of samples (e.g,K * (M + N) = 72), unlike rws - which fails to run due to computationally prohibitive memory requirements.
