Table 1: FID and IS scores for DDSS against baseline methods for a DDPM trained on CIFAR10with the Lsimple objective proposed by (Ho et al., 2020). FID scores (lower is better) are the numbersat the left of each entry, and IS scores (higher is better) are at the right.
Table 2: FID /IS scores for DDSS against baseline methods for a DDPM trained on ImageNet 64x64with the Lhybrid objective proposed by Nichol & Dhariwal (2021).
Table 3: FID / IS scores for the KID kernel ablation on CIFAR10. When not learning the timesteps,We fix them to a quadratic stride, as Table 1 shows this performs best on CIFAR10.
Table 4: FID / IS scores for the DDSS search space ablation on CIFAR10. All runs fix the timestepsto a quadratic stride and use a linear kernel except for the last row (we only include the GGDMresults for ease of comparison).
