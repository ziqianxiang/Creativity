Table 1: Evaluation of sample probing with multiple generative GZSL models on four bench-mark datasets. Each row pair shows the effect of adding sample probing to a particular generativeGZSL model, using ESZSL as the closed-form probe model. We use the same hyper-parameteroptimization policy in all cases to make results comparable. We observe h-score improvements atvarying degrees in 17 out of 19 model, feature & dataset variations.

Table 3: ZSL vs GZSL based sample probing losses (using TF-VAEGAN and ESZSL).
Table 4: Comparison of mean per-class Frechet Distance between real and generated unseen classsamples on CUB, AWA and FLO datasets for TF-VAEGAN and Our approach. Lower is better.
Table 5: Comparison against state-of-the-art generative model based GZSL on CUB, FLO,SUN and AWA datasets. Results obtained with the proposed features are reported, together withthe results obtained with fine-tuned features under fine-tuned (FT). The results are reported in termsof top-1 accuracy of unseen (u) and seen (s) classes, together with their harmonic mean (H).
