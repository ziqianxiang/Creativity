Table 1: Performance of competing algorithms on real World datasets. For Proximity, loWer is better.
Table 2: Performance of the underlying classifiers.
Table 3: Counterfactual examples on German dataset.
Table 4: Performance of competing algorithms on nonlinear classifiers. The current validity is thevalidity of counterfactual plan with respect to the current nonlinear classifier Cnl (i.e., the fractionof instances that the generated CoUnterfactUal plan is feasible).
