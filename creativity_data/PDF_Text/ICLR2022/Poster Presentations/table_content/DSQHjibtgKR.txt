In particular, we considerthree Euclidean data sets, a) Twitter (Chan et al.), b) Adult (Dua & Graff, 2017), and c) Non-Uni (Cebecauer & Buzna, 2018) which are datasets consisting of numeric features in Rd and thedistance is measured by `2, and one graph dataset, US-PG (Rossi & Ahmed, 2015) which representsUS power grid in a graph, where the points are vertices in a graph and the distance is measured by theshortest path distance. The opening cost is non-uniform in Non-Uni dataset, while it is uniform inall the other three. These datasets have also been used in previous papers that study facility locationand related clustering problems (Chierichetti et al., 2017; Chan et al., 2018; Cohen-Addad et al.,2019). A summary of the specification of datasets can be found in Table 1.
