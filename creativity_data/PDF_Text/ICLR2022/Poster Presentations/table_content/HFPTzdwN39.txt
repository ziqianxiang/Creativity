Table 4: Evaluation of selected IN-1k-pretrained methods on the Places-365 dataset. K-means(K = {500, 1000}) and the reverse probe are trained on features extracted on Places-365.
Table 5: Summarization of expert models and datasets used in our work for concept extraction.
Table 6: Evaluation of self-labelling methods. “Self-label” denotes clusters which are predicteddirectly from the model and which are used to train the reverse probe. We compare these to theclusters obtained with K-means on the representation vectors (as in the main paper). K = 3000 forSeLa and K = 1000 for SCAN to match the number of pseudo-labels predicted by the respectivemodels.
