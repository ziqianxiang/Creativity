Table 1: “IT”, “SF” respectively indicate if the method-in-question requires an iterative pruning ora special fine-tuning procedure. “FB” is the fine-tuning budget of each method (in terms of # ofepochs). “BA” represents the pre-pruned network’s accuracy. A cell with “-” implies either suchinformation is inapplicable or we failed to confidently identify such information. Methods notedwith are replicated by Wang et al. (2021), the rest are drawn from their original papers. Thepruning rates (PR) of our method are adjusted to meet the JParams or JFLOPs of other methods.
