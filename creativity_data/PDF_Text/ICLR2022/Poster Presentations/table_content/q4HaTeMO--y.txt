Table 1: Summary of experimental results. Shown are average log test losses ± one “sample stan-dard deviation” of the logarithm taken at the best performing spectral norm. The spectral norm gridwas as described in the main text. If NaNs or Infs were observed, these were replaced by the maxi-mum before the average and variance were recorded. # failed indicates the number of NaNs and Infsobserved over the full grid. Due to training instability causing NaN and Infs data points, especiallyin randomly initialised models, the average and “sample standard deviation” are not true unbiasedestimators. kGLM initialisation shows superior performance, both in terms of average performanceand number of failed runs.
Table 2: KLR and the equivalent DEQ agreed on all 784 pixels of 60000 examples in the trainingset except for the 11 examples above. In these cases, the predicted posterior probabilities were veryclose to borderline.
