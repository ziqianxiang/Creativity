Table 1: Our results compared to existing theoretical algorithms. ∆E (∆V ) denotes the maximumnumber of triangles incident to any edge (vertex), and κ denotes the arboricity of the graph.
Table 2: Datasets used in our experiments. Snapshot graphs are a sequence of graphs over time (thelength of the sequence is given in parentheses) and temporal graphs are formed by edges appearingover time. The listed values for n (number of vertices), m (number of edges), and T (number oftriangles) for Oregon and CAIDA are approximated across all graphs. The Oregon and CAIDAdatasets come from Leskovec & Krevl (2014); Leskovec et al. (2005), the Wikibooks dataset comesfrom Rossi & Ahmed (2015), the Reddit dataset comes from Leskovec & Krevl (2014); Kumar et al.
