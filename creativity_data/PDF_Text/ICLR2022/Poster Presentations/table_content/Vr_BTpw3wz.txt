This free-form open-QA taskis one-to-one but more challenging than other extractive open-domain QA datasets. The dataset is asubset of MS-MARCO questions whose answers were reviewed by a separate editor and rewrittenif they had a high overlap with one of the provided passages (indicating that the original editor mayhave copied the passage directly). These “well-formed answers” are meant to be complete sentences(such as can be read out by a conversational assistant) and are long (median length 11 words). Theinput for this task is a query x, the output is a well-formed answer y, and the models can retrievefrom the MS-MARCO passage collection (8.8 million web passages). The public benchmark andthe test set is no longer available for evaluation. Instead we split the public validation set into avalidation and test set and show results on the test set.
Table 2: Groundedness evaluation: Our method ELBOLOSS (α = 0.25, 0.5) shows more overlapbetween generated output and the retrieved passage than MarginalizedLoss and for the Wizardof Wikipedia dataset the gap increases as we consider the maximum over top-5 passages. (Novel-F1:discounts commonly occurring words and context words (x)).
