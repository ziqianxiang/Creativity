Table 1: Parity labeling results in six methods. The cosine similarity is computed between theground-truth Pj∈A Mj and the closest neuron weight.
Table 2: Interval labeling results in six methods.
Table 3: Results of six methods for different input data dimensions. The cosine similarity is computedbetween the ground-truth Pj∈A Mj and the closest neuron weight.
Table 4: Results of six methods under different negative class ratios.
Table 5: Results of six methods for different sample size.
Table 6: Gaussian mixture setting.
Table 7: Cosine similarities between the gradients in the early steps. We choose the neuron weight clos-est to the average weight of the green cluster at the end of the training (in Figure 20 for ResNet(128)and Figure 21 for ResNet(256)). We record the gradients of the first 30 steps and divide them tothree trunks of 10 steps evenly and sequentially. For the three trunks, we get the average gradientsvι,v2,v3. We calculate their cosine similarities to their average v = (vι + v2 + v3)/3 and thosebetween them.
