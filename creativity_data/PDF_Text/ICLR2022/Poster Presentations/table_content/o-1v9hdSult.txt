We used a within-subject study design where the participants were shownan explanation generated by our method along with a simple baseline. Precondition case involvedpointing out the failing action and the state it was executed and for the cost case the exact cost of ex-ecuting each action in the foil was presented. The users were asked to choose the one they believedwas more useful (the choice ordering was randomized to ensure the results were counterbalanced)and were also asked to report on a five-point Likert scale the completeness of the chosen explana-tion (1 being not at all complete and 5 being complete). For precondition, we collected 5 responsesper each Montezuma foil, and for cost we did 10 per each sokoban variant (40 in total). Table 1a,presents the summary of results from the user study and supports H1. In fact, a binomial test showsthat the selections are statistically significant with respect to α = 0.05.
