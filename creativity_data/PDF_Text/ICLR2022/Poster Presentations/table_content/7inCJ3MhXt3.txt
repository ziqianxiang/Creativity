Table 1: DataSet StatiSticSDataset	Adult	Mushroom	Shuttle	Magic	Letter	CovertypeInput Dimension	2×15	2 ×23	7 X 9	2×12	16 × 26	54 × 7We present the experiment results of the classification problem on UCI datasets,MagicTelescope, letter and covertype. The experiment Setting and grid SearchSetting for parameter tuning are the Same aS deScribed in Section 5. For dataSetS letter andcovertype, only the reSultS of NeuralUCB and NeuralTS with diagonal approximation arereported aS the required GPU memory for the calculation of matrix inverSe, together with theneural model update, exceedS the Supported memory of the NVIDIA GEFORCE RTX 2080graphical card. Similar obServationS are obtained for theSe three dataSetS. Compared to the linearcontextual modelS, the neural contextual bandit algorithmS Significantly improve the performancewith much lower regret (miStakeS on claSSification). NPR Showed conSiStently better performanceto the beSt neural bandit baSelineS. And due to itS perturbation-baSed exploration Strategy, noextra computational reSourceS are needed, which makeS it more practical in real-world problemS,eSpecially large-Scale taSkS.
