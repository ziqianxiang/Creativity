Table 1: The mean and standard deviation of the ELBO and structure recovery metrics. NES outperforms the five different baselines in terms of structure recovery and presents a negligible standard deviation, which reflects its robustness.

However, frequently, we only have access to individual trajectories without knowl-edge of the underlying interactions. The Neural Relational Inference (NRI) model [23], which webase on, is designed to infer these interactions purely from observational data. NRI takes the formof a VAE, where the encoder produces a distribution over the space of interaction structures giventhe component trajectories, and the reconstruction is based on graph neural networks.
Table 2: Unlabeled attachment scores for unsupervised domain adaptation. The column name represents thesetup where the treebank is set to be the target domain. For each of the two tasks, NES achieves the best UASperformance on 5 out of the 6 target domains.
Table 3: ELBO as a function of the neural network size and N. The values in the “Growth in N” columnexpress the percent of additional NES samples (with respect to the preceding step) needed to achieve thebaseline performance.
