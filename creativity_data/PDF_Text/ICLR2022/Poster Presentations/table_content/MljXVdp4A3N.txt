Table 3: AGILE, baseline and ablations: Hyperparameters for additional componentsD.3 Hyperparameter TuningInitial hyperparameters are inherited from the prior works (PPO: Jain et al. (2020); CDQN: Chenet al. (2019a)). To ensure fairness across all baselines and our methods, we use the original hyperpa-rameters for the RL algorithms, such as learning rate, entropy coefficient, etc. (Table 4. We choosea sufficiently large number for total epochs (DQN) and total environment steps (PPO) to ensure allthe methods converge.
Table 4: Environment/Policy-specific HyperparametersBelow, we detail the hyperparameters and network variations searched specifically for the graphattention network (GAT) used in AGILE and its variants.
