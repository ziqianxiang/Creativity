Table 1: Comparison of neural vocoders in terms of MOS with 95% confidence intervals, real-timefactor (RTF) and model size in megabytes (MB) for inference. The highest score and the scores thatare not significantly different from the highest score (p-values ≥ 0.05) are bold-faced.
Table 2: Comparison of sampling acceleration methods with the same score network and the samenumber of steps. The highest score and the scores that are not significantly different from the highestscore (p-values ≥ 0.05) are bold-faced.
