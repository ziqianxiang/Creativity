Table 2: The table shows the number of solved statement in miniF2F when running the tidybaseline with different values of imax as well Lean’s built-in tidy tactic. All tidy baseline ex-periments are run with ωmax = 128, dmax = 8 using L + HL. Despite the tidy baseline beingdeterministic, it is still subject to per-tactic application timeouts, explaining the number 43 reportedon miniF2F-test for imax = 32.
Table 3: Baseline performance on Metamath and Lean. All proof searches are provided with a 128expansions budget. GPT-f attempts e = 16 tactics per expansion while the tidy baseline attemptse = 17 tactics per expansion (L + HL, see section 4.2.1). Reported proof lengths are averages overall the proofs found in each run. Note that the tidy baseline being deterministic, there is no pointattempting a proof search more than once.
