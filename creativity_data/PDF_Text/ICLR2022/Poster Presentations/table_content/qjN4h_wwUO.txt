Table 1: Test accuracy of different baselines and growing methods on different tasks. All results areaveraged over 3 random seeds (used for training).
Table 2: Average test accuracy when growing WRN-28 on CIFAR-10 with batch normalization andoutgoing weights set to zero. BN refers to batch normalization and inverse indicates that we set theoutgoing weights to zero. When the outgoing weights are set to zero, we use GradmaxOpt.
