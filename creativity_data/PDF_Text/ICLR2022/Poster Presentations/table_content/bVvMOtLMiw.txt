Table 1: Test error of DIVA Reweight to curate several fine-grain classification datasets. We use aResNet-34 pretrained on ImageNet as feature extractor and train a linear classifier on top of the lastlayer. Note that DIVA Reweight can improve performance even on curated and noiseless datasetswhereas other reweighting methods based on hard-coded rules may be detrimental in this case.
