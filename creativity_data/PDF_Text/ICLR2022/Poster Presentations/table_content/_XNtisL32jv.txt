Table 1: Comparison between SDT and TET.
Table 2: Comparison of SDT and TET with sig-moid function σ(k∙input). We fix the simulationlength to 4 and record the results of CNN-5 un-der three different k on CIFAR10.
Table 3: Compare with existing works. Our method improves network performance across all tasks.
Table 4: Accuracy of each moment’s membrane potential increment. We use LSDT or LTET to trainthe networks with simulation length 3 or 4. Then directly increase their simulation length to 8 andrecord each moment's potential increment test accuracy.
