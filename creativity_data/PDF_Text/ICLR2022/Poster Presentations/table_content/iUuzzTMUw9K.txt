Table 1: Quantitative comparisons at 2562. We calculate FID, KID×103, and the average renderingtime (batch size = 1). The 2D GAN (StyleGAN2 (Karras et al., 2020b)) results are for reference.
Table 2: (Left) FID, KID ×103 on images with 5122 and 10242 pixels. 2D GAN represents theStyleGAN2 (Karras et al., 2020b). (Right) We also compare the results of replacing 3 × 3 Convwith 1 × 1 and/or removing per-pixel noise injection for 2D models. We use bold font to representthe default setting for both our model.
Table 3: PSNR, SSIM and LPIPS scores between the images synthesized by 3D-aware generativemodels, and the corresponding pseudo targets generated by IBRNet (Wang et al., 2021).
Table 4: FID on the outputs from StyleNeRF trained with different upsampling operators.
