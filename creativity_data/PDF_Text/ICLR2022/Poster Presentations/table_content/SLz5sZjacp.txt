Table 1: Comparison of the permutation obtained withEM probing vs obtained with IoU matching (multi-dSprites, averaged across models). We report (i) per-centage of exactly matching permutations (ii) averagemismatch between both permutations.
Table 2: Projection along a third hierarchylevel (GENESIS, MdSprites).
Table 3: Experimental results (stderr. over three seeds, values in %). Models with (R) have nodisentanglement regularization. ARI/mSC is slightly higher (resp. lower) than prior work forMulti-dSprites (resp. CLEVR6,) because of minor differences in the data generation process. Atobject-level, we observe that disentanglement and completeness match closely, but this is not the caseat property-level, due to the asymmetry in the number of latent factors and slot dimensions.
Table 4: Ablation study of Algorithms 1 and 2 for Multi-dSprites. We report mean and std error overthree random seeds. All values are in %. 100 is the best possible score and 0 the worst, except for theinformativeness metric where 0 is best. All models are trained with full loss.
Table 5: Informativeness and Completeness per object property for all models trained with full losson Multi-dSprites.
Table 6: Informativeness and Completeness per object property for all models trained with full losson CLEVR6.
Table 7: Description of the factors of variation for each individual object in both datasets. For eachfactor, we give the set of possible values, as well as the exact locality constraints used in Algorithm 2.
