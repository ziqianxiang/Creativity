Table 1: Online fool rate of various online algorithms on non-robust models. For a given attack and value of k:• at least 97%, ∙ at least 95%, ∙ at least 90%, ∙ less than 90% of the optimal performance. * indicates whenthere is several best methods with overlapping error bars. Detailed results with error bars can be found in §E.1.
