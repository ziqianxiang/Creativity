Table 9: Evaluation of time complexity of SEAT. Here we use the number of Multiply-Accumulateoperations (MACs) in Giga (G) to measure the running time complexity. And we also compute theactual training time with or without the SEAT method using ResNet18 and WRN-32-10 on a singleNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 GPU.
