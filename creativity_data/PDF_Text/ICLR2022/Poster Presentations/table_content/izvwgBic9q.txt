Table 1: Quantitative results evaluated on OpenFWI in terms of MAE, MSE and SSIM. OurUPFWI yields comparable inversion accuracy comparing to supervised baselines. For H-PGNN+,we use our network architecture to replace the original one reported in their paper, and an additionalperceptual loss between seismic data is added during training.
