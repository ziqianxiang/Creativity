Table 1: MNIST-rot results. Test errors ± standard deviationsare averaged over six runs. Vanilla CNN is a solely translationequivariant model (G = {e}) with the same general architecture.
Table 2: STL-10 results, again over six runs. All modelsexcept the vanilla CNN use regular representations, seemain text for details.
Table 3: Mean squared test error for prediction of velocity and pressure of laminar flow arounddifferent objects.
Table 4: Relative equivariance errors for C16 on a test image, averaged over 10 random initializations of thelayer. As orientation, we also include non-equivariant (vanilla) convolutions.
Table 5: MNIST-rot results with restriction from D16 to C16 equivariance. Test errors ± standard deviationsare averaged over six runs. See main text for details on the models.
