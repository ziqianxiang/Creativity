Table 1: The minority class testing accuracy and the overall testing accuracy (the quantity in theparentheses) after 5000 communication rounds. If there are multiple minority classes, we reportthe worst of them. Here N, the number of devices, is 500. The base FL solver is Fed-Avg withpartial-participation: 100 devices participate in every communication round.
Table 2: The minority class testing accuracy and the overall testing accuracy (the quantity in theparentheses) after sufficiently many communication rounds. If there are multiple minority classes,we report the worst of them. Here N, the number of devices, is 100. The base FL solver is Fed-Avgwith full-participation: all devices participate in every communication round.
