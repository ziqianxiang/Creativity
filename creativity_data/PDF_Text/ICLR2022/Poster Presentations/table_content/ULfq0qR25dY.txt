Table S2: Comparison of existing baselines, S-protein peptides, and OptiVax-Robust peptide vaccinedesigns on various population coverage evaluation metrics. The rows are sorted by EvalVax-Robustp(n ≥ 1). Random subsets are generated 200 times. The binders used for generating random subsetsare defined as peptides that are predicted to bind with ≤ 50 nM to more than 5 of the alleles.
