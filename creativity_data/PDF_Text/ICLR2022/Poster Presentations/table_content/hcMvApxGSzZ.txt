Table 2: Performance of FNNS and its variants with different bpp rates. All values shown areaveraged over 100 images. We bold the lowest error rate numbers up to statistical significance. Notethat the 0.00 numbers are exactly zero.

Table 5: Performance of FNNS-D with auxiliary detection loss from SiaStegNet (You et al., 2020)trained on MS-COCO. The detection rate is measuring the number of steganographic images thatcan be detected as steganographic by SiaStegNet.

Table 8: Time in seconds for different methodsD	Unconstrained OptimizationAs we saw in Equation 1, we have two constraints- 1) to ensure that the pixels are between 0 and1 and 2) to ensure that no pixel changes by more than . We tried translating this optimizationproblem defined in Equation 1 to an unconstrained optimization problem by reparameterizing tocheck if unconstrained optimization yielded better results. Constraint 1 can easily be relaxed byreparameterizing X ∈ [0, 1]H ×W ×3 to Z ∈ RH×W×3 by applying an inverse sigmoid transformZ = σ-1 (X) and optimizing Z instead of Z. We can also relax the second constraint with aslightly more involved process by computing the softmax over the set of admissible pixel values.
