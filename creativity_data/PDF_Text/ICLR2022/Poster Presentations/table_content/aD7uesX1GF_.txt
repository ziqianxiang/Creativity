Table A.4: SAVi on MOVi with bounding box conditioning vs. unconditional SAVi with boundingboxes provided as supervision during the first fame via a matching-based loss. Evaluation on first 6video frames. Mean and standard error (10 seeds). All values in %.
Table A.5: SAVi encoder architecture for MOVi and CATER with 64 × 64 input resolution. ForMOVi++ with 128 × 128 input resolution, we use a larger input stride of 2 and 64 channels (numbersin parentheses).
Table A.6: SAVi decoder architecture for MOVi and CATER with 64 × 64 resolution. For MOVi++with 128 × 128 resolution, we use a larger output stride of 2 (numbers in parentheses).
Table A.7: SAVi initializer architecture for segmentation mask conditioning signals. We use the samearchitecture for all datasets. After the initial convolutional backbone, we perform a spatial average,followed by Layer Norm (Ba et al., 2016) and a small MLP, to arrive at the initial slot representations.
