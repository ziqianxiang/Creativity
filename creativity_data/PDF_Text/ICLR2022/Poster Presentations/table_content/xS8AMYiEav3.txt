Table 1: Comparing REASSURE with representative related works in terms of theoretical guarantees.
Table 2: Point-wise Repairs on MNIST. We use the first hidden layer as the repair layer for PRDNN.
Table 3: Area Repairs on HCAS. We use the the first hidden layer as the repair layer for PRDNN.
Table 4: Point-wise Repairs on ImageNet. PRDNN uses parameters in the last layer for repair.
Table 5: Watermark Removal. The test accuracy of the original DNN is 96.8%. #P: number of buggypoints to repair; ND(L∞), ND(L2): average (L∞, L2) norm difference on both training data andtesting data; NDP(L∞), NDP(L2): average (L∞, L2) norm difference on random sampled pointsnear watermark images; Acc: accuracy on test data.
Table 6: Area Repairs on HCAS. We use the the last hidden layer as the repair layer for PRDNN.
