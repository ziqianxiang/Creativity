Table 1: Results of CIFAR-10 classification with two-layer ReLU CNN architectures, with a3 × 3 kernel size, padding of 2, stride of 3, and averaging to 4 × 4 spatial dimensions, with(n, m1, β, bs, k, C, lr) = (5 × 104, 1024, 5 × 10-4, 250, 22, 10, 10-2). Consistent with our results onfully-connected architectures, the convex architecture matches or improves upon the performance ofthe non-convex architecture, verifying our theoretical results. We also observe the less pronouncedimpact of truncation in convolutional experiments.
