Table 1: Results on HICO dataset. Some methods requires extra supervision. Bbox/Pose meansobject-detection or Pose estimation is needed. All results are reported in mAP. * Results reportedin the original papers; tIntroduces the systematic split We use in the experiments. Full cls.: resultsreported on all 600 HOI categories; Unseen cls.: results reported on the held-out HOI categoriesfrom the training set for testing systematic generalization. Ext. superv.: extra supervision.
