COREG (Zhou & Li, 2005b) adopt two regressors(kNNs) learned by different distance metrics and predict unlabeled data on one regressor and usingthe most promising predictions to train the other one. Transductive Regression (Cortes & Mohri,2007) exploits local linear regression for unlabeled data, takes those with relatively close neighbors,

It contains 523.0K face images and the corresponding ages. Following thedata pre-process method of a recent work (Yang et al., 2021), we also filter out unqualified images,and manually construct balanced validation and test set over the supported ages. After splitting,there are 191.5K images for training and 11.0K images for validation and testing. For data-efficient

For data-efficientdeep regression, we construct 5 subsets with different label ratios including 1%, 5%, 10%, 20% and50%. For evaluation metrics, we use common metrics for regression, such as the mean-average-error(MAE) and another metric called error Geometric Mean (GM) (Yang et al., 2021) which is defined as(∏n=ιei) n1 for better prediction fairness, where ei is the prediction error of each sample i.
