Table 1: Linear classificationprotocol. We test several kindsof linear classifier and report theACC on ModelNet40. It isshown that RASF feature is morediscriminative than raw feature.

Table 3: Results on point clouds data of 3Dobjects. We compare performance on differentpoint-clouds-based backbones and downstreamtasks with and without RASF.
Table 4: Results on point clouds data of 3Dscenes (S3DIS). We compare performance onDGCNN with and without RASF.

In the scene segmentation task, where the point clouds contain richer andmore complex local geometry, RASF notably improves the result over DGCNN. It demonstrates thatRASF remains robust even when the downstream data distribution is thoroughly distinct from thepre-training data. With the additional shape embedding input, networks have a better understandingof the shape semantics than just using coordinates. RASF is able to generally boost the performanceunder various backbones and tasks with little memory and computation cost.
