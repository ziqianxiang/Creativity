Table 1: AUROC on RealNVP (higher is better). Our results are denoted by GOD1KS|GOD2KS.
Table 2: AUROC on RealNVP for point OOD detection (higher is better). Our results are denotedby R1|R2, where R1 corresponds to GOD1KS, and R2 corresponds to GOD2KS.
Table 4: Comparison in the sample and latent spaceswith noise. AUROCs are shown and segmented by |. Sdenotes detection in the sample space, while L-R andL-G denote detecting in the latent space using Real-NVP and Glow, respectively.
Table 3: Comparison in the sample andlatent spaces. AUROCs are shown andsegmented by |. S denotes detection inthe sample space, while L-R and L-Gdenote detecting in the latent space us-ing RealNVP and Glow, respectively.
Table 5: AUPR on RealNVP (higher is better). Our results are denoted by GOD1KS|GOD2KS.
Table 6: AUROC and AUPR on Glow (higher is better). Our results are denoted byGOD1KS|GOD2KS. Highest metrics are denoted in boldface, and failure cases (where metric isbelow 0.5) are underlined.
