Table 1: Test performance of different methods, where left table denotes the likelihood for MoG with varyingC (number of components), oracle is the likelihood of true parameters for the test data, and right denotes thetest accuracy for point cloud classification task With varying N (number of points).
Table 2: 5Way5shot and 5Way10shot classification accuracy (%) on CUB and miniImageNet, respectively,based on 1000 random trials. Here, (âˆ™) is the P-Value computed with two-sample t-test, and P-Value with blue(red) color means the increase (reduce) of performance when introducing POT loss.
Table 3: FID ] of images generated by different methods with varying unseen angles A on MNIST.
