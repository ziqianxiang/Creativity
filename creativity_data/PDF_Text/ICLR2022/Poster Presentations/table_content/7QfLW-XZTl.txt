Table 3: Molecular conformer generation for the GEOM-QM9 and GEOM-Drugs dataset. COVerage scorereports the percentage of reference conformers that are produced by the predicted ensemble. MISmatchingscore reports the percentage of generated conformers that can not be matched with any reference conformer.
Table S1: RMSD when training and evaluating our optimization models with random initialization instead ofRDKit+MMFF. The confidence interval is calculated from the inference with ten different initializations.
Table S2: The mean and standard deviation of the absolute errors of predicted ensemble properties. Unit: eV.

Table S5: Study of Model Ablation and Variation for Interaction Weight Parameterization. None refers to nointeraction prediction net; Per-layer v is an EGNN-like prediction net; Per-layer d and Per-block d directly takeintermediate atomic distances as inputs and perform prediction at each layer or each block separately.

Table S8: Ablation Study Comparing to EGNN. Tfm-BB denotes the transformer backbone. IW denotesinteraction weight, which is marked if per-block interaction weight is adopted, otherwise per-layer interactionweight is adopted. PS denotes parameter sharing. IU denotes parallel update.
Table S9: Ablation Study in Conformation Generation. Multi-step Eval means the model is trained to learnthe part optimization process and evaluated with multiple steps to achieve the entire optimization. EGNN-bbdenotes the model uses EGNN as the backbone. Non OT-Loss means the model is trained to minimize the L2loss between the generated conformers and their closest reference conformers, instead of using the optimaltransport loss.
