Table 1: Keypoint localization with different percentage of labeled images. We report mean andstandard deviation from three runs for different randomly sampled labeled subsets. Pseudo-labeling(PL) based methods are not evaluated for 100% of labeled data because there is no unlabeled datato generate pseudo-labels for. The results marked with ‘*’ are from (Moskvyak et al., 2020).
Table 2: Dataset 6: AnimalPose. Evaluation of generalization capacity to the target unseen animalclass. All results are obtained using the AlphaPose model (Fang et al., 2017) with ResNet-101 (Heet al., 2016) as the backbone. Results marked with ‘*’ are from Cao et al. (2019).

Table 4: Performance improvement of different keypoint localization methods by PLACL. Experi-ments are conducted on CUB-200-2011 dataset (5% labeled data) with PCK@0.1 as the metric.
Table 5: We randomly select different number of training images (#Images) for RL curriculumsearch, and re-train the keypoint networks with the searched curriculum on the full training set.
