Table 1: Comparisons of the MIG and DCI disentanglement metrics (mean ± std). A higher meanindicates a better performance. DisCo can extract disentangled representations from all threegenerative models, and DisCo on GAN achieves the highest score in almost all the cases, comparedto all the baselines. All the cells except for Flow are results over 25 runs.

Table 3: MDS comparison on facial attribute edit-ing. Our DisCo shows the best overall score forthe latent discovering task on FFHQ dataset.
Table 4: Ablation study of DisCo on the latentspaces, types of A, and our proposed techniques.
Table 5: Optimizer for DisCo.
Table 6: Ablation study on hyperparameter T. DisCo is not sensitive to T when T ≥ 0.9. ForT < 0.9, we may flip true hard negative and thus lead the optimization of Contrastive Loss collapse.
Table 7: Encoder E architecture used in DisCo. J is 32 for Shapes3D, MPI3D and Car3D.
Table 8: VAE’s decoder architecture. Its encoder is the same as the encoder in DisCo.
Table 9: Comparisons of the β-VAE and FactorVAE scores on the Shapes3D dataset (mean ±variance). A higher mean indicates a better performance.
