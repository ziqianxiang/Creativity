Table 1: Performance of each model after training vs. the trained baseline model on Mahjong, eachusing 4 random seeds. Each match was played by four independent players (agents) for a seriesof 8 games. A player wins a match if it has the highest points among all players when finishing8 games. Each player played for itself and only consider to maximize its own payoff and ranking.
Table 2: Trained models playing with each other on the same table. Deal-in means the playerdiscards a tile and another player wins the game by picking up this tile to compose a winning hand.
Table 3: Hyper-parameters used in this paper. For OPD-style, we did grid search for the additionalhyper-parameter μ to select the best-performing value among [0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10].
Table 4: Explanation of the 111 features of oracle observation encoding (the first 93 features areavailable to the executor) of our Mahjong environment. Player 0 is the current player who is makingdecision and player 1, 2, 3 are opponents counterclockwise. Tegiri (“discard from hand”) means thetile is not discarded immediately after drawing it.
