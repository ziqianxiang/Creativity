Table 1: Evaluation on CIFAR-10 for different models. "Parallel-OptEqs"(POptEqs) meansour model is built without utilizing HH&D fusion (Stated in Appendix A.1), which is formedby paralleling several OptEqs with the method stated in the brackets for fusion. "w/o PE"means MOptEqs is trained without our PE strategy.

Table 3: Evaluation on MOptEqs trained with and without considering D and H part.
Table 4: Evaluation on MOptEqs on ImageNet.
Table 5: Evaluation on MOptEqs trained by PGD-3 with and without PE method.
Table 6: The comparison of the computational cost of MDEQ and our MOptEqs (trainedby one-step gradient).
