Table 1: Comparison of different methods on the random molecular geometry generation task. Theperformance is evaluated by the chemical validity percentage and MMD distances of bond lengthdistributions. Here ↑ means higher value indicates better performance, while J means the opposite.
Table 2: Comparison of different methods on the targeted molecule discovery task. Here J meansthat our objective is minimizing the property score, while ↑ is maximizing the property score.
Table 3: Results of ablation studies evaluated by Validity. (a) Comparison between using localor/and global features; (b) Comparison of using different 3D information; (c) Comparison of thefocal atom selection by the Sigmoid method (ours) and the Softmax method (Simm et al., 2020).
