Table 1: For each function, we display the function, its derivative, and indicate whether the respectiverelaxed sorting network is monotonic and has a bounded error.
Table 2: For each differentiable sorting opera-tor, whether it is monotonic (M), and whetherit has a bounded error (BE).
Table 3: Results on the four-digit MNIST and SVHN tasks using the same architecture as previousworks [1]-[4]. The metric is the proportion of rankings correctly identified, and the value inparentheses is the proportion of individual element ranks correctly identified. All results are averagedover 5 runs. SVHN w/ n = 32 is omitted to reduce the carbon impact of the evaluation.
