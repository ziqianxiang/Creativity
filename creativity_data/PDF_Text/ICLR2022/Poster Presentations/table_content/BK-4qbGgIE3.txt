Table 1: Models Used. These models are all within the 74-78% accuracy range, of which we baseour main results. "Sup." indicates supervised learning, "Cont." constrastive learning. "IN" indicatesImageNet.
Table 2: High Accuracy Models. These models are all above the 80% accuracy. "Sup." indicatessupervised learning, "Cont." constrastive learning. "IN" indicates ImageNet.
Table 3: Low Accuracy Models. These models are all below the 74% target accuracy, but they aretrained with very different methodologies (relative to typical models), so we include them in a fewanalyses, as indicated in main text. "Sup." indicates supervised learning, "Cont." constrastive learning.
Table 4: Other Models. These hyper-parameter sweeps were trained, but did not fit our target 74-78%accuracy range, so we did not use them in our main analyses. "Sup." indicates supervised learning,"IN" indicates ImageNet.
