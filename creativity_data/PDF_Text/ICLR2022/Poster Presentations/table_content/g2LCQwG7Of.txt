Table 1: Hierarchical clustering results (n0 = 512). BoldUnderline indicate best/Second best scores.
Table 2: NMI results on real-world datasets. FPH (Louv.) and FPH (Ward) refer to FPH initializedfrom the solutions of Louvain and Ward, respectively.
Table 3: Results on ogbn-products.
Table 4: AUC-PR score (%) for link prediction.
Table 5: Cora-ML hierarchy visualization.
Table 6: Dataset summary; we convert directed datasets to undirected and select the largest connectedcomponent (LCC).
Table 7: Hyperparameter settings.
Table 8: Hierarchical clustering results (n0 = 512, d = 128).
Table 9: NMI results for d128 DeepWalk embeddings.
Table 10: NMI results on synthetic HSBM graphs.
Table 11: Standard deviations of non-deterministic baselines. In parentheses we report the standarddeviation in relation to the best value reported in Table 1 in percent.
