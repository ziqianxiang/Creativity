Table 1: MAE between perfor-mance predicted by a tab./surr.
Table 2: Performance of dif-ferent regression models fittedon the SNB-DARTS dataset.
Table 3: Metrics for the selected surro-gate models on 500 architectures thatwere evaluated 5 times.
Table 4: MSE and Kendall tau correlation between performance predicted by a tab./surr. benchmarkfitted with one seed each, and the true performance of evaluations with the two other seeds (seeSection 2). Test seeds in brackets.
Table 6: Hyperparameters of the surrogate models and the default values found via HPO. The "Range"column denotes the ranges that the HPO algorithm used for sampling the hyperparameter values andthe "Log-transform" column if sampling distribution was log-transformed or not.
Table 7: Leave One-Optimizer-Out performance of the best surrogate models. Note that the config-urations sampled by DARTS are mostly composed with skip connections (Zela et al., 2020a), butstill the surrogate manages to rank them fairly good (high sKT) even though not providing a goodestimate of the accuracy.
