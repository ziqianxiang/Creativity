Table 3: Discrimination scores (DS) of positive (+) and negative features (-) for different shots (S) and datasets	ChestX				ISIC				EuroSAT				CroPDisease			Setting	5S+	5S-	20S+	20S-	5S+	5S-	20S+	20S-	5S+	5S-	20S+	20S-	5S+	5S-	20S+	20S-DS	0.018	0.016	0.03	0.02	0.13	0.10	0.17	0.09	0.67	0.42	0.62	0.28	0.63	0.41	0.77	0.31clusters. The DS difference between positive and negative features for the ChestX dataset is lowmostly because the dataset is very hard to cluster. Visualization using t-SNE (Maaten & Hinton, 2008)for 5-shot and 20-shot settings are shown in Fig. 2 (b) and (c) respectively. Results show that positivefeatures produce better clusters compared to negative ones. As expected, the positive features for the20-shot setting are more discriminative compared to the 5-shot setting. Also, the internal statistics ofpositive and negative features are different because of Ldiv , which maximizes the statistical distancebetween the two sets of features.

Table 8: Effect of varying epochs for training masking module and for fine-tuning. In the first column, numberwithout parantheses is the epoch number for training masking module while that with parantheses is the epochnumber for fine-tuning. The results are shown in corresponding labelled super-columns.
