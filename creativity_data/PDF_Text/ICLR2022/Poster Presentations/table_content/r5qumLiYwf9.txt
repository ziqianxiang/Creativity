Table 1: FID obtained by StyleGAN2 (config-f) trained on FFHQ using standard and MaGNETsampling (pixel-space) for varying degrees of truncation (Ïˆ). (Left) FID score obtained for 50,000samples generated by a mixture of MaGNET and standard sampling. MaGNET samples can be usedto increase diversity of the model, resulting in better FID than current state-of-the-art. (Right) FIDscore for varying truncation without mixing.
