Table 1: High-frequency notation table.
Table 2: Test loss of one-step sinusoid regression with neural network feature. First row is the discretetest values of Î±, second row is the Mean Square Error(MSE) loss before adaptation and third row isthe loss after adaptation. All loss values are digits after the decimal pointRiemann Zeta function. Note that results in (c) and (d) are beyond our Assumption 1. So our theoremcan be extended to more general scenarios.
