Table 1: Average errors (min-ADE / min-FDE / NLL) on trajectory prediction benchmarks. For ev-ery model, We show the errors with and without (w/o) interaction, as well as their relative difference.
Table 2: Average errors (min-ADE / min-FDE) for the Traj++ model on ETH-UCY. We observe al-most no difference between training with/without interaction with the ETH scene to be an exceptionwhere training without interaction yields lower errors.
Table 3: Average errors (min-ADE / min-FDE) of different variants of the Traj++NRI framworkwith different priors on the learned interaction graph (0.5, 0.9, 0.1).
