Table 1: Comparison of machine learning approaches for measuring the severity of depressive symp-toms on the DAIC-WOZ development set using mean absolute error (MAE). The task evaluated is:PHQ score regression. Modalities: A: audio, V: visual, L: linguistic(text), A+V+L: combination.
Table 2: Results of ablation studies. We apply 10-fold stratified cross-validation and give meanresults. MAE: mean absolute error. RMSE: root mean squared error.

The two word clouds on the left-hand column depict the most salient wordsbased on the frequency of their occurrences over two different raw transcripts respectively. Theword clouds on the right-hand column illustrate the most focused content selected by SGNN model.

Weshow the accuracy on a sentiment classification task. We adopt 10-fold stratified cross-validationand report mean with standard deviation in the parentheses for both of these two models. The GNNmodel is initialized by Glove word embeddings.
