Table 1: Evaluating domain generalization: out-of-domain test accuracy with different amounts of distributionshift d. Higher d indicates more challenging problem. Test data are fixed and only training data are changed.
Table 2: EvalUating sUbpopUlation shift: p is the percentage of minority groups in the training data. Lower pindicates a more challenging setting. Evaluated on a balanced test set (p=50%). The classification task is “Catvs. Dog” with “indoor/outdoor” as the spurious correlation.
Table 3: Evaluating domain generalization on a 10-class animal classification task. Out-of-domain (OOD)test accuracy with different amounts of distribution shift d. Higher d indicates more challenging problem.
Table 4: Evaluating subpopulation shift in a 10-class animal classification task: p is the percentage ofminority groups in the training data. Lower p indicates a more challenging setting. Evaluated on a balanced testset (p=50%).
Table 5: EvalUating sUbpopUlation shift on MetaShift from COCO. p is the percentage of minority groups inthe training data. Lower p indicates a more challenging setting. Evaluated on a balanced test set (p=50%).
