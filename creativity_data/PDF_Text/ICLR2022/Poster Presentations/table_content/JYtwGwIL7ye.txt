Table 1: Reward misspecifications across our four environments. ‘Misalign’ indicates whether thetrue reward drops and ‘Transition’ indicates whether this corresponds to a phase transition (sharpqualitative change). We observe 5 instances of misalignment and 4 instances of phase transitions.
Table 2: Performance of detectors on different subtasks. Each detector has at least one subtask withAUROC under 60%, indicating poor performance.
Table 3: Benchmark statistics. We average over 5 rollouts in traffic and 32 rollouts in COVID.
