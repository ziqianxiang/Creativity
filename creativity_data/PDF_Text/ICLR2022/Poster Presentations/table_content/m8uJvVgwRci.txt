Table 1: Comparisons between the proposed weak indirect supervision (WIS) and related machinelearning tasks. Compared to normal and weakly supervised learning, WIS handles mismatched trainand test label spaces. WIS is similar in spirit to indirect supervision (IS) and zero-shot learning(ZSL), but distinct in that WIS only takes as input weak or noisy labels and a simple set of logicallabel relations, and aims to output a training data set rather than a trained model, affording completemodularity in which final model class is used.
