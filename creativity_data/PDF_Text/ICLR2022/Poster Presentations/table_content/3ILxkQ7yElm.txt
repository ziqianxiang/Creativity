Table 1: Ablation study on network architecture. The 11 × 11 mazes are from the Minigrid (Chevalier-Boisvert et al., 2018) dataset while all other mazes are from the Gridworld (Tamar et al., 2016) dataset. IFstands for implicit function.
Table 2: Success rate and efficiency for maze navigation.
Table 3: Quantitative comparison with RRT (LaValle, 1998) and PRM (Kavraki et al., 1996) on the PROXdataset. “AFF” indicates the pose dependent search discussed in Section 4.2.
Table 4: Quantitative evaluations of human motion trajectory prediction on the PROX dataset. “AFF” is thesame as in Table 3. “Support” and “free” indicate the ratio of poses that are either well supported or collision-free, respectively. “Valid” indicates the ratio of poses that obey both constraints.
