Table 1: Details of the memory footprint of pipeline systems of GPipe, PipeDream, PipeDream-2BW,and WPipe, where we ignore the intermediate activations for recomputation.
Table 2: The results of the convergence experiment of WPipe. We train the models three times withdifferent seeds. Then, we calculated the means and standard deviations of the results. Where DPrepresents data parallelism and PD-2BW represents PipeDream-2BW.
Table 3: The impact of networkcommunication on throughput.
Table 4: The impact of network commu-nication on throughput.
Table 5: The accuracy difference between using APC and not using APC with the same hyperparam-eters. We set ν = 8 × 10-5, b = 32 × 8, ws = 200, epoch = 1 for BERTBASE and ν = 4 × 10-5,b = 16 × 8, ws = 100, epoch = 1 for BERTLARGE and ν = 0.01, b = 32 × 8, wr = 0.05 forResNeXt50_32x4d and ResNeXt10L32x8d.
