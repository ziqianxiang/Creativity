Table 1: Results on the air datasets. Performance averaged over 5 runs.
Table 2: Results on the traffic and smart grids datasets. Performance averaged over 5 runs.
Table 3: Ablation study. Averages over 5 runs.
Table 4: Statistics on adjacency matrices used in the experiments. Self loops are excluded.
Table 5: Statistics on missing data distribution. (P) and (B) indicate the Point Missing and BlockMissing settings, respectively. With block, we refer to missing data bursts longer than 2 time stepsand shorter than or equal to 48.
Table 6: Results on the synthetic datasets. Performance averaged over 5 runs.
Table 7: Comparison of regularized matrix factorization methods on air quality datasets. Resultsaveraged over 5 independent runs.
Table 8: Ablation study. MAE averaged over 5 runs. (P) and (B) indicate the Point Missing andBlock Missing settings, respectively.
Table 9: Performance with different adjacency matrices. Results averaged over 5 runs. (B) indicatesthe Block Missing setting.
Table 10: Performance with different amounts of missing data. Results averaged over 5 differentevaluation masks in the out-sample setting. (P) indicates the Point Missing setting.
