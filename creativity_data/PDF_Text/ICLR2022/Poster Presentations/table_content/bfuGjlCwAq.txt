Table 1: Performance comparisons. Uti. and Num. mean the average space utilization and the average numberof packed items separately. Var. (Ã—10-3) is the variance of Uti. and Gap is w.r.t. the best Uti. across all methods.
Table 2: A graph embedding for complete PCT helps the final performance.
Table 3: Online 3D-BPP with continuous solution space.
Table 4: Generalization performance on different kinds of item sampling distributions.
Table 5: Online 3D-BPP with practical constraints. Obj. means the task-specific objective score, the smallerthe better. S etting 2 involves no mass property and the load balancing is not considered.
Table 6: Transfer the best-performing PCT policies directly to the disturbed item sampling distributions.
Table 7: Generalization performance on unseen items. All policies are trained with the EV scheme.
Table 8: Running costs (seconds) tested on online 3D-BPP with discrete solution space (Section 4.1) andcontinuous solution space (Section 4.3). The running costs of the latter are usually more expensive sincechecking Constraint 1 and 2 in the continuous domain is more time-consuming.
Table 9: Scalability on larger packing problems. |L| is the average number of leaf nodes per step. Run. is therunning cost. |L| will not increase exponentially with |B| since invalid leaf nodes will be removed.
