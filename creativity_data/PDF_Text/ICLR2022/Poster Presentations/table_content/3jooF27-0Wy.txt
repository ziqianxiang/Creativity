Table 5: Average PSNR for fitting of images in the Kodak dataset. Both our improved initializationscheme, as well as the inclusion of anisotropic Gabor functions lead to better reconstructions.
Table 6: Full results on CIFAR-10. We report results over three runs per setting. CIFARResNet-44 w/CKConv is a CIFARResNet-44 where all convolutional layers are replaced with CKConvs with k = 3.
