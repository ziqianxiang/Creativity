For setting covariate shift, we used aa set of distributions that were shifted w.r.t. the default context distribution. We then sampled ashifted distribution w.p. β and the default distribution w.p. 1 - β. That is, when β = 1, the usersampled a context only from the shifted distribution. Table 5 shows an example of one of the shifteddistribution that were used.
