Table 1: Natural accuracy [%] (Acc.), verified accuracy [%] (Ver.) and its empirical upper bound[%] and average runtime [s] of the first 1000 images of the test set.
Table 2: Verified accuracy [%] (Ver.) and avg. runtime[s] on the first 100 images of the test set for = 1/255).
Table 3: Overview of the experimental configuration for every network.
Table 4: Network architectures of the convolutional networks for CIFAR10 and MNIST. All layerslisted below are followed by an activation layer. The output layer is omitted. ’Conv C hxw/s/p'corresponds to a 2D convolution with c output channels, an h×w kernel size, a stride of s in bothdimensions, and an all-around zero padding of p.
Table 5: Network architecture of the ResNet6 and ResNet8. All layers listed below are followed by aReLU activation layer, except if they are followed by a ResAdd layer. The output layer is omitted.
