Table 1: Results for undersampled MRI reconstruction on BraTS. First two methods are supervisedlearning techniques trained with 8^ acceleration. The others are unsupervised techniques.
Table 2: Results for sparse-view CT reconstruction on LIDC and LDCT. FISTA-TV is a standarditerative reconstruction method that does not need training. cGAN, Neumann, and SIN-4c-PRN aresupervised learning techniques trained with 23 projection angles.
