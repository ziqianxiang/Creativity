Table 1: Comparison among existing works regarding their type, coverage, and additional structuralassumptions on the function class or MDPs. Type F means model-free and type B means model-based. Partial coverage means 2that the offline distribution ρ covers a state-action distribution ofa comparator policy ∏*. f means it assumes an accurate density estimator for ρ(s, a). ff meansalthough the analysis in Jin et al. (2020a) is done under the full coverage for linear MDPs, based onthe argument (Zhang et al., 2021b), we can show the algorithm has the PAC guarantee under partialcoverage in terms of the relative condition number for linear MDPs. fff means that we can refineit to a more adaptive quantity using the model class (i.e., Definition 1). All the methods in the tablerequire realizability in the function class.
