Table 1: Errors on IHDP over 1000 random DGPs. “Mod. *” indicates the modified version with unconditionalbalance of strength Y = *. Italic indicates where the modified version is significantly worse than the original.
Table 2: Performance of modified version with different unconditional balancing parameter, the values of whichare shown after “Mod.”.
Table 3: Pre-treatment Errors on IHDP over 1000 random DGPs. We report results with dim(Z) = 10. Boldindicates method(s) which is significantly better. The results are taken from Shalit et al. (2017), except GANITE(Yoon et al., 2018) and CEVAE (Louizos et al., 2017).
Table 4: Pre-treatment ATE on Pokec. Ground truth ATE is 1, as we can see in (38). “Unadjusted” estimatesATE by ED(y1) - ED(y0). “Parametric” is a stochastic block model for networked data (Gopalan & Blei,2013). “Embed-” denotes the best alternatives given by (Veitch et al., 2019). Bold indicates method(s) which issignificantly better than all the others. We report results with 20-dimensional latent Z. The results of the othermethods are taken from (Veitch et al., 2019).
