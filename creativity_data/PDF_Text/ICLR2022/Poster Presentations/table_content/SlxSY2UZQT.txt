Table 1: Number of annotated images for each dataset used in our evaluation.
Table 2: The comparison of the segmentation methods in terms of mean IoU. (*) On CelebA-19 andADE Bedroom-30, we evaluate models trained on FFHQ-256 and LSUN Bedroom, respectively.
Table 3: Performance of DDPM-based segmentation when trained on real and synthetic images.
Table 4: Evaluation of the proposed method with a different number of labeled training data. Evenusing less annotated data, DDPM still outperforms most baselines in Table 2.
Table 5: Performance of the DDPM-based method for different feature extraction variations. Allconsidered stochastic options provide a similar mIoU to the determinstic one.
Table 6: Performance of DatasetDDPM and DatasetGAN for 10K-50K synthetic images in thetraining dataset. Mean IoU of both methods saturates at 30K-50K of synthetic data.
Table 7: Performance of the proposed method for twice wider / deeper MLP architecture within theensemble. More expressive MLPs do not improve the performance.
