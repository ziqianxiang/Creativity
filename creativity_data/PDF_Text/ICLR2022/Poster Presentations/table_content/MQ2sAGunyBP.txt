Table 1: Results on the Waymo Open Dataset - Long-Range Labels. Compared to Zhu &Fang (2019), R4D achieves performance gains on all evaluation metrics. R4D also outperformsSVR (Gokce et al., 2015), and DisNet (Haseeb et al., 2018). R4D-NA refers to No-Attention R4D.
Table 2: Results on the pseudo long-range KITTI dataset. R4D outperforms SVR (GOkce et al.,2015), DisNet (Haseeb et al., 2018), and Zhu & Fang (2019).
Table 3: The target embeddings (Tgt) and the reference embeddings (Ref) alone are not enough formodeling pairwise relationships. The union embeddings (Uni) and geo-distance embeddings (G-D)are also necessary components of R4D.
Table 4: Ablation studies on the proposed pairwise relationship modeling and distance augmentation(DA). Results in this table are slightly different from those in Tables 1 and 3 because, here, weremove images which do not contain any reference objects. This is in order to report results onR4D-Relative, which requires at least one reference object (see Section 5.3 for details).
Table 5: Robustness on out-of-distribution data. Both R4D and the baseline (Zhu & Fang, 2019) aretrained on daytime images only, and evaluated on three test sets collected during different times ofday. The performance improvement of R4D increases when the domain gap is larger.

Table 8: Results on the pseudo long-range nuScenes Dataset. R4D outperforms SVR (Gokce et al.,2015), DisNet (Haseeb et al., 2018), and Zhu & Fang (2019).
Table 9: Comparison with monocular 3D object detection methods on pseudo long-range KITTIdataset. R4D outperforms SMOKE (Liu et al., 2020), and RTM3D (Li et al., 2020).
Table 10: Robustness on out-of-distribution data. All models are trained on daytime images only,and evaluated on three test sets collected during different times of day. We evaluate each componentsfrom R4D, i.e., the target embeddings (Tgt), the reference embeddings (Ref), the union embeddings(Uni), the geo-distance embeddings (G-D), and distance augmentation (DA).
Table 11: Noise on reference input 2D bounding boxes. We perturb the location and the size ofreference 2D boxes, and then test the performance of R4D. Although slightly obserVing performancedrop after adding noise, R4D is still better than the baseline method (Zhu & Fang, 2019).
Table 12: Noise on object distance provided by the 3D detector. We perturb distance of reference3D boxes, and then test the performance of R4D. Although slightly observing performance dropafter adding noise, R4D is still better than the baseline method (Zhu & Fang, 2019).
Table 13: Results comparison on the Waymo Open Dataset - Long-Range Labels. We compare thebaseline (Zhu & Fang, 2019) and R4D with and without LiDAR signals. For R4D, when LiDARsignal is missing, we train a monocular depth estimator (Zhu & Fang, 2019) on the short rangeobjects, and then predict the distance for short-range objects as references.
