Table 1: Multiclass-to-binary (M2B) notions internally verify one or more binary calibration state-ments/claims. The statements in the rightmost column are required to hold almost surely.
Table 2: Top-label-ECE and top-label-MCE for deep-net models (above: ‘Base’) and various post-hoc calibrators: temperature-scaling (TS), vector-scaling (VS), Dirichlet-scaling (DS), top-label-HB(TL-HB), and normalized-HB (N-HB). Best performing method in each row is in bold.
Table 3: Class-wise-ECE for deep-net models and various post-hoc calibrators. All methods aresame as Table 2, except TL-HB is replaced with class-wise-HB (CW-HB).
Table 4: Top-label-ECE and top-label-MCE for deep-net models and various post-hoc calibrators.
Table 5: Class-wise-ECE for deep-net models and various post-hoc calibrators. All methods aresame as Table 2, except top-label-HB is replaced with class-wise-HB or Algorithm 3 (CW-HB).
