Table 1: Comparison to prior work on Mini-ImageNet, CIFAR-FS, and FC-100 on 1-shot and5-shot 5-class classification. Reported numbers are test target classification accuracy of variousmethods for various data sets. The notation a-b-c-d denotes a 4-layer convolutional network with a,b, c, and d filters in each layer. *The algorithm was trained on both train and validation classes. Wetook the data from Dhillon et al. (2020) and Tian et al. (2020).
