Table 1: NURD vs. methods that use nuisances or environments. In this work, the training datacomes from a single member of the family F, i.e. a single environment. For methods that requiremultiple environments, values of the nuisance can be treated as environment labels. Unlike existingmethods, NuRD works with high-dimensional nuisances without requiring them at test time.
