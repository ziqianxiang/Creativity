Table 1: Negative evidence lower bound of test likelihood (lower is better). " Training ELBO, estimated fromFigure 12inWuetal. (2018a).
Table 2: Denoising success rate on binarized Omniglot dataset. A denoising process is successful if it canretrieve the original image with at most 1% error, which is equivalent to 7 pixels.
Table 3: Negative evidence lower bound of test likelihood (lower is better) on FashionMNIST, CIFAR100 andCelebA datasets. * Our implementation.
