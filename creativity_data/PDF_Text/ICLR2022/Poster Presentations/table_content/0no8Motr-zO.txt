Table 1: Sample Complexity: Median number of samples across 5 seeds required to reach ‘solved’performance, averaged across 5 trials. We determine ‘solved’ performance by running an MPC policy(similar to the one used for evaluation) on the ground truth dynamics to predict actions. We record‘N/A’ when the median run is unable to solve the problem by the end of training.

Table 3: Runtime in seconds for the phases of the BARL algorithm on all problems when run onthe author’s 24-core CPU machines. The ranges given show the runtime for the operation at thebeginning and at the end of training, as some operations run longer as more data is added.
