Table 1: Average PSNR and SSIM values on 30 test slices.
Table 2: Average reconstruction times for single-instance reconstruction methods. The computationtimes were measured on the machines equipped with 4 NVIDIA V100 GPUs (each with 32 GBmemory). While CG-SENSE and DIP methods have lower computational times, their reconstruc-tion quality is severely degraded hindering clinical usage. ZS-SSL-TL (K = 10) provides an 8-foldfaster convergence time compared to ZS-SSL (K = 10). We note that ZS-SSL methods recon-struction times may further be reduced by means of more compact architectures. Additionally, theincreased computational times may be tolerable within the workflow, for instance in clinical settingswhere image readings are done the next day (Basha et al., 2017), or scans such as high-resolutionfunctional or diffusion MRI, where it is challenging to have high-quality high-resolution data, whilepost-reconstruction analyses readily take hours to days (Andersson & Stamatios N, 2016; Vizioliet al., 2021).
Table 3: Average PSNR and SSIM values on 30 test slices for the experiments associated withFigures 4-6 (in the main text) and 12. We note that ZS-SSL-TL successfully fine-tunes the networkfor each new dataset/instance regardless of the starting pretrained model. Interestingly, there arecases where out-of-domain transfer has slightly higher metrics than in-domain transfer. In thesecases, since the metrics are already high, the slight quantitative differences do not affect the overallquality. However, the main difference in these cases is in the convergence/stopping time, where in-domain transfer is typically Converges/stops in ~2-fold fewer iterations than out-of-domain transfer.
