Table 1: mean IoU validation performance for Pascal VOC, CityScapes and SUN RGB-D datasets.
Table 2: mean IoU validation performance for Pascal VOCwith data partition and training strategy proposed in Pseu-doSeg (Zou et al., 2021). The percentage and the number oflabelled data used are listed in the first row.
Table 3: mean IoU validation performance for Pascal VOC and Cityscapes datasets trained on1, 1%, 5% and 25% labelled pixels per class per image. We report the mean over three indepen-dent runs for all methods.
Table 4: mean IoU validation performance for 20and 50 labelled CityScapes data for supervisedmethod (top) and semi-supervised methods (bot-tom).
Table 5: mean IoU validation performance in semi-supervsed Pascal VOC and CityScapes datasets.
