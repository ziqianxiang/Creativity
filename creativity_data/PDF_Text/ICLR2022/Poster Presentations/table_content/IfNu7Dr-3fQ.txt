Table 1: Common kernels k(x,y) on Rd with Z = X — y. In each case, kk∣∣∞ = 1. Here, Ca，r—., Kais the modified Bessel function of the third kind of order a (Wendland, 2004, Def. 5.10), hβ is therecursive convolution of 2β + 2 copies of 1[- 1 1 ], and Be，Pb=02c (—1)j (；)(2 - j)β~1.
Table 2: MMD guarantees for TARGET KT under Mk (4) growth and P tail decay. We report theMMDk(Sin, SKT) bound (6) for target KT with n input points and √n output points, up to con-stants depending on d and kkk∞,in. Here Rin , maxx∈Sin kxk2.
Table 3: MMDk(S也,SKT) guarantees for commonly used kernels. For n input and √n output points, Wereport the MMD bounds of Thm. 2 for target KT, of Dwivedi & Mackey (2021, Thm. 1) for rootKT, and of Thm. 4 for KT+ (with α = 2 wherever feasible). We assume a SUBGAUSS P for theGAUSS kernel, a COMPACT P for the B -SPLINE kernel, and a SUBEXP P for all other k (see Tab. 2for a definition of each P class). Here, Cn，log log n, δi = δ, δ0 = 2, and error is reported UP toconstants depending on (k, d, δ, α). The KT+ guarantee for LAPLACE applies with a > ddi and forMATERN with a> 2V. The target KT guarantee for MATERN with V > 3d/2 assumes v—d/2 ∈ Nto simplify the presentation (see (53) for the general case). The best rate is highlighted in blue.
