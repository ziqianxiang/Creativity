Table D.1: Priors for the astrophysical binary black hole parameters used to train the inferencenetwork. Priors are uniform over the specified range unless indicated otherwise. We train networkswith different distance ranges for the two observing runs O1 and O2 due to the different detectorsensitivities. At inference time, a cosmological distance prior is imposed by reweighting samplesaccording to their distance.
