Table 1: Performance (per question/option accuracy) comparison with the state-of-the-art methodsMAC (V+), NS-DR, DCL, and ALOE on CLEVRER, ALOE takes static scene representations fromMonet as visual input while ODDN-ALOE use representations of ODDN.
Table 2: Ablations of how different object representations perform on CLEVRER, all experimentsare conducted based on ALOE without self-supervision. “ODDN w/o relation” is ODDN trainedwithout relation module (with only dynamic distillation module). -dyn means reducing distilleddynamic representations (only static representations remained). “MoNet w/o ss” is the result ofALOE without self-supervision from original paper with MoNet features.
