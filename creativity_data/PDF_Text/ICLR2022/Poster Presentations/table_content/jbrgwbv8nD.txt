Table 1: Output distributions for constrained decoding (Pθu (y | x, L)) and constrained training(Pθc (y | x, L)), compared to the data distribution P(y | x). Constrained decoding cannot learn thedata distribution exactly, and yields a mode which disagrees with that of the data distribution.
Table 2: Results from our experiments (averaged over 5 trials), along with selected reported resultsfrom recent literature. We rank of our models by precision, recall, and Fi score - rankings differ ifand only if the difference is significant at p < 0.05 (two-tailed), as measured by a permutation test.
Table 3: Summary of hyperparameters for our models and experiments.
