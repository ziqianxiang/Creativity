Table 1: Comparison on the benefit ratio (%) of all race identities & standard deviation (%) betweendifferent settings. t_asian (nt-asian) is the benefit ratio of asian identity With “toxic” labels (“non-toxic” labels). SD denotes standard deviation. Negative benefit ratios are highlighted in red colors.
Table 2: Dataset statistics and train/test splitting. The number of train and test samples means thenumber of data per class.
Table 3: Balance samples with reweighting. We sample unbalanced CIFAR-100 (1:2 means 40instances per class for the first 50 fine classes, 20 instances per class for the next 50 fine classes).
Table 4: Collect more data. a → b → c → d: stands for the change of mean or standard deviationwith different sizes of labeled dataset. For CIFAR-100, the sizes are 5 × 100, 10 × 100, 20 × 100, 40 ×100. For Jigsaw (both race and gender), the sizes are 25 × 8, 50 × 8, 100 × 8, 150 × 8.
