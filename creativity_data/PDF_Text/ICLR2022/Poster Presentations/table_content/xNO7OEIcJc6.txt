Table 1: CLIP’s label switching rate for word-superimposed images.
Table 2: CLIP’s label switching rate for word-superimposed images on different prompts. Thered-colored texts are the prompts that specify that the image content is what should be predicted.
Table F1: Label switching rate for nonsense pseudowords.
Table G1: Consistency rates between the switched labels and the superimposed words.We calculatedthe ratio that the switched labels and the superimposed words were consistent in the label-switchedimage. This table results from the prompt ”a photo of X” using the ViT/32 image encoder. Whenthe prediction category class is same as the superimposed word class (the S/S and B/B conditions),most switched labels were the same word as superimposed on the images (more than 90%) (e.g., a”dog” prediction for a superimposed word ”dog” ). When the prediction category class is differentfrom the superimposed one (the S/S and B/B condition), parts of switched labels were the consistentcategory with superimposed words across different category levels (e.g., a ”animal” prediction for asuperimposed word ”dog” ).
