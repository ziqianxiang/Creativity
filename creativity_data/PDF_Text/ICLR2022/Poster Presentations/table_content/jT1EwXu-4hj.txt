Table 1: Real-data and semi-synthetic experiment testing testing results for the MovieLens-1M, LaftFM andGoodReads dataset. All the results are computed via ten runs and the Hit and NDCG metrics are multipliedby 100 for presentation. The results for the LastFM and GoodReads datasets, and sequential recommendation(Attn) are deferred to Appendix D.3. The metric of Rel@10, Hit@10 and NDCG@10 are short for the top-10 relevance score, hitting rate and normalized discounted cumulative gain. The metrics on synthetic dataare computed by using the true relevance model. We highlight the best and SeCond best results. Attn is notexperimented on simulation because the ordering of the generated data is random.
Table A.1: Additional testing results on MovieLens-1M. The settings of this table follow from Table1. DT-(M/M/N), for instance, indicates using the proposed method with f and MCF, w as NCF andg as NCF. We highlight the best results.
Table A.2: Simulation experiment results for the Goodreads simulation. The settings and interpre-tations are the same as Table 1. We highlight the best results.
Table A.3: Additional numeric results for the variations of the proposed domain transportation meth-ods with different combinations of the f , g and w models).
Table A.4: Offline evaluation of the three models used in the online A/B/C testing. Due to pri-vacy reasons, we are only able to report the relative lift percentage with respect to the baseline. Weuse D&W to represent the original deep&wide control model, IW-D&W to represent the approxi-mate propensity-weighted version, and DT-D&W to represent the proposed domain transportationapproach when coupled With the deep&wide model. *: the CTR is computed using the history ex-posure log and the past estimated CTR, similar to how we computed the relevance score Rel in thebenchmark and simulation experiments.
