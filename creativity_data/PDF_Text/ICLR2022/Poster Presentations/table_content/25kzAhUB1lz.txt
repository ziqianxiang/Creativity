Table 1: Instantiation of Equation 2 foreach part of an UPSIDE policy, and forVIC (Gregor et al., 2016) and DIAYN(Eysenbach et al., 2019) policies.
Table 2: Coverage on Bottleneck Maze and U-Maze: UPSIDE cov-ers significantly more regions of the discretized state space than theother methods. The values represent the number of buckets that arereached, where the 50 Ã— 50 space is discretized into 10 buckets peraxis. To compare the global coverage of methods (and to be fairw.r.t. the amount of injected noise that may vary across methods), weroll-out for each model its associated deterministic policies.
