Video recordings of speech contain correlated audio and visual information, pro-
viding a strong signal for speech representation learning from the speaker’s lip
movements and the produced sound. We introduce Audio-Visual Hidden Unit
BERT (AV-HuBERT), a self-supervised representation learning framework for
audio-visual speech, which masks multi-stream video input and predicts automat-
ically discovered and iteratively refined multimodal hidden units. AV-HuBERT
learns powerful audio-visual speech representation benefiting both lip-reading and
automatic speech recognition. On the largest public lip-reading benchmark LRS3
(433 hours), AV-HuBERT achieves 32.5% WER with only 30 hours of labeled
data, outperforming the former state-of-the-art approach (33.6%) trained with a
thousand times more transcribed video data (31K hours) (Makino et al., 2019).
The lip-reading WER is further reduced to 26.9% when using all 433 hours of
labeled data from LRS3 and combined with self-training. Using our audio-visual
representation on the same benchmark for audio-only speech recognition leads
to a 40% relative WER reduction over the state-of-the-art performance (1.3%
vs 2.3%). Our code and models are available at https://github.com/

1	Introduction
Human perception of speech is intrinsically multimodal, involving audition and vision. The speech
production is accompanied by the movement of lips and teeth, which can be visually interpreted
to understand speech. Visual cues of speech not only play an essential role in language learning
for pre-lingual children (Meltzoff & Moore, 1977; Davies et al., 2008), but also improve speech
understanding in noisy environment (Sumby & Pollack, 1954) and provide patients of speech im-
pairment with means of communication. Furthermore, perceptual studies (McGurk & MacDonald,
1976) have shown that such visual cues can alter the perceived sound.
For machine learning models, the tight coupling between audio and visual lip movement informa-
tion emerges as a natural source for supervision to learn speech representations, which has not been
extensively utilized yet in the self-supervised speech representation learning literature. Recent suc-
cessful representation learning frameworks for speech (e.g., APC (Chung et al., 2019), CPC (Oord
et al., 2018; Kharitonov et al., 2021), wav2vec 2.0 (Baevski et al., 2020; Hsu et al., 2021b), De-
CoAR2.0 (Ling & Liu, 2020), HuBERT (Hsu et al., 2021c;a)) are mostly built entirely on audio.
The fundamental research question addressed in this paper is whether a self-supervised audio-visual
speech representation learned from the lip movement information, alongside the audio signal in
video recordings, captures cross-modal correlations and improves downstream performance for vi-
sual speech recognition (i.e., lip reading) and automatic speech recognition (ASR) tasks. Existing
ML models for lip-reading rely heavily on text transcriptions to achieve an acceptable level of accu-
racy. The state-of-the-art lip-reading model (Makino et al., 2019) requires 31K hours of transcribed
video data for training. Such large amounts of labeled data are expensive and hard to obtain for
most of the world’s 7,000 languages. The benefit from a robust visual speech representation learn-
ing framework goes beyond lip-reading. Additionally, it can benefit a vast range of applications,

including but not limited to keyword spotting in sign language (Albanie et al., 2020), speech en-
hancement (Xu et al., 2020) and talking face generation (Chen et al., 2018).
In this paper, we present Audio-Visual Hidden Unit BERT (AV-HuBERT), a multimodal self-
supervised speech representation learning framework. It encodes masked audio and image se-
quences into audio-visual features via a hybrid ResNet-transformer architecture to predict the pre-
determined sequence of discrete cluster assignments. The target cluster assignments are initially
generated from signal processing-based acoustic features (e.g., MFCC) and iteratively refined us-
ing the features learned by the audio-visual encoder via k-means clustering. AV-HuBERT simul-
taneously captures linguistic and phonetic information for unmasked regions from both the lip-
movement and audio streams into its latent representations, then encodes their long-range temporal
relationships to solve the masked-prediction task.
The contextualized representations learned by AV-HuBERT show excellent transferability to the lip-
reading task, where only the visual modality is available. Pre-training on audio and visual input
streams led to substantially better results than only visual input. In the low-resource setup using
only 30 hours of labeled data from LRS3 (Afouras et al., 2018b), our model achieves a lip-reading
WER of 32.5%, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art model (33.6%) trained on 31,000 hours
of transcribed videos (Makino et al., 2019). Using the complete 433 hours from LRS3 further
reduces WER to 28.6%. We further show AV-HuBERT and self-training are complementary to each
other: combining both sets a new lip-reading WER record of 26.9%. In addition, we show that
the multimodal clusters derived from AV-HuBERT can be used to pre-train a HuBERT model for
audio-based speech recognition, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art model (2.3%) and the
unimodal HuBERT pre-trained on audio clusters (1.5%) by a large margin (1.3%).
2	Related Work
The strong correlation between video modalities provides an effective means for self-supervised
representation learning on videos, which has been explored in many prior works and is still an active
research area. This work draws inspiration from two lines of previous research:
Multimodal general video representation focuses on learning self-supervised audio-visual repre-
sentations of general videos to solve high-level semantic tasks, e.g., action recognition and audio
event detection (Arandjelovic & Zisserman, 2017; BrUno et al., 2018; Morgado et al., 2021; Chen
et al., 2020; Lee et al., 2021). Owens & Efros (2018) learns a multimodal network to predict whether
the aUdio and visUal streams of a video are temporally synchronized while Pham et al. (2019) ap-
plies a cyclic translation between different modalities. Piergiovanni et al. (2020) learns the visUal
representation throUgh a mUlti-tasking framework that incorporates a series of pretext tasks sUch
as reconstrUction and temporal ordering prediction. Sharing oUr work’s inspiration of DeepClUs-
tering (Caron et al., 2018), XDC (Alwassel et al., 2020) and AV-BERT (Chan et al., 2021) learn
cross-modal representations throUgh predicting cross-modal or clUster assignments. In contrast to
XDC, AV-HUBERT is trained with a BERT-like masked prediction loss, which forces the model to
learn the strUctUre within the mUltimodal inpUt and was shown in HsU et al. (2021c) to be more
resilient to bad clUster assignments compared to Unmasked clUster prediction. On the other hand,
AV-BERT focUses on learning Utterance-level mUltimodal environment embeddings that serves as
the global context for ASR, while oUr objective is to learn frame-level aUdio-visUal speech represen-
tations and pre-train a model that can be fine-tUned for downstream tasks with either modality.
Semi- and self-supervised audio-visual speech representation learning focUses on improving
lip-reading with Untranscribed aUdio-visUal speech data. To solve isolated visUal word recognition,
ChUng et al. (2020) learns visUal embeddings Using a contrastive loss based on aUdio-visUal synchro-
nization. Ma et al. (2021a) learns visUal speech representations by minimizing the distance between
its latent featUres and off-the-shelf aUdio embeddings. Using an external sUpervised ASR to tran-
scribe Unlabeled aUdio, AfoUras et al. (2020) trains their lip-reading model on the aUgmented labeled
and pseUdo-labeled data. Unlike Ma et al. (2021a) and AfoUras et al. (2020), oUr model is trained
from scratch and encoUraged to learn contextUalized representations with a masked prediction task.
Moreover, oUr method does not rely on any external pre-trained models.

3.1	Preliminary: Audio HuB ERT
Our research builds on Audio HuBERT (Hsu et al., 2021a) which is a self-supervised learning frame-
work for speech and audio. It alternates between two steps: feature clustering and masked predic-
tion. In the first step, a discrete latent variable model (e.g., k-means) is applied to a sequence of
acoustic frames A1:T producing a sequence of frame-level assignments z1a:T . Clusters of signal-
processing-based acoustic features, e.g., Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC), exhibit non-
trivial correlations with the inherent acoustic units of speech inputs. Using (A1:T , z1a:T ) pairs, the
second step learns new feature representations by minimizing a masked prediction loss, similar to
masked language modeling in BERT (Devlin et al., 2019). The pressure to predict cluster assign-
ments of masked audio regions forces the model to learn good local acoustic representations for
unmasked regions and long-range temporal dependencies between latent features. Repeating these
two steps improves the cluster quality and consequently the quality of the learned representations.
3.2	Single-Modal & Cross-Modal Visual HuBERT
Single-modal Visual HuBERT: The most naive way to extend HUBERT to the visual domain is by
generating targets using visual features. Formally, given an image sequence I1:T , we first cluster
the image features into a sequence of discrete units zi1:T via k-means: zti = k-means(G(It)) ∈
{1, 2, ..., V }, where G is an visual feature extractor and V is the codebook size. The cluster assign-
ments zi1:T serve as the prediction targets of the model. Initially, G can be an engineered image
feature extractor such as Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HoG), analogous to MFCC in audio
HuBERT. The intermediate layers of the HuBERT model are used as G in later iterations.
To perform the masked prediction task, the model first encodes I1:T using a ResNet into an in-
termediate visual feature sequence f1v:T , which is then corrupted into f1v:T via a binary mask M .
Specifically, ∀t ∈ M, ftv is replaced with a learned masked embedding. We adopt the same strategy
in HuBERT to generate span masks. The masked visual features f1v:T are encoded into a sequence
of contextualized features e1:T via a transformer encoder followed by a linear projection layer. The
loss is computed over the masked regions and optionally over unmasked ones (when α ≥ 0):
pt = Softmax(Wet + b), 1 ≤ t ≤ T
L = - X logpt(zti) - α X log pt (zti)	(1)
t∈M	t6∈M
Where (W ∈ Rd×V , b ∈ RV ) are parameters of the projection layer which maps features into logits
predicting the cluster assignments.
Cross-modal Visual HuBERT: The single-modal visual HuBERT aims to learn visual speech rep-
resentation through gradually refined image features. However, it does not employ the audio stream
of the video. Presumably, audio features, e.g., MFCC or a pre-trained audio HuBERT model, cor-
relate with phones better than vanilla image features (e.g., HoG) do. To this end, we train an audio
encoder based on the aligned audio frame sequence A1:T in parallel to the visual encoder. The iter-
ative training alternates between the two encoders. In each iteration, an audio encoder Ea is utilized
to generate target cluster assignments z1a:T . The visual encoder Ev is trained subsequently with
(I1:T, z1a:T). The z1a:T is also used to train the next iteration of the audio encoder Ea for refinement.
The cross-modality visual HuBERT can be seen as modeling visual inputs by distilling knowledge
from the audio stream, where z1a:T represents the audio-side knowledge. We hypothesize that the
audio feature is more favorable to speech representation learning than the visual feature, which is
validated in the Section E.1. Critical for the lip-reading downstream task, the masked prediction
objective used by HuBERT forces the model to capture temporal relationships, which facilitates
prediction of homophemes, which are groups of sounds with identical visual shapes (e.g., ’p’-’b’,
’f’-’v’, ’sh’-’ch’) that are impossible to distinguish using a single image frame.

middle frames, because at least one modality is masked for those frames. See section A for its
comparison between single-modal and cross-modal visual HuBERT.
3.3	Audio-visual HuBERT
Our primary model in this work is Audio-Visual HuBERT (AV-HuBERT), shown in figure 1, which
is trained iteratively by alternating between feature clustering and masked prediction in a similar
way to the Visual HuBERT but with four main improvements:
Audio-visual input: The AV-HuBERT model consumes both acoustic and image frames for the
masked prediction training, which enables better modeling and distillation of the correlations be-
tween the two modalities. Specifically, image sequences and acoustic features pass through their
light-weight modality-specific encoders to produce intermediate features, which are then fused and
fed into a shared backbone transformer encoder to predict masked cluster assignments. The targets
are generated from clustering audio features or features extracted from the previous iteration of the
AV-HuBERT model. When fine-tuned for lip-reading, we drop the audio input to work solely with
the visual input. The input discrepancy is addressed by modality dropout described next.
Modality dropout: Audio-visual speech recognition models can relate audio input to lexical output
more effortlessly than the visual input stream, as observed in the literature (Afouras et al., 2018a;
Ma et al., 2021b). This causes the audio modality to dominate model decisions. The problem is
aggravated in our setting because the target cluster assignments are initially generated from acoustic
features. To prevent the model’s over-reliance on the audio stream in our joint model, we only use a
linear layer to encode acoustic input to force the audio encoder to learn simple features.
Additionally, before fusing audio and visual inputs into the backbone transformer encoder, dropout
is applied to mask the full features of one modality; we refer to it as modality dropout. With a
probability pm, both modalities are used as input. When only one modality is used, the audio stream
is selected with a probability of pa . Formally, given the encoded audio and visual feature sequence
f1a:T and f1v:T , equation 2 shows feature fusion equipped with modality dropout:
(Concat(fta, f)	withPm
ftav =	concat(fta, 0)	with (1 - pm)pa	(2)
Iconcat(0, fv)	with (1 - Pm)(1 -Pa)
where concat denotes channel-wise concatenation. Note that modality drop out is applied at
the sequence level instead of at the frame-level, which effectively tasks AV-HuBERT to perform
masked prediction with visual-only, audio-only, or audio-visual input. Modality dropout prevents
the model from ignoring video input and encourages the model to produce the prediction regardless
of what modalities are used as input. Furthermore, since the fine-tuning and inference phases use the
visual stream alone (no audio input), this modality dropout mechanism bridges the gap between pre-
training (multimodal) and fine-tuning/inference (single-modality). A similar dropout mechanism
is used in prior work (Zhang et al., 2019a; Makino et al., 2019; Neverova et al., 2014; Abdelaziz
et al., 2020) to increase the robustness in multi-modal settings. We verify the modality dropout
effectiveness in Section D.

Audio-visual clustering: One benefit of pre-training on both modalities is the ability to generate
multimodal cluster assignments that serve as target labels for the masked prediction task of the
next iteration. In contrast to the Cross-modal Visual HuBERT where targets are generated from
audio-based features or a prior Audio HuBERT model, the targets for AV-HuBERT are naturally
multimodal after the first iteration. Lip movement sequences provide complementary information
to the audio stream. Combining both modalities produces cluster assignments of higher quality for
AV-HuBERT, as shown in Section E.1.
Masking by substitution: We propose a novel masking strategy for AV-HuBERT that masks seg-
ments in the visual stream by substituting them with random segments from the same video. More
formally, given an input video Iv1:T , an imposter video Iv1:,Tf and a mask consisting of n intervals
M = {(si, ti)}1≤i≤n, we corrupted I1v:T into I1v:T by setting:
Ivi:ti= Ipifpi+ti-Si, ∀1 ≤ i ≤ n	(3)
where pi is a sampled integer offset from the interval [0, Tf - ti + si]. Now, to solve the task,
the model needs to first identify the fake frames and then infer the labels belonging to the original
frames. Since the “filled-in” segments are from real video segments and temporally smooth, the
fake segment detection sub-task becomes less trivial compared to when using vanilla masking or
substitution with non-consecutive frames. We show an ablation confirming the advantage of the
proposed masking strategy in Section D.
The audio and visual segments are masked independently using two different masking probabilities
ma and mv. We hypothesize that the difficulty of the masked prediction task differs for each modal-
ity: inferring the masked targets given the audio stream is more straightforward than using the lip
movement stream. Setting a high masking probability for acoustic frames is essential to help the
whole model capture the language characteristics. On the contrary, setting a high masking proba-
bility for the visual input provide the model with more imposter segments than the original ones,
hurting its ability to learn meaningful features (studied in Section D of the appendix). Given the
output probability p1:T and target cluster assignments z1:T, the AV-HuBERT pre-training loss is:
L = -	logpt(zt) - α	logpt(zt)
t∈Ma∪Mv	t6∈M a ∪Mv
(4)
where Ma and Mv denotes the frames that are masked for the audio and the visual stream. α is a
hyperparameter weighting the contribution of the unmasked regions in the overall objective.
3.4	Fine-tuning
The proposed pre-training approaches can be fine-tuned for visual speech recognition using any
sequence classification loss. In this paper, we focus on fine-tuning with the connectionist temporal
classification (CTC) (Graves et al., 2006) and attention-based sequence-to-sequence cross-entropy
loss (Bahdanau et al., 2016) (S2S for brevity), which are the most popular choices. Assume that
the feature sequence output of our pre-trained model is e1:T and the ground-truth transcription is
w = w1, w2, ..., ws. For CTC, a projection layer is used to map the visual feature sequence into
the output probabilities: pt = Softmax(Wftet + bft), where Wft ∈ Rd×(U+1), bft ∈ RU+1
and U is the output vocabulary size (+1: plus blank symbol). The model is trained with CTC loss:
Lctc = - log P∏∈b-i(w)p(∏∣eι:τ), where B maps an alignment sequence ∏ to w. For S2S, a
tranformer decoder is appended to the pre-trained encoder to autoregressively decode the feature
sequence e1:T into target probabilities p(wt|w1:t-1, e1:T). The whole model is trained with cross
entropy loss: Ls2s = - Pts=1 logp(wt |w1:t-1, e1:T).
4	Experiment
4.1	Setup
We conduct experiments on two datasets: LRS3 (Afouras et al., 2018b) with 433 hours of tran-
scribed English videos and VoxCeleb2 (Chung et al., 2018) with 2442 hours of unlabeled mul-
tilingual videos. We only use the English portion of VoxCeleb2, which amounts to 1,326 hours

of content. The inputs to our backbone model are lip Regions-Of-Interest (ROIs) for the visual
stream and log filterbank energy feature for the audio stream. The image encoder is a modified
ResNet-18, which has been used in prior work (Ma et al., 2021b; Martinez et al., 2020; Stafylakis
& Tzimiropoulos, 2017). The audio encoder is simply a linear projection layer. We consider two
model configurations: BASE with 12 transformer blocks and LARGE with 24 transformer blocks.
For BASE and LARGE, the embedding dimension/feed-forward dimension/attention heads in each
transformer block are 768/3072/12 and 1024/4096/16 respectively. The number of parameters in
BASE and LARGE are 103M and 325M respectively. α in equation 4 is set to 0.
The model uses five iterations of feature clustering and masked prediction during pre-training. See
Section B.4, E for details on clustering. For fine-tuning, we use phone targets for the CTC loss and
unigram-based subword units (Kudo, 2018) for the S2S loss. For decoding the CTC-trained model,
we use a 4-gram language model trained on LRS3 training text. For the S2S fine-tuned model, we
rely only on its own decoder module to incorporate language information, with no external language
model employed during inference. To further show the complementary relationship between AV-
HuBERT and existing approaches of using unlabeled data, we also experiment on combining AV-
HuBERT with self-training. Specifically, we generate pseudo labels for unlabeled data using a fine-
tuned HuBERT, and fine-tune the pre-trained AV-HuBERT model with the combination of pseudo-
labeled videos and original labeled videos. Note that no additional data is used when combined with
self-training. More details about the used datasets, data pre-processing, and model training are in
Section B.
4.2	Main Result
Table 1 compares the performance of our AV-HuBERT pre-training approach to previously pub-
lished supervised, semi-supervised, and self-supervised lip-reading systems using different amounts
of labeled and unlabeled data. Since the CTC and S2S fine-tuning approaches have similar trends,
only S2S results are shown in table 1. Complete results of CTC fine-tuning are in Table C.4.1
Using 1,759 hours unlabeled data for pre-training and only 30 hours of labeled data for fine-tuning,
AV-HuBERT-LARGE outperforms all the prior lip-reading models, including the model in (Makino
et al., 2019) which is trained with 1000 times more labeled data. Fine-tuning with the whole training
set of LRS3 further reduces WER. Combining our method and self-training achieves a new SOTA
result with only 7% of the data used for training the model in Makino et al. (2019). Furthermore, it
shows that AV-HuBERT and self-training are complementary to each other. Note the overall gain is
attributed mainly to AV-HuBERT as self-training alone leads to much worse performance (> 50%
WER). More details can be found in section C.3. Many prior models pre-train their visual front-end,
e.g., ResNet-18, using word-level annotated lip-reading videos, which is costly to collect since they
require word boundary information. In contrast to these models, our models are fully pre-trained
from scratch using the proposed approach.
Compared to the semi-supervised approach Jasper-KD (Afouras et al., 2020), which transcribed 334
hours of the English data in VoxCeleb2 using a pre-trained ASR system,2 our best model achieves
29% lower absolute WER benefiting from VoxCeleb2 for pre-training. Even when limiting our
model to the LRS3 data for pre-training and fine-tuning, our model surpasses their semi-supervised
system by 18%. Compared to LiRA (Ma et al., 2021a), a recently proposed self-supervised model for
lip-reading, AV-HuBERT-BASE provides 17.5% lower absolute WER on average for low-resource
and high-resource settings. The implementation details of LiRA are provided in Section B.5.
With the same network architecture, our pre-training approach significantly reduces WER com-
pared to training from scratch, in both low-resource (92.3% → 32.5%, LARGE) and high-resource
(62.3% → 28.6%, LARGE) settings. A qualitative view of the improvement can be found in Sec-
tion F. Additionally, we notice that our AV-HuBERT pre-training helps under a fully supervised set-
ting. Using the LRS3 data only (433 hours), pre-training followed by fine-tuning (41.6%, LARGE)
outperforms training a lip-reading model from scratch (62.3%, LARGE) to predict the output text.
1The prior work in (Ma et al., 2021b) uses an outdated version of LRS3 (before 2018) with speaker overlap
in training and test data, which is no longer publicly available. Its best results on the current version are included
in table 1& C.4 . For comparison, we simulate the old closed-speaker setting in Section C.2.
2The gap in data amount (334hr vs 1,759hr) is due to the different parameters and ASR model used for
filtering non-English data in VoxCeleb2.

AV-HuBERT, pre-trained on video-audio pairs, learns better fine-grained visual representation than
the scratch model trained on video-text pairs. The benefits of AV-HuBERT pre-training in various
labeled data setups can be found in Section C.1.
4.3	AV-HuBERT vs. Visual HuBERT
We compare AV-HuBERT against a suite of alternatives, including the Single-modal and Cross-
modal Visual HuBERT in Table 2. All the models are BASE pretrained on 433 hours of unlabeled
data and fine-tuned on 30 hours of labeled data. For this comparison, we use CTC fine-tuning due
to its computational efficiency and given their similarity in results trends to S2S.

As shown in table 2, target cluster assignments driven from a single modality, either audio or visual,
do not provide much WER reduction beyond the second iteration. Training the AV-HuBERT model
7
Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2022
using targets driven from audio-visual features keeps improving for more iterations and achieves
better final performance. As mentioned in Section 3, visual information is complementary to audio
input; hence, using both produces higher quality target clusters. Measuring the quality of different
target labels using cluster quality metrics such as purity and NMI shows the same trend observed
from lip-reading WER (See appendix E.1).
Fixing target labels used for the masked-prediction pre-training, AV-HUBERT (AV∕MFCC→ A) out-
performs the Cross-modal Visual HuBERT (V∕MFCC→A) by a large margin. AV-HuBERT effec-
tively transfers knowledge from audio into the visual encoder and the backbone transformer model
to benefit visual-only fine-tuning and inference. In contrast to AV-HuBERT, iterative pre-training
brings much smaller gains to single-modality visual HuBERT ("V∕MFCC一V'',''V∕HoG→V").
Starting with audio features is critical for learning effective target labels for the masked-prediction
task. Phonetic information, which is crucial for lip-reading, is primarily present in the audio stream.
All the models considered so far are based on audio feature MFCC clustering in their initial iteration.
As is shown in the "HoG→V*row, using hand-engineered visual features provides a lousy starting
point for iterative learning. Visual features such as HoG mainly incorporate low-level visual cues
such as edges and luminance, which is irrelevant to the downstream recognition task. Using features
of a higher correlation with phonetic units are more likely to benefit the final lip-reading model.
Indeed, clustering MFCC features show much higher purity (30.3%) than HoG clusters (16.4%) if
one considers phone labels as the target units, as shown in Table E.1.
4.4	Multilingual vs. Monolingual
Since the correlation between lip movements and the produced sound is governed by the vocal
apparatus that is language-agnostic, the proposed AV-HuBERT can utilize multi-lingual data for
such learning. This would be particularly beneficial for low-resource languages. Nevertheless, the
masked language modeling aspect in AV-HuBERT is still language-dependent, implying that mixing
other languages would increase the language domain discrepancy. To study how these two factors
affect AV-HuBERT, we compare using monolingual English data only versus multilingual videos in
the pre-training phase. In particular, we vary the amount of English data we use in pre-training while
the number of non-English utterances is fixed to 1,116 hours in all the settings. For simplicity, we
train AV-HuBERT (BASE) for one iteration with MFCC clusters and fine-tune it with CTC using 30
hours of labeled data.
Table 3: WER (%) with different amounts of unlabeled English utterances in pre-training. Non-En
data: 1,116 hours. Labeled data for fine-tuning: 30 hours.
Hours of En data for Pre-Training	0	100	400	800	1759
Pre-train on En only, WER (%)	84.1	77.8	68.9	67.9	59.9
Pre-train on En + 1,116 hr of non-En, WER (%)	70.6	68.4	67.4	66.6	64.3
As is shown in table 3, using non-English data in pre-training significantly reduces WER when
there are no or very little English data in pre-training (≤ 100 hours). As we increase the amount
of English data, the gain diminishes because the out-of-domain effect brought by non-English data
outweighs the benefit of the overall increase in pre-training data. Using the whole English data only
for pre-training is better than combining it with other languages (59.9% vs. 64.3%). Training with
5 iterations leads to similar results (47.3% vs. 48.9%). This experiment highlights the importance
of the domain match between pre-training and fine-tuning data. For zero/low-resource settings,
merging data from other languages in pre-training benefits the downstream task. When the unlabeled
data from the target language is abundant, limiting the pre-training data to one language is beneficial.
4.5	ASR performance
The multimodal clusters produced by AV-HuBERT, which have higher quality than audio-HuBERT
targets, can also benefit speech pre-training. To test our hypothesis, we trained an audio-HuBERT,
with only audio input during the masked-prediction pre-training, for one iteration with cluster as-
signments driven from AV-HuBERT features. We also pre-trained an audio-HuBERT from scratch
8
Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2022
using clusters driven from the MFCC features for three iterations. The two pre-trained models are
evaluated on a downstream ASR task.
Table 4 shows the performance of different models fine-tuned on the ASR task. We only include the
performance of S2S fine-tuning for our models as it consistently outperforms the CTC fine-tuning.
An audio-HuBERT pre-trained using targets generated by AV-HuBERT features outperforms the
vanilla audio-HuBERT in low-resource (30h) and high-resource settings (433h) fine-tuning settings
across different model architectures. With the same amount of labeled data, our best model (1.4%)
outperforms the prior SOTA (2.3%) even without an external language model during inference.
Given that the AV-HuBERT model utilizes both modalities at its input, it can be fine-tuned, in prin-
ciple, for the ASR downstream task. In practice, we notice pre-training an audio-HuBERT with
audio-visual cluster leads to better ASR performance (3.8%) than a pre-trained AV-HuBERT (4.6%),
potentially due to its hyperparameters being selected based on lip reading rather than ASR. In fact,
audio-HuBERT can be treated as a special case of AV-HuBERT with pm = 0, pa = 1.

5	Conclusion
We presented multiple pre-training models for visual speech recognition. Our AV-HuBERT model
leverages the strong correlation between the audio and lip movement streams for self-supervised
audio-visual speech representation learning. Our pre-training approaches iteratively alternate be-
tween feature clustering and learning new features through a masked-prediction loss. The AV-
HuBERT model consumes masked image and audio frames to predict target cluster assignments.
The targets are initially generated from MFCC features and gradually refined through iterative train-
ing. Experiments on visual speech recognition show that AV-HuBERT achieves SOTA using 433
hours of text transcriptions, two orders of magnitude less than the 31,000 hours of labeled data used
in the prior best approach. When using only one-thousandth of labeled data, the lip-reading perfor-
mance outperforms the prior SOTA by more than 10% (relative). AV-HuBERT also improves the
representation for the ASR downstream task. An audio-HuBERT model trained with targets gener-
ated by an AV-HuBERT model shows superior performance, achieving the SOTA in the audio-based
speech recognition in the LRS3 dataset. As future work, AV-HuBERT can be applied for multilin-
gual lip-reading in low-resource languages. Additionally, our approach can be extended to other
applications of visual speech representation, such as speech enhancement and generation.

B Detailed Experimental Setup
B.1	Datasets
LRS3 (Afouras et al., 2018b) is the largest publicly available sentence-level lip reading dataset to
date. It consists of over 400 hours of video, extracted from TED & TEDx talks in English from
YouTube. In the original dataset, the training data is split into two partitions: pretrain (403 hours)
and trainval (30 hours). Both parts are transcribed at the sentence level and come from the same
source as the test set. The pretrain set differs from trainval in that the duration of its video clips
are of a much wider range and can be shorter or longer than a full sentence. In the low-resource
setup, we only use trainval as the labeled data. As no official development set is provided, we
randomly select 1,200 sequences from trainval as the validation set (about 1 hour) for early stopping
and hyperparameter tuning.
VoxCeleb2 (Chung et al., 2018) is originally created for multilingual audio-visual speaker recogni-
tion and it contains over 2,442 hours of utterances of over 6,000 speakers extracted from YouTube
videos. The dataset naturally serves our purpose as it does not contain ground-truth transcriptions.
The VoxCeleb2 has substantial domain discrepency to the LRS3 data as its utterances are from multi-
ple languages and includes videos in a larger variety of domains including interviews, talks, excerpts
under indoor and outdoor environments. In VoxCeleb2, by default we only use the English portion
for pre-training. As no ground-truth language label is given in the VoxCeleb2, we use a simple
heuristic to choose the English samples. Specifically, we use an off-the-shelf character-based ASR
model (Hsu et al., 2021a) trained on Librispeech which achieves 1.9%/3.5% WER on clean/other
test set. We run greedy decoding on the VoxCeleb2 and use the proportion of valid English words
to determine if a target utterance is English or not. An utterance is only selected if the proportion of
valid English words is higher than 60%. The total amount of unlabeled data after filtering is 1,326
hours.
B.2	Data Preprocessing
For each video clip, we detect the 68 facial keypoints using dlib (King, 2009) and align each frame to
a reference face frame via affine transformation. We crop a 96 × 96 region-of-interest (ROI) centered
on the mouth. Each image frame is converted to grayscale. We randomly cropped 88 × 88 from
the whole ROI and randomly flipped it horizontally with probablity of 0.5 during training. At test
time, 88 × 88 ROI is center cropped and does not go through horizontal flipping. The preprocessing
steps remain same as prior works in lip reading (Martinez et al., 2020; Ma et al., 2021b). For the
associated audio, we extract the 26-dimensional log filterbank energy feature at a stride of 10 ms
from the raw waveform and use it as input to the model. As the image frames are sampled at 25Hz,
we stack the 4 neighboring acoustic frames to synchronize the two modalities.
B.3	AV-HuBERT Model Architecture
In the modified ResNet-18 (Ma et al., 2021b; Martinez et al., 2020; Stafylakis & Tzimiropoulos,
2017), the first convolutional layer is substituted by a 3D convolutional layer with kernel size 5 ×
7 × 7. The visual feature tensor is flattened into a single-dimensional vector through a 2D average
pooling layer in the end. We use one linear projection layer as the audio encoding module. The
acoustic features are normalized by per-frame statistics before feeding into the network (Ba et al.,
2016). We use a dropout ofp = 0.1 after the self-attention block within each transformer layer, and
each transformer layer is dropped (Fan et al., 2020) at a rate of 0.1.
B.4	Training and Inference
Pretraining Our models are implemented with fairseq (Ott et al., 2019). The whole network is
randomly initialized before pre-training. In pre-training, the model is trained for five iterations in
total. For the initial iteration, we generate the targets by running k-means clustering algorithm on
39-dimensional MFCC feature (13 coefficients with its first- and second-order derivatives) extracted
from raw audio waveform. For the subsequent iterations, the feature from an intermediate layer
of the model in the previous iteration is used for clustering. The layer index (one-based) used for
clustering in iteration 1-4 are {9, 12, 12, 12}. The number of features are clustered to {100, 100,
14
Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2022
500, 1000, 2000} respectively for the 5 iterations. See section E.3 for analysis. To save training
time, we always use the BASE model to generate clusters and LARGE model is only trained in the
5th iteration.
We set both pm and pa to 0.5 for modality dropout at training time. To extract features for clustering,
both modalities are used. We adopt the strategy used in wav2vec 2.0 (Baevski et al., 2020) to
generate masks, where p% of all frames are randomly selected as start and subsequent l frames are
masked. In iteration 1-4, we mask the fused features and set p/l to be 8/10 respectively as we observe
such practice generates higher quality cluster assignments (see section E.2). In the last iteration, we
set p/l to be 6/5 for video and 8/10 for audio (see section D).
We train the model with Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2015), warming up the learning rate for the first 8%
of updates to a peak of 0.002 and then linearly decay it. Videos are batched together to not exceed
1,000 image frames (40 seconds) per GPU. Both BASE and LARGE models are updated for 400K
and 600K steps at each iteration, respectively in 433h/1759h unlabeled settings. We train on 32 and
64V100-GpUs for BASE and LArGe. On average, each iteration takes ~ 2.0/3.0 days for BASE
and ~ 2.4/3.6 days for LARGE in using 433h/1759h unlabeled data for pre-training.
Fine-tuning After pre-training, we fine-tune the AV-HuBERT model on labeled (video, text) pairs.
The audio encoder is removed and its output is replaced by a zero-vector. In CTC fine-tuning, a ran-
domly initialized projection layer is added on top of the transformer to map features into phonemes.
The lexicon is constructed with CMUDict (cmu). In fine-tuning with S2S, we use a 6-layer/9-layer
transformer decoder on BASE and LARGE model to decode features into unigram-based subword
units (Kudo, 2018). The vocabulary size in CTC and S2S are 46 and 1000 respectively.
In CTC, the pre-trained model is updated from the initial iteration without any freezing. The model
is fine-tuned for 30K/100K steps respectively in 30h/433h setting. In S2S, the pre-trained model
(i.e., encoder) is frozen for the first N% updates . N is 100 and 50 for 30h and 433h labeled setting
respectively. The entire model is trained for 18K/45K steps in the 30h/433h setting. Both models
are trained with Adam, with the learning rate being warmed up for the first P% of updates to a peak
of 0.001 and linearly decayed. p is tuned among {10, 30, 50}. All hyperparamters are tuned on the
validation set.
Decoding For CTC, we use a 4-gram language model trained on text data in the LRS3 training set.
The perplexity of the 4-gram LM on test set is 110.5. No language model is used for S2S decoding.
For CTC, we tune the beam width among {5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 150}, the language model weight
among {0, 1, 2, 4, 8} and word insertion penalty among {±4, ±2, ±1, 0}. For S2S, The beam
width and length penalty are tuned among {5, 10, 20, 50} and {0, ±1}. The tuning is done on the
validation set.
Self-Training We apply self-training on LARGE AV-HuBERT. Specifically, the fine-tuned LARGE
HuBERT model(AZMFCC→AV, Table 4) is used to assign pseudo-labels to the unlabeled audio-
visual data. In 30hZ433h setting, the amount of data for fine-tuning AZMFCC→AV are 30h and 433h
respectively. The pre-trained AV-HuBERT LARGE is fine-tuned with the pseudo-labeled videos and
videos with ground-truth text labels (30hZ433h). Note the data used here is exactly same with the
case of using AV-HuBERT only.
B.5	LiRA Implementation
We re-implemented the LiRA (Ma et al., 2021a) training objective in our framework, as there does
not exist publicly available implementations and we aim to focus the comparison on the pre-training
objective rather than the architectural difference. We use the same backbone architecture as the
BASE AV-Hubert except the output layer being a linear project layer with an output dimension
of 256. The 256-dimensional frame pASE+ feature is extracted from the audio with its official
implementation in (Ravanelli et al., 2020). The original pASE+ feature is downsampled to 25Hz for
synchronization with the visual stream. The pre-trained model is fine-tuned in both CTC and S2S.
The optimizer and learning rate schedule in pre-training, hyperparameter search in fine-tuning and
decoding remain the same as AV-HUBERT. Note with our implementation, the WER is reduced by
23% (94.3% → 71.9%) using LiRA when the percentage of labeled data is 6.9% (30h labeled, 433h
in total), while Ma et al. (2021a) achieves ~ 10% improvement in a similar setting.

use 433 hours of unlabeled data (LRS3 only) and randomly selected 1, 10 and 100 hours of labeled
data for fine-tuning. Overall pre-training brings large and consistent gains across different amount
of labeled data. Specifically CTC-based fine-tuning outperforms S2S-based fine-tuning in low-
resource settings (1-hour and 10-hour). The larger number of parameters as well as the lack of a
language model for decoding makes S2S model more likely to overfit especially when the amount
of fine-tuning data is small.

C.2 Performance on Seen Speakers
The current LRS3 benchmark is under the open-speaker setting, where the speaker identities in
training and test set do not overlap. To test the lip reading performance for a fixed set of speakers
which is the case for an early versions of LRS3 used before October 2018, we randomly choose
5 groups of utterances from the trainval partition of LRS3 as test set and repeat experiments for
each group independently. Each group contains 1322 utterance, which is of the same amount as
the original test set. The model we compare is the AV-HUBERT LARGE pre-trained with 1,759
unlabeled data. As is shown in table C.2, the average WER achieved by our model for seen speakers
is 18.0 ± 0.5%, which is significantly lower than the WER for unseen speakers (30.5%) under the
open-speaker setting.

	Test set (seen speakers) 12345	AVG
WER (%)	17.4	18.6	18.5	17.5	18.3	18.0 ± 0.5
C.3 Performance of self-training only
Table C.3 shows the performance of only applying self-training. The WER of a self-training only
model is significantly higher than AV-HuBERT and self-trained AV-HuBERT, which suggests that
the gain of the combined approach is primarily from AV-HuBERT.
C.4 Full Results with CTC Fine-Tuning
Table C.4 shows the full results on LRS3, which includes the CTC fine-tuning performance for all
the models we implemented. In general, the conclusions we draw from S2S (e.g., the benefits of
our pre-training approach in different settings, the improvement over LiRA) in section 4.2 holds for
CTC as well.

433 hours of unlabeled data. The model is fine-tuned with 30 hours of labeled data using CTC.

Masking Strategy In the first part of table D.1, we compare the proposed masking strategy against
several alternatives. Feature masking applies span mask at feature level and leads to the worst per-
formance, which is due to the leakage of information to ResNet. Directly masking image sequence
with random Gaussian noise or a learned embedding slightly improves the performance by pre-
venting the prior issue. However, those artificial frames also corrupts the raw image sequence and
enlarges the domain gap in videos between pre-training and fine-tuning. On the other hand, our pro-
posed method achieves better performance. Specifically, using segments from the same utterance
(“Sub, (same, seg)”) as the imposter leads to the best result compared to sampling from a different
utterance (“Sub, (diff, seg)”) or sampling non-consecutive frames from the same utterance (“Sub,
(same, frm)”).3 The filled-in fake images are visually similar to the raw images and substitution
with a segment keeps the temporal smoothness making the replaced segment more realistic, which
enforces the ResNet to encode more fine-grained visual details.
Masking probability We set two different masking probabilities for audio and visual stream in the
last iteration. The probabilities of an acoustic frame and image frame being masked are 0.8 and 0.3
respectively. As is shown in the second part of table D.1, setting masks for audio and visual stream
independently is essential because the optimal masking probability for audio and visual stream are
different. Audio encoder tends to deteriorate into a simple acoustic feature extractor when mask
length is small. On the other hand, long visual mask will lead to the model lacking context to
distinguish between fake and real images.
Modality dropout The third part of table D.1 compares the model performance with and without
modality dropout. Randomly dropping audio sequence prevents the model from over-relying on
audio for masked prediction and helps the visual representation learning.
Where to compute prediction loss In the last part of table D.1, we compare the choice of masked
prediction vs. prediction. The loss weight on unmasked region does not have a large impact on the
fine-tuning performance. This is different from the findings in Audio HuBERT Hsu et al. (2021a),
where masked prediction leads to much better performance. Given image frames as input, the pre-
diction of cluster assignments, which are mostly determined by the accompanied audio stream,
helps encode phonetic information into the visual representation. The task is much less trivial than
3To avoid using original frames for substitution, pi in equation 3 is selected from [0, 2si - ti] ∪ [ti , Tf -
ti + si] if the imposter is from the same sequence.

a single-modal model (audio-HuBERT), where setting non-zero weight on unmasked prediction can
easily make the model deteriorate into an acoustic feature extractor. In addition, the high quality of
targets in the last iteration also makes such prediction more helpful.

E Analysis on Clustering
E.1 Measuring Clustering Quality
For analysis, we use frame-level phonetic labels as the ground-truth and match its correlation be-
tween cluster assignments. The phonetic labels are obtained via forced alignement from a mono-
phone based HMM-GMM ASR model trained on LRS3. In particular, we use clustering purity
and Normalize Mutual Information (NMI) as the evaluation metrics. Table E.1 shows that (1) The
quality of cluster assignments is consistent with fine-tuning performance across different models (2)
Hand-engineered audio feature (MFCC, NMI: 21.5%) has much stronger correlation with phonetic
labels than the visual feature (HoG, NMI: 1.6%) (3) Audio-visual clusters (NMI: 44.2%) are of
better quality than pure audio-based clusters (NMI: 39.7%). (4) In single-modality visual Hubert
(V∕HoG→V), feature quality is improved negligibly through iteration training.

The metrics of cluster assignments and WER in last iteration of each model are in boldface.

E.2 Feature Masking Produces Better Features for Clustering
In iteration 1-4, we apply the mask in the fused feature. We observe such practice generates targets of
higher quality, thus helping future iterations more. Table E.2 shows a comparison between such two
different masking strategies. Input-level masking enhances the learning of visual representation (see
table D.1) while produces worse audio-visual feature (NMI: 27.2%). In contrast, the two streams
of original input are better aligned in feature-level masking which is consistent with the cluster
generation process, thus leading to better audio-visual clusters (NMI: 37.7%).

cluster assignments used to train the model)

AV∕MFCC→AV (it1, L9) w∕ Input Masking	100	34.5	27.2
E.3 Clustering Quality Across Layers
Figure E.1 shows the clustering quality of features of different layers in different iterations. The
cluster assignment quality generally improves with more iterations. In the first iteration, features in
21
Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2022
the middle layers show higher quality than the other layers. The target for the first iteration (MFCC
clusters) is of worse quality, thus later layers that are more correlated with targets do not yield the
best cluster. Target quality improves with more training iterations, thus the best feature layer shifts
towards the end. Setting a larger number of clusters increases the clustering quality as can be seen
from the comparison between ”varied clusters” and ”2K clusters”. In terms of the 12th layer which
we choose, the highest NMI (44.2%) is achieved in the last iteration. In addition, more iterations of
training improves the overall quality of clusters produced by a model though the highest NMI/purity
among all layers does not necessarily increase in later iterations. Therefore, setting a larger number
of iterations brings stable gains which are more robust to the index of layer chosen for clustering.
It is important as the purity/NMI, whose measurement rely on a supervised model, are not used for
hyperparameter search in practice.

F Qualitative examples
Figure F.2 shows the example outputs from different models. Our self-supervised model is the
LARGE AV-HUBERT pre-trained with 1,759 hours unlabeled data and fine-tuned with 433 hours
labeled data. The baseline model is the supervised baseline trained with 433 hours labeled data.
Both models use the S2S criterion for supervised training and have the same number of parameters.
Qualitatively, our approach provides transcriptions with much higher quality. The baseline approach
confuses among words of similar sound while our model output more semantically sound sentences.
Figure F.2 also shows typical errors made by our model. We noticed many errors are on short
sentences. This is mainly because lip reading relies heavily on the context for recognition due
to the existence of homophomes. Thus the error rates in lip reading are notably higher in short
utterances, which differs from ASR, as can be seen from figure F.1. Substitution among words with
homophemes (’fiction’ vs. ’vision’ in a.4, ’part’ vs. ’bunk’ in b.5) is another source of error made
by the model.
