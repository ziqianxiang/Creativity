Recent progress in language model pre-training has achieved a great success via
leveraging large-scale unstructured textual data. However, it is still a challenge
to apply pre-training on structured tabular data due to the absence of large-scale
high-quality tabular data. In this paper, we propose TaPEx to show that table pre-
training can be achieved by learning a neural SQL executor over a synthetic cor-
pus, which is obtained by automatically synthesizing executable SQL queries and
their execution outputs. TaPEx addresses the data scarcity challenge via guiding
the language model to mimic a SQL executor on the diverse, large-scale and high-
quality synthetic corpus. We evaluate TaPEx on four benchmark datasets. Exper-
imental results demonstrate that TaPEx outperforms previous table pre-training
approaches by a large margin and achieves new state-of-the-art results on all of
them. This includes improvements on the weakly-supervised WikiSQL denota-
tion accuracy to 89.5% (+2.3%), the WikiTableQuestions denotation accuracy
to 57.5% (+4.8%), the SQA denotation accuracy to 74.5% (+3.5%), and the
TabFact accuracy to 84.2% (+3.2%). To our knowledge, this is the first work to
exploit table pre-training via synthetic executable programs and to achieve new
state-of-the-art results on various downstream tasks. Our code can be found at

1 Introduction
Pre-trained language models (LMs) such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) and BART (Lewis et al.,
2020) have hit a success on a range of free-form natural language (NL) tasks. By learning from a
large amount of unstructured textual data, these models have demonstrated surprising capabilities in
understanding NL sentences. Inspired by this huge success, researchers have attempted to extend
pre-training to structured tabular data (Herzig et al., 2020; Yin et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2021a; Wang
et al., 2021b; Deng et al., 2020; 2021; Shi et al., 2021a). However, different from free-form NL
sentences, tabular data often contains rich and meaningful structural information, for which existing
pre-training approaches designed for unstructured data are not well suited.
To apply pre-training techniques on structured tabular data, there exist two key challenges: (i) where
to obtain a large-scale pre-training corpus with high quality, and (ii) how to design an efficient pre-
training task for table pre-training. For the first challenge, existing works generally collect parallel
data including NL sentences and tables as the pre-training corpus, since downstream tasks often
involve a joint reasoning over both free-form NL sentences and tables. They either crawled tables
and their surrounding NL sentences from the Web (Herzig et al., 2020; Yin et al., 2020; Deng et al.,
2021), or synthesized NL sentences on available tables (Yu et al., 2021a; Shi et al., 2021a). However,
as pointed by Yin et al. (2020), the raw data mined from the Web is extremely noisy and requires
complicated heuristics to clean. Conversely, the synthesis method is easier to control the data quality,
but it usually requires experts to write hundreds of templates, which is both costly and often lacking
diversity. Regarding the pre-training task, existing works often employ different variants of Masked
Language Modeling (MLM) (Devlin et al., 2019) to guide LMs to learn better representations of

tabular data. For example, TaPaS (Herzig et al., 2020) used MLM with whole word masking, and
TaBERT (Yin et al., 2020) proposed Masked Column Prediction (MCP) to encourage the model to
recover the names and data types of masked columns. Despite their success, they still largely treat
tabular data as a structural format of text, which leads to the need of an extremely large corpus for
their table pre-training. All of these hinder the progress of table pre-training.
In this paper, we present a novel execution-centric table pre-training approach TAPEX (TAble Pre-
training via Execution). It addresses the above challenges and achieves efficient table pre-training
via approximating the structural reasoning process of formal languages over tables. The structural
reasoning process is associated with the executability of tables, i.e., tables are inherently capable of
supporting various reasoning operations (e.g., summing over a column in the table). In particular,
TaPEx approximates the structural reasoning process of SQL queries by pre-training LMs to mimic
the behavior of a SQL execution engine on tables. As shown in Figure 1, by sampling executable
SQL queries over tables, TaPEx first synthesizes a large-scale pre-training corpus. Then it contin-
ues pre-training a language model to output the execution results of these SQL queries, which are
obtained from the SQL execution engine. Since the diversity of SQL queries can be systematically
guaranteed, we can easily synthesize a diverse, large-scale, and high-quality pre-training corpus.
Our key insight is that if a language model can be pre-trained to faithfully “execute” SQL queries
and produce correct results, it should have a deep understanding of tables. Thus, the execution
pre-training task could be more efficient in understanding tables and reasoning over tables. To our
knowledge, TaPEx is the first one to explore table pre-training via synthetic executable programs.
TaPEx is conceptually simple and easy to implement. In this paper, we regard the pre-training
as a sequence generation task and employ an encoder-decoder model. Specifically, we employ the
pre-trained encoder-decoder language model BART (Lewis et al., 2020) as the backbone. Further-
more, we examine the effectiveness of TaPEx via two fundamental downstream tasks: table-based
question answering (TableQA) and table-based fact verification (TableFV). To enable fine-tuning of
downstream tasks to take full advantage of TaPEx, we reformulate these tasks using the encoder-
decoder sequence generation paradigm. We evaluate TaPEx using four well-known benchmark
datasets. Experimental results clearly demonstrate that TaPEx can bring significant and consistent
improvements on these datasets. For example, TAPEX obtains an absolute improvement of 19.5%
over BART in the WikiTableQuestions dataset. Furthermore, TaPEx yields strong results even
with a small pre-training corpus, demonstrating its high efficiency. Finally, TaPEx achieves new
state-of-the-art results on all experimental benchmarks, outperforming previous approaches by a
large margin, including complicated table pre-training approaches with several heuristics in data
processing. We will make our code, model, and data publicly available to facilitate future research.
2 Fine-Tuning on Downstream Tasks
Before diving into the details of our proposed table pre-training, we start by describing how to
tackle downstream task fine-tuning with the encoder-decoder sequence generation paradigm. In this
section, we first present the background of two fundamental table related downstream tasks: table-
based question answering (TableQA) and table-based fact verification (TableFV). Then we elaborate
on our generative fine-tuning method in detail.

Fine-tuning
Figure 2:	The illustration of the fine-tuning procedure in our method. During fine-tuning, we feed
the concatenation of an NL sentence and its corresponding table taken from the downstream task to
the model, and train it to output the answer (e.g., “Marisela Moreno Montero”).
2.1	Downstream Task Formulation
As mentioned in § 1, downstream tasks always involve joint reasoning over free-form NL sentences
and tables. Therefore, examples of downstream tasks generally contain an NL sentence x and a
(semi-)structured table T as the model input. Each NL sentence consists of K tokens as x =
xi, x2, ∙∙∙, XK, while each table T consists of M rows {ri}Mι, in which each row r contains N
cell values {shi,ji}jN=1. Each cell shi,ji includes a list of tokens and corresponds to a table header cj.
As for the output, there are variations among different tasks. In this paper, we focus on TableQA and
TableFV. TableQA aims to retrieve table content to answer the user’s question, and thus its output
is either a list of cell values or number(s) calculated over the selected table region by aggregation
functions (e.g., SUM). Itis worth noting that for semi-structured tables, the answer may not be exactly
table cell values, but their normalized forms (e.g., from 2k to 2,000), which makes downstream
tasks more challenging (Oguz et al., 2020). As for TableFV, the output is a binary decision entailed
or refused, indicating whether the NL sentence follows the fact indicated by the table.
2.2	Generative Fine-Tuning
In this section, we present a generative approach for downstream task fine-tuning. Unlike previous
works, we model both TableQA and TableFV as sequence generation tasks and leverage generative
LMs to generate the output autoregressively. Taking TableQA as an example, given an NL question,
our method generates the answer by decoding it in a word-by-word fashion.
Architecture Our method theoretically applies for any LM as long as it can generate sequence,
such as GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020) and UniLM (Bao et al., 2020). In our experiments, we imple-
mented our method based on BART (Lewis et al., 2020), a widely used pre-trained encoder-decoder
model. BART follows a standard sequence-to-sequence Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al.,
2017), with modifying ReLU activation functions to GeLU. It is pre-trained via corrupting sentences
(i.e., randomly sampling length-variable spans and masking each one with a single [MASK] token)
and then optimizing a reconstruction loss. As for the number of layers, we employ the BARTLarge
configuration in our experiments, i.e., 12 layers are used in both the encoder and the decoder.
Model Input As illustrated in Figure 2, the input contains an NL sentence and its corresponding
table. Encoding the NL sentence is relatively straightforward, while encoding the table is non-trivial
since it exhibits underlying structures. In practice, we flatten the table into a sequence so that it can
be fed directly into the model. By inserting several special tokens to indicate the table boundaries, a
flattened table can be represented as T* = [head] ,cι,…,CN, [row] , 1, ri, [row] , 2, r2,…,rM.
Here [HEAD] and [ROW] are special tokens indicating the region of table headers and rows respec-
tively, and the number after [Row] is used to indicate the row index. Notably, we also separate
headers or cells in different columns using a vertical bar | . Finally, we prefix the flattened table T*
with the NL sentence x and feed them into the model encoder.
Model Output With attending on the encoder, the decoder is responsible for modeling the outputs
of both TableQA and TableFV. For TableQA, the output is the concatenation of the answer(s) sepa-
rated by commas, and the decoder generates it autoregressively. In this way, our model can readily
support (almost) all operators and their compositions in TableQA. For TableFV, as BART does for
sequence classification tasks (Lewis et al., 2020), the same input is fed into both the encoder and
decoder, and a binary classifier upon the hidden state of the last token in the decoder is used for the
output. Notably, our method can be easily extended to other table related tasks in a similar way.

Pre-training

Figure 3:	The illustration of the pre-training procedure in our method. During pre-training, we feed
the concatenation of a sampled SQL query and a sampled table to the model, and train it to output
the corresponding execution result (e.g., “Pairs”).
Fine-Tuning Strategy Since our approach can perform various downstream tasks on the same
architecture, it can easily perform multi-task learning. Therefore, we explore two ways of fine-
tuning, one for vanilla fine-tuning and the other for multi-task fine-tuning. The former is to fine-tune
the model on each individual downstream task. The latter is inspired by TaPaS (Herzig et al.,
2020) and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020), which first fine-tunes the model on related or similar intermediate
downstream tasks and then continues to fine-tune it on the target downstream task.
Discussion Our approach comes with several advantages: (i) Flexibility: due to the powerful ex-
pressiveness of encoder-decoder models, our approach can readily adapt to (almost) any kind of
output. (ii) Conveniency: our approach does not require any modification (e.g., table-specific mask-
ing) on pre-trained LMs, and can be trained in an end-to-end manner. (iii) Transferability: since we
formulate downstream tasks as sequence generation tasks, which allows different tasks to share the
same training protocol, it is easy to perform multi-task fine-tuning for our approach.
3	Table Pre-training via Execution
As mentioned in § 1, TaPEx achieves efficient table pre-training by training LMs to mimic the
behavior of a SQL execution engine. In this section, we illustrate how to conduct table pre-training
from two aspects: the pre-training task and the pre-training corpus.
3.1	Pre-training Task
Following the MLM task in NL pre-training, existing works usually use reconstruction tasks for
table pre-training. They generally take corrupted tables and NL sentences as input and try to recover
the corrupted parts, in order to strengthen the linking between NL sentences and tables. While these
pre-training tasks perform well, they tend to be less efficient since they usually require an extremely
large pre-training corpus.
To design efficient tasks for table pre-training, we argue that the key lies in the executability of tables.
That is to say, structured tables enable us to perform discrete operations on them via programming
languages such as SQL queries, while unstructured text does not. Taking this into account, TaPEx
adopts SQL execution as the only pre-training task. As illustrated in Figure 3, the pre-training of
TaPEx is similar to the procedure of the above generative fine-tuning. Given an executable SQL
query and a table T, TAPEX first concatenates the SQL query and the flattened table T* to feed
into the model encoder. Then it obtains the query’s execution result through an off-the-shelf SQL
executor (e.g., MySQL) to serve as the supervision for the model decoder. Intuitively, the pre-
training procedure is to encourage a language model to be a neural SQL executor. We believe that
if a language model can be trained to faithfully “execute” SQL queries and produce correct results,
then it should have a deep understanding of tables.
3.2	Pre-training Corpus
Synthesizing the pre-training corpus is very important for table pre-training. Generally, there are
two key factors: the table source and the SQL query sampling strategy.

WEAK. Execution-Guided Decoding is proposed to
leverage execution results of SQL queries during in-
ference (Wang et al., 2018).
Table Source Following previous work by Yin et al. (2020), we choose publicly available semi-
structured tables as the table source. However, rather than requiring millions of raw tables in (Yin
et al., 2020), TaPEx works well even with only afew thousand tables. Therefore, instead of fetching
noisy tables from the Web and then heuristically filtering them, we pick high-quality tables right
from existing public datasets. Concretely, we randomly select nearly 1, 500 tables from the training
set of WikiTableQuestions (Pasupat & Liang, 2015) as the table source for our pre-training
corpus. Notice that there is no overlap between the tables used in our pre-training and the tables
used in the dev and test sets of all downstream tasks, so there is no data leakage problem.
Query Sampling Regarding the sampling of diverse SQL queries, there are various choices in
the literature. We can either sample SQL queries according to a probabilistic context-free grammar
(Wang et al., 2021a), or instantiate SQL templates over different tables (Zhong et al., 2020a). In
our experiments, we follow the latter, where SQL templates are automatically extracted from the
S QUALL dataset (Shi et al., 2020b). An example SQL template is: SELECT num1 WHERE text1
= val1, where num1 and text1 correspond to a numeric column and a text column respectively,
and val1 refers to one of the cell values with respect to the column text1. Given a SQL template,
at each instantiation, we uniformly sample headers and cell values from a sampled table to fill the
template, forming a concrete SQL query. Notably, SQL queries that execute with empty results are
discarded, because empty results do not reflect much information about the executability of tables.
This way, we can obtain a large-scale pre-training corpus with high quality.
4	Experiments
In this section, we evaluate TaPEx on different downstream tasks to verify its effectiveness.
Dataset and Evaluation We evaluate the performance of our approach on weakly-supervised
WikiSQL (WIKISQL-WEAK) (Zhong et al., 2017), WIKITABLEQUESTIONS (Pasupat & Liang,
2015), SQA (Iyyer et al., 2017), and TABFACT (Chen et al., 2020). Compared to WIKISQL-
Weak, which only requires filtering and optionally aggregating on table cell values, WikiTable-
Questions requires more complicated reasoning capabilities. SQA is a conversational benchmark,
which requires our approach to model the conversational context. Datset details can be found in Ap-
pendix A. For TableQA datasets, the evaluation metric is denotation accuracy, which checks whether
the predicted answer(s) is equal to the ground-truth answer(s). It is worth noting that we evaluate our
approach on WikiSQL-Weak with answer annotations provided by TaPaS (Herzig et al., 2020),
since nearly 2% of answers obtained from the official evaluation script are incorrect. For TABFACT,
the evaluation metric is accuracy, which is calculated using the percentage of correct prediction.
Implementation Details We implement our approach based on fairseq (Ott et al., 2019). During
pre-training, we synthesize up to 5 million pairs of SQL queries and their execution results for

TaPEx. In the following, unless specified explicitly, all the experimental results are by default
evaluated under the 5 million setting. Our pre-training procedure runs up to 50, 000 steps with a
batch size of 256. It takes about 36 hours on 8 Tesla V100 GPUs to finish the pre-training. The
best pre-training checkpoint is selected based on the loss on the validation set. For all downstream
datasets, the fine-tuning procedure runs up to 20, 000 steps with a batch size of 128. For both pre-
training and fine-tuning, the learning rate is 3×10-5.
4.1	Main Results
Table 1, Table 2, Table 3 and Table 4 summarize the experimental results of various models on
WikiSQL-Weak, WikiTableQuestions, SQA and TabFact respectively. For both dev and
test sets of all datasets, we report the median performance of our approach for five random runs.
WikiSQL-Weak As shown in Table 1, TAPEX outperforms all the baselines by a large margin.
On the test set of WIKISQL-WEAK, TAPEX registers a denotation accuracy of 89.5%, which is
3.7% higher than BART and 2.3% higher than the previous best performance. This is significant
since the previous best model has already utilized the execution-guided decoding. In short, TaPEx
achieves a new state-of-the-art result on the well-known benchmark WikiSQL-Weak.
WikiTableQuestions On the more challenging WIKITABLEQUESTIONS, TAPEX also
achieves a new state-of-the-art denotation accuracy of 57.5%, surpassing the previous best system
by 4.8% (Table 2). Meanwhile, we find that BART alone can only reach the denotation accuracy of
38.0%, much worse than the performance of previous pre-training models. We conjecture that the
performance degradation could be attributed to the relatively small amount of training data in Wik-
iTableQuestions, which makes the adaptation of BART to tabular structures more challenging.

Figure 4: The visualization results of attention weights from other tokens to the cell “adrian lewis”.
Intuitively, the darker the color, the more closely the word is associated with “adrian lewis”.
However, TAPEX delivers a dramatic improvement of 19.5% over BART, indicating that in the low
data regime, the improvements introduced by TaPEx are often more significant.
SQA Table 3 presents the performance of various models on the test set of SQA, where TaPEx
again obtains a new state-of-the-art denotation accuracy in terms of both the conversation level
(48.4%) and the sentence level (74.5%). This improvement is also a surprise to us since SQA
is a conversational dataset while our pre-training task is context-free. Meanwhile, the substantial
improvements of TaPEx over BART on SQA continues to verify the same observation that TaPEx
alleviates the low resource issue.
TabFact Beyond TableQA, TAPEX also excels at TableFV. As shown in Table 4, TAPEX
achieves new state-of-the-art results on all subsets of TabFact. For example, it surpasses the previ-
ous best system by 4.0% on Testcomplex. The result shows that TAPEX endows BART with generic
table understanding capabilities, which could be adapted to different downstream tasks, regardless
of whether these tasks are highly similar to the TaPEx pre-training task or not.
Overall Results Experimental results on four datasets show that TAPEX can broadly improve the
model ability on understanding tables, especially in the low data regime.
4.2 Multi-task Results
As discussed in § 2.2, our approach can easily perform multi-task learning, thereby conferring bene-
fits to downstream tasks. To verify it, we conducted multi-task fine-tuning experiments and obtained
the following findings: (1) when initialized by BART, multi-task fine-tuning boosts the performance
of the target task significantly; (2) when initialized by TaPEx, the gain of multi-task fine-tuning
tends to be marginal, suggesting that most of the “skills” (loosely speaking) gained by multi-task
learning can be acquired by our table pre-training. Detailed results can be found in Appendix B.
5	Analysis
In this section, we carefully analyze our approach in terms of various aspects. Besides, we perform
an exploratory analysis to provide more insights for future work, which can be found in Appendix C.
SQL Execution by Pre-training In order to understand how well TAPEX performs SQL exe-
cution after pre-training, we analyze its performance on nearly 20, 000 held-out SQL queries over
unseen tables. Overall, the SQL execution accuracy is relatively high, as TaPEx correctly “exe-
cutes” 89.6% of the SQL queries1. In particular, TAPEX performs better on Filter, Aggregate
and Superlative operators, indicating that it is highly accurate in table cell selection and table
aggregating. Regarding Arithmetic and Comparative operators, TAPEX also does a good job,
demonstrating its numerical reasoning skill on tables. To summarize, TaPEx has learned to be a
neural SQL executor with good selection, aggregating and numerical capabilities.
Table Understanding by Pre-training To provide insight on if TAPEX helps downstream tasks
understand tables better, we visualize and analyze the self-attention of TaPEx (without fine-tuning)
on sampled WikiTableQuestions examples. As shown in Figure 4, TaPEx seems to focus
more on the row and the header where a cell corresponds to. Taking the example from Figure 4, the
attention weights imply that “adrian lewis” is closely associated with the first column “player” and
the entire third row, which are the positions of “adrian lewis” in the structured table.
Table Reasoning by Pre-training To understand if TAPEX can improve table reasoning, we com-
pare the performance of TAPEX to BART on 500 randomly selected questions and manually ana-

lyzed them in Table 5. One can find that TaPEx significantly boosts the performance on all opera-
tors, implying that it does enhance BART’s capabilities for joint reasoning over text and tables.
The Scale of Pre-training Corpus Figure 5 illustrates downstream performance with different
scales of the pre-training corpus. It can be seen that even if our pre-training corpus is synthetic,
scaling up the pre-training corpus generally brings positive effects. The observation is analogous to
the one in language modeling (Brown et al., 2020): the larger the pre-training corpus, the better the
downstream performance. By the comparison across different datasets, we can find that for simple
tasks like WikiS QL-Weak, the gains by scaling up pre-training corpus become marginal, while
they remain non-trivial for complex tasks like TabFact. Meanwhile, both downstream datasets in
the low data regime show a positive trend by increasing the pre-training corpus. Conclusively, the
scale matters when the downstream task is difficult, or the downstream dataset is relatively small.
The Efficiency of Pre-training As mentioned in § 1, the pre-training efficiency of existing ta-
ble pre-training approaches is relatively low, as they usually require an extremely large corpus.
Therefore, taking WikiTableQuestions as an example, we compare the pre-training efficiency
of TAPEX with TAPAS (Herzig et al., 2020), TABERT (Yin et al., 2020) and GRAPPA (Yu et al.,
2021a). It is worth noting that part of the pre-training corpus for GraPPa comes from human-
annotated, high-quality parallel data. As shown in Figure 6, TaPEx can yield very promising
performance when using a much smaller pre-training corpus, indicating that our proposed SQL
execution pre-training task is more efficient than other table pre-training tasks.
Limitations The first limitation of our approach is that it cannot ideally handle large tables. As
mentioned above, we employ the table flattening technique to represent a table. It works well when
the table is relatively small, but it becomes infeasible when the table is too large to fit in memory.
In practice, we can compress tables by removing some unrelated rows or columns, which would
decrease downstream performance. The second limitation is that the task of text-to-SQL cannot
8

benefit from our proposed table pre-training. We have tried to apply TaPEx for a text-to-SQL task,
where the input remains the same and the output converts to SQL. However, TaPEx does not show
a significant advantage over BART. We attribute this to two factors: first, our synthetic pre-training
corpus does not contribute to grounding, one of the most important factors for semantic parsing (Liu
et al., 2021); second, table reasoning capabilities (e.g., aggregate) learned by TaPEx may not be
necessary for SQL generation. For example, a model could still understand an NL phrase “total” as
the aggregation function “sum”, even though it is unaware of the mathematical meaning of “sum”.
6	Related Work
Table Pre-training The work most related to ours is table pre-training whose key factors include
the pre-training corpus and the pre-training task. As for the pre-training corpus, most of previ-
ous works almost collect NL-table data to perform table pre-training. They either mined a large
corpus of tables and their NL sentence contexts (Yin et al., 2020; Herzig et al., 2020), leveraged
human-annotated parallel NL-table datasets for pre-training (Deng et al., 2021; Yu et al., 2021a), or
synthesized a NL-table corpus using human-written templates (Yu et al., 2021a; Eisenschlos et al.,
2020). Our work is different from theirs because we are the first to use pure synthetic SQL-table
data for table pre-training, which allows us to automatically synthesize a diverse, large-scale, and
high-quality pre-training corpus. As for the pre-training task, existing works proposed several pre-
training tasks, such as Mask Column Prediction (Yin et al., 2020), Multi-choice Cloze at the Cell
Level (Wang et al., 2021b) and Structure Grounding (Deng et al., 2021). Different from all of them,
we present a novel SQL execution task to perform table pre-training.
Joint Understanding on Table and Text As our experiments are mainly on TableQA and TableFV,
our work is also closely related to previous methods for these tasks. For TableQA, previous works
almost formulate it as a weakly semantic parsing task (Liang et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2019a; Guo
et al., 2021), which always employ reinforcement learning to optimize semantic parsers over tables.
Although these parsers produce logic forms (e.g., SQL), they have difficulties in training due to
the large search space and the presence of spurious programs (Goldman et al., 2018). In addition,
another promising line of work has emerged in recent advances (Mueller et al., 2019; Herzig et al.,
2020), which aims at answering NL sentences without logical forms. This line of work predicts
answer(s) by selecting cell values and optionally applying an aggregation operator to them. They can
be easily trained, but their modeling ability is limited. For example, it is hard to support compound
aggregation operators such as max(Year) - min(Year). What makes our approach different
from these works is that we employ generative models to handle TableQA and can enjoy the end-to-
end training and flexibility simultaneously. For TableFV, previous works usually employ specialized
architectures with limited scalability (Shi et al., 2020a; Yang et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2021b). For
example, Zhong et al. (2020b) leveraged a graph construction mechanism, a semantic parser, and a
semantic composition model to capture the connections among the NL sentence and the table. While
the approach works well for TableFV, it is not easily applied to other table-related tasks. Compared
with them, our approach works well for a variety of downstream tasks in the same architecture.
7	Conclusion
In this paper, we present TaPEx, an execution-centric table pre-training approach whose corpus is
automatically synthesized via sampling SQL queries and their execution results. TaPEx addresses
the data scarcity challenge in table pre-training by learning a neural SQL executor on a diverse,
large-scale, and high-quality synthetic corpus. Experimental results on four downstream datasets
demonstrate that TaPEx outperforms previous table pre-training approaches by a large margin and
achieves new state-of-the-art results on all of them. Our work opens the way to exploit structured
data by pre-training on synthetic executable programs, which is conceptually simple and has great
potential to be extended to other research areas (e.g., knowledge base).

Ethics S tatement
In this work, we present a novel pre-training approach for tabular data, which approximates the struc-
tural reasoning process of formal languages over tables to achieve efficient table pre-training. Dif-
ferent from previous works which employ web crawling to construct a large-scale NL-table corpus
for pre-training, our pre-training corpus is synthesized via sampling SQL queries and their execution
results on public tables. Compared with previous works, our pre-training corpus is more controllable
with high-quality. For example, compared with TABERT which crawls 26 million noisy tables from
the Web, our approach adopts 1, 500 high-quality tables from public datasets, which greatly allevi-
ates the potential privacy and bias issues raised by web crawling. We evaluate our approach on two
fundamental table-related tasks: table-based question answering and table-based fact verification.
The former enables non-expert users to query databases without learning programming languages,
while the latter helps users to verify whether a textual hypothesis is valid based on given tabular
evidence. Experimental results on four well-known benchmark datasets show that our approach
achieves new state-of-the-art results on all of them, especially in the low data regime.

in pre-training impact the performance of downstream tasks? (2) Would it be better to use natural
language sentences instead of SQL queries during pre-training?
C.1 Impact of SQL Query Difficulty in Pre-training
SQL Difficulty Criteria Inspired by Yu et al. (2018), we suppose that the difficulty of a SQL
query can be measured by the number of SQL elements. An element can be either a SQL keyword
(e.g., SELECT), or a table schema (i.e., a header or a cell value). In practice, we obtain elements
of SQL queries via an off-the-shelf SQL parser 2, which returns a stream of SQL elements for each
SQL query. Empirically, we categorize SQL queries with ≤ 6 elements into Easy, > 6 and ≤ 14
elements into Medium, > 14 and ≤ 20 elements into Hard, and the rest into Extra Hard. Example
SQL queries of different difficulty levels can be found in Table 9. Based on the SQL difficulty
criteria, we divide the templates from S quall (Shi et al., 2020b) into four levels of difficulty and
gradually add them to the construction of the pre-training corpus from Easy-level ( ≤ Easy) to Extra-
Hard-level (≤ Extra Hard). Notably, to avoid the effect of the scale of pre-training, we maintain the
same amount of examples for the above pre-training corpus.
Downstream Performance The experimental results are shown in Figure 7. As can be seen, it is
helpful to add harder SQL queries to the pre-training corpus in most cases. For example, compared to
≤ Easy, ≤ Medium achieves consistent improvements on the performance of downstream tasks (e.g.,
10.6% on WIKITABLEQUESTIONS). Meanwhile, we also notice that the impact of the difficulty of
SQL queries becomes less significant after the Medium-level. On the TabFact dataset, involving
Extra-Hard-level SQL queries in pre-training even slightly hurts the performance.

plates with a difficulty level less than or equal to Medium when synthesizing its pre-training corpus.
Notably, ≤ Extra Hard is equivalent to using all SQL query templates.

SQL Difficulty Level in Pre-training
Figure 8:	The fine-grained performance of different SQL difficulty levels in pre-training on different
question difficulty levels from WikiTableQuestions dev set.
Fine-Grained Analysis To understand the impact from a fine-grained perspective, we divide ques-
tions from the WikiTableQuestions dev set into the same four levels of difficulty, with the help
of SQL query annotation for WikiTableQuestions questions provided by S quall. All fine-
grained experimental results are presented in Figure 8. We can see that with the addition of harder
SQL queries, the performance on questions at the same difficulty level are greatly improved. For ex-
ample, the addition of Medium level SQL queries boosts the performance of Medium-level questions
from 38.2% (≤ Easy) to 56.2% (≤ Medium), which is in line with expectations. More encourag-
ingly, adding simpler SQL queries can even improve performance on harder questions. For example,
compared to BART, the ≤ Medium pre-training leads to an impressive improvement of up to 13.1%
in the performance of Hard-level questions.
C.2 Impact of Natural Language in Pre-training
Natural Language Generation Intuitively, compared to SQL queries, using NL sentences in pre-
training is better for downstream tasks since the pre-training objective is nearly the same as the
fine-tuning objective. However, it is non-trivial to obtain a fluent NL sentence which faithfully
reflects the semantics of a SQL query. In this experiment, we follow Zhong et al. (2020a) to train a
SQL-to-NL model and employ the model to translate SQL queries from the pre-training corpus into
NL sentences. Concretely, our SQL-to-NL model is based on BART-Large (Lewis et al., 2020) and
trained on the S QUALL dataset (Shi et al., 2020b), which contains nearly 9, 000 SQL-NL pairs. Then
we apply the well-trained SQL-to-NL model to the pre-training corpus of TAPEX (0.5 Million) and
obtain a NL pre-training corpus of the same size. By manually analyzing 100 sampled translated
NL sentences, we are surprised to find that all NL sentences are fluent, and nearly 68% of them

are faithful to the semantics of the corresponding SQL queries. Table 10 presents some sampled
SQL queries and their corresponding translated NL sentences. After obtaining the NL pre-training
corpus, we follow the same pre-training and fine-tuning procedures as TaPEx to leverage it.
Performance Comparison We compare the performance of all downstream tasks between
TAPEX with. SQL and TAPEX with. NL in Table 11. Surprisingly, the performance of TAPEX
with. NL is comparable or even worse than the one of TAPEX with. SQL. For example, compared
to using SQL queries in pre-training, using NL sentences causes a drop of 1.4% on WIKITABLE-
Questions. We attribute such drop to the fact that the translated NL sentences contain some noise.
Taking the second row in Table 11 as an example, the translated NL sentence includes extra infor-
mation such as “in the 1989 major league baseball draft”, which may interfere with the pre-training.
