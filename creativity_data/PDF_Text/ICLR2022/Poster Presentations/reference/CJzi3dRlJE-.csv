 Each Worm has about 170 measured neurons,4080, We trained each model 4 times under the sameconnectomic constraints and With different initializations
 We calculate the correlation coefficient ri between the absolute value ofmodel weights |Wij | and connectome synapse count Cij along each row i,2022, Then it is averaged acrossN rows and 4 models with identical constraints but different random initializations to get r as ourmetric for connectome-consistency
 We show 300 neurons from a train worm in Figure 11-Figure 15,2022, Meanwhile
 That indicates optimization is saturated on the train set,2022, However
