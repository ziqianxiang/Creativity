The study of language emergence aims to understand how human languages are
shaped by perceptual grounding and communicative intent. Computational ap-
proaches to emergent communication (EC) predominantly consider referential
games in limited domains and analyze the learned protocol within the game frame-
work. As a result, it remains unclear how the emergent languages1 from these
settings connect to natural languages or provide benefits in real-world language
processing tasks, where statistical models trained on large text corpora dominate.
In this work, we propose a novel way to establish such a link by corpus transfer,
i.e. pretraining on a corpus of emergent language for downstream natural language
tasks, which is in contrast to prior work that directly transfers speaker and listener
parameters. Our approach showcases non-trivial transfer benefits for two different
tasks - language modeling and image captioning. For example, in a low-resource
setup (modeling 2 million natural language tokens), pre-training on an emergent
language corpus with just 2 million tokens reduces model perplexity by 24.6%
on average across ten natural languages. We also introduce a novel metric to
predict the transferability of an emergent language by translating emergent mes-
sages to natural language captions grounded on the same images. We find that our
translation-based metric highly correlates with the downstream performance on
modeling natural languages (for instance ρ = 0.83 on Hebrew), while topographic
similarity, a popular metric in previous work, shows surprisingly low correlation
(ρ = 0.003), hinting that simple properties like attribute disentanglement from
synthetic domains might not capture the full complexities of natural language. Our
findings also indicate potential benefits of moving language emergence forward
with natural language resources and models2.
1	Introduction
The recent remarkable progress in NLP (Devlin et al., 2018; Radford et al., 2019; Brown et al.,
2020) benefits from huge text corpora, on which powerful models learn rich statistical patterns tabula
rasa and adapt to downstream tasks. But in stark contrast, human language acquisition (De Villiers
et al., 1978) does not start with passive and complex corpora like Wikipedia. Instead, children
learn language through a cumulative series of interactions with other people (Bruner, 1985; Barton,
1994) grounded in the physical and social world (Harnad, 1990; Vogt, 2002; Alomari et al., 2017).
Incorporating such cognitive insights with recent machine learning advances holds great promises
towards more functional (Wittgenstein, 1958; Wagner et al., 2003) and generalizable (Lake et al.,
2017) language agents.
The study of emergent communication (EC) (Cangelosi & Parisi, 2002; Kirby, 2002; Wagner et al.,
2003; Lazaridou & Baroni, 2020) is one promising direction toward this motivation, where a commu-

refers to children’s language development in psychology (Bohlmann & Downer, 2016; Zajicek-Farber, 2010).

nication protocol is shaped through multi-agent interactions with perceptual grounding. A typical
setup is the image referential game (Figure 1(a)), where a speaker generates a discrete sequence of
tokens based on an input image, a listener is challenged to select the input out of distractors based
on the message, and both networks are optimized jointly via game success signals. By studying
these games, researchers are interested in the emergence of desirable properties resembling natural
language, such as game success generalization (Kharitonov & Baroni, 2020; Lazaridou & Baroni,
2020) and compositionality (Smith et al., 2003; Andreas & Klein, 2017; Kirby et al., 2015; Lazaridou
et al., 2018; Li et al., 2020b). However, these properties are mostly defined and analyzed within each
individual game framework. For example, generalization is usually measured as game success with
novel inputs, but it remains unknown how the emergent coding can be useful beyond the particular
game (e.g. useful for natural language tasks). Moreover, compositionality is often approximated by
attribute-wise disentanglement in simple environments, which could be drastically different from
the structural properties of natural language (Dankers et al., 2021). Such gaps pose difficulty in
objectively understanding the emergent properties with respect to the full complexities of natural
language, and assessing the universality of various claims.
In this work, we aim to address these issues by linking emergent languages with natural languages.
Concretely, we investigate if modeling an emergent language provides transferable benefits for down-
stream natural language tasks — language modeling (Figure 1(b)), image captioning (Figure 1(c)) —
and if downstream performances in turn allow us to understand and analyze properties of emergent
language beyond the EC game and toward natural language. The key technique is corpus transfer,
i.e. by pre-training a model on a corpus of emergent messages produced by a trained emergent speaker,
and fine-tuning the model on downstream tasks with natural language data. This approach integrates
inspirations from prior work like Papadimitriou & Jurafsky (2020), which proposes the transfer
scheme from synthetic to natural corpora, and Li et al. (2020b), which aims to improve few-shot
translation by transferring the trained EC speaker and listener model weights. Through a series of
experiments, we find that corpus transfer is helpful when the downstream natural language resource
is limited. For example, in a low-resource setup of modeling two million natural language tokens,
such a transfer scheme reduces the test perplexity by 24.6% on average versus training from scratch,
across ten different downstream languages. We also establish the non-triviality of such a transfer
performance by comparing to other synthetic and natural source corpora, as well as multiple ablation
studies on the EC and downstream transfer setups to help understand the transferability of emergent
language. Notably, our method of corpus transfer significantly outperforms directly transferring
the trained emergent speaker model (Li et al., 2020b), demonstrating that modeling the emergent
language could yield greater usefulness than directly transferring the EC agents.
While our transfer experiments demonstrate that emergent languages can be leveraged and under-
stood outside the game and towards real-world tasks, the pre-training and fine-tuning pipeline is
computationally expensive as a scalable evaluation scheme for a population of emergent languages.
Instead, we are interested in developing a simpler metric to predict the transferability of emergent
language, which pertains to properties of natural language and may challenge metrics defined within
2

the game framework (e.g. game accuracy). Therefore, we propose a novel metric for emergent
languages based on how easily it can be translated to the corresponding natural language grounded
on the same perceptual input (Figure 1(d)). Concretely, we employ the trained speaker to produce
emergent messages based on a small set of unseen images with natural language captions, and train
a translation model on paired emergent and natural captions. We show that the translation score
(such as ROUGE-L (Lin, 2004)) can better predict (e.g. Pearson correlation P = 0.83 for modeling
Hebrew) the transfer benefits of different emergent languages than two commonly adopted metrics in
prior literature - game success with novel inputs (P = 0.74), and topographic similarity (Brighton
& Kirby, 2006; Lazaridou et al., 2018) (ρ = 0.003). These results call for a re-thinking of what
properties we should evaluate for an emergent language corpus, and how we should evaluate them.
For example, game accuracy may be confounded by the listener performance, and topographic
similarity, a metric of attribute disentanglement, can be flawed for measuring the compositional
structure of real language (Kirby, 2001; Goldberg, 2015; Steinert-Threlkeld, 2020).
In summary, our work takes a step toward bridging the gap between emergent and natural languages.
We believe that shifting from synthetic setups and in-game evaluations to leveraging downstream
natural language tasks and state-of-the-art language models could potentially lead to more general
insights and greater practical impact for EC and NLP research.
2	Related Work
Emergent Communication and Evaluation A large body of prior work qualitatively analyzes the
evolved message structures when the EC games are set up with synthetic environments (Mordatch &
Abbeel, 2018; Lazaridou et al., 2018) or even with real images (Havrylov & Titov, 2017). Alternative
evaluations and examinations include ease of teaching (Li & Bowling, 2019) and symbol usage
purity (Lazaridou et al., 2016). While these schemes align the emergent language with game success
or different aspects of game input, our work evaluates the emergent language outside the game
framework, instead via the corpus transfer performance to natural language tasks and the translation
performance to natural language.
Linking Synthetic and Natural Language Papadimitriou & Jurafsky (2020) find that recurrent
networks pretrained on non-linguistic corpora (e.g. music, code, regular languages) facilitate natural
language modeling. In an opposite direction, Lu et al. (2021) observe that language pre-training
improves Transformer’s performance with several non-language tasks (logical, vision, protein) even
when most weights are frozen, indicating that learning language structure could yield generally useful
computational subroutines. Andreas et al. (2017) propose to translate a differentiable communication
channel in deep multi-agent policies to natural language by collecting human-human communication
in the same games. However, their approach focused on interpreting a continuous channel, while we
focus on evaluating emergent messages with discrete structures.
Use of Emergent Communication beyond games There have been efforts to incorporate commu-
nication signals and natural language supervision to better communicate (Lowe et al., 2020), avoid
language drift (Lazaridou et al., 2020), orto improve NLP tasks like vision-language navigation (Fried
et al., 2018), translation (Lee et al., 2018), and image captioning (Havrylov & Titov, 2017). Different
from these setups where the speaker is also grounded on natural language annotations, Li et al.
(2020b) propose to separate the EC game, where no natural language is involved, and fine-tuning on
a downstream translation task with limited natural language data. Despite being the closest work to
ours, such a model transfer approach is fundamentally different from our corpus transfer in several
ways. First, while Li et al. (2020b) mainly aim to improve downstream tasks, we envision transfer as
a novel means to evaluating and analyzing emergent languages. Also, the emergent language is a
representation with properties beyond the parameters of specific EC models (Section 3.1). Last but
not least, corpus transfer has several practical advantages over model transfer (Section 4.3).
3	Background
3.1	Emergent Communication (EC) Game
As shown in Figure 1(a), we consider a typical speaker-listener referential game (Lazaridou et al.,
2016; 2018; Li & Bowling, 2019) on a set of N image features DI = {Iι,…，IN}. At each training
3

step, the speaker takes an input image feature Ii and generates a discrete message Mi ∈ [V]T using
the Gumbel-Softmax trick (Jang et al., 2016), where V is the vocabulary size and T is the sequence
length limit. For simplicity denote m = Mi so that mt = Mi,t denotes the t-th token of the message
Mi . Then
hs0 = Ii, hst = GRUspk (mt-1,hst-1) (t > 0),
m0 = [CLS], mt = Gumbel-Softmax (MLPspk(hst)) (t > 0).
(1)
Here hst denotes speaker hidden states. Next, the listener takes the message m, and tries to guess the
right image Ii out of a set of K confounding images Ci = {1先，…，IjK } ⊂ Di -{L}. To do so, it
uses another GRU layer to turn the message m into a hidden vector hlT
hl0 =0, hlt = GRUlsn (mt, hlt-1) (t>0).
(2)
Based on hlT, the listener assigns a score for each candidate image based on inverse square error (Lee
et al., 2018), then selects the image by Softmax sampling across the scores. The speaker and listener
are jointly optimized by minimizing the cross-entropy loss of image selection:
score(I) = ||hlT - M LPlsn(I)||2-2,	(3)
p(guess = I) = softmax(score(I)) (I ∈ {Ii} ∪ Ci),	(4)
LEC = -EIi,Ci EMi log p(guess = Ii).	(5)
After the game is trained, the speaker can be employed to sample a corpus of emergent language
DM = {Mι,…，MN} based on input images. Though the emergent language is generated by a
particular EC speaker, the representation could be potentially learned and used by new agents, with
more general properties beyond the parameters of a particular speaker architecture. Thus, our work
focuses on evaluating and analyzing the properties of the emergent language (e.g. corpus transfer)
rather than the emergent communication models (e.g. model transfer).
3.2	Evaluating Emergent Language
A central question in emergent communication is how to evaluate the quality of the emergent corpus
DM. Two commonly used metrics in prior work are game accuracy and topographic similarity.
Game Accuracy with Novel Objects The most straightforward metric is the accuracy of playing
the referential game EIi,Ci,Mi [1guess=Ii]. Prior work (Cogswell et al., 2019; Li & Bowling, 2019)
usually considers how well the speaker and listener generalize to novel inputs, and finds that such a
generalization ability might not correlate with other properties such as compositionality (Chaabouni
et al., 2020; Kharitonov & Baroni, 2020). Note that this metric involves both the speaker and listener,
while the emergent language corpus DM is generated solely by the speaker.
Topographic Similarity The topographic similarity (Brighton & Kirby, 2006; Lazaridou et al.,
2018) measures how messages align with the meaning representations. More concretely, let CSij =
-Ii ∙ Ij / (|| Ii || 21| Ij || 2) be the negative cosine similarity of image features Ii and Ij, and EDij be
the Levenshtein distance (Levenshtein et al., 1966) between messages Mi and Mj. The metric is
defined as the Spearman rank correlation of the two distance metrics:
Ei,j [(R(EDij ) - NR(ED))(R(CSij ) - μR(cs))]	小
rED,CS = PR(ED),R(CS) = ------------------------------------------------ (6)
σR(ED) σR(CS)
Here R(∙) denotes the rank of the element in the list. This metric intuitively measures disentangle-
ment: different attributes of the input should be expressed in different token positions, and each
token only describes one attribute (e.g. “big red cube” and “big blue cube”). Such a property has
been claimed (Lazaridou et al., 2018; Li & Bowling, 2019) as connected to compositionality, a
key structural property of natural language. However, this metric is too rigid in its definition of
compositionality, ignoring aspects like argument structure, context or morphology which play a key
role in determining the combination of word semantics (Goldberg, 2015).
We note that experiments around both these metrics are within the game framework - accuracy is
based on game success, while topographic similarity measures how emergent messages align with
game input representations. This leaves two questions unsolved: (i) can emergent languages be used
outside the game? (ii) if so, would these metrics predict the usefulness of emergent languages for
downstream tasks? We tackle these two questions in Sections 4 and 5 respectively.

4	Emergent Corpus Transfer for Natural Language Tasks
In this section, we present initial evidence that a corpus of emergent language DM can benefit two
types of downstream tasks involving natural language: language-only task (language modeling,
Section 4.1) and vision-language task (image captioning, Section 4.2). Moreover, we show such
a benefit is most significant when the natural language resources are limited, which indicates that
emergent language is potentially valuable for low-resource languages and tasks. We then analyze
what contributes to such a transfer via ablation studies in Section 4.3.
4.1	Language Modeling
Inspired by Papadimitriou & Jurafsky (2020), we consider the task of natural language modeling, and
explore if pretraining a language model on a corpus of emergent messages can reduce the downstream
perplexity in a low-resource setup (Figure 1(b)), and how emergent language compares to other
sources of synthetic and even natural language corpora.
Pre-training Corpora We compare three source corpora: (i) a Spanish Wikipedia corpus (es) culled
to 50,000 vocabulary size using the pre-processing script from Papadimitriou & Jurafsky (2020),
(ii) a regular language of well-balanced brackets (paren-zipf) with the Zipf unigram distribution
as es, and (iii) an emergent language corpus (ec). paren-zipf is the best-performing source corpus
from Papadimitriou & Jurafsky (2020) not created by humans (e.g. natural language, music, or code)
with the inductive bias of hierarchical structure, and es should set an upper bound of the transfer
performance for both paren-zipf and ec. We vary the source corpus size from 2, 5, 10, 15 to 30
million tokens to understand how the transfer results change with respect to the pre-training scale.
Fine-tuning Corpora We scrape Wikipedia corpora of 10 languages to test downstream trans-
fer: Danish (da, IE-Germanic), Basque (eu, Basque), Japanese (ja, Japanese), Romanian (ro,
IE-Romance), Finnish (fi, Uralic), Indonesian (id, Austronesian), Kazakh (kk, Turkic), Hebrew (he,
Afro-Asiatic), Urdu (ur, IE-Indic), and Persian (fa, IE-Iranian). They come from diverse linguistic
families with different levels of resource richness. Each corpus has 2 million tokens and a vocabulary
size of 50,000, and is pre-processed (to remove noise) via the same script to process es.
Implementation We train the EC game and generate ec based on the Conceptual Captions
dataset (Sharma et al., 2018), using more than 2.8 million natural images in the wild. Note that we
do not use the natural language captions in the dataset for EC game training. We take the 512-dim
pre-trained ResNet-18 (He et al., 2016) features before the classification head as input image features
Ii . Other architecture and training details mainly follow Li et al. (2020b), and by default V = 4035,
T = 15, K = 256. For language modeling, we adopt a Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) with 6
decoder layers and 6 attention heads, and pre-train on each source corpus for 3,000 steps with batch
size 32, input length 1,000, and learning rate 5 × 10-4. For fine-tuning and training from scratch on
downstream corpora, the batch size is 8 and learning rate is 10-4. Hyperparameters are chosen after
grid search. We report the test perplexity at the best validation loss.
Results As can be seen from Figure 2, pre-training on ec (blue) significantly reduces the perplexity
compared with training from scratch (red, dotted line with constant value), with an average reduction
of 24.6% with merely 2 million pre-training tokens. This is a positive signal that a corpus of
emergent language could be useful beyond the communication game itself.
Comparing two synthetic pre-training corpora, ec performs better than or comparable to paren-zipf
throughout different source sizes and downstream languages, with the exception of Basque and
Finnish when pre-training size is more than 15 million. Given the strong inductive bias in paren-zipf
(hierarchical structure and unigram information from real language), and the fact that ec is generated
by just a single-layer GRU speaker without such explicit bias, such a result hints that ec may possess
non-trivial structural properties due to the communication signals and perceptual grounding.
On the other hand, the natural language corpus es usually achieve a lower perplexity than both ec
and paren-zipf as may be expected. Most surprisingly, when pre-training only on 2M tokens, ec
consistently beats es in terms of transfer performance, and their performances are comparable on
most languages using 5 million source tokens. To offer one plausible explanation, ec could contain

properties closer to everyday conversations - smaller vocabulary, simpler structures (generated by one-
layer GRU) and repetitive (all about image references) - easier for language modeling, compared to
the complicated structures and statistical patterns of large text corpora like Wikipedia es. However, the
relative simplicity of ec also prevents the transfer from scaling as well as es - comparing pretraining
on 30 versus 2 million tokens, ec only reduces perplexity by 2.4% on average, while es reduces
23.8%. Such a mixed finding points to potential in combining the strengths of simpler emergent
corpora (easier to acquire and benefit from) and noisy natural language corpora (more structures and
complexities) for more efficient language learning. Such an idea of mixing NLP and EC training has
been useful for some NLP (Fried et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2018) and EC (Lowe et al., 2020; Lazaridou
et al., 2020) tasks. Another important direction would be on how to evolve emergent languages
with more complexities that resemble and transfer to natural language, where existing approaches to
improving and regularizing EC (Mu & Goodman, 2021; Guo et al., 2019; Li & Bowling, 2019; Dessl
et al., 2021; Luna et al., 2020) could be tested through our transfer scheme.
4.2	Image Captioning
The language modeling transfer experiment leverages the structural properties of the source corpus,
but has little to do with the semantics of the source corpus. For example, a regular language like
paren-zipf has no real meanings, but still reduces downstream perplexity due to its hierarchical
structure. Therefore, we also consider transfer to image captioning, a classical vision-language task
where a model has to ground meaning of the words to the images. As shown in Figure 1(c), we
pre-train an image captioning model on unlabeled images to generate EC captions, then fine-tune on
downstream annotated images to generate natural language captions. We note that such a transfer
scheme cannot work for other synthetic corpora such as music, code, or paren-zipf as they are not
grounded on perceptual stimuli.
Pre-training Data We use the EC speaker trained on Conceptual Captions to generate an EC
caption Mi based on each ResNet-18 image feature Ii in the dataset. As image captioning requires
fine-grained information beyond a global feature, we extract detection features I0i for each image via
pre-trained Faster R-CNN (Ren et al., 2015) and ResNet-101 (He et al., 2016), and pre-train an image
captioning model to generate EC captions based on detection features (I0i 7→ Mi). To set up an upper

bound for transfer performance, we also use the English captions NLi in the Conceptual Captions
dataset for pre-training (I0i 7→ NLi).
Fine-tuning Data We use the MS-COCO dataset (Lin et al., 2014) for fine-tuning, which consists
of around 500,000 pairs of images and English captions. We use the full training set, or a subset with
5,000 or 50,000 samples to study the transfer benefit when natural language annotation is limited.
Implementation We use a Transformer with 3 encoder layers and 6 decoder layers as the image
captioning model, and perform pre-training and fine-tuning in a seq2seq framework (Ott et al., 2019).
Notably, we only transfer the encoder weights, and fine-tune the whole network end-to-end with a
learning rate of 3 × 10-4, as we notice transferring the full weights leads to worse performance. We
report BLEU4 (PaPineni et al., 2002), ROUGE-L (Lin, 2004), and CIDEr (Vedantam et al., 2015)
scores for the test split based on best validation loss.
Results As shown in Table 1, when fine-tuning on 5,000 or 50,000 samples, pre-training on either
EC or NL captions both significantly improve the image captioning performance. For example,
with 50,000 samples, EC pre-training can improve the BLEU-4 score by +0.9 points, while NL
pre-training further improves +1.0 points. The fact that EC pre-training can provide half the benefit
of NL pre-training is surprising, because the former requires no language annotation - both training
the EC games and generating the EC captions can be done on unlabeled images in the wild, while the
NL pretraining leverages more than 2.8 million English sentences.
However, when the full MS-COCO dataset is used, even pretraining on 2.8 million English captions
is not significantly helpful, possibly because Conceptual Captions collect noisy Internet sentences
while MS-COCO annotates captions with less diversity (Wang et al., 2020) so a model trained from
scratch on the full dataset can capture most of the output patterns. Other vision-language tasks where
natural language annotations are harder or more limited (e.g. instruction following, navigation) would
potentially benefit more from EC pre-training, where we can turn abundant unlabeled visual stimuli
into annotations in the emergent language.
4.3	What Contributes to Successful Corpus Transfer?
We have shown that emergent languages can provide transfer benefit for natural language tasks, but it
is still unknown what properties of emergent languages contribute to such a benefit. Hence we ablate
several key aspects of the EC game training and EC corpus generation, and examine the effect via
transfer (with 15 million pre-training tokens) to two example languages, Romanian (ro) and Hebrew
(he). We leave ablation studies on the image captioning experiment in Section A.3.
Communication and Perceptual Stimuli in EC Game The emergent language stems from two
elements in the game that human language acquisition relies on: perceptual grounding (input image
features) and communication (referential game). For ablation, we first consider an untrained GRU
speaker with randomized parameters (random speaker), and use it to sample tokens conditioned on
image features according to (1). As Table 2 shows, pre-training on such a corpus leads to even worse
7
Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2022
performance than training from scratch, because an untrained speaker has highly random generations
with no clear structure.
On the other hand, to ablate the effect of visual stimuli, we sample a set of N random vectors from
N(μ(Dι), σ(Dι)), and replace it for DI as inputs of the EC game (random input). We then use the
trained speaker to generate a EC corpus based on the same random vectors. It turns out only one out
of three game trials develop a game accuracy > 90%, and other two trials cannot learn an accuracy
beyond 5%. On Hebrew, the “successful” trial achieves a transfer perplexity of 388, which is still
worse than EC corpus on visual inputs, while other two trials yield significantly worse perplexities
(573, 509). So it turns out communicating visual stimuli instead of random inputs is more robustly
successful, and more helpful for transfer even when communication can be successful.
Sentence Structure in EC Corpus To investigate how structured EC sentences are, we indepen-
dently shuffle each EC sentence in DM to form a new-pretraining corpus (permuted EC), and find in
Table 2 that it indeed leads to a consistent worse performance, though better than training from scratch.
This indicates the speaker develops a coding scheme with sentence structures beyond bag-of-words.
Model vs. Corpus Transfer Li et al. (2020b) propose to transfer the EC models for a downstream
translation task, whereas we leverage a speaker-generated EC corpus to pre-train with architectures
that could be more flexible and powerful, which leads to several significant practical advantages.
First, EC model architectures might not apply to many downstream tasks (e.g. image captioning
with multiple input features), but corpus transfer could still be readily deployed (Section 4.2). On
other tasks (e.g. language modeling) where model transfer could be implemented, its performance is
still constrained by the simple EC model architectures3. As shown in Table 2, directly fine-tuning
the one-layer speaker GRU (model transfer (GRU)) indeed leads to much worse perplexities than
corpus transfer with a Transformer (EC pretrain), but more interestingly, is also worse than corpus
transfer with the same GRU architecture (corpus transfer (GRU)), possibly due to the benefit of
self-distillation (Zhang et al., 2019; Allen-Zhu & Li, 2020). In summary, our corpus transfer approach
better utilizes the emergent communication for downstream tasks than model transfer.
5	Emergent-Natural Language Translation as a Metric
Section 4.3 presents initial evidence that the quality of an emergent language correlates with the
transfer performance, by showing ablated emergent languages transfer worse. However, directly
using transfer as an evaluation scheme for emergent languages has certain deficiencies. First, the pre-
training and fine-tuning optimizations are computationally expensive. Second, transfer performance
across different downstream tasks might induce inconsistency. Hence we propose a cheaper and
simpler evaluation for emergent languages by measuring how easily it translates to the corresponding
natural language grounded on the same input, and show that it better correlates with the transfer
performance than existing metrics across different tasks.
More concretely, we use a small set of captioned images, where image Ii is associated with a natural
language caption NLi . We also use the trained speaker to generate emergent message Mi based on
each Ii , and train a translation model to map emergent sentences to natural sentences Mi 7→ NLi .
Intuitively, a higher translation score means the emergent and natural sentences are closer in structure
and semantics, similar to how French-English translation might be easier than Chinese-English.
Implementation To estimate the correlation between metrics and transfer performance re-
quires a population of emergent languages with different speakers. Thus we choose
5 EC game setups with varying vocabulary and sequence length limits ((V, T)	∈
{(4035, 5), (4035, 15), (4035, 25), (1000, 15), (10000, 25)}), and for each setup we run 4 trials for
2,000 steps. We consider checkpoints every 200 steps, summing to 5 × 4 × 10 = 200 checkpoints.
Due to computational limits, we train EC games on a small subset of 50,000 MS-COCO images, and
use another subset of 50,000 MS-COCO image-caption pairs to calculate the translation metric. For
translation, we use the same seq2seq Transformer for image captioning, but only train for 2 epochs,
so that an emergent language more similar to the natural language can perform better with limited
3We note that unlike most NLP tasks, EC model architectures might not arbitrarily scale up due to optimization
challenges with discretization. For example, we have tried 2/3-layer GRUs for EC, but the transfer is worse.

training. We use ROUGE-L (Lin, 2004) as the translation metric, and find other metrics with similar
results. For downstream language modeling, we use ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009) to generate a
corpus of 15 million tokens and fine-tune on Romanian (ro) and Hebrew (he).
Results We compare with the two existing metrics, validation accuracy and topographic similarity
(see Section 3.2). Table 3 shows how different metrics correlate with downstream performance
across all checkpoints form all trials4. Surprisingly, we find little correlation between topographic
similarity and downstream performance, while our translation metric has a better correlation (ρro =
0.757, ρhe = 0.829) than validation accuracy (ρro = 0.672, ρhe = 0.737).
To better understand the results, we take all 4 trials from a specific game setup (V = 10000, T = 15)
and plot in Figure 3 how the three metrics (accuracy, topographic, translation ROUGE-L) as well as
the downstream Romanian performance change with training steps (similar analysis of more setups
(vocabulary size, sequence length) in Section B.4). We observe that our metric (Figure 3(c)) aligns
with the downstream performance (Figure 3(d)) in that both reach a high level around 300 steps (red
dash line) and maintains a similar level afterwards. The validation accuracy ((Figure 3(a))) has a
generally similar tendency as these two metrics, with the difference being that it is only around 50%
at step 300 and far from convergence, possibly due to the underdevelopment of the listener. A similar
observation was made in Li et al. (2020b). Such a dependency on the listener renders game success
unreliable for the evaluating emergent languages produced by the speaker alone.
On the other hand, the topographic similarity (Figure 3(b)) peaks as early as step 300, after which the
degradation fails to explain the downstream performance. To illustrate the misalignment, consider the
“best” language with respect to topographic, i.e. a fully disentangled coding scheme (e.g. “red/blue
cube/sphere”). Such a corpus would essentially have a maximum possible entropy, pre-training on
which should not help with any downstream tasks. Our finding suggests that simple measurements
of rigid disentanglement fall short of estimating the compositionality of real language, and we
may need to take into account other structural properties of natural language, e.g. stable irregular-
ity (Kirby, 2001), or the role of argument structures, context and morphology (Goldberg, 2015;
Steinert-Threlkeld, 2020).
6	Conclusion
While previous research in language emergence tends to investigate different setups and how they
affect certain metrics, such a paradigm cannot provide robust and valuable insights if the metrics are
flawed. Thus, our work calls for a paradigm shift in how we evaluate and analyze language emergence
— by stepping from metrics within each EC framework or over-approximate NL properties, and
instead directly linking to NL by transfer or translation. Such a paradigm shift enables several brand
new and exciting future directions — how to improve or regularize EC through the lens of our metrics,
how to push EC to be more useful for NLP5, and how to design more fine-grained metrics for specific
NL properties. We believe progress in these directions will further develop a synergy between EC
and NLP research and bring benefits and insights for both sides.
4For topographic, we exclude 9 checkpoints with the metric undefined due to zero variance of edit distances.

Ethics S tatement
Our work is a preliminary step toward aligning the language of machines and humans, which has
potential positive social impacts in several ways. First, shaping machine communications towards
the structure of natural language contributes to human and AI alignment in terms of values and
understanding of the world. Second, emergent languages could yield transfer benefits for low-
resource languages and tasks, contributing to linguistic diversity and inclusion. We could not think of
negative ethics impact for now, as the emergent language is still very different from natural language.
Reproducibility S tatement
Our research in based on public codebases and datasets, with implementation details described
throughout the paper. We have conducted reasonable hyperparameter searches and ablation studies
to make sure experiment conclusions are fair. In the Appendix, we further provide links to all used

A	Implementation Details
A. 1 Emergent Communication Game
We adapt the public code6 from Li et al. (2020b) and mostly follow their default setups. For training,
we use a batch size of 256, and each batch element contains one input images and other 255 distractor
images. Since the Conceptual Captions dataset has more than 2.8 million images, random sampling a
batch of data is computationally costly. So for each batch, we first sample 50,000 images from the
whole dataset, then sample input and distractor pairs from this subset. We use an Adam optimizer
with learning rate 10-3. We use a soft version of Gumbel-softmax with temperature 1, and have
tried hard Gumbel-softmax and found it not further helpful for downstream performance. Each game
training only takes less than 12 hours using one GeForce RTX 2080 GPU.
A.2 Language Modeling
We use the public script7 from Papadimitriou & Jurafsky (2020) to pre-process Wikipedia corpora
of different languages, using the default setup of culling to 50,000 vocabulary size. We hand-pick
downstream languages to make sure they represent different linguistic families.
We use the language modeling script8 from Huggingface (Wolf et al., 2019) for both pre-training and
fine-tuning.
We have tried grid search for the pre-training learning rate (10-3, 5 × 10-4, 10-4) and batch size
(4, 32), which checkpoint to transfer (1000, 2000, 3000), as well as the fine-tuning learning rate
(10-4, 5 × 10-5, 10-5) and batch size (8, 32). We find that for all three source corpora (es, ec,
paren-zipf), it works best to pre-train with learning rate 5 × 10-4 and batch size (32), transfer using
the checkpoint with 3000 training steps, and fine-tune with learning rate 10-4 and batch size 8. For
training from scratch, we have tried grid search for the learning rate (10-3, 5 × 10-4, 10-4, 5 × 10-5)
and batch size (4, 32), and find that learning rate 10-4 and batch size 8 work best for different
downstream languages. An pre-training experiment can finish within one hour using one GeForce
RTX 3090 GPU, while a fine-tuning or training-from-scratch experiment can finish within one hour
using one GeForce RTX 2080 GPU.
A.3 Image Captioning
We use the pre-processed detection features9 of Conceptual Captions from the codebase of Li et al.
(2020a).
For both pre-training and fine-tuning, we use a public codebase10 for image captioning based on
FAIRSEQ (Ott et al., 2019), and mostly follow their default setups. Pre-training on Conceptual
Captions takes 8 GeForce RTX 3090 GPU for around two days. Fine-tuning takes 1 GeForce RTX
2080 GPU for one hour.
B Additional Results
B.1	Language Unigrams
As shown in Figure 4, the es and paren-zipf corpora have a larger vocabulary size (5000) and a larger
entropy (6.48). While ec is set with vocabulary limit 4,035, its corpus only uses around 2,500 words
with smaller entropy (3.7). The ec corpus with random speaker almost has a large entropy (7.98).

B.2	Image Captioning
We visualize the fine-tuning process of image captioning experiments in Figure 5. Interestingly,
we find that under different natural language resource conditions (5,000, 50,000, or all samples in
the MS-COCO (Lin et al., 2014) training set) the training progress is different. Specifically, with
5,000 samples, EC or NL pre-training and training from scratch first learn similarly well, then gaps
gradually appear with more training epochs. In contrast, when more han 50,0000 samples are used,
the gap between pre-training methods and training from scratch is most significant when trained
for only one epoch, and it starts to diminish with more training epochs. It suggests that even when
downstream natural language resources are abundant, pre-training on an EC corpus might still help in
a fast adaption setup.
We also perform additional ablation studies to confirm the non-triviality of image captioning results.
Due to computation limits, we use 450k MS-COCO samples (instead of 3M Conceptual Captions
samples used in the main paper) to pre-train (image 7→ emergent caption / shuffled emergent caption /
random paren-zipf string with the same unigram as emergent captions), and the other 50k MS-COCO
samples to finetune (image 7→ English caption). As shown in Table 4, pre-training with shuffled
emergent captions or ungrounded strings leads to worse performance than even no pre-training, while
pre-training with emergent captions still improves the downstream performance. This helps address
the importance of having a semantically grounded and structural language for vision-language pre-
training. However, we do note that in the case of MS-COCO image captioning, fine-tuning usually
does the heavy-lifting and pre-training contributes much less than the case of language modeling.
That is why our work focuses analysis on the language modeling experiments.

low (less than 0.1), and a higher value does not correlate with better downstream performance. Also,
we note that data points around the beginning of training (e.g. 200 steps) have very low accuracy or
translation score, and their downstream performance is worse but significantly more varied than the
rest of data points.
B.4 How Setups (Vocabulary Size, Sequence Length) Effect Metrics and
Downstream Performances
Figure 3 in Section 5 mainly studies how metrics and downstream performance change with respect
to the training steps, while controlling the other setups. Following a similar logic, in Figure 7 we take
those checkpoints with 1000 training steps and sequence lengths being 15 and plot the downstream
performances and metrics with respect to the vocabulary size (1000, 4035, 10000), and in Figure 8
we take those checkpoints with 1000 training steps and vocabulary size being 4035 and plot the
downstream performances and metrics with respect to the sequence length (5, 15, 25).
For the vocabulary size setup (Figure 7), we find that both validation accuracy and our metric capture
that the performance when vocabulary size is 1000 is worse and has significantly more variance. In
contrast, topographic similarity is highest when vocabulary size is smallest (1000), which disagrees
with downstream performances. However, all metrics are higher when vocabulary size is 4035 instead
of 10000, which is the opposite for downstream performances.

For the sequence length setup (Figure 8), we find that our metric captures the fact that a larger
sequence length leads to better and less varied downstream performance. In contrast, validation
accuracy with sequence length being 25 is worse than sequence length being 15, and topographic
similarity fails to capture the decreasing trend of performance variance.
In summary, we find that a larger vocabulary size or sequence length within our setup choices leads to
better downstream performance with less variance, which is best captured by our translation metric.
Figure 7: How metrics and downstream performances change with respect to vocabulary size (1000,
4035, 10000). Sequence length is 15 and training step is 1000.

B.5 Qualitative Examples
Figure 9 includes some COCO images (not Conceptual Captions training images for EC) and their
natural and emergent captions. Manual check might reveal some patterns, e.g. transportation tools
might start with 2340 (a, b, j), indoor scenes might start with two 1777 tokens and indoor home
scenes might start with even more 1777 tokens (d, e, k, l). Still, we note that our paper intentionally
aims to move away from previous manual-check paradigms in EC papers and tries to establish a more
standardized, scalable, and robust quantitative metric to enable more progress.
