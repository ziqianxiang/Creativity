Figure 1: RMSE v.s. random seed for Countydataset.
Figure 2: Performance of BGNN vs. EBBS after each boosting iteration on the VK dataset. Eachmodel uses the hyperparameter values that performed best on the County dataset.
Figure S1:	Performance of BGNN vs. EBBS after each boosting iteration on the VK dataset. The leftBGNN uses the hyperparameter values that performed best on the County dataset. The right BGNNuses the hyperparameter values that performed best on the VK dataset. EBBS uses the hyperparametervalues that performed best on the County dataset. These results suggest that EBBS can be run withmostly shared hyperparameters across all datasets.
