Figure 1: Scatter plots of test accuracy g(f) v.s. synthetic accuracy g(f) with f from a pool of deepnet classifiers on CIFAR-10 and Tiny ImageNet of diverse architectures VGG, ResNet, DenseNet,ShuffleNet, NASNet, MobileNet with various hyper-parameters. One single BigGAN+DiffAugmodel is used for each dataset. Left: CIFAR-10 classifiers. The y = x fit has R2 score 0.804and Kendall τ coefficient 0.851. Right: Tiny ImageNet classifiers. The y = x fit has R2 score0.918 and Kendall τ coefficient 0.803.
Figure 2: Scatter plots of test accuracy g(f) v.s. synthetic accuracy g(f) with f from DEMOGENconsisting of 216 Network in Network classifiers and 216 ResNet classifiers on CIFAR-10 as wellas 324 ResNet classifiers on CIFAR-100. The synthetic examples are from the BigGAN+DiffAug.
Figure 3: Histograms of dh’s measured using the feature spaces of the pool of 216 pre-trainedResNet models on CIFAR-10 in DEMOGEN. Since features vectors h(x) of different classifiersmay have vastly different norms, we plot the histograms of the ratios dh(Ssyn, Stest)/dh (Strain, Stest)and dh (Ssyn, Stest)/dh(Ssyn, Strain) instead. The synthetic dataset is the identical one generatedby the BigGAN-DiffAug model used in Section 3.2. Top: the histograms of all the 216 pre-trained classifiers, including the not-so-well-trained ones with training accuracy below 90%. Bot-tom: the histograms of only the well-trained 162 out of 216 classifiers with training accuracy atleast 97%. Clearly, the ratio dh(Ssyn, Stest)/dh (Strain, Stest) is below 1 consistently, and the ratiodh(Ssyn, Stest)/dh(Strain, Stest) is below 1 for all well-trained classifiers. This indicates that in theirfeature space the labeled synthetic examples behave more similarly to the test set rather than to thetraining set.
Figure 4: Histograms of dhs measured using the feature spaces of deep neural nets with variousarchitectures on CIFAR-10 (same ones from Figure 1). The synthetic dataset is the same one usedin Figure 1 as well. All the classifiers are well-trained. dh (Ssyn, Stest) is consistently the smallestamong all three pairwise distances among Strain , Stest and Ssyn.
Figure 5: Scatter plots of test accuracy g(f) v.s. synthetic accuracy g(f) on the DEMOGEN CIFAR-100 task using BigGAN models trained with a) data augmentation (random crop + horizontal Flip-ping) only to real (training) examples, b) without any data augmentation, and c) with the differen-tiable data augmentation technique. Blue and orange dots represent ResNet-34 classifiers trainedwith and without data augmentation.
