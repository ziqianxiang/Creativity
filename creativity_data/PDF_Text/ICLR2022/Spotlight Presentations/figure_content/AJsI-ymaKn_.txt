Figure 5: Anomalous and low-value actions in various patient cohorts: patients over 75 years old, patientscarrying the 4 allele of the apolipoprotein E gene (ApoE4), patients with signs of MCI or dementia at theirfirst visit, female and male patients.

Figure 9: Performance on ADNI as a function of tree depth, for fixed and grown trees. Our growthoptimisation procedure adapts model complexity to the task at hand to (a) facilitate interpretation and (b) avoidoverfitting.
