Figure 2: Constructing Higher Order Householder activations (J+ and J- defined in equation (2))E VERIFICATION THAT σθ (z1 , z2) ALWAYS LIES ON ONE SIDE OF THEHYPERPLANEa1 cos θ sin θ	z1a2 = sin θ - cos θ z2Consider the case: z1 Sin (θ∕2) - z2 cos (θ∕2) > 0In this case σθ(z1, z2) = (z1, z2) and the result follows directly.
