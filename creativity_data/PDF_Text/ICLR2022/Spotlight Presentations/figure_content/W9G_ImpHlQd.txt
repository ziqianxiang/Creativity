ZO-AE-DS: CGE with q = 1926 ConclusionIn this paper, we study the problem of black-box defense, aiming to secure black-box modelsagainst adversarial attacks using only input-output model queries. The proposed black-box learningparadigm is new to adversarial defense, but is also challenging to tackle because of the black-boxoptimization nature. To solve this problem, we integrate denoised smoothing (DS) with ZO (zeroth-order) optimization to build a feasible black-box defense framework. However, we find that the directapplication of ZO optimization makes the defense ineffective and difficult to scale. We then proposeZO-AE-DS, which leverages autoencoder (AE) to bridge the gap between FO and ZO optimization.
