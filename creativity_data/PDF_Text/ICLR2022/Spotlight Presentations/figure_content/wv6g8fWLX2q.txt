Figure 1: TAMP-S2GCNets consists of 5 components: (I) Spatial graph convolutional layer on Gtextracts spatial information at time t (see Eq. 5). (II) Feature transformation (FT) learns representa-tion of the spatio-temporal data XT over a sliding window of size T (see Eq. 1). (III) Supragraphconvolutional module captures joint spatio-temporal dependencies in XT (see Eq. 4). (IV) Detailedarchitecture of the DEPSRL module (see Eqs. 6 and 7), where the DEPS with different types of mul-tifiltrations can be learned by a CNN base model and global pooling mechanism. Here DEPS allowsus to learn the intrinsic graph structure both across multiple geometric dimensions and across time.
Figure 2: Illustration of multidimensional persistence (i.e., multipersistence). In the original graph(the top left panel), red numbers represent the eccentricity of the node, while blue numbers are thenode degrees. The top right panel depicts the corresponding Euler-PoinCare Surface. Shape ProP-erties of the top graph are evaluated along two geometric dimensions (i.e., degree and eccentricity).
