Figure 1: NCD aims to discover novel classes (i.e., clustering novel-class data) with the help of labeledknown-class data. There exists two ways to obtain data in NCD: (a) labeling in causality, e.g., we first obtainunlabeled images and then hire experts to label them and (b) sampling in causality, e.g., we are given a labelset, and then sample images regarding these labels. In (a), experts have to go through all images and findout novel classes. However, the novel classes (like cars) might be totally different from known classes (likeanimals), which makes NCD become a theoretically unsolvable problem. In this paper, we revisit NCD from (b),where novel-class data are collected on the same way of sampling known-class data. In this view, NCD can betheoretically solved, since novel classes and known classes are highly related. The yellow rectangles representthe identified novel classes.

Figure 5: We conducted experiments on CIFAR-100 and OmniGlOt and reported the average clusteringaccuracy (ACC (%), Section 5) when using existing and our methods to address the NCDL problem. Theexperimental results showed that MM and MP tend to outperform existing methods.
