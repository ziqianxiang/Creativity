Figure 1: Commutation diagram for an equivariant operator φ applied to a 3D molecular graph withsteerable node features (visualised as spherical functions); As the molecule rotates, so do the nodefeatures. The use of steerable vectors allows neural networks to exploit, embed, or learn geometriccues such as force and velocity vectors.
Figure 2: Left: representation of an O(3) steerable vector h ∈ VL = V0 ㊉ V1 ㊉ V2, a sphericalharmonic embedding of vector x, e.g. relative orientation, velocity or force. Right: for each subspacethe embedding with the basis functions Ymml is shown (a). The transformation of h via D(I) (g) actson each subspace of Vl separately (b).
