Figure 1: t-SNE visualization of feature representations of an imbalanced training set for the CatVs-Dog visualized by tSNE learned by different methods (from left to right): optimizing CE loss, anAUC loss, a linear combination of CE and AUC loss, and a compositional objective by our method.
Figure 2: Evolution of different terms in (5) computed in the process of our optimization algorithm(Algorithm 1) on the CatvsDog data. LAVG is the averaged CE loss. Please refer to Appendix A.6for more details of the calculations.
Figure 3: t-SNE visualization of training data (• is positive and • is negative) by (from top to bottom)optimizing the CE loss, an AUC loss from scratch, a linear combined loss, and our CT method.
Figure 4: Convergence curves on four benchmark datasets with an imbalance ratio of 10%.
Figure 5: Convergence curves of testing AUC on four benchmark datasets with imbalance ratio of10%.
Figure 6: Evolution of each term of compositional objective function on CATvsDog, CIFAR10,STL10 and CIFAR100 datasets (from top to bottom).
