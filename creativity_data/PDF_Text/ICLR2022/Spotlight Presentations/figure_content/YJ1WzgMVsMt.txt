Figure 1: Evaluation of algorithms on four sparse reward MuJoCo environments with complete (1a)and incomplete (1b) offline data. The solid line corresponds to the mean over five trials with differentseeds and the shaded region corresponds to the standard deviation over the trials.
Figure 2: Training and evaluation under Gazebo simulations and real-world experiments. (a)-(c) showthe experiment setup, with the TurtleBot added for visual reference in (c). (d)-(f) show waypointtracking performance. (g)-(i) show waypoint tracking with obstacle avoidance performance.
