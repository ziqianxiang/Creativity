Figure 1: Learning curves on a suite of MuJoCo benchmark tasks with episodic rewards. All curvesfor MuJoCo benchmark are plotted from 30 runs with random initializations. The shaded regionindicates the standard deviation. To make the comparison more clear, the curves are smoothed byaveraging 10 most recent evaluation points. We set up an evaluation point every 104 timesteps.
Figure 2: Learning curves of RRD with different choices of hyper-parameter K . The curves withK = 64 correspond to the default implementation of RRD presented in Figure 1.
Figure 3: Learning curves on a suite of Atari benchmark tasks with episodic rewards. These curvesare plotted from 5 runs with random initializations. The shaded region indicates the standard devi-ation. To make the comparison more clear, the curves are smoothed by averaging 10 most recentevaluation points. We set up an evaluation point every 5 ∙ 104 timesteps.

Figure 5: An ablation study on the hyper-parameter configuration of IRCR. The curves of “IRCR”refer to the performance of IRCR using the hyper-parameter setting proposed by Gangwani et al.
