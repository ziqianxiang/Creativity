Figure 1:	Schematic structure of an antibody (figure modified from Wikipedia).
Figure 2:	(A-C) One generation step of RefineGNN. Each circle represents a CDR residue and eachsquare represents a residue block in a coarsened context sequence. (D) Sequence coarsening.
Figure 3: (A) CDR-H3 structure predicted by RefineGNN (PDB: 4bkl, RMSD = 0.57). The pre-dicted structure (cyan) is aligned to the true structure (green) using the KabsCh algorithm. (B) CDR-H3 structure predicted by AR-GNN (PDB: 4bkl, RMSD = 2.16). (C) Ablation studies of differentmodeling choices in RefineGNN in the CDR-H3 perplexity evaluation task.
Figure 4: (A) Visualization of a generated CDR-H3 sequence and its structure in complex with anantigen (PDB: 4cmh). The predicted structure is aligned and grafted onto the original antibody usingthe Kabsch algorithm. Residues different from the original antibody are highlighted in red. (B) Thecorrelation between the perplexity of a generated sequence and AA recovery error.
