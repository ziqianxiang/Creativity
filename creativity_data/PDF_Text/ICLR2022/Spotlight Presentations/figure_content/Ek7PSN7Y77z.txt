Figure 1: Sample game paths and state observations from ZORKL Starting from the leftmoststate ('West of House')，the agent encounters several novel and unique valid actions (e.g Odysseus,Echo) (in brown) across different states in the game. In order to make progress, our algorithm(XTX) strategically re-visits different frontiers in the state space (red and blue circles) and performsstrategic local exploration to overcome bottleneck states (e.g. ‘Troll Room’) and dead-ends (e.g.
