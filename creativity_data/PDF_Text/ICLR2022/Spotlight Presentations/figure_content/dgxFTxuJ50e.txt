Figure 1: Illustration of how important features are extracted by the dilated convolution. The coloredcircles indicate the important features (xi1 , . . . , xiC0 ).
Figure 2: Smoothness with polynomial order in-	Figure 3: Smoothness with sparsitycreaseIn this section, we verify the dimension independence of CNNs by numerical experiments usingfunctions with anisotropic smoothness. The experiments were conducted in the following settings:29Published as a conference paper at ICLR 20221.	Smoothness with Polynomial order increase:We consider the following function as the true function:d √τ k	kf °(x) = X Pk 2ip Y Cos (2πxi),k=1	i=1 2 i=1where p,d ∈ N are parameters. Data generation model: yi = f °(χi) (i = 1,...,n).
