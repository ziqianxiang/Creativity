Figure 1: comparison between current multi-class classification training in deep face recog-nition and our binary classification training.
Figure 2: Comparison between triplet-based and pair-based learning. Purple arrows denoteoptimization directions. Triplet-based learning compares different similarity scores, while pair-based learning compares similarity score and a threshold.
Figure 3: Loss objective value under different target cosine values.
Figure 4: Intuitive comparison of angular margin in different losses.
Figure 5: Similarity score distribution of positive and negative pairs trained with dif-ferent t. The evaluation pairs are combined from 4 sets: LFW [9], Age-DB30 [24],CA-LFW [49] and CP-LFW [50].
Figure 6: g(cos(Î¸)) of different t.
Figure 7: 2D deep feature learned by SphereFace2. We construct a small dataset consistingof 6 face identities from VGGFace2 [2]. Dots with the same color represent samples fromthe same face identity.
Figure 8: 3D features.
Figure 9: The ROC curves of SphereFace2 and other start-of-art methods on IJB-B(left) and IJB-C (right) datasets.
