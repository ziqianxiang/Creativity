Table 1: Comparison between the various gradient-based HO algorithms. 1-step denotes one-step looka-head approximation (Luketina et al., 2016).
Table 2: Meta-test performance measured in test classification accuracy (%). We report mean and and 95%confidence intervals over 5 meta-training runs.
Table 3: Memory and wall-clock time required by a single process. We used RTX 2080 Ti for the measure-ments. Note that we run 4 processes in parallel in our actual experiments (meta-batchsize is 4), which requiresroughly Ã—4 memory than the values reported in this table.
Table 4:	Meta-test performance.
Table 5:	Meta-test performance.
