Table 1: Optimizing the ELBO starting from the ML solution degrades the FID-score. The firstrow corresponds to the pre-trained encoder for the ground truth decoder, its FID-score thereforecompares two image sets, both generated by the ground truth model.
Table 2: Training and test NELBO values for Text-VAE with different configurations of bits, de-coder and encoder. Bold highlights the best encoder choice and underlined bold values are the bestdecoder-encoder combinations for each bit-length.
