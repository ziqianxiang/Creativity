Table 1: Results of synthetic tree construction for “reachable” and “unreachable” target molecules.
Table 2: Highest scores of generated molecules for various de novo molecular design tasks. Note thatall baselines other than our method don’t place constraints on synthetic accessibility.
Table 3: Results of synthesis planning for molecules from training, validation, and test datasets.
Table 4: Analysis of the generated molecules in unrecovered cases. We compare with baselinegenerative methods to evaluate the similarity of input and output molecules.

Table 5: Results of synthesis planning for unrecovered cases in “reachable” and “unreachablemolecules. Metrics other than recovery rate are measured for unrecovered molecules only.
Table 6: SALI of oracle functions we investigated. A higher SALI value means that a small structurechange can lead to a larger property change, such that the function is more sensitive to detailedstructural changes.
Table 7: Results of synthesizable molecular optimization on common oracle functions. Seeds arerandomly sampled from the ZINC database (Sterling & Irwin, 2015). Top-n is the average value forthe top n molecules. “Seeds” refers to the mean scores of the initial mating pool we sampled and“Outputs” refers to the mean scores of the 128 generated molecules.
Table 8: Leaderboard on TDC DRD3 docking benchmark using ZINC and Docking. Mean andstandard deviation across three runs are reported. Arrows (↑, J) indicate the direction of betterperformance. The best method is bolded and the second best is underlined. Note in particular the lowSA_Score and high % Pass, which are heuristics for synthetic complexity and drug likeness/quality.
