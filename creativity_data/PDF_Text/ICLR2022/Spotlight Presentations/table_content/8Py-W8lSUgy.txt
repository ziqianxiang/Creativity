Table 1: Results of different multi-task learning settings on graph classification tasks, measured inROC AUC. MetaLink can successfully utilize the relations among different tasks, outperforming thestate-of-the-art method GROVER (Rong et al., 2020) under the relational setting.
Table 2: Results on MS-COCO (80 tasks) dataset. We report the average accuracy and standarddeviation over 5 runs on the validation set. We use ResNet-50 and our input size is 224. MetaLinkachieves the best performance in relational settings through harnessing the auxiliary labels efficiently.
Table 3: ROC AOC on 3 tasks with the lowestaverage Pearson correlation to other tasks (tasks 2,17, 22), as well as 3 tasks with the highest averagePearson correlation to other tasks (tasks 5, 20, 21)on the Sider dataset. We observe MetaLink gainsmore improvement on the tasks with high Pearsoncorrelation.
Table 4: Results on 5-way, 5-shot classification on mini-ImageNet and tiered-ImageNet datasets. Wereport the average accuracy and standard deviation over 800 randomly sampled episodes. MetaLinkdemonstrates consistent improvement from stacking KG layer = 0 to 2.
Table 5: Results of ROC AUC (for biomedical) and mAP (for MS-COCO) datasets.
