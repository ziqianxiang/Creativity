Table 1: We examine four characteristics: The ability to handle partial observation at test and train time,the form of the joint distribution or representation in the bi-modal case (s, t are modalities), and additionalcomponents. (✓) indicates a theoretical capability that is not verified empirically.
Table 2: Marginal likelihoods.
Table 3: Coherence Scores for MNIST → SVHN (Top) and for SVHN → MNIST (Bottom). Subscript indicateswhich modality is always present during training, f indicates the percentage of matched samples. Higher isbetter.
Table 5: Correlation Values for CUB cross generations. Higher is better.
Table 6: Mutual Information Scores. Lower is better.
