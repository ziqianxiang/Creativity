Table 1: Summary of related works on the noise and stationary distribution of SGD. This work fills the gap ofthe lack of theoretical results for the actual SGD dynamics, which is discrete-time and with minibatch noise.
Table 2: Comparison with previous results. For notational conciseness, we compare the case whenall the relevant matrices commute. The model fluctuation Σ, the expected training loss Ltrainand the expected test loss Ltest calculated by continuous- and discrete-time theories with Hessianapproximation C ≈ H are presented. Exact solutions to these quantities obtained in the present workare shown in the rightmost column.
