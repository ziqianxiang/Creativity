Table 1: Test perplexity on WikiText-103 dataset.
Table 2: Test perplexity on One Billion Word dataset.
Table 3: Bit per Character on the Enwik8 dataset.
Table 4: Comparison of base LM and GNN-LM in different kNN recall buckets. We report averagelog probabilities within each bucket, and compute the absolute and relative improvement.
Table 5: Test perplexity on WikiText-103 with different representations as query and key.
Table 6: Two examples showing the input context and the corresponding extracted three neighbors.
