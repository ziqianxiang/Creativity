Table 1: Complex Prediction Results. As in the main text, the proprietary baselines might internallyuse parts of the test sets (e.g. to extract templates or features), thus their numbers might be optimistic.
Table 2: Overview of Datasets. For DIPS, the statistics of number of residues and atoms per proteinis based on a subset consisting of 200 proteins.
Table 3: Hyperparameter choices. LN stands for layer normalization, BN stands for batch normaliza-tion.
Table 4: Inference time comparison (in seconds). Note: ClusPro and PatchDock were run manuallyusing the respective public webservers, thus their runtimes are influenced by their cluster load.
Table 5: Ablation studies. We show DIPS test median C-RMSD and I-RMSD values for thecorresponding best validation models. Abbreviations: “intersection loss” = intersection loss inEq. (15), “pocket loss” = pocket loss in Eq. (14), “surface feas” = surface features in Eq. (16).
Table 6: Values of the intersection loss defined in Eq. (15) and evaluated on the DIPS validation setin different scenarios. “Centered structures” means that both ground truth ligand and receptor pointclouds have been centered (0-mean), without any other modifications.
