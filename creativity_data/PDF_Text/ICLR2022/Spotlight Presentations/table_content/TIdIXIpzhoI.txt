Table 1: Generated sample quality as measured by FID and Inception Score (FID/IS) on uncondi-tional CIFAR-10, training the original model (no distillation), and comparing different parameteri-zations and loss weightings discussed in Section 4. All reported results are averages over 3 randomseeds of the best metrics obtained over 2 million training steps; nevertheless we find results are still±0.1 due to the noise inherent in training our models. Taking the neural network output to representa prediction of in combination with the Truncated SNR loss weighting leads to divergence.
