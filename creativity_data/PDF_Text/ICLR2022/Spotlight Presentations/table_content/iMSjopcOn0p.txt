Table 7: Mapping of Slakh2100 “classes” to MT3 Instrument Token numbers used for all experi-ments using the Slakh2100 dataset (i.e., all columns labeled Slakh2100 in experiments throughoutthis paper). Slakh2100 classes have slightly more granularity than the 16 MIDI Classes (see Table 8and our MT3 Instrument tokens are designed to roughly correspond MIDI program numbers.
