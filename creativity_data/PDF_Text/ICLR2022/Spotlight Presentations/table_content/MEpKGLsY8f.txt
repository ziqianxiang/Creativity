Table 1: Ablation Study on four datasets. In this table, we report the ACC (%)±standard deviation ofACC (%) on four datasts, where w/o represents “without”. It is clear that CATA improves the ACC.
Table 2: Results of K-means on all four datasets.
Table 3: Results of NCD with abundant novel class data. In this table, we report the ACC(%)±standard deviation of ACC (%) of baselines and our methods (MM and MP) given abun-dant novel class data. We still evaluate these methods on four benchmarks (SVHN, CIFAR-10,CIFAR-100, and OmniGlot).
