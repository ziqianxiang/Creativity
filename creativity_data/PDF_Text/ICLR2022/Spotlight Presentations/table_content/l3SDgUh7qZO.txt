Table 6: Results on IJB-B. We cite the results from the original papers for [2, 46,47]. For the re-implemented methods, We use the hyperparameters that lead to thebest results on the validation set. Results are in % and higher values are better.
Table 7: Results on IJB-C. The testing instances of IJB-C are twice as many asthose in IJB-B. Results are in % and higher is better.
Table 8: Results on MegaFace. Because of mislabeled samples inMegaFace, we present the results before and after label refinement.
