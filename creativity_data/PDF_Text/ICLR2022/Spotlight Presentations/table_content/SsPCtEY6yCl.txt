Table 1: Deficiencies of some common alternatives to overly expressive EBMs.
Table A.1: Summary of negative results: neither deterministic or randomized algorithms can estimate EBM partitionfunctions accurately. On the other hand, popular sampling schemes such as rejection and importance sampling requiretheir autoregressive proposal distributions to be uncomputable.
