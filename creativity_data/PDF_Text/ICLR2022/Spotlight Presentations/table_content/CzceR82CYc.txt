Table 1: Unconditional CIFAR-10 generative performance.
Table 2: (right) Performance using adaptive stepsize solvers (ODE is based on probability flow, GGF simulatesgenerative SDE). f: taken from JoliCoeur-Martineau et al. (2021a). LSGM corresponds to the small LSGM-100M model for fair comparison (details in App. E.2.7). Error tolerances were chosen to obtain similar NFEs.
Table 3: (bottom) Performance using non-adaptive stepsize solvers (forPC, QS performed poorly). f: 2.23 FID is our evaluation, Song et al.
Table 5: Initial velocitydistribution width.
Table 6: Model architectures as well as SDE and training setups for our experiments on CIFAR-10and CelebA-HQ-256.
Table 7: Influence of denoising step on FID scores (using our main CIFAR-10 model).
Table 8: Performance (measured in negative log-likelihood) using analytical scores for non-adaptive stepsizesolvers for varying numbers of synthesis steps n (function evaluations).
