Table 1: Total GPU (A100) hours to train all models of the respective figures. *Experiments arenot included in the original works and timings are measured with the default parameters for therespective models. â€” Larger molecules did not work with DeepErwin.
Table 2: Default hyperparameters.
Table 3:	Energies in Eh averaged over the PES for PESNets with and without the MetaGNN. Num-bers in brackets indicate the standard error at the last digit(s). In cases without the MetaGNN, westill train a single model for all configurations of a system.
Table 4:	Energies in Eh averaged over the PES for different number of determinants in our PESNetmodel. Numbers in brackets indicate the standard error at the last digit(s).
Table 5:	Energies in Eh averaged over the PES for different single-stream sizes in our PESNetmodel. Numbers in brackets indicate the standard error at the last digit(s).
