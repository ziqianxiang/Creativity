Table 1: InKB Micro F1 on the in-domain and out-of-domain test sets on the GERBIL benchmarkingplatform. For each dataset, bold indicates the best model and Underline indicates the second best.
Table 2: Ablation study for the retriever module. Each line makes a single change from the baselineretriever used in Table 1. We also compare with BM25.
Table 3: Ablation study for the reader module. Each line makes a single change from the baselinereader used in Table 1. Candidate entities are obtained from the baseline retriever in Table 2 (exceptthe oracle experiment).
