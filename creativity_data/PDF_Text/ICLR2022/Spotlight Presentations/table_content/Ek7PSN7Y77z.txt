Table 1: Results on deterministic games for the best XTX model, where the inverse dynamicsscaling coefficient Î±1 was tuned per game. We outperform the baselines on all 12 games, achievingan average normalized game score of 56%. * indicates actions were added to the game grammar.
Table 2: Results on stochastic games. We outperform baselines on 4 out of 5 games, with an averagenormalized game score of 32%. Scores are averaged across 3 seeds. Baselines were rerun with thelatest Jericho version.
Table 3: Average and maximum number of steps between rewards for games in Jericho (based onhuman walkthroughs). Several games have long sequences of actions without reward.
Table 4: Full Deterministic Results. Standard deviations are in parentheses. Scores are averagedacross 3 seeds. Note that the average normalized scores only take into account the games listed inTable 1. Baselines were rerun with the latest Jericho version.
Table 5: Full Stochastic Results. Standard deviations are in parentheses. Scores are averagedacross 3 seeds. Note that the average normalized scores only take into account the games listed inTable 2. Baselines were rerun with the latest Jericho version.
