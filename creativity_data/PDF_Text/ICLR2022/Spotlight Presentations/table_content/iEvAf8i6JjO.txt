Table 1: The averaged accuracy (ACC) and backward transfer (BWT) over all the tasks on differentdatasets. Note that, Multitask jointly learns all tasks only once in a single network by using thewhole dataset, which does not adhere to CL setup.
Table 2: The performance for CIFAR-100 Sup dataset. Note that Single-task learning (STL) trainsa separate network for each task, which does not adhere to CL setup.

To understand the impact of the threshold l, we evaluate the learningperformance for three different values of l (i.e., 0.2, 0.5, 0.7) as shown in Table 3. The results showthat the accuracy is very stable across the three threshold values, with ignoble accuracy difference onboth CIFAR-100 Split and 5-Dataset settings. The reason behind is because we only select top-2 oldtasks with largest gradient projection norm into the trust region, among all tasks satisfying conditionEq. (3). Therefore, for a wide range of l, the selected tasks in the trust region are actually fixed.
