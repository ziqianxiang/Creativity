Table 2: Simulation results of the glycolytic oscillator under different noise levels. The success probability andthe RMSE on θ1, θ3 are reported for the two equations. Standard deviations are shown in the brackets.
Table 3: The detailed settings for each simulation: noise level σR, time step size ∆t, number of trajectories N,time horizon T, range of initial conditions [a, b], numeric constants θ. Bold values are the defaults.
Table 4: The top-3 most common equations discovered by different methods for each dynamical system (among the 100 simulation runs). “Freq” denotes the chance of discoveringthe equation. We make the following observations: (1) SR-T and SR-S produce over-simplistic equations for the growth models (constant or zero), possibly because the estimatedderivative X is too noisy to learn useful signal. (2) SR-T and SR-S may consistently miss a variable (e.g. the xo term in Glycolytic 1) or miss an interaction (e.g. the x0x2 term inLorenz 2). (3) SR-T and SR-S may include unnecessary terms in the equation (e.g. Lorenz 3). The measurements settings are the default ones listed in Table 3.
