Table 1: Runtime and memory complexities for sampling algorithms developed in this work. M isthe size of the entire item set (ground set), and K is the rank of the kernel (often K M in practice).
Table 2: Average MPR and AUC, with 95% confidence estimates obtained via bootstrapping, testlog-likelihood, and the number of rejections for NDPP models. Bold values indicate the best MPR,outside of the confidence intervals of the two baseline methods.
Table 3: Wall-clock time (sec) for preprocessing and sampling ONDPPs trained on real-world data,and speedup of the tree-based sampler over the Cholesky-based one. We set K = 100 and provideaverage times with 95% confidence intervals from 10 independent trials for the Cholesky-basedalgorithm and 100 trials for the rejection algorithm. Memory usage for the tree is also reported.
