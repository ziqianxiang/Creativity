Table 1: Comparison of theestimated choice (IC) of a leaderagent in a high performancescenario (with a cooperativepartner) vs. a low performancescenario (with a randomly-actingpartner). IC correlates with highperformance.
Table 2: Results of the Tagexperiments (mean and standarddeviation over 5 random seeds).
Table 3: Results on minimalistic environments (sec. 4.1). Two desired behaviours of the altruisticagent, one for each scenario, are listed as the two bottom rows. In the columns, D denotes DiscreteChoice, E Entropic Choice, AvE the Assistance via Empowerment baseline (Du et al., 2020), andSV the supervised baseline. Refer to sec. 4.1 for a discussion of the results.
Table 4: Detailed hyper-parameters used in the three experimental environments.
Table 5: Results on the resource environment. We evaluate two baselines (random and supervised),and four different implementations of choice. Performance is measured as the average number ofconsume actions that failed, over all time steps and both agents (so it takes values between 0 and 1).
