Table 1: Hyperparameters for LAMBDA. For other safety tasks, we recommend first tuning theinitial Lagrangian, penalty and penalty power factor at different scales and then fine-tune the safetydiscount factor to improve constraint satisfaction. We emphasize that it is possible to improve theperformance of each task separately by fine-tuning the hyperparameters on a per-task basis.
Table 2: LAMBDA’s unnormalized scores for the SG6 tasks.
Table 3: Experiment results for the SG6 benchmark. We present the results with the tuple(J(∏), Jc(∏), pc(∏)) of the normalized metrics.
