Table 1: Performance on Sort of CLEVR. We highlight that our proposed model outperforms thebaseline across the different question types even with lower number of searches and/or retrievals.
Table 2: Performance on Multi-Task Image Classification. We highlight that our proposed modeloutperforms the baseline across different number of retrievals.
Table 3: Performance on Equilateral TriangleDetection. Our proposed method outperforms thebaseline over different number of retrievals.
Table 4: Performance on SCAN. We highlight that our proposed model outperforms the baselineacross the different question types even with lower number of searches and/or retrievals.
Table 5: Contextual Retrieval TaskOoD Setup. For 2-Search-4-Retrievevariant there are 42 unique value com-binations that define tasks. For the OoDsetup, we pick fraction of tasks for train-ing set and the rest for the test set.
Table 6: Performance on the Contextual Retrieval task. Performance for different number ofsearches and retrievals in ground truth data. Ablations are done on the number of heads anddimensionality of the transformer dimension.
Table 7: Dimensions and Heads Ablation on Sort of CLEVR. We perform ablations with increasednumber of dimensions and heads. For proposed model, We use 2 searches - 2 retrievals for 32dimensional model and 4 searches - 2 retrievals for other dimensions.
Table 8: Compositional Transformer - MLP Ablation on Sort of CLEVR. We highlight thatour proposed model outperforms the baseline across the different question types even with lowernumber of searches and/or retrievals even with the MLP ablation where the retrieval attention score iscomputed by an MLP instead of dot-product acttention.
Table 9: Performance on Equilateral TriangleDetection. We perform ablations over the numberof retrievals and type of attention mechanism usedretrieval. Our proposed method outperforms thebaseline over multiple different setups.
