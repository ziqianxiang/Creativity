Table 1: Average and minimum class accuracy (%) on USPS→MNIST with different levels of shiftsin label distributions (higher α implies more severe imbalance). We report median (the main number),and 25 (subscript) and 75 (superscript) percentiles across 5 runs.
Table 2: Results on STL→CIFAR. Same setup and reporting metrics as Table 1.
Table 3: Results on VisDA17. Same setup and reporting metrics as Table 1.
Table D.1: Results of ablation experiments of the effect of auxiliary conditional entropy loss onSTL→CIFAR data. Same setup and reporting metrics as Table 1.
Table D.2: Results of comparison with optimal transport based methods on STL→CIFAR data. Samesetup and reporting metrics as Table 1.
Table D.3: Results of comparison of ASA with DANN and VADA across different values of thealignment loss weight λalign on STL→CIFAR data. Same setup and reporting metrics as Table 1.
Table D.4: Analysis of effect history size parameter for ASA on USPS→MNIST with class labeldistribution shift corresponding to α = 1.5. We report distribution and support distances between thepushforward distributions gψ]pθZ and gψ]qZθ , as well as the value of discriminator’s log-loss.
Table D.5: Results of No DA, DANN, and ASA-abs (with different history sizes) on 3-classUSPS→MNIST adaptation with 2D feature extractor and label distribution shift correspondingto α = 1.5. We report average and minimum target class accuracy, as well as Wasserstein distanceDW and support divergence D4 between source pθZ and target qZθ 2D embedding distributions. Wereport median (the main number), and 25 (subscript) and 75 (superscript) percentiles across 5 runs.
