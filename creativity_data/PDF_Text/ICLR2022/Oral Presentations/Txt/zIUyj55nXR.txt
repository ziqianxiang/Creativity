Many machine learning tasks involve learning functions that are known to be
invariant or equivariant to certain symmetries of the input data. However, it is often
challenging to design neural network architectures that respect these symmetries
while being expressive and computationally efficient. For example, Euclidean
motion invariant/equivariant graph or point cloud neural networks.
We introduce Frame Averaging (FA), a general purpose and systematic framework
for adapting known (backbone) architectures to become invariant or equivariant to
new symmetry types. Our framework builds on the well known group averaging
operator that guarantees invariance or equivariance but is intractable. In contrast,
we observe that for many important classes of symmetries, this operator can be
replaced with an averaging operator over a small subset of the group elements,
called a frame. We show that averaging over a frame guarantees exact invariance
or equivariance while often being much simpler to compute than averaging over
the entire group. Furthermore, we prove that FA-based models have maximal
expressive power in a broad setting and in general preserve the expressive power
of their backbone architectures. Using frame averaging, we propose a new class
of universal Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), universal Euclidean motion invari-
ant point cloud networks, and Euclidean motion invariant Message Passing (MP)
GNNs. We demonstrate the practical effectiveness of FA on several applications in-
cluding point cloud normal estimation, beyond 2-WL graph separation, and n-body
dynamics prediction, achieving state-of-the-art results in all of these benchmarks.
1 Introduction
Many tasks in machine learning (ML) require learning functions that are invariant or equivariant
with respect to symmetric transformations of the data. For example, graph classification is invariant
to a permutation of its nodes, while node prediction tasks are equivariant to node permutations.
Consequently, itis important to design expressive neural network architectures that are by construction
invariant or equivariant for scalable and efficient learning. This recipe has proven to be successful
for many ML tasks including image classification and segmentation (LeCun et al., 1998; Long et al.,
2015), set and point-cloud learning (Zaheer et al., 2017; Qi et al., 2017a), and graph learning (Kipf &
Welling, 2016; Gilmer et al., 2017; Battaglia et al., 2018).
Nevertheless, for some important instances of symmetries, the design of invariant and/or equivariant
networks is either illusive (Thomas et al., 2018; Dym & Maron, 2020), computationally expensive
or lacking in expressivity (Xu et al., 2018a; Morris et al., 2019; Maron et al., 2019; Murphy et al.,
2019). In this paper, we propose a new general-purpose framework, called Frame Averaging (FA),
that can systematically facilitate expressive invariant and equivariant networks with respect to a broad
class of groups. At the heart of our framework, we build on a basic fact that arbitrary functions
φ : V → R, Φ : V → W, where V, W are some vector spaces, can be made invariant or equivariant by
symmetrization, that is averaging over the group (Yarotsky, 2021; Murphy et al., 2018), i.e.,
ψ(X) =看 ∑ φ(g-1 ∙ X) or ψ(X)=卷 ∑ g ∙ φ(g-1 ∙X).

where G = {g} denotes the group, ψ : V → R is invariant and Ψ : V → W is equivariant with
respect to G. Furthermore, since invariant and equivariant functions are fixed under group averaging,
i.e., ψ = φ for invariant φ and Ψ = Φ for equivariant Φ, the above scheme often leads to universal
(i.e., maximally expressive) models (Yarotsky, 2021). However, the challenge with equation 1 is
that when the cardinality of G is large (e.g., combinatorial groups such as permutations) or infinite
(e.g., continuous groups such as rotations), then exact averaging is intractable. In such cases, we
are forced to approximate the sum via heuristics or Monte Carlo (MC), thereby sacrificing the exact
invariance/equivariance property for computational efficiency, e.g., Murphy et al. (2018; 2019) define
heuristic averaging strategies for approximate permutation invariance in GNNs; similarly, Hu et al.
(2021) and Shuaibi et al. (2021) use MC averaging for approximate rotation equivariance in GNNs.
A concurrent approach is to find cases where computing the symmetrization operator can be done
more efficiently (Sannai et al., 2021).
The key observation of the current paper is that the group average in equation 1 can be replaced with an
average over a carefully selected subset F(X) ⊂ G while retaining both exact invariance/equivariance
and expressive power. Therefore, if F can be chosen so that the cardinality ∣F(X)∣ is mostly small,
averaging over F(X) results in both expressive and efficient invariant/equivariant model. We call
the set-valued function F : V → 2G, a frame, and show that it can successfully replace full group
averaging if it satisfies a set equivariance property. We name this framework Frame Averaging (FA)
and it serves as the basis for the design of invariant/equivariant networks in this paper.
We instantiate the FA framework by considering different choices of symmetry groups G, their
actions on data spaces V, W (manifested by choices of group representations), and the backbone
architectures (or part thereof) φ, Φ we want to make invariant/equivariant to G. We consider: (i) Multi-
Layer Perceptrons (MLP), and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with node identification (Murphy
et al., 2019; Loukas, 2020) adapted to permutation invariant Graph Neural Networks (GNNs); (ii)
Message-Passing GNN (Gilmer et al., 2017) adapted to be invariant/equivariant to Euclidean motions,
E(d); (iii) Set network, DeepSets and PointNet (Zaheer et al., 2017; Qi et al., 2017a) adapted to be
equivariant or locally equivariant to E(d); (iv) Point cloud network, DGCNN (Wang et al., 2018),
adapted to be equivariant to E(d).
Theoretically, we prove that the FA framework maintains the expressive power of its original backbone
architecture which leads to some interesting corollaries: First, (i) results in invariant universal graph
learning models; (ii) is an E(d) invariant/equivariant GNN that maintain the power of message
passing (Xu et al., 2018a; Morris et al., 2019); and (iii), (iv) furnish a universal permutation and
E(d) invariant/equivariant models. We note that both the construction and the proofs are arguably
considerably simpler than the existing alternative constructions and proofs for this type of symmetry
(Thomas et al., 2018; Fuchs et al., 2020; Dym & Maron, 2020). We experimented with FA on different
tasks involving symmetries including: point-cloud normal estimation, beyond 2-Weisfeiler-Lehman
graph separation, and n-body dynamics predictions, reaching state of the art performance in all.
2	Frame Averaging
In this section we introduce the FA approach using a generic formulation; in the next section we
instantiate FA to different problems of interest.
2.1	Frame averaging for function symmetrization
Let φ : V → R and Φ : V → W be some arbitrary functions, where V, W are normed linear spaces
with norms IHlV , ∣∣∙∣∣ w, respectively. For example, φ, Φ can be thought of as neural networks. We
consider a group G = {g} that describes some symmetry we want to incorporate into φ, Φ. The way
the symmetries g ∈ G are applied to vectors in V, W is described by the group’s representations
ρ1 : G → GL(V), and ρ2 : G → GL(W), where GL(V) is the space of invertible linear maps
V → V (automorphisms). A representation ρi preserves the group structure by satisfying ρi(gh) =
ρi(g)ρi(h) for all g, h ∈ G (see e.g., Fulton & Harris (2013)). As customary, we will sometimes refer
to the linear spaces V, W as representations.
Our goal is to make φ into an invariant function, namely satisfy φ(ρ1(g)X) = φ(X), for all g ∈ G
and X ∈ V; and Φ into an equivariant function, namely Φ(ρ1(g)X) = ρ2(g)Φ(X), for all g ∈ G and
X ∈ V . We will do that by averaging over group elements, but instead of averaging over the entire
group every time (as in equation 1) we will average on a subset of the group elements called a frame.

Definition 1. A frame is defined as a Set ValUedfUnCtiOn F : V → 2G ∖ 0.
1.	A frame is G-equivariant if F(ρ1 (g)X) = gF(X),	∀X ∈ V, g ∈ G, where as usual,
gF(X) = {gh ∣ h ∈ F(X)}, and the eqUality shOUld be UnderstOOd as eqUality Of sets.
2.	Aframe is bounded over a domain K ⊂ V ifthere exists a constant C > 0 so that ∣∣ρ2 (g)∣∣0p ≤
c, for all g ∈ F(X) and all X ∈ K, where IHlop denotes the induced operator norm over W.
Figure 1 provides an illustration. How are equivariant frames
useful? Consider a scenario where an equivariant frame is
easy to compute, and furthermore its cardinality, ∣F (X)∣, is
not too large. Then averaging over the frame, denoted CF
and defined by
(Φ>f(X)=两焉 ∑ Φ(ρι(g)-1 X)
∣F(X)∣ g∈F(X)
(Φ>f(X)=由1 ∑ ρ2(g)Φ(ρ1(g)-1X)
∣F(X)∣ g∈F(X)

provides the required function symmetrization. In Appendix A.1 we prove:
Theorem 1	(Frame Averaging). Let F be a G eqUivariant frame, and φ : V → R, Φ : V → W some
functions. Then,⑷F is G invariant, while (Φ)f is G equivariant.
Several comments are in order: First, the invariant case (equation 2) is a particular case of the
equivariant case (equation 3) under the choice of W = R and the trivial representation ρ2(g) ≡ 1.
Second, in this paper we only consider X and frame choices F for which F(X) are finite sets.
Nevertheless, treating the infinite case is an important future research direction. Third, a trivial choice
of an equivariant frame is F(X ) ≡ G, that is, taking the frame to be the entire group for all X ∈ V
(for infinite but compact G the sum in the FA in this case can be replaced with Harr integral). This
choice can be readily checked to be equivariant, and turns the FA equations 2, 3 into standard group
averaging operators, equation 1. The problem with this choice, however, is that it often results in an
intractable or challenging computation, e.g., when the group is large or infinite. In contrast, as we
show below, in some useful cases one can compute a manageable size frame and can use it to build
invariant or equivariant operators in a principled way. Let us provide a simple example for Frame
Averaging: consider V = Rn , W = R, and G = R with addition as the group action. We choose the
group actions1 in this case to be ρ1(a)x = x + a1, and ρ2(a)b = b + a, where a, b ∈ R, x ∈ Rn, and
1 ∈ Rn is the vector of all ones. We can define the frame in this case using the averaging operator
F(x) = {^ITx} ⊂ G = R. Note that in this case the frame contains only one element from the
group, in other cases finding such a small frame is hard or even impossible. One can check that this
frame is equivariant per Definition 1. The FA of φ : Rn → R would be {0)尸(x) = φ(x - ɪ (ITx) 1)
in the invariant case, and {0)尸(x) = φ(x - n (1tx) 1) + n 1tX in the equivariant case.
Incorporating G as a second symmetry. An important use case of frame averaging is with the
backbones φ, Φ already invariant/equivariant w.r.t. some symmetry group H and our goal is to
make it invariant/equivariant to H × G. For example, say we want to add G = E(3) equivariance to
permutation invariant set or graph functions, i.e., H = Sn . We will provide sufficient conditions for the
FA to provide this desired invariance/equivariance. First, let us assume H is acting on V and W by the
representations τ1 : H → GL(V) and τ2 : H → GL(W), respectively. Assume φ is H invariant and
Φ is H equivariant. We say that representations ρ1 and τ1 commute if ρ1(g)τ1(h)X = τ1(h)ρ1(g)X
for all g ∈ G, h ∈ H, and X ∈ V. Ifρ1 and τ1 commute then the map γ1 : H ×G → GL(V) defined by
γ1(h, g) = τ1 (h)ρ1 (g) is a representation of the group H × G. Second, we would need that the frame
F(X) is invariant to H, that is F(τ1 (h)X) = F(X). We show a generalization of Theorem 1:
Theorem 2	(Frame Average second symmetry). Assume F is H -invariant and G-equivariant. Then,
1.	If φ : V → R is H invariant and ρ1,τ1 commute then ⑷F is G × H invariant.
2.	If Φ : V → W is H equivariant andρi,τi, i = 1,2, commmute then (中)尸 is G×H equivariant.
1Note that since these are affine maps they are technically not representations but have an equivalent
representation using homogeneous coordinates. Therefore, FA is also valid with affine actions as used here.

Right actions. Above we used left actions for the definition of equivariance. There are other flavors
of equivariance, e.g., if one of the actions is right. For example, if g multiplies F(X) from the right,
then equivariance will take the form:
F(ρ1(g)X) = F(X)g-1,	∀X∈V, g∈G
(4)
and accordingly
㈤ F(X) = ∣F(X)∣
∑ Φ(ρι(g)X),⑻F (X) =	∑ P2(g)-1Φ(ρι(g)X) (5)
g∈F(X)	∣F(X)∣ g∈F(X)
are G invariant and equivariant, respectively.
Efficient calculation of invariant frame averaging. There could be instances of the FA framework
(indeed we discuss such a case later) where ∣F(X)∣ is still too large to evaluate equations 2,3. In
the invariant case, there is a more efficient form of FA, that can potentially be applied. To show
it, let us start by defining the subgroup of symmetries of X, i.e., its stabilizer. The stabilizer of an
element X ∈ V is a subgroup of G defined by GX = {g ∈ G ∣ ρ1 (g)X = X}. GX naturally induces an
equivalence relation Z on F(X), With g Z h u⇒ hg-1 ∈ GX. The equivalence classes (orbits) are
[g] = {h ∈ F(X)∣g z h} = GXg ⊂ F(X), for g ∈ F(X), and the quotient set is denoted F(X)∕Gχ.
Theorem 3. Equivariant frame F(X) is a disjoint union of equal size orbits, [g] ∈ F(X)/GX.
The proof is in A.3. The first immediate consequence of Theorem 3 is that the cardinality of F(X)
is at-least that of the stabilizer (intuitively, the inner-symmetries) of X, namely ∣F(X)∣ ≥ ∣GX ∣.
Therefore, there could be cases, such as When X describes a symmetric graph, Where ∣F(X)∣ could
be too large to average over. A remedy comes from the folloWing observation: for every h ∈ [g], We
have that h = rg, r ∈ GX, and φ(ρ1(h)-1X) = φ(ρ1(g)-1ρ1(r)-1X) = φ(ρ1 (g)-1X), since also
r-1 ∈ GX . Therefore the summands in equations 2 are constant over orbits, and We get
⑷F (X) =	∑	φ(ρ1(g)~1X),	(6)
mF [g]∈F(X)IGX
Where mF = ∣F(X)∕GX∣ = ∣F(X)∣ ∕ ∣GX ∣. This representation of invariant FA requires only
mF = ∣F (X)∣∕∣GX ∣ evaluations, compared to ∣F(X)∣ in the original FA in equation 2.
Approximation of invariant frame averaging. Unfortunately, enumerating F (X)∕GX could be
challenging in some cases. Nevertheless, equation 6 is still very useful: it turns out We can easily
draw a random element from F (X)∕GX With uniform probability. This is an immediate application
of the equal orbit size in Theorem 3:
Corollary 1. Let F(X) be an equivariant frame, and g ∈ F(X) be a uniform random sample. Then
[g] ∈ F(X )∕GX is also uniform.
Therefore, an efficient approximation strategy is averaging over uniform samples, gi ∈ F(X), i ∈ [k],
1k
《。》F (X) = k ∑ Φ(ρ1(gi)-1X).	⑺
k i=1
This approximation is especially useful, compared to the full-bloWn FA, When mF = ∣F (X)∣∕∣GX ∣ is
small, i.e., When ∣GX∣ is large, or X has many symmetries. Intuitively, the smaller mF the better the
approximation in equation 7. A partial explanation to this phenomenon is given in Appendix A.4,
While an empirical validation is provided in Section 5.2.
2.2 Expressive power
Another benefit in frame averaging as presented in equations 2 and 3 is that it preserves the expressive
poWer of the base models, φ, Φ, as exaplined next. Consider some hypothesis function space
H = {Φ} ⊂ C(V, W), Where C(V, W) is the set of all continuous functions V → W. As mentioned
above, the case of scalar functions φ is a special case Where W = R, and ρ2 (g) ≡ 1. H can be seen
as the collection of all functions represented by a certain class of neural netWorks, e.g., Multilayer
Perceptron (MLP), or DeepSets (Zaheer et al., 2017), or Message Passing Graph Neural NetWorks
(Gilmer et al., 2017). We denote by (H) the collection of functions Φ ∈ H after applying the frame
averaging in equation 3, (H) = {{Φ}f ∣ Φ ∈ H}.

We set some domain K ⊂ V over which We would like to test the approximation power of (H). To
make sure that FA is well defined over K we will assume it is frame-finite, i.e., for every X ∈ K,
F(X) is a finite set. Next, we denote KF = {ρ1 (g)-1X ∣ X ∈ K, g ∈ F(X)}; intuitively, KF ⊂ V
contains all the points sampled by the FA operator. Lastly, to quantify approximation error over a
set A ⊂ V let Us use the maximum norm ∣∣Φ∣K W = maxχ€a ∣∣Φ(X)∣∣w. We prove that an arbitrary
equivariant function Ψ ∈ C(V, W) approximable by a function from H over KF is approximable by
an equivariant function from (H) (Proof details are found on Appendix A.5).
Theorem 4 (Expressive power of FA). If F is a bounded G-equivariant frame, defined over a
frame-finite domain K, then for an arbitrary equivariant function Ψ ∈ C(V, W) we have
φnH∣∣ψ -网F ∣∣k,w ≤C φf Iiψ - φ∣∣kf ,w ,
Where c is the constant from Definition 1.
This theorem can be used to prove universality results if the backbone model is universal, even for
non-compact groups (e.g., the Euclidean motion group). Below we will use it to prove universality of
frame averaged architectures for graphs, and point clouds with Euclidean motion symmetry.
3 Model instances
We instantiate the FA framework by specifying: i) The symmetry group G, representations ρ1, ρ2
and the underlying frame F ; ii) The backbone architecture for φ (invariant) or Φ (equivariant).
3.1	Point clouds, Euclidean motions.
Symmetry. We would like to incorporate Euclidean symmetry to existing permutation invari-
ant/equivaraint point cloud networks. The symmetry of interest is G = E(d) = θ(d)区 T(d), namely
the group of Euclidean motions in Rd defined by rotations and reflections O(d), and translations
T(d). We also discuss G = SE(d) = SO(d)区 T(d), where SO(d) is the group of rotations in Rd.
We define V = Rn×d, and the group representation2 is ρ1 (g)X = XRT + 1tT, where R ∈ O(d)
or R ∈ SO(d), and t ∈ Rd denotes the translation. W, ρ2 are defined similarly, unless translation
invariance is desired in which case we use the representation ρ2(g)X = XRT.
Frame. We define the frame F(X) in this case based on Principle Component Analysis (PCA),
as follows. Let t = nXT1 ∈ Rd be the centroid of X, and C = (X - ItT)t(X - ItT) ∈ Rd×d
the covariance matrix computed after removing the centroid from X. In the generic case the
eigenvalues of C satisfy λι < λ2 < …< λd. Let vι, v2,..., Vd be the unit length corresponding
eigenvectors. Then we define F(X) = {([α1v1, . . . , αdvd] , t) ∣ αi ∈ {-1, 1}} ⊂ E(d). The size of
this frame (when it is defined) is 2d which for typical dimensions d = 2, 3 amounts to frames of size
4, 8, respectively. For G = SE(d), we restrict F(X) to orthogonal, positive orientation matrices;
generically there are 2d-1 such elements, which amounts to 2, 4 elements for d = 2, 3, respectively.
Proposition 1. F(X) based on the covariance and centroid are E(d) equivariant and bounded.
This choice of frame is defined for every X ∈ V for which the covariance matrix C has simple
spectrum (i.e., non-repeating eigenvalues). It is known that within symmetric matrices, those with
repeating eigenvalues are of co-dimension 2 (see e.g., Breiding et al. (2018)). Therefore, F(X) is
defined for almost all X except rare singular points. Where it is defined, F is continuous as a direct
consequence of perturbation theory of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of normal matrices (see e.g.,
Theorem 8.1.12 in Golub & Van Loan (1996)). However, when very close to repeating eigenvalues,
small perturbation can lead to large frame change. In Appendix B we present an empirical study of
frame stability and likelihood of encountering repeating eigenvalues in practice.
Since we would like to incorporate E(d) symmetries to an already Sn invariant/equivariant archi-
tectures, per Theorem 2, we will also need to show that the ρ1 (and similarly ρ2) commute with
T : Sn → GL(V) defined by τ(h)X = PX, where P = Ph, h ∈ Sn , is the permutation representa-
tion. That is Ph ∈ Rn×n is the permutation matrix representing h ∈ Sn, that is, Pij = 1 if i = h(j)
and 0 otherwise. Indeed τ (h)ρ1(g)X = P(XRT + 1tT) = ρ1(g)τ(h)X. Furthermore, note that
F(τ(h)X) = F(X), therefore F is also Sn invariant.
2Technically, this representation is defined by matrices (CRT	；) acting on X' = [X, 1] ∈ Rn×(d+1)

Backbone architectures. We incorporate the FA framework with two existing popular point cloud
network layers: i) PointNet (Qi et al., 2017a); and ii) DGCNN (Wang et al., 2018). We denote both
architectures by Φd,d' : Rn×d → Rn×d' for the Sn equivariant version of these models. To simplify
the discussion, we omit particular choices of layers and feature dimensions, Appendix C.1 provides
the full details. We experimented with two design choices: First, consider frame averaged Φ3,3, i.e.,
(Φ3,3)F, yielding a universal, E(3) equivariant versions for PointNet and DGCNN, dubbed FA-
PointNet and FA-DGCNN. A more complex design choice, taking inspiration from deep architectures
with multiple modules, is to compose blocks of FA networks. For example, to build a local E(3)
equivariant version of PointNet, denote also Υd,d' ： Rd → Rd' an MLp We decompose the input
point cloud to k-nn patches Xi ∈ Rk×3, i ∈ [n], where each patch is sorted by distance. Next, feed
each patch into an equivariant FA Υ3k,3d, each with its own frame Fi, resulting in E(3) equivariant
features in R3d for every point, Y ∈ Rn×3d; then applying equivariant FA Φ3d,3 providing output
in Rn ×3. That is, ψ (X) = (φ3d,3)F ([(γ3k,3d>Fι (XI),..., (γ3k,3d>Fn(Xn)]), where brackets
denote concat in the first dimension. We name this construction FA-Local-PointNet.
Universality. We use Theorem 4 to prove that using a universal set invariant/equivariant back-
bone φ, Φ, such as DeepSets or PointNet (see e.g., Zaheer et al. (2017); Qi et al. (2017a); Segol &
Lipman (2019)) leads to a universal model. Let H be any such universal set-equivariant function
collection. That is, for arbitrary continuous set function Ψ we have (in the notation of Section 2.2)
inf φ∈h Il Ψ - Φ∣∣ω w = 0 for arbitrary compact sets Ω ⊂ V. If K ⊂ V is some bounded domain, then
the choice of frame F described above implies that KF is also bounded and therefore contained in
some compact set Ω ⊂ V. Consequently, Proposition 1 and Theorem 4 imply Corollary 2. A similar
results holds for SE(d), which provides a similar expressiveness guarantee as the one from (Dym &
Maron, 2020) analyzing Tensor Field Networks (Thomas et al., 2018; Fuchs et al., 2020).
Corollary 2 (FA-DeepSets/PointNet are universal). Frame Averaging DeepSets/PointNet using the
frame F defined above results in a universal E(d) × Sn invariant/equivariant model over bounded
frame-finite sets K ⊂ V.
3.2	Graphs, permutations
Symmetry and frame. Let G = Sn, and V = Rn×d × Rn×n, where X = (Y , A) ∈ V represents
a set of node features Y ∈ Rn×d, and an adjacency matrix (or some edge attributes) A ∈ Rn×n ;
we assume undirected graphs, meaning A = AT . Let X ∈ V, the representation ρ1 is defined by
ρ1(g)X = (PY , PAPT), where P = Pg is the permutation matrix representing g ∈ Sn. We define
F(X) to contain all g ∈ Sn that sort the rows of the matrix S(X) in column lexicographic manner,
i.e., PS(X) is lexicographically sorted; the matrix S is defined as follows. Let L = diag(A1) - A
be the graph’s Laplacian. For every eigenspace (traversed in increasing eigenvalue order), spanned
by the orthogonal basis uι,..., uk, We add the (equivariant) column diag(∑k=ι UiuT) to S (Furer,
2010). Hence, the number of columns of S equals to the number of unique eigenvalues of L.
Proposition 2. F(X) defined by sorting of S(X) is Sn-equivariant and bounded.
Backbone architectures. In this case We perform only invariant tasks, for Which We chose tWo
universal backbone architectures for φ: (i) MLP applied to vec(Y , A) and (ii) GNN+ID (Murphy
et al., 2019; Loukas, 2020), denoting a GNN backbone equipped With node identifiers as node features.
We perform FA With φ according to the frame constructed in Proposition 2. Note that Theorem 3
implies, ∣F(X)∣ ≥ ∣Aut(G)∣, since the stabilizer GX is the automorphism group of the graph, i.e.,
g ∈ GX = Aut(X) iff ρ1(g)X = X. This means that for symmetric graphs equation 2 can prove too
costly. In this case, We use the approximate invariant FA, equation 7.
Universality. Let us use Theorem 4 to prove FA-MLP and FA-GNN+ID are universal. Again, it is
enough to consider the equivariant case. Let H ⊂ C(V, W) denote the collection of functions that can
be represented by MLPs or GNN+ID. Universality results in (Pinkus, 1999; Loukas, 2020; Puny et al.,
2020) imply that for any continuous graph (i.e., Sn equivariant) function Ψ, infφ∈h ∣Ψ - Φ∣∣ω w = 0
for any compact Ω ⊂ V. Let K ⊂ V be some bounded domain, then since G is finite then KF is also
bounded and is contained is some compact set. Proposition 2 and Theorem 4 noW imply:
Corollary 3 (FA-MLP and FA-GNN+ID is graph universal). Frame Averaging MLP/GNN+ID using
the frame F above results in a universal Sn equivariant graph model over bounded domains K ⊂ V.

3.3	Graphs, Euclidean motions.
Symmetry and frame. We consider the group G = E(d) acting on graphs, i.e., V = Rn×d × Rn×n,
where X = (Y , A) ∈ V represents a set of node and edge attributes, as described above. The
group representation is ρ1(g)X = ρ1(g)(Y , A) = (Y RT + 1tT, A). We define the frame F(X) =
F(Y ) using the node features as in the point cloud case, Section 3.1. Therefore Proposition 1
implies F is equivariant and bounded. Next, also in this case we would like to incorporate E(d)
symmetries to an already Sn invariant/equivariant graph neural network architectures; again per
Theorem 2, We will also need to show that the ρι (and similarly ρ2) commutes with T : Sn → GL(V)
definedbyτ(h)X = (PY,PAPT),where P = Ph is the permutation matrix of h ∈ Sn . Indeed
τ (h)ρ1(g)X = (P (Y RT + 1tT), PAPT) = ρ1(g)τ (h)X. Furthermore, note that as in the point
cloud case F (τ (h)X) = F(X), therefore F is also Sn invariant.
Backbone architecture. The backbone architecture we chose for this instantiation is the Message
Passing GNN in Gilmer et al. (2017), an Sn equivariant model denoted Φd,d' ： Rn×d × Rn×n →
Rn×d' × Rn×n. In this case we constructed a model, as suggested above, by composing l equivariant
layers Ψ(X)=仲3；,QF。…停；)’ 3出)尸…Q (Φ613d')f(X). The input feature size is 6 since we use
velocities in addition to initial position as input (n-body problem). We name this model FA-GNN.

Rotation invariant and equivariant point networks. State of the art Sn invariant networks, e.g.,
(Qi et al., 2017a;b; Atzmon et al., 2018; Li et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2018b; Wang et al., 2018) are not
invariant/equivariant to rotations/reflections by construction (Chen et al., 2019). Invariance to global
or local rotations can be achieved by modifying the 3D convolution operator or modifying the input
representation. Relative angles and distances across points (Deng et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019) or
angles and distances w.r.t. normals (Gojcic et al., 2019) can be used for rotation invariance. Other
works use some local or global frames to achieve invariance to rotations and translations. Xiao et al.
(2020); Yu et al. (2020); Deng et al. (2018) also use PCA to define rotation invariance, and can be
seen as instances of the FA framework. We augment this line of work by introducing a more general
framework that includes equivariance to rotation/reflection and translation, more general architectures
and symmetries as well as theoretical analysis of the expressive power of such models.
Equivariance is a desirable property for 3D recognition, registration (Ao et al., 2021), and other
domains such as complex physical systems (Kondor, 2018). A popular line of work utilizes the
theory of spherical harmonics to achieve equivariance (Worrall et al., 2017; Esteves et al., 2018;
Liu et al., 2018; Weiler et al., 2018; Cohen et al., 2018). Notably, Tensor Field Networks (TFN),
SE(3) transformers, and Group-Equivariant Attention (Thomas et al., 2018; Fuchs et al., 2020;
Romero & Cordonnier, 2021) achieve equivariance to both translation and rotation, i.e., SE(3),
and are maximally expressive (i.e., universal) as shown in Dym & Maron (2020). These methods,
however, are specifically adapted to SE(3) and require high order SO(3) representations as features.
Recently Deng et al. (2021) propose a rotation equivariant network by introducing tensor features,
linear layers that act equivariantly on them and equivariant non-linearities etc. However, their
architecture is not proved to be universal. Discrete convolutions (Cohen et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019;
Worrall & Brostow, 2018) have also been used for achieving equivariance. In particular, Chen et al.
(2021) propose point networks that are SE(3) equivariant and use separable discrete convolutions.
Lastly, (Finzi et al., 2020) construct equivariant layers using local group convolution, and extends
beyond rotations to any Lie group.
Graph neural networks. Message passing (MP) GNNs (Gilmer et al., 2017) are designed to be Sn
equivariant. Kondor et al. (2018) introduces a broader set of equivariant operators in MP-GNNs, while
Maron et al. (2018) provides a full characterization of linear permutation invariant/equivariant GNN
layers. In a parallel approach, trying to avoid harming expressively due to restricted architectures (Xu
et al., 2018a; Morris et al., 2019), other works suggested symmetrization of non invariant/equivariant
backbones. Ranging from eliminating all symmetries by a canonical ordering (Niepert et al., 2016) to
averaging over the entire symmetry group (Murphy et al., 2019; 2018), which amount to the trivial
frame F ≡ ρ(G), with the symmetry group G = Sn. As we have also shown, this approach comes at
a cost of high variance approximations hindering the learning process. Our FA framework reduces
the variance both by choosing a canonical ordering and addressing the fact that it may not be unique.
Recently, a body of work studies GNNs with invariance/equivariance to E(3) (or a similar group)
to deal with symmetries in molecular data or dynamical systems . Many SE(3) equivariant con-

extend TFN (Thomas et al., 2018) and inherit its expensive higher order feature representations in the
intermediate layers. Finally, a recent work by Satorras et al. (2021) provides an efficient message
passing construction which is E(d) equivariance but is not shown to be universal, thus far.
5	Experiments
We evaluate our FA framework on a few invariant/equivaraint point cloud and graph learning tasks:
point cloud normal estimation (O(3) equivariant and translation invariant); graph separation tasks
(Sn invariant); and particles position estimation, i.e., the n-body problem (E(3) equivariant).
5.1	Point Clouds: Normal Estimation
Normal estimation is a core geometry processing task, where the goal is to estimate normal data from
an input point cloud, X ∈ Rn×3. This task is O(3) equivariant and translation invariant. To test the
effect of rotated data on the different models we experimented with three different settings: i) I/I -
training and testing on the original data; ii) I/SO(3) - training on the original data and testing on
randomly rotated data; and iii) SO(3)/SO(3) - training and testing with randomly rotated data. We
used the ABC dataset (Koch et al., 2019) that contains 3 collections (10k, 50k, and 100k models
each) of Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models. We follow the protocol of the benchmark suggested
in Koch et al. (2019), and quantitatively measure normal estimation quality via 1 - (nTn^)2, with n
being the ground truth normal and n the normal prediction. We used the same random train/test splits
from Koch et al. (2019). For baselines, we chose the PointNet (Qi et al., 2017a) and DGCNN (Wang
et al., 2018) architectures, which are popular permutation equivariant 3D point cloud architectures.
In addition, we also compare to VN-PointNet and VN-DGCNN (Deng et al., 2021), a recent state of
the art approach for SO(3) equivariant network design. We also tested our FA models, FA-PointNet
and FA-DGCNN as described in Section 3.1. In addition, we tested our local O(3) equivariant
model, FA-Local-PointNet. See Appendix C.1 for the further implementation details. The results in
Table 1 showcase the advantages of our FA framework: Incorporating FA to existing architectures
is beneficial in scenarios (ii-iii), outperforming augmentation by a large margin. In contrast to VN
models, FA models maintain (and in some cases even improve) the baseline estimation quality (i),
attributed to the expressive power of the FA models.

5.2	Graphs: Expressive Power
Producing GNNs that are both expressive and computation-
ally tractable is a long standing goal of the graph learning
community. In this experiment we test graph separation (Sn
invariant task): the ability of models to separate and clas-
sify graphs, a basic trait for graph learning. We use two
datasets: GRAPH8c (Balcilar et al., 2021) that consists of all
non-isomorphic, connected 8 node graphs; and EXP (Abboud
et al., 2021) that consists of 3-WL distinguishable graphs that
are not 2-WL distinguishable. There are two tasks: (i) count
pairs of graphs not separated by a randomly initialized model
in GRAPH8c and EXP; and (ii) learn to classify EXP to two
classes. We follow Balcilar et al. (2021) experimental setup. As
baselines we use GCN Kipf & Welling (2016), GAT Velickovic
et al. (2018), GIN Xu et al. (2018a), CHEBNET Tang et al.

(2019), PPGN Maron et al. (2019), and GNNML3 Balcilar et al. (2021), all of which are equivariant
by construction. We compare to our FA-MLP, and FA-GIN+ID, as described in Section 3.2 that
provide tractable option for universal GNNs. We also compare to the trivial (i.e., entire group)
frame averaging F ≡ G, denoted GA-MLP and GA-GIN+ID as advocated in (Murphy et al., 2019).
Appendix C.2 provides full implementation details.
The two first columns in Table 2 show the results
of the separation task (i). As expected both FA
and GA provide perfect separation, however, are
not perfectly invariant unless one computes the
full averages on F and G, respectively. Since
for some graphs (with many symmetries) full
averages are not feasible, we compare the invari-
ance error (see appendix for the exact definition)
of GA with that of the approximate FA, equa-
tion 7, for 50 randomly permuted inputs. Figure
2-left shows the mean, std, and 90% percentile
of invariance error for increasing sample size
k. Note that approximate FA is more invariant

even with as little as k = 1 samples, which explains why in the classification task (ii), in Table 2, right
column, FA is able to learn while GA fails, when both are trained with sample size k = 1. Figure
2-right compares mF and mG (the maximal number of unique elements in the FA, equation 6) for
GRAPH8c dataset. The color and size of the points in the plot represents how many graphs in the
dataset have the corresponding (mG, mF) values. This demonstrates the benefit (in one example) of
FA over GA in view of Theorem 5 and approximation in equation 7. Of course, other, more powerful
frames can be chosen, e.g., using higher order WL (Morris et al., 2019) or substructure counting
(Bouritsas et al., 2020) that will further improve the approximation of equation 7.
5.3	GRAPHS: n-BODY PROBLEM
In this task we learn to solve the n-body problem (E(3) equiv-
ariant). The dataset, created in (Satorras et al., 2021; Fuchs
et al., 2020), consists of a collection of n = 5 particles systems,
where each particle is equipped with its initial position in R3
and velocity in R3, and each pair of particles (edge) with a value
indicating their charge difference. The task is to predict the
particles’ locations after a fixed time. We follow the protocol
of (Satorras et al., 2021). As baselines we use EGNN (Satorras
et al., 2021), GNN (Gilmer et al., 2017), TFN (Thomas et al.,
2018), SE(3)-Transformer (Fuchs et al., 2020) and Radial Field
(Kohler et al., 2019). We test our FA-GNN, as described in
Section 3.3. Table 3 logs the results, where the metric reported

is the Mean Squared Error between predicted locations and ground truth. As can be seen, FA-GNN
improves over the SOTA by more than 20% . Note that the number of parameters used in FA-GNN
and EGNN is roughly the same. More details are provided in Appendix C.3
6	Conclusions
We present Frame Averaging, a generic and principled methodology for adapting existing (back-
bone) neural architectures to be invariant/equivariant to desired symmetries that appear in the data.
We prove the method preserves the expressive power of the backbone model, and is efficient to
compute in several cases of interest. We use FA to build universal GNNs, universal point cloud
networks that are invariant/equivariant to Euclidean motions E(3), and GNNs invariant/equivariant
to Euclidean motions E (3). We empirically validate the effectiveness of these models on several
invariant/equivariant learning tasks. We believe the instantiations presented in the paper are only the
first step in exploring the full potential of the FA framework, and there are many other symmetries
and scenarios that can benefit from FA. For example, extending the invariance (or equivariance) of
a model from a subgroup H of G, to G. Further Interesting open questions, not answered by this
paper are: What would be a way to systematically find efficient/small frames? How the frame choice
effects the learning process? How to explore useful FA architectures and modules?

A Proofs
A.1 Proof of Theorem 1
Proof. First note that frame equivariance is defined to be F(ρ1(g)X) = gF(X) which in particular
means ∣F (ρ1 (g)X)∣ = ∣F (X)∣.
For invariance, let g′ ∈ G
㈤ F (ρι(g')X) =	∑	Φ(ρι(g)-1ρι(gf)X) = -^χτ,	∑ φ(ρi(g' g)-1Pl(g')X)

□
A.2 Proof of Theorem 2
Proof. The proof above A.1, of Theorem 1, is a special case of the following where the second
symmetry is chosen to be trivial. In principle the proofs are quite similar.
First note that frame equivariance and invariance, together with ρ1, τ1 commuting mean
F (γ1(h, g)X) = F (τ1 (h)ρ1 (g)X) = F (ρ1(g)τ1(h)X) = gF (τ1(h)X) = gF (X),
which in particular implies that IF (γ1(h, g)X)I = IF (X)I. Let (h′, g′) ∈ H × G be arbitrary. Then,
(φ)F (γι(hf,gf)X) = —1—	∑ φ(ρι(g)-1 τ1(h')ρ1(g')X)

meaning that MF is H × G invariant. Next,
网F (γι(h',g')X) =	∑	P2(g)Φ(ρι(g)-1τι(h')ρι(g')X)
F (X )∣ g∈g'F(X)

∣F(X)∣ g∈F(X)

showing that 网F is H × G equivariant.
□
A.3 Proof of Theorem 3 and Corollary 1
Proof. (Theorem 3) First we show GX acts on F(X). For an arbitrary h∈ GX and equivariant
frame F, we have F(X) = F (ρ1(h)X) = hF(X), where in the first equality we used the fact that
h∈ GX and in the second the equivariance of F. This means that if g ∈ F (X) and h∈ GX then also
hg ∈ F (X), or in other words F(X) is closed to actions from GX. Furthermore, since a group acts
on itself via bijections we have that the cardinality of all orbits is the same, ∣[g]∣ = ∣GX g∣ = ∣GX ∣, for
all [g] ∈ F(X)∕Gχ. Lastly, the equivalence relation g Z h ^⇒ hg-1 ∈ GX shows that F(X) is a
union of disjoint orbits of equal cardinality.	□
Proof. (Corollary 1) Theorem 3 asserts that all orbits [g] ∈ F (X)∕GX have the same number of
elements. Therefore, a random choice g ∈ F(X) will have equal probability to land in each orbit. □
A.4 THE ROLE OF mF IN APPROXIMATION QUALITY OF EQUATION 7
To better understand the role of mF in approximating equation 6 we first note that equation 7 can
be written as《0》F (X) = ∑[g]∈F(χ)∕Gχ μ[g]φ(ρ1(gi)-1 X), where μ is the empiricial distribution
over F (X)∕GX, assigning to each element [g] ∈ F (X)∕GX the fraction of samples landed in [g],
i.e., μ[g] = ∣{i ∈ [k]∣gi ∈ [g]} ∣k-1. We next present a lower bound on the probability of any particular
μ that provides a good approximation《0》F (X) ≈ MF (X).
Theorem 5. Let F be an equivariant frame. The probability of an arbitrary μ
∈
{μ ∣ supφ€Q ∣(φ>F (X)-《0》F (X )∣ ≤ e} is bounded from below as follows,
P(μ) ≥ (1 + k)-mF exp(-2mFke2),
where Q = {0 ∈ C(V, R) ∣ ∣0(X)∣ ≤ 1, ∀X ∈ V } the set of bounded, continuous functions V → R.
Before providing the proof let us note that this theorem provides a lower bound for each particular
"good" empirical distribution μ. The main takeoff is that for fixed k and e, the smaller mF the better
the lower bound. The counter-intuitive behaviour of this bound w.r.t. k and stems from the fact that
the size of the set of "good" μ, namely {φ ∈ C(V, R) ∣∣φ(X)∣ ≤ 1, ∀X ∈ V} is increasing with k and
.
Proof. For brevity we denote m = mF . Our setting can be formulated as follows. We have the
uniform probability distribution, denoted μ, over the discrete space [m] (representing the quotient set
F(X)∕Gχ); μj = m, j ∈ [m], and we have numbers aj = φ(ρι(hj)-1X), where [hj] ∈ F(X)∕Gχ,
j ∈ [m] represent exactly one sample per orbit. In this notation MF (X) = ∑p=ι aj, while the
approximation in equation 7 takes the form《0》F (X) = ∑p=ι μjaj, where μj = kj/k, where kj is
the number of samples gi ∈ [hj], i ∈ [k], i.e., samples that landed in the j-th orbit. Therefore,

where the latter is the total variation norm for discrete measures (Levin & Peres, 2017). We denote
H (μ∣μ) = ∑m=ι iog(μj) log (μj)
the KL-divergence. The Pinsker inequality and its inverse for
discrete positive measures are (see e.g., (Polyanskiy & Wu, 2014)):
2 M-"'Tv ≤ H(μ∣”)≤ 2 M-"'Tv,

A.5 Proof of Theorem 4
Proof. Let Ψ ∈ C(V, W) be an arbitrary G equivariant function, F a bounded G equivariant frame
over a frame-finite domain K. Let c > 0 be the constant from Definition 1. For arbitrary X ∈ K,
∣∣Ψ(X )-(Φ)F (X )∣∣W = ∣∣(Ψ)F (X )-(Φ)F (X )∣∣W

where in the first equality We used the fact that (W* = Ψ since Ψ is already equivariant.
□
A.6 Proof of Proposition 1
Proof. Let us prove F is equivariant (equation 3). Consider a transformation g = (R, t) ∈ G, and let
(O, s) ∈F(X),then
C = OΛOt , S = - X T1,
n
where OΛOT is the eigen decomposition of C . Note that the group product of these transformations
is
(R, t)(O, s) = (RO, Rs + t).
We need to show (RO, Rs + t) ∈ F ((R, t)X). Indeed, RO ∈ O(3) and consists of eigenvectors
of C = RXT(I - n 11T)XRT as can be verified with a direct computation. If O, R ∈ SO(d) then
also RO ∈ SO(d). Furthermore
-(XRT + 1tT)T 1 = -(RXT + t1T) 1 = Rs +1
nn
as required. We have shown (R, t)F(X) ⊂ F ((R, t)X) for all X and (R, t). To show the other
inclusion let X = (R, t)-1Y and get F ((R, t)-1Y ) ⊂ (R, t)-1F(Y ) that also holds for all Y
and (R, t). In particular (R, t)F(X) ⊃ F ((R, t)X). The frame F is bounded since for compact
K ⊂ Rn×d, the translations n-1XT1 are compact and therefore uniformly bounded for X ∈ K, and
orthogonal matrices always satisfy IlRII 2 = 1.	口

A.7 Proof of Proposition 2
Proof. First note that by definition S(X) is equivariant in rows, namely S(ρ1 (g)X) = ρ1(g)S(X).
Therefore if g ∈ F(X) ⊂ Sn, then by definition of the frame ρ1(g)S is sorted. Therefore, ρ1(g)S =
ρ1 (gh)ρ1 (h)-1S(X) = ρ1 (gh)S(ρ1 (h)-1X) is sorted and we get that gh ∈ F(ρ1 (h)-1X). We
proved F(X)h ⊂ F(ρ1(h)-1X) for all h ∈ G and all X ∈ V . Taking X = ρ1(h)Y for an arbitrary
Y ∈ V , and h = g-1 for arbitrary g ∈ G, we get F (ρ1(g-1)Y) ⊂ F (Y)g, for all g ∈ G and Y ∈ V . We
proved F(X)h = F(ρ1 (h)-1X), which amounts to right action equivariance, see equation 4. The
frame is bounded since ρι(G) is a finite set.	□
B Empirical frame analysis
Repeating eigenvalues. We empirically test the likeli-
ness of repeating eigenvalues in the covariance matrix
used from the definition of frame in Section 3.1. We
use the data from the n-body dataset (Satorras et al.,
2021). Let X ∈ Rn×3 represent the set of particles lo-
cations (each set centered around 0 and scaled to have
maxχi∈x IIxiil 2 = 1) and λι ≤ λ2 ≤ λ3 be the eigenval-
ues, sorted in increasing order, of the covariance matrix
C = (X - 1tT)T (X - 1tT) . In order to measure the
proximity of eigenvalues across the dataset we use the
notion of eigenvalues spacing Si = λi+S-λi, i = 1,2, where
S = λ32λ1 is the mean spacing. Furthermore We define
smin = min {s1, s2} as the minimal normalized spacing,
a ratio that indicates how close the spectrum is to having
repeating eigenvalues. Figure 3 presents a histogram of
Figure 3: Minimal spacing histogram
over the training set of n-body dataset
(Satorras et al., 2021) .
the minimal spacing over the training set of the n-body dataset (consists of 3000 particles sets). The
minimal spacing encountered in this experiment is of order 10-2. This empirically justifies the usage
of finite frames for E(d) equivariance.
Frame stability. Here we test stability of our O(d)
frame defined in Section 3.1. By stability we mean the
magnitude of change of a frame w.r.t. the change in the
input X . A desired attribute of the constructed frame is
to be stable, that is, to exhibit small changes if the input is
perturbed. We quantify this stability by comparing the dis-
tance between our frames to frames constructed by a noisy
input. As in the previous experiment used the data from the
n-body dataset (Satorras et al., 2021). LetX ∈ Rn×3 repre-
sent the set of particles locations (each set centered around
0 and scaled to have maxxi∈X IxiI2 = 1) and Xσ = X+Z
where zi,j Z N(0, σ) is the noisy input sample . We com-
pute F(X) and F(Xσ) and choose representatives from
each set g = (R, t) ∈ F(X),gσ = (Rσ,tσ) ∈ F(Xσ).
We measure the distance between the frames as a function
of the representatives -
σ
Figure 4: Distance between original and
noisy frames as a function of σ (we plot
average and std). The result is reported
over the training set of n-body dataset
(Satorras et al., 2021) .

E(R, Rσ ) = - ∑ √1 - {R,i, (Rσ ):,i )2
Notice that in the case of simple spectrum the distance is invariant to the selection of representatives.
In Figure 4 we plot distance of original and noisy frames (and its standard deviation) as function of
noise level σ. The plot validates the continuity of frames in the simple spectrum case.

C Implementation Details
C.1 Point Clouds: Normal Estimation
Here we provide implementation details for the experiment in section 5.1.
PointNet architecture. Our backbone PointNet is based on the object part segmentation network
from Qi et al. (2017a). The network consists of layers of the form
FC(n, din, dout) : X ↦ V(XW +1bT)
MaxPool(n,din) : X ↦ 1[max Xe/
where X ∈ Rn×din, W ∈ Rdin ×dout, b ∈ Rdout are the learnable parameters, 1 ∈ Rn is the vector of all
ones, [∙] is the concatenation operator, ei is the standard basis in Rdin, and V is the ReLU activation.
In this experiement, for the PointNet baseline and for Φ3,3 (the backbone in FA-PointNet), we used
the following architecture:
FC(512, 3, 64) L→1 FC(512, 64, 128) L→2 FC(512, 128, 128) L→3 FC(512, 128, 512) L→4
FC(512, 512, 2048) L→5 MaxPool(512, 2048) L→6 [L1, L2, L3, L4, L5, L6] L→7
FC(512, 4028, 256) L→8 FC(512, 256, 128) L→9 FC(512, 128, 3).
Note that the original PointNet network also contains two T-Net networks, applied to the input
and to L3 (the output of the third layer). Similarly, our baseline implementation made a use of the
same T-Net networks. Note that the T-Net networks were not part of our FA-PointNet backbone
architectures Φ3,3.
The FA-Local-Pointnet architecture can be seen as a composition of two parts (see Figure 5). The
first part outputs equivariant features by applying the same MLP backbone Υ3k,3d with FA on each
point’s k-nn patch. Then, from each point’s equivariant features, the second part of the network
outputs an equivariant normal estimation. Note that the second part, (Φ)f, is an FA-Pointnet network
applied to a point cloud of dimensions Rn×3d. For FA-Local-PointNet we made the following design
choices. Each point patch is constructed as its k nearest neighbors, with k = 20, Xi ∈ R20×3. Then,
the backbone Υ3*20,3*42 is applied to all patches, with the following PointNet layers:
FC(512, 3 * 20, 3 * 21) → FC(512, 3 * 21, 3 * 42) → FC(512, 3 * 42, 3 * 42).
The second backbone, Φ3*42,3, is built from the following PointNet layers:
FC(512, 3 * 32, 128) L→1 FC(512, 128, 256) L→2 FC(512, 256, 256) L→3 FC(512, 256, 512) L→4
FC(512, 512, 2048) L→5 MaxPool(512, 2048) L→6 [L1,L2,L3,L4,L5,L6] L→7
FC(512, 5248, 256) L→8 FC(512, 256, 128) L→9 FC(512, 128, 3).

DGCNN architecture. Our backbone DGCNN architecture, Φ3,3, is based on the object part seg-
mentation network from Wang et al. (2018). It consists of EdgeConv(n, din, dout), FC(n, din, dout),
and MaxPool layers.
EdgeConv(512, 3, 64) L→1 EdgeConv(512, 64, 64) L→2 EdgeConv(512, 64, 64) L→3
FC(512, 64, 1024) L→4 MaxPool(512, 1024) L→5 [L1,L2,L3,L4,L5] L→6
FC(512, 1216, 256) L→7 FC(512, 256, 128) L→8 FC(512, 128, 3).
Note that the DGCNN architecture incorporates T-Net network applied to the input.
Training details. We trained our networks using the ADAM (Kingma & Ba, 2014) optimizer,
setting the batch size to 32 and 16 for PointNet and DGCNN respectively. We set a fixed learning
rate of 0.001. All models were trained for 250 epochs. Training was done on a single Nvidia V-100
GPU, using pytorch deep learning framework (Paszke et al., 2019).
C.2 Graphs: Expressive Power
We provide implementation details for the experiments in 5.2. We used two different universal
backbones, MLP and GIN equipped with identifiers. The details of those architectures are presented
here.
FA/GA GIN+ID architecture. The GIN+ID backbone is based on the GIN (Xu et al., 2018a)
network with an addition of identifiers as node features in order to increase expressiveness. For the
experiments we used a three-layer GIN with a feature dimension of size 64 and a ReLU activation
function. For the added identifiers we defined the input node features as X0 = [X0, In], where n is
the number of nodes in the graph, and to handle graphs of different sizes (EXP dataset) we padded
the node features with zeros to fit the size of the maximal graph. Note that we did not apply the
permutation generated by the frame on the identifiers.
FA/GA MLP architecture. We used two different MLP networks for the EXP dataset and the
GRAPH8c, due to the different size of graphs in the datasets. In the EXP dataset the maximal graph
size is 64 and every node in the graph has a one dimensional binary feature, therefore the input for
the MLP network is a flatten representation of the graph (with additional padding according to the
graph size) x ∈ R642+64. Our architecture consists of layers of the form
FC(din, dout) : X ↦ V (Wx + b)
where W ∈Rdout×din, b ∈ Rdout are the learnable parameters. The final output of the network is denoted
by (dout ) where dout is the output dimension.
The MLP network structure for the EXP-classify task:
FC(4160, 2048) L→1 FC(2048, 4096) L→2 FC(4096, 2048) L→3
FC(2048, 10) L→4 FC(10, 1) L→5 (1)
with ReLU as the activation function. For the EXP task, which has 10-dimensional output for each
graph we omitted the last layer. The GRAPH8c is composed of all the non-isomorphic connected
graphs of size 8, hence we did not used any padding of the input here. The nodes have no features
and we just used a flatten version of the adjacency matrix. The architecture for the GRAPH8c task:
FC(64, 128) L→1 FC(128, 64) L→2 FC(64, 10) L→3 (10)
Training details. We followed the protocol from (Balcilar et al., 2021) and trained our model with
batch size 100 for 200 epochs. The learning rate was set to 0.001 and did not change during training.
For optimization we used the ADAM optimizer. Training was done on a single Nvidia RTX-8000
GPU, using pytorch deep learning framework.

Invariance Evaluation. We quantify the permutation invariance of a model φ by comparing output
of randomly permuted graphs ρ1(gi)X, gi ∈ Sn, i ∈ [50]. The evaluation metric used is the invariance
error, defined by
1m
—∑ ∣∣φ(ρι(gi)X)- vb ,
m i=1	2
where V = mm ∑m=ι Φ(ρι(gi)X).
The permutation invariance error of the models (FA/GA) was measured as a function of the sample
size k . We iterated over the entire GRAPH8c dataset and for every graph computed the invariance
error for the FA-MLP ,GA-MLP and regular MLP models (all with the exact same backbone network).
The results presented in Figure 2 (left) are normalized by the error of the regular MLP model. The
backbone MLP we used for this experiment is of the form:
FC(64, 128) L→1 FC(128, 128) L→2 FC(128, 128) L→3 FC(128, 10) L→4 (10)
C.3 GRAPHS: n-BODY PROBLEM
This section describes the implementation details for the n-body experiment from Section 5.3.
FA-GNN architecture. We use the GNN architecture of Gilmer et al. (2017) our base GNN layer,
where for each node i ∈ [n] the update rule follows,
mij = φe(hli, hlj,aij)
mi = ∑ mij
j∈N(i)
hli+1 = φh(hli,mi)
where N(i) are the indices of neighbors of vertex i, hli is the embedding of node i at layer l and
aij ∈ {-1, 1} × R+ are edge attributes representing attraction or repelling between pairs of particles
and their distance. h0 ∈ Rn×6 represents the nodes input features, which in this experiment are a
concatenation of the nodes initial 3D position (rotation and translation equivariant) and velocities
(rotation-equivariant and translation-invariant). We used node feature dimension of size 60 to maintain
a fair comparison with the baselines (Satorras et al., 2021). The functions φe and φh are implemented
as a two-layer MLP with the SiLU activation function (also chosen for consistency purposes) with
an hidden dimension of 121 and 120 respectively. To maintain fair comparison with (Satorras et al.,
2021) our network is composed of 4 GNN layers.①；1；或 has an additional linear embedding of
the features as a prefix to the GNN layers while Φ成' 3 is equipped with a two-layer MLP (SiLU
activation) as a decoder to extract final positions.
Training details. We followed the protocol from (Satorras et al., 2021) and trained our model with
batch size 100 for 10000 epochs. The learning rate was set to 0.001 and did not changed during
training. For optimization we used the Adam optimizer. Training was done on a single Nvidia
RTX-6000 GPU, using PYTORCH deep learning framework.
