Table 1: Average test power ± standard error for N samples over the HIGGS dataset. The resultson MNIST is similar and presented in Table 3, Appendix B.1.
Table 2: Features selected by different approaches. With H-Divergence we can select differentfeatures that are important in different decision problems. For example, if we assign a high / lowpenalty to making incorrect prediction for higher income groups, we select a different set of features.
