Table 1: Results on Isocyanates, best bold, second-best underlined; We omit Novelty since all meth-ods achieved 100%; the few valid molecules generated by GraphNVP did not allow for reasonableevaluation on some metrics (-).
Table 2: Results on Acrylates and Chain Extenders (best bolded, second-best underlined). Thelow validity of molecules generated by GraphNVP did not allow for reasonable evaluation on somemetrics (-).
Table 3: Results on the large polymer dataset (best bold, second-best underlined). The low validityof molecules generated by GraphNVP and SMILESVAE did not allow for reasonable evaluation onsome metrics (-). Our method DEG was trained on 0.15% and 0.3% of the train data. DEG (fitting)is evaluated using the selected 10k samples via the fitting process described in Appendix B.
