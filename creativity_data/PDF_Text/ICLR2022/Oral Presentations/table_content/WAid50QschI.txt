Table 1: Discrete, continuous, and mixed distributions considered in this work, all involving theprobability simplex 4K-1. For each distribution we indicate if it assigns probability mass to allfaces of the simplex or only some, if it is multivariate (K ≥ 2), and, for mixed distributions, if it ischaracterized extrinsically (sample-and-project) or intrinsically (based on face stratification).
