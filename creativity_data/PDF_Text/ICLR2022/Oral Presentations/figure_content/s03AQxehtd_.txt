Figure 1: ProtoRes completes full human pose using anarbitrary combination of 3D coordinates, look-at targets andworld-space rotations specified by a user. The animation isbest viewed in Adobe Reader.
Figure 2: ProtoRes follows the encoder-decoder pattern and produces predictions in three steps.
Figure 3: Qualitative posing results. Left 4 poses: adding position, look-at and rotation effectors tospecify pose. Right 2 poses: achieving interesting poses with sparse constraints (4 and 7 effectors).
Figure 4: Block diagram of the fully-connected residual (FCR) decoder architecture. Left: thediagram of one residual block of the FCR decoder. Note that the basic residual block of the encoderarchitecture is exactly the same. Right: residual blocks connected in the FCR architecture.
Figure 5: The distribution of tags across frames in the original Mixamo (top) and Anonymous(bottom) datasets.
Figure 6: The distribution of PCA of flattened rotations of all joints of miniMixamo (red) andminiUnity (blue) datasets. Each point corresponds to a pose. It is clear that there are both overlappingareas corresponding to clusters with similar poses and areas with disjoint clusters, showing distinctpose configurations characteristic of the two different datasets.

Figure 8: Qualitative comparison results. ProtoRes vs. FinalIK (top row). ProtoRes vs. Transformer(bottom row).
Figure 9: Metrics as a function of the number and type of effectors. miniMixamo dataset positionand rotation metrics (top), miniUnity dataset position and rotation metrics (bottom). Position onlyeffectors (blue), rotation only effectors (green), rotation and position effectors (red). Position errormetric (left) and rotation error metric (right). The x-axis shows the percentage of joints used aseffectors, the y-axis shows the tracked metric value.
