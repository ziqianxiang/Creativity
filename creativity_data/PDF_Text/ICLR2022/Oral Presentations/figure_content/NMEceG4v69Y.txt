Figure 1: (a)-(c): motivation of Cycle Fully-Connected Layer (Cycle FC) compared to ChannelFC and Spatial FC. (a) Channel FC aggregates features in the channel dimension with spatial size‘1’. It can handle various input scales but cannot learn spatial context. (b) Spatial FC (Tolstikhinet al., 2021; Touvron et al., 2021a; Liu et al., 2021a) has a global receptive field in the spatialdimension. However, its parameter size is fixed and it has quadratic computational complexity toimage scale. (c) Our proposed Cycle Fully-Connected Layer (Cycle FC) has linear complexitythe same as channel FC and a larger receptive field than Channel FC. (d)-(f): Three examples ofdifferent stepsizes. Orange blocks denote the sampled positions. F denotes the output position.

Figure 4: Effective Receptive Field(ERF). We visualize the ERFs of thelast stage for both Swin (Liu et al.,2021b) and CycleMLP. Best viewedwith zoom in.

Figure 6: An example of dilatedCycleMLP where dilation=2and stepsize=3.
Figure 7: Examples of Stepsize cases: Here we separate the feature map along the widthdimension for convenient visualization. F denotes the output position. We place the absolutecoordinates (h, w, c) of the sampled points at the left of the feature. Sampled points within acurly bracket ({) belong to the same period (group). Dash lines link two cyclical periods.
