Figure 4: Recall on different constituent length.
Figure 5: Case Study. RoIs and spans without special marks are predicted correctly.
Figure 6: Illustration of the VL structure. Left: VL structure. Leftâ†’Right: decoupling of the VLstructure. Bottom right: language constituency tree. Top right:grounding results. Different phraseare allowed to be aligned to the same region.
Figure 7: Detailed diagram of structure construction. The inside pass (left) and outside pass (right)are illustrated. Structure construction is the process of filling the chart T. Rounds denote scores andrectangles denote vectors. Orange and blue shows variables in the inside pass. Yellow and greenshows variables in the outside pass. Arrows refer to operations on data.
Figure 8: Inside pass and outside pass using the indexing scheme. For the inside pass (Left) twospans ci,k and ek`i,j is composed as a bigger span. For the outside pass (Right), representationof a target span Cij is recursively computed from the inside representation of c-i and outsiderepresentation of ej`i,k and ck'i,n. k can appear to the left or right of the target span Ci,k. Here Weshow k on the right. If k on the left, the indexing is adjusted.
