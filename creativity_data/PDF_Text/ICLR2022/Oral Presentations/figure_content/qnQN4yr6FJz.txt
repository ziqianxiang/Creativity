Figure 1: Each of three panels corresponds to a different variational approximation. Lines in eachpanel denote the training objectives during 5 independent training runs.
Figure 2: The average performance loss when the missing-value ratio is changed from p = .1 top = .5. Lower values imply more robustness against feature incompletion. The error bars representthe estimated standard deviation of the expectations.
Figure 3: The gain function G(w) with α = 2 (the orange line). The green line shows the sizeof the stochastic term wθ,ψ,ξ(u, z) after the transformation, whereas the blue dashed line shows theoriginal size.
