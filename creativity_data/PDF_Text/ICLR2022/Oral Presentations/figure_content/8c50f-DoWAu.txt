Figure 1: VC model training and inference. Y stands for the training mel-spectrogram at trainingand the target mel-spectrogram at inference. Speaker conditioning in the decoder is enabled by thespeaker conditioning network gt(Y ) where Y = {Yt}t∈[0,1] is the whole forward diffusion trajectorystarting at Y0 . Dotted arrows denote operations performed only at training.
Figure 2: CIFAR-10 images randomly sampled from VP DPM by running 10 reverse diffusion stepswith the following schemes (from left to right): “euler-maruyama”, “probability flow”, “maximumlikelihood (τ = 0.5)”, “maximum likelihood (τ = 1.0)”.
