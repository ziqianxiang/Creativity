Figure 1: Framework overview of the SPN. Our approach formulates a proxy optimization problemfor learning, which is much easier to solve. Given a graph, a node GNN and an edge GNN are used topredict the pseudomarginal label distributions on each node and each edge respectively. Then thesepseudomarginals serve as building blocks to construct a near-optimal joint label distribution.
