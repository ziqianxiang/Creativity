Figure 1: Comparing our analytic estimate 3匕 and prior works with handcrafted variances βn andβn . (a) compares the values of the variance for different timesteps. (b) compares the term in Lvbcorresponding to each timestep. The value of Lvb is the area under the corresponding curve.
Figure 2:	Comparing our analytic estimate σ/ and prior works with handcrafted variances βn andβn . (a-c) compare the values of the variance of different timesteps. (d-e) compare the term in Lvbcorresponding to each timestep. The value of Lvb is the area under the corresponding curve.

Figure 4:	The mean, the standard deviation and the relative standard deviation (RSD) (i.e., the ratioof the standard deviation to the mean) of a single Monte Carlo sample llsn(χn)11 , Xn 〜qn(xn) atdifferent n on CIFAR10 (LS). These values are estimated by 50000 samples.
Figure 5:	The mean, the standard deviation and the relative standard deviation (RSD) (i.e., the ratioof the standard deviation to the mean) of Γn with different number of Monte Carlo samples Mat different n on CIFAR10 (LS). These values are directly calculated from the mean, the standarddeviation and the RSD of llsn(Xn)|| , Xn 〜qn(Xn) presented in Figure 4.
