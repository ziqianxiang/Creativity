Figure 1: Illustration of the diffusion and reverse process of GEODIFF. For diffusion process,noise from fixed posterior distributions q(Ct |Ct-1) is gradually added until the conformation is de-stroyed. Symmetrically, for generative process, an initial state CT is sampled from standard Gaussiandistribution, and the conformation is progressively refined via the Markov kernels pÎ¸ (C t-1 |G, Ct).
Figure 2: Examples of generated structures from Drugs dataset. For every model, We show theconformation best-aligned with the ground truth. More examples are provided in Appendix E.
