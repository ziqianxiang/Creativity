Figure 1: An input image with threecandidate labels, where the ground-truth is Malamute.
Figure 2: Illustration of PiCO. The classifier’s output is used to determine the positive peers for contrastivelearning. The contrastive prototypes are then used to gradually update the pseudo target. The momentumembeddings are maintained by a queue structure. ’//’ means stop gradient.
Figure 3: T-SNE visualization of the image representation on CIFAR-10 with q = 0.5. Different colorsrepresent the corresponding classes.
Figure 4: Performance of PiCO withvarying φ on CIFAR-100 (q = 0.05).
Figure 5: A large norm of Euclidean's mean vector also leads to a strong concentration of unit vectors to itsmean direction.
