Figure 1:	Comparison between minibatCh RR and loCal RR, with and without SyncShuf. Bestviewed in Color. The algorithm versions with SyncShuf Converge faster. Also note the perfor-manCe degradation as B inCreases, as expeCted by our theory.
Figure 2:	Comparison of minibatch RR, local RR, and single-machine RR. Best viewed in color.
Figure 3: Comparison of with-replacement (Sgd) and without-replacement (RR) versions. Bestviewed in color. Without-replacement versions converge faster than with-replacement versions, atleast in our problem instance. Also note that the two versions perform similarly in the small-epochregime, which supports our theoretical findings.
