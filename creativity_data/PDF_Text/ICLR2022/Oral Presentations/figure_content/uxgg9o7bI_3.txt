Figure 1: An overview of our proposed framework for GNNs that can go beyond the WL testin distinguishing non-isomorphic graphs Gi and G?. The overlap subgraphs of Gi and G2 arestructurally different, which are captured by structural coefficients defined in Eq. 4.
Figure 2: (a) Si and Sj are overlap-isomorphic (i.e., having the same overlap subgraph) but notsubgraph-isomorphic; (b) Four neighborhood subgraphs {Svi |i = 1, 2, 3,4} are subtree-isomorphic(i.e., having the same subtree) but not overlap-isomorphic.
Figure 3: (a) Local closeness: for overlap subgraphs that are complete graphs, their structuralcoefficients increase with the number of vertices; (b) Local denseness: for overlap subgraphs thathave the same number of vertices, their structural coefficients increase with the number of edges.
Figure 4: Oversmoothing analysis w.r.t. the model depth for node classification.
