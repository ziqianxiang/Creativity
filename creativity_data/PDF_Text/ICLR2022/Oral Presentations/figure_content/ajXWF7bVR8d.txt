Figure 1: Motivations behind MLTI. (a) three tasks are sampled from the task distribution; (b)individual augmentation methods (e.g., (Ni et al., 2021; Yao et al., 2021) augment each task within itsown distribution); (c) MLTI densifies the task-level distribution by performing cross-task interpolation.
Figure 2: Accuracy w.r.t. the num. of tasks underthe non-label-sharing scenario. Intra and Crossrepresent intra-task interpolation (i.e., Ti = Tj) andcross-task interpolation (i.e., Ti 6= Tj).
Figure 3: Visualization of theoriginal and interpolated tasks.
Figure 4: Accuracy w.r.t. the number of meta-training combinations of transformations in Rain-bowMNIST. Intra and Cross represent the intra-task interpolation (i.e., Ti = Tj) and the cross-taskinterpolation (i.e., Ti 6= Tj), respectively.
Figure 5: Accuracy w.r.t. the number of meta-training classes under the non-label-sharing scenario(1-shot). Intra and Cross represent the intra-task interpolation (i.e., Ti = Tj) and the cross-taskinterpolation (i.e., Ti 6= Tj), respectively.
