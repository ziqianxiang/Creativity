Ab stract
Neural models achieved considerable improvement for many natural language
processing tasks, but they offer little transparency, and interpretability comes at a
cost. In some domains, automated predictions without justifications have limited
applicability. Recently, progress has been made regarding single-aspect sentiment
analysis for reviews, where the ambiguity of a justification is minimal. In this
context, a justification, or mask, consists of (long) word sequences from the input
text, which suffice to make the prediction. Existing models cannot handle more
than one aspect in one training and induce binary masks that might be ambiguous.
In our work, we propose a neural model for predicting multi-aspect sentiments for
reviews and generates a probabilistic multi-dimensional mask (one per aspect) si-
multaneously, in an unsupervised and multi-task learning manner. Our evaluation
shows that on three datasets, in the beer and hotel domain, our model outperforms
strong baselines and generates masks that are: strong feature predictors, meaning-
ful, and interpretable.
1	Introduction
Neural networks have become the standard for many natural language processing tasks. Despite the
significant performance gains achieved by these complex models, they offer little transparency con-
cerning their inner workings. Thus, they come at the cost of interpretability (Jain & Wallace, 2019).
In many domains, automated predictions have a real impact on the final decision, such as treatment
options in the field of medicine. Therefore, it is important to provide the underlying reasons for such
a decision. We claim that integrating interpretability in a (neural) model should supply the reason
of the prediction and should yield better performance. However, justifying a prediction might be
ambiguous and challenging. Prior work includes various methods that find the justification in an
input text — also called rationale or mask of a target variable. The mask is defined as one or
multiple pieces of text fragments from the input text.1 Each should contain words that altogether are
short, coherent, and alone sufficient for the prediction as a substitute of the input (Lei et al., 2016).
Many works have been applied to single-aspect sentiment analysis for reviews, where the ambiguity
of a justification is minimal. In this case, we define an aspect as an attribute of a product or ser-
vice (Giannakopoulos et al., 2017), such as Location or Cleanliness for the hotel domain. There are
three different methods to generate masks: using reinforcement learning with a trained model (Li
et al., 2016b), generating rationales in an unsupervised manner and jointly with the objective func-
tion (Lei et al., 2016), or including annotations during training (Bao et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2016).
However, these models generate justifications that are 1) only tailored for one aspect, and 2) ex-
pressed as a hard (binary) selection of words. A review text reflects opinions about multiple topics
a user cares about (Musat et al., 2013). It appears reasonable to analyze multiple aspects with a
multi-task learning setting, but a model must be trained as many times as the number of aspects.
A hard assignment of words to aspects might lead to ambiguities that are difficult to capture with
a binary mask: in the text ”The room was large, clean and close to the beach.”, the word ”room”
refers to the aspects Room, Cleanliness and Location. Finally, collecting human-provided rationales
at scale is expensive and thus impractical.
In this work, we study interpretable multi-aspect sentiment classification. We describe an architec-
ture for predicting the sentiment of multiple aspects while generating a probabilistic (soft) multi-

dimensional mask (one dimension per aspect) jointly, in an unsupervised and multi-task learning
manner. We show that the induced mask is beneficial for identifying simultaneously what parts of
the review relate to what aspect, and capturing ambiguities of words belonging to multiple aspects.
Thus, the induced mask provides fine-grained interpretability and improves the final performance.
Traditionally interpretability came at a cost of reduced accuracy. In contrast, our evaluation shows
that on three datasets, in the beer and hotel domain, our model outperforms strong baselines and
generates masks that are: strong feature predictors, meaningful, and interpretable compared to
attention-based methods and a single-aspect masker. We show that it can be a benefit to 1) guide the
model to focus on different parts of the input text, and 2) further improve the sentiment prediction
for all aspects. Therefore, interpretabilty does not come at a cost anymore.
The contributions of this work can be summarized as follow:
•	We propose a Multi-Aspect Masker (MAM), an end-to-end neural model for multi-aspect
sentiment classification that provides fine-grained interpretability in the same training.
Given a text review as input, the model generates a probabilistic multi-dimensional mask,
with one dimension per aspect. It predicts the sentiments of multiple aspects, and highlights
long sequences of words justifying the current rating prediction for each aspect;
•	We show that interpretability does not come at a cost: our final model significantly out-
performs strong baselines and attention models, both in terms of performance and mask
coherence. Furthermore, the level of interpretability is controllable using two regularizers;
•	Finally, we release a new dataset for multi-aspect sentiment classification, which contains
140k reviews from TripAdvisor with five aspects, each with its corresponding rating.2
2	Related Work
2.1	Interpretability
Developing interpretable models is of considerable interest to the broader research community, even
more pronounced with neural models (Kim et al., 2015; Doshi-Velez & Kim, 2017). Many works
analyzed and visualized state activation (Karpathy et al., 2015; Li et al., 2016a; Montavon et al.,
2018), learned sparse and interpretable word vectors (Faruqui et al., 2015b;a; Herbelot & Vecchi,
2015) or analyzed attention (Clark et al., 2019; Jain & Wallace, 2019). Our work differs from these
in terms of what is meant by an explanation. Our system identifies one or multiple short and coherent
text fragments that — as a substitute of the input text — are sufficient for the prediction.
2.2	Attention-based models
Attention models (Vaswani et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2016; Lin et al., 2017) have been shown to
improve prediction accuracy, visualization, and interpretability. The most popular and widely used
attention mechanism is soft attention (Bahdanau et al., 2015) over hard (Luong et al., 2015) and
sparse ones (Martins & Astudillo, 2016). According to Jain & Wallace (2019); Serrano & Smith
(2019), standard attention modules noisily predict input importance; the weights cannot provide
safe and meaningful explanations.
Our model differs in two ways from attention mechanisms: our loss includes two regularizers to fa-
vor long word sequences for interpretability; the normalization is not done over the sequence length.
2.3	Multi-Aspect Sentiment Classification
Review multi-aspect sentiment classification is sometimes seen as a sub-problem (Wang et al., 2010;
McAuley et al., 2012; Pappas & Popescu-Belis, 2014), by utilizing heuristic-based methods or topic
models. Recently, neural models achieved significant improvements with less feature engineering.
Yin et al. (2017) built a hierarchical attention model with aspect representations by using a set of
manually defined topics. Li et al. (2018) extended this work with user attention and additional
features such as overall rating, aspect, and user embeddings. The disadvantage of these methods is
their limited interpretability, as they rely on many features in addition to the review text.
2We will make the code and data available.

2.4	Rationale-Based Models
The idea of including human rationales during training has been explored in (Zhang et al., 2016;
Marshall et al., 2015; Bao et al., 2018). Although they have been shown to be beneficial, they are
expensive to collect and might vary across annotators. In our work, no annotation is used.
The work most closely related to ours is Li et al. (2016b) and Lei et al. (2016). Both generate hard
rationales and address single-aspect sentiment classification. Their model must be trained separately
for each aspect, which leads to ambiguities. Li et al. (2016b) developed a post-training method that
removes words from a review text until another trained model changes its prediction. Lei et al.
(2016) provides a model that learns an aspect sentiment and its rationale jointly, but hinders the per-
formance and relies on assumptions on the data, such as a small correlation between aspect ratings.
In contrast, our model: 1) supports multi-aspect sentiment classification, 2) generates soft multi-
dimensional masks in a single training; 3) the masks provide interpretability and improve the per-
formance significantly.
3	Method： MULTI-ASPECTMASKER
Figure 1: The proposed MUlti-AsPect Masker (MAM) model architecture for A aspects.
Let X be a review composed of L words x1,x2,…,xL and Y the target A-dimensional senti-
ment vector, corresponding to the different rated aspects. Our proposed model, called Multi-Aspect
Masker, is composed of three components: 1) a Masker module that computes a probability distri-
bution over aspects for each word, resulting in A + 1 different masks (including one for not-aspect);
2) an Encoder that learns a representation of a review conditioned on the induced masks; 3) a Clas-
sifier that predicts the target variables. The overall model architecture is shown in Figure 1. Our
framework generalizes for other tasks, and each neural module is interchangeable with other models.
The Masker first computes a hidden representation h' for each word x' in the input sequence, us-
ing their word embeddings e1, e2, ..., eL. Many sequence models could realize this task, such as
recurrent, attention, or convolution neural networks. In our case, we chose a convolutional network
because it led to a smaller model, faster training, and empirically, performed similarly to recurrent
models. Let ai denote the ith aspect for i = 1, ..., A, and a0 the not-aspect case, because many
words can be irrelevant to every aspect. We define M' ∈ R(A+1), the aspect distribution of the
input word x' as:
L	LA
P(MX ) = Y P(M'∣x') = YY Pg*')	⑴
'=1	'=1 i=0
Because we have categorical distributions, we cannot directly sample P(M'|x') and backpropagate
the gradient through this discrete generation process. Instead, we model the variable m'ai using
the Straight Through Gumbel Softmax (Jang et al., 2017; Maddison et al., 2017), to approximate
sampling from a categorical distribution. We model the parameters of each Gumbel Softmax dis-
tribution M' with a single-layer feedforward neural network followed by applying a log softmax,
which induces the log-probabilities of the `th distribution: ω' = log(softmax(W h' + b)). W and b
are shared across all tokens, to have a constant number of parameters with respect to the sequence

length. We control the sharpness of the distributions with the temperature parameter τ . Com-
pared to attention mechanisms, the word importance is a probability distribution over the targets:
PT=o P(m^at ∣x') = 1, instead of a normalization over the sequence length, PL=ι P(a`∣χ`) = 1.
Given a soft multi-dimensional mask M ∈ R(A+1)×L , we define each sub-mask Mai ∈ RL as:
Mai = P (m1ai ∣x1), P (m2ai ∣x2), ..., P (maLi ∣xL)	(2)
We weight the word embeddings by their importance towards an aspect ai with the induced sub-
masks, such that Eai = Mai Θ E = P(m^ ∣x1) ∙eι, P(m^∣x2) ∙ e2,…,P(mLi∣xL) ∙eL∙ Thereafter,
each modified embedding Eai is fed into the Encoder block. Note that Ea0 is ignored because Ma0
only serves to absorb probabilities of words that are insignificant to every aspect.3
The Encoder module includes a convolutional neural network, for the same reasons as earlier, fol-
lowed by a max-over-time pooling to obtain a fixed-length feature vector. It produces the hidden
representation hai for each aspect ai . To exploit commonalities and differences among aspects, we
share the weights of the encoders for all Eai. Finally, the Classifier block contains for each aspect ai
a two-layer feedforward neural networks followed by a Softmax layer to predict the sentiment r^ai.

Aspect Changes: 5
Figure 2: Justifications obtained for a hotel review, with an attention model and Multi-Aspect
Masker, where the colors represent the aspects: Service, Cleanliness, Value, Location, and Room.
Masks lead to mostly long sequences describing clearly each aspect (one switch per aspect), while at-
tention to many short and interleaving sequences (30 changes between aspects), where most relate to
noise or multiple aspects. Highlighted words correspond to the highest aspect-attention scores above
1/L (i.e., more important than a uniform distribution), and the aspect a% maximizing P(m£i ")∙
The first objective to optimize is the sentiment loss, represented with the cross-entropy between the
true aspect sentiment label yai and the prediction r^aιi:
A
'sent =>[ 'cross_entroPy (yai , yJai )
i=1
(3)
Training Multi-Aspect Masker to optimize 'sent will lead to meaningless sub-masks Mai , as
the model tends to focus on certain key-words. Consequently, we guide the model to produce long
and meaningful sequences of words, as shown in Figure 2. We propose two regularizers: the first
controls the number of selected words, and the second favors consecutive words belonging to the
3if P(m%0 ∣x') ≈ 1.0, it implies that PA=1 P(mlai ∣x') ≈ 0 and consequently, e`ai ≈ ~0.

same aspect. For the first term `sel, we calculate the probability psel of tagging a word as aspect and
then compute the cross-entropy with a parameter λp . The hyper-parameter λp can be interpreted as
the prior on the number of selected words among all aspects, which corresponds to the expectation
of Binomial(psel), as the optimizer will try to minimize the difference between psel and λp.
Psel = 1 X (ι - p(ma |xI))
L '=1 ∖	)
`sel = `binary .cross .entropy (psel, λP)
(4)
The second regularizer discourages aspect transition between two consecutive words, by minimizing
the mean variation of two consecutive aspect distributions. We generalize the formulation in Lei
et al. (2016), from a hard binary single-aspect selection, to a soft probabilistic multi-aspect selection.

Finally, we train our Multi-Aspect Masker in an end-to-end manner, and optimize the final loss

4 Experiments
In this section, We assess our model on tWo dimensions: the predictive performance and the quality
of the induced mask. We first evaluate Multi-Aspect Masker on the multi-aspect sentiment classifi-
cation task. In a second experiment, We measure the quality of the induced sub-masks using aspect
sentence-level annotations, and an automatic topic model evaluation method.4
4.1	Datasets
McAuley et al. (2012) provided 1.5 million beer revieWs from BeerAdvocat. Each contains multiple
sentences describing various beer aspects: Appearance, Smell, Palate, and Taste; users also provided
a five-star rating for each aspect. Lei et al. (2016) modified the dataset to suit the requirements of
their method.5 As a consequence, the obtained subset, composed of 280k revieWs, does not reflect
the real data distribution: it contains only the first three aspects, and the sentiment correlation be-
tWeen any pair of aspects is decreased significantly (27.2% on average, instead of 71.8% originally).
We denote this version as the Filtered Beer dataset, and the original one as the Full Beer dataset.
To evaluate the robustness of models across domains, We craWled 140k hotel revieWs from TripAd-
visor. Each revieW contains a five-star rating for each aspect: Service, Cleanliness, Value, Location,
and Room. The average correlation betWeen aspects is high (63.0% on average). Compared to beer
revieWs, hotel revieWs are longer, noisier, and less structured, as shoWn in Appendix A.3.
As in Bao et al. (2018), We binarize the problem: ratings at three and above are labeled as positive
and the rest as negative. We further divide the datasets into 80/10/10 for train, development, and
test subsets (more details in Appendix A.1).
4.2	Baselines
We compared our Multi-Aspect Masker (MAM) With various baselines. We first used a simple
baseline, Sentiment Majority, that reports the majority sentiment across aspects, as the sentiment
correlation betWeen aspects might be high (see Section 4.1). Because this information is not avail-
able at testing, We trained a model to predict the majority sentiment of a revieW using Wang &
Manning (2012). The second baseline We used is a shared encoder folloWed by A classifiers, that
We denote Emb + Enc + Clf. This model does not offer any interpretability. We extended it With a

given the others and then selected revieWs With the largest prediction error.

shared attention mechanism (Bahdanau et al., 2015) after the encoder, noted AShared, that provides a
coarse-grained interpretability: for all aspects, the network focuses on the same words in the input.
Our final goal is to achieve the best performance and provide fine-grained interpretability: to visu-
alize what sequences of words a model focuses on and to predict the aspect sentiment predictions.
To this end, we included other baselines: two trained separately for each aspect and two trained
with a multi-aspect sentiment loss. We employed for the first ones: the well-known NB-SVM of
Wang & Manning (2012) for sentiment analysis tasks, and the Single Aspect-Mask (SAM) model
from Lei et al. (2016), each trained separately for each aspect. The two last methods are composed
of a separate encoder, attention mechanism, and classifier for each aspect. We utilized two types
of attention mechanism: additive (Bahdanau et al., 2015), and sparse (Martins & Astudillo, 2016).
We call each variant Multi Aspect-Attentions (MAA) and Multi Aspect-Sparse-Attentions (MASA).
Diagrams for the baselines can be found in Appendix A.5.
4.3	Multi-Aspect Sentiment Classification
In this section, we enquire whether fine-grained interpretability can become a benefit rather than a
cost. We group the models and baselines in three different levels of interpretability:
•	None: we cannot identify what parts of the review are important for the prediction;
•	Coarse-grained: we can identify what parts of the reviews were important to predict all
aspect sentiments, without knowing what part corresponds to what aspect;
•	Fine-grained: for each aspect, we can identify what parts are used to predict its sentiment.
4.3.1	Beer Reviews
Overall F1 scores (macro and for each aspect Ai) for the controlled-environment Filtered Beer
(where there are assumptions on the data distribution) and the real-world Full Beer dataset are
shown in Table 1 and Table 2.
We find that our MUlti-AsPect Masker (MAM) model ⑧，with 1.7 to 2.1 times fewer parameters
than aspect-wise attention models (⑥ + ⑦)，performs better on average than all other baselines
on both datasets, and provides fine-grained interpretability. For the synthetic Filtered Beer dataset,
MAM achieves a significant improvement of at least 0.36 macro F1 score, and 0.05 for the Full Beer
one.
To demonstrate that the induced sub-masks Ma1 , ..., MaA are 1) meaningful for other models to
improve final predictions, and 2) bring fine-grained interpretability, we extracted and concatenated
the masks to the word embeddings, resulting in contextualized embeddings (Peters et al., 2018).

We trained a simple Encoder - Classifier with the contextualized embeddings ⑨,which has approxi-
mately 1.5 times fewer parameters than MAM. We achieved a macro F1 score absolute improvement
of 0.34 compared to MAM, and 1.43 compared to the non-contextualized variant for the Filtered
Beer dataset; for the Full Beer one, the performance increases by 0.39 and 2.49 respectively. Simi-
larly, each individual aspect Ai F1 score of MAM is improved to a similar extent.
We provide in Appendix A.3.1 and A.3.2 visualizations of reviews with the computed sub-masks
Ma1 , ..., MaA and attentions by different models. Not only do sub-masks enable the reach of higher
performance; they better capture parts of reviews related to each aspect compared to other methods.
Both NB-SVM ④ and SAM ⑤，offering fine-grained interpretability and trained separately for each
aspect, significantly underperform compared to the Encoder - Classifier ①.This result is expected:
the goal of SAM is to provide rationales at the price of performance (Lei et al., 2016), and NB-
SVM might not perform well because of its simplicity. Shared attention models (② + ③)perform
similarly to the Encoder - Classifier ①，but provide only coarse-grained interpretability.
However, in the Full Beer dataset, SAM ⑤ obtains better results than the Encoder - Classifier base-
line ① and NB-SVM ④,which is outperformed by all other models. It might be counterintuitive
that SAM performs better, but we claim that its behavior comes from the high correlation between
aspects: SAM selects words that should belong to aspect ai to predict the sentiment of aspect aj
(ai 6= aj ). Moreover, in Section 4.5, we show that a single-aspect mask from SAM cannot be
employed for interpretability.
Finally, Sentiment Majority (0 is outperformed by a large margin by all other models in the Filtered
Beer dataset, because of the low sentiment correlation between aspects. However, in the realistic
dataset Full Beer, Sentiment Majority obtains higher score and performs better than NB-SVM ④.
These results emphasize the ease of the Filtered Beer dataset compared to the Full Beer one, because
of the assumptions not holding in the real data distribution.
4.3.2	Model Robustness - Hotel Reviews
On the Hotel dataset, the learned mask M from Multi-Aspect Masker ⑧ is again meaningful, by
increasing the performance and adding interpretability. The Encoder-Classifier with contextual-
ized embeddings © outperforms all other models significantly, with an absolute macro F1 score
improvement of 0.49. Moreover, it achieves the best individual F1 score for each aspect A1, ..., A5.
Visualizations of reviews, with masks and attentions, are available in Appendix A.3.3. The inter-
pretability comes from the long sequences that MAM identifies, unlike attention models. In com-
parison, SAM ⑤ lacks coverage and suffers from ambiguity due to the high correlation between
aspects. We observe that Multi-Aspect Masker ⑧ performs slightly worse than aspect-wise atten-

tion models (⑦ + ⑧)，With 2.5 times fewer parameters. We emphasize that using the induced
masks in the Encoder - Classifier ⑨ already achieves the best performance.
The Single Aspect-Mask ⑤ obtains the lowest relative macro F1 score of the three datasets: a differ-
ence of -3.27; -2.6 and -2.32 for the Filtered Beer and Full Beer dataset respectively. This proves
that the model is not meant to provide rationales and increase the performance simultaneously.
Finally, we show that learning soft multi-dimensional masks along training objectives achieves
strong predictive results, and using these to create contextualized word embeddings and train a
baseline model with, provides the best performance across the three datasets.
4.4 Mask Interpretab ility
In these experiments, we verify that Multi-Aspect Masker generates induced masks Ma1 , ..., MaA
that, in addition to improving performance, are meaningful and can be interpreted by humans.
4.4. 1 Mask Precision
Evaluating justifications that have short and coherent pieces of text is challenging because there is no
gold standard provided with reviews. McAuley et al. (2012) provided 994 beer reviews with aspect
sentence-level annotations, although our model computes masks ata finer level. Each sentence of the

dataset is annotated with one aspect label, indicating what aspect that sentence covers. We evaluate
the precision of words highlighted by each model. For both, ours and Lei et al. (2016), we used
trained models on beer reviews and extracted a similar number of selected words.
We show that the generated sub-masks Ma1 , Ma2 , Ma3 obtained with Multi-Aspect Masker (MAM)
correlate best with human judgment. Table 4 presents the precision of the masks and attentions com-
puted on sentence-level aspect annotations. We reported results of the models in Lei et al. (2016):
SVM, the Single Aspect-Attention (SAA) and Single Aspect-Mask (SAM) — trained separately for
each aspect because they find hard justifications for a single aspect. In comparison to SAM, our
MAM model obtains significant higher precisions with an average of +1.13. Interestingly, SVM
and attention models perform poorly compared with mask models: especially MASA that focuses
only on a couple of words due to the sparseness of the attention (examples in Appendix A.3.1).
4.5 Mask Coherence
In addition to evaluating masks with human annotations, we computed their semantic interpretability
for each dataset. According to Aletras & Stevenson (2013); Lau et al. (2014), NPMI (Bouma,
2009) is a good metric for qualitative evaluation of topics, because it matches human judgment most
closely. However, the top-N topic words, used for evaluation, are often selected arbitrarily. To
alleviate this problem, we followed Lau & Baldwin (2016): we computed the topic coherence over
several cardinalities N , and report all the results, as well as the average; the authors claim the mean
leads to a more stable and robust evaluation. More details are available in Appendix A.4.
We show that generated masks by MAM obtains the highest mean NPMI and, on average, superior
results in all datasets (17 out of 21 cases), while only needing a single training. Results are shown
in Table 5. For the Hotel and Full Beer datasets, where reviews reflect the real data distribution,
our model significantly outperforms SAM and attention models for N ≥ 20. For smaller N, MAM
obtains higher scores in four out of six cases, and for these two, the difference is only below 0.003.
For the controlled-environment Filtered Beer dataset, MAM still performs better for N ≥ 15, al-
though the differences are smaller, and is beat by SAM for N ≤ 10. However, SAM obtains poor
results in all other cases of all datasets and must be trained as many times as the number of aspects.

We show the top words for each aspect and a human evaluation in Appendix A.4. Generally, our
model finds better sets of words among the three datasets compared with other methods.
5 Conclusion
In this work, we propose Multi-Aspect Masker, an end-to-end neural network architecture to per-
form multi-aspect sentiment classification for reviews. Our model predicts aspect sentiments while
generating a probabilistic (soft) multi-dimensional mask (one dimension per aspect) simultaneously,
in an unsupervised and multi-task learning manner. We showed that the induced mask is beneficial
to guide the model to focus on different parts of the input text and to further improve the sentiment
prediction for all aspects. Our evaluation shows that on three datasets, in the beer and hotel domain,
our model outperforms strong baselines and generates masks that are: strong feature predictors,
meaningful, and interpretable compared to attention-based methods and a single-aspect masker.

and hotel reviews respectively. Filtered Beer contains a subset of beer reviews with assumptions,
leading to a more straightforward and unrealistic dataset.

A.2 Experimental Details
For each model, the review encoder was either a bi-directional single-layer forward recurrent neural
network using Long Short-Term Memory (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997) with 64 hidden units
or the multi-channel text convolutional neural network, similar to Kim et al. (2015), with 3, 5, 7
width filters and 50 feature maps per filter. Each aspect classifier is a two-layer feedforward neural
network with ReLU activation function (Nair & Hinton, 2010). We used the 200-dimensional pre-
trained word embeddings of Lei et al. (2016) for beer reviews. For the hotel domain, we trained
word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013) on a large collection of hotel reviews with an embedding size of 300.
We used dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014) of 0.1, clipped the gradient norm at 1.0 if higher, added
L2-norm regularizer with a regularization factor of 10-6 and trained using early stopping with a
patience of three iterations. We used Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2015) for training with a learning rate
of 0.001, β1 = 0.9, and β2 = 0.999. The temperature τ for Gumbel-Softmax distributions was
fixed at 0.8. The two regularizer terms and the prior of our model are λsel = 0.03, λcont = 0.04,
and λp = 0.11 for the Filtered Beer dataset; λsel = 0.03, λcont = 0.03, and λp = 0.15 for the
Full Beer dataseet; and λsel = 0.02, λcont = 0.02 and λp = 0.10 for the Hotel dataset. We ran
all experiments for a maximum of 50 epochs with a batch-size of 256 and a Titan X GPU. For the
model of Lei et al. (2016), we reused the code from the authors.
A.3 Visualization of the Multi-Dimensional Facets of Reviews
We randomly sampled reviews from each dataset and computed the masks and attentions of four
models: our Multi-Aspect Masker model (MAM), the Single Aspect-Mask method (SAM) of Lei
et al. (2016) and two attention models with additive and sparse attention, called Multi Aspect-
Attentions (MAA) and Multi Aspect-Sparse-Attentions (MASA) respectively (more details in Sec-
tion 4.2). Each color represents an aspect and the shade its confidence. All models generate soft
attentions or masks besides SAM, which does hard masking. Samples for the Filtered Beer, Full
Beer and Hotel dataset are shown below.

Figure 3:	Our model MAM highlights all the words corresponding to aspects. SAM only highlights
the most crucial information, but some words are missing out, and one is ambiguous. MAA and
MASA fail to identify most of the words related to the aspect Appearance, and only a few words
have high confidence, resulting in noisy labeling. Additionally, MAA considers words belonging to
the aspect Taste whereas the Filtered Beer dataset does not include it in the aspect set.

Sa 's harvest pumpkin ale 2011 . had this last year
,loved it , and bought 6 harvest packs and saved
the pumpkins and the dunkel 's ... not too sure
why sa dropped the dunkel , i think it would make
a great standard to them . pours a dark brown
with a 1 " bone white head , that settles down to
a thin lace across the top of the brew . smells of
the typical pumpkin pie spice , along with a good
squash note . tastes just like last years , very subtle
,nothing over the top . a damn good pumpkin ale
that is worth seeking out . when i mean everything
is subtle i mean everything . nothing is overdone
in this pumpkin ale , and is a great representation
of the original style . mouthfeel is somewhat thick
,with a pleasant coating feel . overall , i loved it
last year , and i love it this year . do n't get me
wrong , its no pumpking , but this is a damn fine
pumpkin ale that could hold its own any day among
all the others . i would rate this as my 4th favorite
pumpkin ale to date . i ’m not sure why the bros
rated it so low , but do n't take their opinion , make
your own !

Figure 5:	MAM can identify accurately what parts of the review describe each aspect. Due to the
high imbalance and correlation, MAA provides very noisy labels, while MASA highlights only a
few important words. We can see that SAM is confused and performs a poor selection.

Figure 7:	MAM emphasizes consecutive words, identifies important spans while having a small
amount of noise. SAM focuses on certain specific words and spans, but labels are ambiguous. The
MAA model highlights many words, ignores a few important key-phrases, and labels are noisy when

Figure 8:	Our MAM model finds most of the important span of words with a small amount of noise.
SAM lacks coverage but identifies words where half are correctly tags and the others ambiguous.
MAA partially correctly highlights words for the aspects Service, Location, and Value while missing

A.4 Topic Words per Aspect
For each model, we computed the probability distribution of words per aspect by using the induced
sub-masks Ma1 , ..., MaA or attention values. Given an aspect ai and a set of top-N words waNi, the
Normalized Pointwise Mutual Information (Bouma, 2009) coherence score is:
N j-1
NPMI(waNi) = XX
log
P (Wai ,wai)
P (Wai)P (Wai)
-logP(waki,waji)
(6)
Top words of coherent topics (i.e., aspects) should share a similar semantic interpretation and thus,
interpretability of a topic can be estimated by measuring how many words are not related. For
each aspect ai and word w having been highlighted at least once as belonging to aspect ai , we
computed the probability P (w|ai) on each dataset and sorted them in decreasing order of P (w|ai).
Unsurprisingly, we found that the most common words are stop words such as ”a” and ”it”, because
masks are mostly word sequences instead of individual words. To gain a better interpretation of
the aspect words, we followed the procedure in McAuley et al. (2012): we first computed averages
across all aspect words for each word w: bw = JAj Pi=1 P(w∣ai), which generates a general
distribution that includes words common to all aspects. The final word distribution per aspect is
computed by removing the general distribution: P (w|ai) = P (w|ai) - bW.
After generating the final word distribution per aspect, we picked the top ten words and asked two
human annotators to identify intruder words, i.e., words not matching the corresponding aspect. We
show in subsequent tables the top ten words for each aspect, where red denotes all words identified
as unrelated to the aspect by the two annotators. Generally, our model finds better sets of words
across the three datasets compared with other methods. Additionally, we observe that the aspects
can be easily recovered given its top words.
Table 7: Top ten words for each aspect from the Filtered Beer dataset, learned by various models.
Red denotes intruders according to two human annotators. For the three aspects, MAM has only
one word considered as an intruder, followed by MASA with SAM (two) and MAA (six).
