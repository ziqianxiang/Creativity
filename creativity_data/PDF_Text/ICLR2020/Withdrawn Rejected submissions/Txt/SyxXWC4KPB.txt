Ab stract
The consistency loss has played a key role in solving problems in recent stud-
ies on semi-supervised learning. Yet extant studies with the consistency loss are
limited to its application to classification tasks; extant studies on semi-supervised
semantic segmentation rely on pixel-wise classification, which does not reflect the
structured nature of characteristics in prediction. We propose a structured con-
sistency loss to address this limitation of extant studies. Structured consistency
loss promotes consistency in inter-pixel similarity between teacher and student
networks. Specifically, collaboration with CutMix optimizes the efficient per-
formance of semi-supervised semantic segmentation with structured consistency
loss by reducing computational burden dramatically. The superiority of proposed
method is verified with the Cityscapes; The Cityscapes benchmark results with
validation and with test data are 81.9 mIoU and 83.84 mIoU respectively. This
ranks the first place on the pixel-level semantic labeling task of Cityscapes bench-
mark suite. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to present the superiority
of state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning in semantic segmentation.
1	Introduction
With the deep learning approach of Krizhevsky et al. (2012) introduced in ILSVRC-2012 (Rus-
sakovsky et al., 2015), deep learning based image processing has quickly spread among the field.
Deep learning has evolved into supervised learning, where the performance of the network is greatly
affected by the quantity and quality of labeled data provided. However, preparing labeled data is
time-consuming and expensive as it is manually prepared. When it comes to semantic segmenta-
tion, it requires pixel-by-pixel annotation making it particularly costly to prepare labeled data for
processing. Currently, various techniques such as active learning (Mackowiak et al., 2018), interac-
tive segmentation (Maninis et al., 2018), weakly-supervised leaning (Lee et al., 2019) and more are
developed and presented to solve the labeling cost problem in semantic segmentation. In this study,
we are aimed at bypassing the labeling cost problem with semi-supervised learning technique.
Semi-supervised learning is a technique to improve network performance with relatively a smaller
number of labeled data when a large number of unlabeled data is also available. In reality, a simple
build up of unlabeled data can be easily collected from various data sources such as web crawling,
vehicle logging and more, and what makes data preparation costly is the manual labelling process to
make the collected data useful in learning process. That is, semi-supervised learning technique best
suits the data needs of semantic segmentation in real-world research environment. For this reason,
our research designed the semi-supervised learning approach suitable for semantic segmentation.
Prior studies apply various versions of semi-supervised learning technique to image classification
task and report significant improvement in the performance. Unlike classification, semantic segmen-
tation is a task that performs structured prediction. Specifically, prediction of classification results
in a class vector, while semantic segmentation makes predictions per regional location and predicts
structural characteristics of regions. We can also learn from prior studies that structural relationship
between pixels is important in semantic segmentation; Liu et al. (2019) discussed the distillation
of between-pixel relationships and Xie et al. (2018) discussed the neighbor-pixel distillation of fea-
tures. Together, we pinpoint that it is important to adequately modify the semi-supervised learning
to be applied in semantic segmentation.

In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised learning with structured consistency loss in seman-
tic segmentation. Structured consistency loss reflects the structural relationship between pixels in
semantic segmentation. It regularizes the inter-pixel relationships consistent, thereby allowing the
network to learn more powerful generalization capabilities. We propose a method incorporating
CutMix (Yun et al., 2019) in data augmentation, achieving a significantly lower GPU memory uti-
lization by limiting the observation region at each CutMix box. This allows us to process the final
prediction map at the size of the original image; we no longer must reduce the size of the final predic-
tion map to lower the GPU memory utilization, unlike it was with pair-wise knowledge distillation
which requires feature distillation with the lowest resolution.
Our method achieved the first place with mIOU 83.84 in the Cityscapes benchmark pixel-level se-
mantic labeling task (Cordts et al., 2016). This is the first study showing that the semi-supervised
learning achieved the state-of-the-art performance in semantic segmentation using the Cityscapes
benchmark. Note that our semi-supervised learning technique could be used in parallel with other
researches for further improvements since our contribution is not in network architecture, but in
learning techniques.

Semantic Segmentation. The early period of semantic segmentation approaches were mostly
based on Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) (Sermanet et al., 2013; Long et al., 2015). Improving
earlier segmentation models, the loss of spatial information is mediated with the use of encoder-
decoder architecture (Noh et al., 2015; Ronneberger et al., 2015; Badrinarayanan et al., 2017) or
dilated convolution (a.k.a. Atrous Convolution) expanding the receptive field (Chen et al., 2014; Yu
& Koltun, 2015). Improving the localization performance, (Chen et al., 2017) applied the Atrous
Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) in semantic segmentation and PSPNet (Zhao et al., 2017) proposed
a feature pyramid pooling module to gather global contextual information around the image object
or stuff.
More recently, Chen et al. (2018) suggested well-organized architecture with combining
encoder-decoder architecture and dilated convolution. Many subsequent methods that achieved
state-of-the-art performance have followed this structure (Takikawa et al., 2019; Zhuang et al., 2018;
Li et al., 2019). Zhu et al. (2019) adopted DeeplabV3Plus (Chen et al., 2018) with WideResNet38
(Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2016) as the backbone network. The inspiring results were generated
due to labelling of video image using temporal information, not by architectural improvements.
Moreover, boundary label relaxation also eased the strictly labeling in boundary issue and class
uniform sampling dealt the class imbalance problem. To make our contribution clearly visible, we
employed those architecture and methods except for video label generation .
Semi-Supervised learning. In recent years, semi-supervised method has become a very prominent
theme, but a lot of researches were limited to classification task in earlier times. They used a loss
function computed on unlabeled data and encouraged the model to generalize better to unseen data
in same domain. Grandvalet & Bengio (2005) proposed the entropy minimization loss showing
that decision boundary tends to lie on low density region of class distribution. Consistency loss
which encourages the model to produce the same output distribution when its inputs are perturbed is
suggested in Laine & Aila (2016). Consistency regularization loss played a breakthrough role which
facilitated researches in this field.
To employ consistency loss efficiently, Tarvainen & Valpola (2017) proposed teacher network with
exponential-moving-average (EMA) network and generated better guessed label. More recently,
MixMatch (Berthelot et al., 2019) combined entropy minimization, consistency loss, and MixUp
(Zhang et al., 2017) regularization for the better generalization. Furthermore, result of Xie et al.
(2019) nearly matched the performance of models trained on the full sets of CIFAR-10 with only
using 10 % of this dataset, thanks to sophisticated augmentation method with realistic noise.
Structured Prediction. Semantic segmentation has a nature of structured prediction; prediction
result has a equal shape of input image and prediction vector of each pixel has a strong correlation
with each other, especially close one. There were some researches reflected this characteristics by a

loss term, or architectural perspective. In Xie et al. (2018), local pair-wise (8-neighbors) distillation
was used to make efficient feature distillation. They transferred the knowledge of zero-order, and
first-order by consistency map. Liu et al. (2019) showed impressive progress of feature distillation
using pair-wise distillation. They calculated total inter-pixel similarities in a specific feature map
and distilled the feature of teacher to student by similarities.
The knowledge distillation and consistency loss differ in the underlying philosophy. The purpose
of knowledge distillation is to enable an efficient network to learn powerful network predictions or
feature extraction capabilities for the same image, while the goal of consistency loss is to enhance
robustness against disturbances by forcing the same prediction. However, the implementation detail
of both methods are same. That is, using the distance function as the cost function. In this paper,
we employed the knowledge distillation technique introduced in Liu et al. (2019) to our structured
consistency loss.
Most recently, consistency loss with CutMix (Yun et al., 2019) for semantic segmentation was intro-
duced in French et al. (2019). They investigated the difference between classification and semantic
segmentation in terms of low density region; it lies in boundary of class distribution in classification,
while it is distributed in object boundary pixels of each image in semantic segmentation. For this
reason, they selected CutMix instead of MixUp to conserve the local-structural identity of image in
CutMix box. We also used CutMix augmentation to give different perturbed images to teacher and
student while maintaining the structural information.
3	Methodology
Since semantic segmentation can be considered as a classification problem performed pixel by pixel,
it is reasonable to try to apply semantic segmentation in the same way to consistency loss, widely
used in semi-supervised classification. Indeed, several studies have made improvements in this
methodology. However, semantic segmentation has a characteristic of structured prediction unlike
general classification. For this reason, if the existing consistency loss is used as it is, it is difficult
to expect high performance improvement while ignoring the nature of the structured prediction of
semantic segmentation.
Therefore, structured consistency loss is used to encourage network to predict properly focusing
on inter-pixel relationship in local patch using cosine similarity. Local patches are implemented
with random CutMix augmentation scheme. Looking at too narrow range of receptive field can
be ineffective in identifying pixel-to-pixel relationships, while looking at too wide range increases
computational complexity and hinder network’s learning. Therefore, precise tuning of the CutMix
box size is essential. Experimental details would be explained in section 4.1.
3.1	architecture
Our main architecture is divided into two parts, supervised training with labeled image and unsuper-
vised training with unlabeled image. These images are used to compose mini-batch in each step in
order to calculate labeled and unlabeled loss simultaneously. Formally, the combined loss Ltot for
semi-supervised learning is computed as:
Ltot = Lx + Lu	(1)
Lx = -log X P(C)	(2)
C∈Nw
Where Lx is general cross entropy loss with boundary label relaxation for semantic segmentation
with labeled image x. Lu is a loss with unlabeled image u. In equation (2), Lx is composed of
P() with softmax probability of each class where Nw is the set of classes within a w by w window
boundary region, respectively. Note that Lx reduces to the standard cross entropy loss with one-hot
label when w equals one.
CutMix. The CutMix augmentation was originally designed for classification task. It mixes
samples by cutting rectangular patch and pasting from one sample into another. Following as done

semantic segmentation. Two losses, consistency and structured consistency, are calculated from
prediction of teacher and student networks each.
by Liu et al. (2019), we use it for semantic segmentation by generating N patches with random size
and position. The total area of patches would be approximately half of the image dimension H, W
to make balance between two images u and x.
Semi-supervised. In Figure 1, our main architecture of semi-supervised approach is described.
First, we generate u´a and u´b by applying random augmentation used in Zhu et al. (2019) except
CutMix. And then create CutMix image um from the augmented images. The teacher network takes
the images as input and generates prediction results (pt (u´a), pt (u´b)), and also generates CutMix
image pmt (u´a , u´b) from the two predictions. Student network use the result as a guessed label
introduced by Berthelot et al. (2019). The student network gets the CutMix image as input during
training and produces prediction ps (um). In the end, we calculate two consistency losses using the
prediction of student and teacher networks each. Note that teacher and student network have same
network architecture. The weights of teacher is not from its own weights using gradient update, but
from the student weights by EMA manipulation. These losses give the student network ability to
predict similar result as the teacher networks by only looking at local patches where teacher network
receives the overall image information.
Unlabeled loss term is separated into two parts: consistency loss and structured consistency loss.
Consistency loss is a conventional loss used for classification task and performed pixel-wise manner
while structured consistency loss is a novel approach to figure out inter-pixel relationship within
local patch. Formula of unlabeled loss is as follows:
Lu = λcLc + λscLsc
Lc = H X W ^X ||ps (Umn) ― Pmt(Ua,i,ub,i )||2
i∈T
(3)
(4)
Where Lc is conventional consistency loss which is average of pixel-wise squared L2 loss used in
classification task. We will deep dive into Lsc in next section. λc , λsc are weight for each loss
term. T = {1, 2, ..., H × W} denotes a set of all the pixel indices in the image. ps(Um,i) represents
prediction of student network for ith pixel of CUtMix unlabeled image Um. Pmt (u1,i, ub,i) represents
CUtMix prediction of teacher network for ith pixel for unlabeled augmented images uɑ, Ub.
3.2	structured consistency loss
As explained in section 2, we used pair-wise knowledge distillation technique suggested by Liu et al.
(2019) into structured consistency loss can be written as:

Figure 2: Structured consistency loss calculation procedure is described visually. CutMix box size
of 3 by 3 is used for simplicity. Note that the each pair of cosine similarity (asn , atn) with same color
are used to calculate the loss. (a) Masking the covered region (denoted as black box) by another
CutMix box since it doesn’t include uncovered box related information. (b) Random elimination of
cosine similarities when the number of similarities exceed Npair .
aij = piT pj /(||pi ||||pj ||)	(5)
Lsc = (H×1w)2 XXHaSj - atj∣∣2	⑹
i∈T j∈T
Where aitj and aisj denote the similarity between the ith pixel and the jth pixel produced from the
teacher and student network each and pi represents prediction vector of ith pixel.
In the previous work, prediction vector (p) was calculated at the feature stage rather than the pre-
diction stage due to feature distillation effects. On the contrary, structured consistency loss must be
calculated at the image domain because the goal is to get the same prediction from the perturbed
image. In order to do that, there are issues to overcome to calculate structured consistency loss in
image domain; The calculation of structured loss consumes a lot of GPU memory usage since the
complexity is (H× W)2 , not feasible in image domain with the same size as the input.
Nevertheless, because our main architecture uses CutMix augmentation, calculating the structured
consistency loss inside the CutMix box reduces computing complexity approximately N times. To
be specific, CutMix augmentation allows limitation of calculation into the CutMix box, thereby
enabling efficient GPU memory usage. Moreover, by using CutMix, the network can learn the
ability to make accurate predictions with limited local information which predicts similar to the
prediction with global area. The structured consistency loss with CutMix is described as below:
an,ij = pn,ipn,j /(||pn,i ||||pn,j ||)	(7)
N1
Lsc = E 1T⅛ ∑∑Han,ij - an,ij∣∣2	(8)
n=1	n i∈Tn j∈Tn
Where Tn = {1, 2, 3, ..., Hn × Wn} denotes a set of all the pixel indices in nth CutMix box except
for the region covered by other CutMix box. an,ij represents the similarity between the ith pixel and
the jth pixel in nth CutMix box and N is the number of CutMix boxes.
To achieve state-of-the-art performance, it is necessary to revise the loss term because input image
with high resolution and complex network architecture cause the out of memory problem. In order
to handle this issue, the number of CutMix boxes for calculating structured consistency loss and
the maximum number of pairs for calculating losses in each box are restricted to Nbox and Npair ,
respectively, to make algorithm realizable. To be specific, we didn’t use CutMix box with dotted

line borders while only considered Nbox CutMix box with straight line for structured consistency
loss in Figure 1. In Figure 2(a), we eliminated the region covered by another CutMix box, and also
randomly dropped out similarity vectors excessing over Npair in Figure 2(b). Finally, we derived
the feasible structured consistency loss as follows:
Tn,drop = Droph{(i,j)∖∀i ∈ Tn,∀j ∈ Tn},Npair〉	(9)
N1
Lsc = ΣS T | ΣS	llan,ij - an,ij11	(IO)
n=N-Nbox+1 | n,drop | (i,j)∈Tsn,drop
The customized function DrophX, ni randomly clips X to n when exceeding n. In the process of
attaching the CutMix box, box attached earlier is likely to be covered by the box attached behind, so
the loss is calculated using posterior Nbox of boxes. In addition, the loss is not calculated through
masking on the area covered by another box. By doing this, only those pixels that are structural-
relevant within the CutMix box can learn about the relationship to each other.
4	Experiments
4.1	implementation details
Network Structures. We adopt a state-of-the-art segmentation architecture from Zhu et al. (2019),
Deeplabv3+ with WideResNet38. Output stride of encoder is set to 8 and that of the low level
feature transferred to decoder is set to 2. The teacher network used to generate guessed label is
made from EMA model (Tarvainen & Valpola, 2017). Inference with test and validation sets are
also done with EMA model. The parameter value of EMA weight is set to 0.999 and it is averaged
out in every training steps.
Training Procedure. We use a SGD optimizer with polynomial learning rate policy. Following
the setup of Zhu et al. (2019) the initial learning rate is 0.002, power set to 1.0, weight decay of
0.001 and momentum of 0.9. We use synchronized batch normalization with a batch size of 2
per GPU, one for labeled data and the other for unlabeled one, on 8 V100 GPUs. The training
epoch is set to 175 based on the labeled data. For unlabeled data, we adopt CutMix augmentation
additionally. From the empirical results, we set the hyper-parameters N, Nbox , Npair λc, λsc to
32, 16, 9000, 20, 3 respectively. We use training skills, class uniform sampling and boundary label
relaxation, to get strong baseline network.
Cityscapes. Cityscapes is a widely accepted validation medium among recent studies, thanks to
its high-quality labeled image database. Cityscapes offers pixel-level annotations of 5,000 images
and coarse annotations of 20K images. The reliable pixel-level annotations are also split into three
subsets for training, validation and test, each consisting of 2,975, 500 and 1,525 images respectively,
and we used these training, validation and test set to gauge the performance of our methodology pre-
sented in this paper. We also use coarsely annotated images for class uniform sampling to overcome
the imbalance between classes. Those images with coarse annotations are also used, ignoring the
annotations associated with, as unlabeled images in unlabeled training phase for greater learning
exposure.
4.2	Results
The experimental results from our semi-supervised learning technique with structured consistency
loss are summarized in Table 1. Our experiments were conducted on Cityscapes test images with
multi-scale strategy (0.5, 1.0 and 2.0), horizontal-flip, and overlapping-tile methods. Our perfor-
mance result ranks the first in the Cityscapes benchmark, even after including the results of unpub-
lished studies. We also want to emphasize that the result with only training set exhibits the highest
performance result when compared with performance results of published methods. Graphical re-
sults on the Cityscapes test set are presented in Figure 3.

We believe the observed improvement in performance is attributed to (a) the use of coarsely labeled
images in unlabeled training phase and (b) the effectiveness of structured consistency loss added
to semi-supervised learning in semantic segmentation. In recent years, many researchers have at-
tempted to achieve the close performance obtained from learning with the entire labeled data set by
using a combination of only a small portion of the labeled data set and a large unlabeled data set.
Yet the use of coarsely labeled data has been limited in extant studies; they are only used in the early
training stage, or sporadically used to aid the segmentation of images with rare classes.
We believe that our approach reflects the real-world environment where the available training re-
sources are mostly unlabeled; the combination of a small labeled data set and a large unlabeled data
set to achieve the performance equivalent to using a large labeled data set is the way we all want to
go. We are a step closer to this goal with the structured consistency loss applied to semi-supervised
learning in semantic segmentation.
4.3	Ablation study
Validation with Baseline. In this section, we conducted additional experiments to demonstrate the
superiority and effectiveness of our proposed method in semi-supervised learning. We first perform
a supervisory baseline, and the result is summarized in the first row of Table 2. The baseline result
exhibits a reasonable performance, as a decent amount of recent techniques are already included;
pre-training with Mapillary, boundary label relaxation, and class uniform sampling are included in
the baseline. By adding consistency loss to the baseline, the mIoU increases to 81.55% from 81.18%,
showing the practical implication of the semi-supervised learning using the CutMix in semantic seg-
mentation. mIoU increases further with addition of structured consistency loss to 81.90%, reflecting
the significance of our proposed method.

The qualitative results have been visually provided in Figure 4, allowing us to gauge the qualitative
performance. Thanks to inter-pixel consistency processed with the structured consistency loss, our
proposed method exhibits less errors in small and visually easy-to-confuse region(s).
Exponential-moving-average (EMA) Application. Networks with EMA are well-known for
their great generalization ability (Tarvainen & Valpola, 2017; Berthelot et al., 2019). Hence it must
be beneficial to apply EMA to both training (teacher network) and inference (validation or test).
Nevertheless, not all recent studies apply EMA to the weight of teacher network, but use the same
weight as that of student network. Therefore, we conduct an experiment to examine the performance
variability depending on application of EMA. The experiment result is sumamrized in Table 3. When
the EMA weight is used in the teacher network, mIoU increases 0.135% on average, while the use
of EMA weight in validation seems to have no significant effect on mIoU. Since the use of EMA
weight in teacher network and validation yields the greatest mIoU, we proceed to use the EMA
weight in both.

5	Conclusion
In this paper, we propose the structured consistency loss in semi-supervised learning for semantic
segmentation. With CutMix augmentation, the structured consistency loss fully exploits the rela-
tionship among local regions and enhance the network generalization. This technique could also
be simultaneously applied to the general network. Our proposed method achieves the state-of-the-
art premier performance in the Cityscapes benchmark suite, not only ranking the first place only
among publication results, but also among all results including unpublished results. Therefore, we
are confident that the semi-supervised learning is also highly effective to solve practical real world
problems under data-insufficiency, when accompanied with CutMix augmentation as well as the
structured consistency loss. Despite of superior performance exhibited by our method, the random
sampling using Npair , Nbox in the proposed method still has a room for optimization. We leave this
as a future work.
