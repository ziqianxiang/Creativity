ABSTRACT

Semi-supervised learning, i.e. jointly learning from labeled an unlabeled samples,
is an active research topic due to its key role on relaxing human supervision. In the
context of image classification, recent advances to learn from unlabeled samples
are mainly focused on consistency regularization methods that encourage invariant
predictions  for  different  perturbations  of  unlabeled  samples.   We,  conversely,
propose to learn from unlabeled data by generating soft pseudo-labels using the
network predictions.  We show that a naive pseudo-labeling overfits to incorrect
pseudo-labels due to the so-called confirmation bias and demonstrate that mixup
augmentation and setting a minimum number of labeled samples per mini-batch are
effective regularization techniques for reducing it. The proposed approach achieves
state-of-the-art results in CIFAR-10/100, SVHN, and Mini-ImageNet despite being
much simpler than other methods. These results demonstrate that pseudo-labeling
alone can outperform consistency regularization methods, while the opposite was
supposed in previous work. Code will be made available.

1    INTRODUCTION

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have become the dominant approach in computer vision (Lin
et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2018; Xie et al., 2018). To best exploit them, vast 
amounts of
labeled data are required. Obtaining such labels, however, is not trivial, and the research 
community
is exploring alternatives to alleviate this (Li et al., 2017; Oliver et al., 2018; Liu et al., 
2019).

Knowledge transfer via deep domain adaptation (Wang & Deng, 2018) is a popular alternative that
seeks to learn transferable representations from source to target domains by embedding domain
adaptation in the learning pipeline.  Other approaches focus exclusively on learning useful repre-
sentations from scratch in a target domain when annotation constraints are relaxed (Oliver et al.,
2018; Arazo et al., 2019; Gidaris et al., 2018). Semi-supervised learning (SSL) (Oliver et al., 
2018)
focuses on scenarios with sparsely labeled data and extensive amounts of unlabeled data; learning
with label noise (Arazo et al., 2019) seeks robust learning when labels are obtained automatically
and may not represent the image content; and self-supervised learning (Gidaris et al., 2018) uses
data supervision to learn from unlabeled data in a supervised manner. This paper focuses on SSL for
image classification, a recently very active research area (Li et al., 2019).

SSL is a transversal task for different domains including images (Oliver et al., 2018), audio (Zhang
et al., 2016), time series (Gonza´lez et al., 2018), and text (Miyato et al., 2016). Recent 
approaches
in image classification primarily focus on exploiting the consistency in the predictions for the 
same
sample under different perturbations (consistency regularization) (Sajjadi et al., 2016; Li et al., 
2019),
while other approaches directly generate labels for the unlabeled data to guide the learning process
(pseudo-labeling) (Lee, 2013; Iscen et al., 2019).  These two alternatives differ importantly in the
mechanism  they use to exploit unlabeled samples. Consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling
approaches apply different strategies such as a warm-up phase using labeled data (Tarvainen &
Valpola, 2017; Iscen et al., 2019), uncertainty weighting (Shi et al., 2018; Li et al., 2019), 
adversarial
attacks (Miyato et al., 2018; Qiao et al., 2018), or graph-consistency (Luo et al., 2018; Iscen et 
al.,
2019). These strategies deal with confirmation bias (Tarvainen & Valpola, 2017; Li et al., 2019), 
also
known as noise accumulation (Zhang et al., 2016). This bias stems from using incorrect predictions
on unlabeled data for training in subsequent epochs and, thereby increasing confidence in incorrect
predictions and producing a model that will tend to resist new changes.

This paper explores pseudo-labeling for semi-supervised deep learning from the network predictions
and shows that, contrary to previous attempts on pseudo-labeling (Iscen et al., 2019; Oliver et 
al., 2018;
Shi et al., 2018), simple modifications to prevent confirmation bias lead to state-of-the-art 
performance
without adding consistency regularization strategies.  We adapt the approach proposed by Tanaka
et    al. (2018) in the context of label noise and apply it exclusively on unlabeled samples. 
Experiments
show that this naive pseudo-labeling is limited by confirmation bias as prediction errors are fit by
the network.  To deal with this issue, we propose to use mixup augmentation (Zhang et al., 2018)
as an effective regularization that helps calibrate deep neural networks (Thulasidasan et al., 2019)
and, therefore, alleviates confirmation bias. We find that mixup alone does not guarantee robustness
against confirmation bias when reducing the amount of labeled samples or using certain network
architectures (see Subsection 4.3), and show that, when properly introduced, dropout regularization
(Srivastava et al., 2014) and data augmentation mitigates this issue.  Our purely pseudo-labeling
approach achieves state-of-the-art results (see Subsection 4.4) without requiring multiple networks
(Tarvainen & Valpola, 2017; Qiao et al., 2018; Li et al., 2019; Verma et al., 2019), nor does it 
require
over       a thousand epochs of training to achieve peak performance in every dataset (Athiwaratkun 
et al.,
2019; Berthelot et al., 2019), nor needs many (ten) forward passes for each sample (Li et al., 
2019).
Compared to other pseudo-labeling approaches, the proposed approach is simpler in that it does
not require graph construction and diffusion (Iscen et al., 2019) or combination with consistency
regularization methods (Shi et al., 2018), but still achieves state-of-the-art results.

2    RELATED  WORK

This section reviews closely related SSL methods, i.e.  those using deep learning with mini-batch
optimization over large image collections. Previous work on deep SSL differ in whether they use
consistency regularization or pseudo-labeling to learn from the unlabeled set (Iscen et al., 2019),
while they all share the use of a cross-entropy loss (or similar) on labeled data.

Consistency regularization    Imposes that the same sample under different perturbations must
produce the same output. This idea was used in (Sajjadi et al., 2016) where they apply randomized
data augmentation, dropout, and random max-pooling while forcing softmax predictions to be similar.
A similar idea is applied in (Laine & Aila, 2017), which also extends the perturbation to different
epochs, i.e.  the current prediction for a sample has to be similar to an ensemble of predictions of
the same sample in the past. Here the different perturbations come from networks at different 
states,
dropout, and data augmentation. In (Tarvainen & Valpola, 2017), the temporal ensembling method is
interpreted as a teacher-student problem where the network is both a teacher that produces targets
for the unlabeled data as a temporal ensemble, and a student that learns the generated targets by
imposing the consistency regularization. Tarvainen & Valpola (2017) naturally re-define the problem
to deal with confirmation bias by separating the teacher and the student.  The teacher is defined
as a different network with similar architecture whose parameters are updated as an exponential
moving average of the student network weights. This method is extended in (Li et al., 2019), where
they apply an uncertainty weight over the unlabeled samples to learn from the unlabeled samples
with low uncertainty (i.e. entropy of the predictions for each sample under random perturbations).
Additionally, Miyato et al. (2018) use virtual adversarial training to carefully introduce 
perturbations
to data samples as adversarial noise and later impose consistency regularization on the predictions.
More recently, Luo et al. (2018) propose to use a contrastive loss on the predictions as a 
regularization
that forces predictions to be similar (different) when they are from the same (different) class. 
This
method extends the consistency regularization previously considered only in-between the same data
samples to in-between different samples. Their method can naturally be combined with (Tarvainen &
Valpola, 2017) or (Miyato et al., 2018) to boost their performance.  Similarly, Verma et al. (2019)
propose interpolation consistency training, a method inspired by (Zhang et al., 2018) that encourage
predictions at interpolated unlabeled samples to be consistent with the interpolated predictions of
individual samples.  Also, authors in (Berthelot et al., 2019) apply consistency regularization by
guessing low-entropy labels, generating data-augmented unlabeled examples and mixing labeled and
unlabeled examples using mixup (Zhang et al., 2018). Both (Verma et al., 2019) and (Berthelot et 
al.,
2019) adopt (Tarvainen & Valpola, 2017) to estimate the targets used in the consistency 
regularization.

Co-training (Qiao et al., 2018) uses two (or more) networks trained simultaneously to agree on
their predictions (consistency regularization) and disagree on their errors.  Errors are defined as

different predictions when exposed to adversarial attacks, thus forcing different networks to learn
complementary representations for the same samples.  Recently, Chen et al. (2018) measure the
consistency between the current prediction and an additional prediction for the same sample given by
an external memory module that keeps track of previous representations. They additionally introduce
an uncertainty weighting of the consistency term to reduce the contribution of uncertain 
predictions.
Consistency regularization methods such as (Laine & Aila, 2017; Tarvainen & Valpola, 2017; Miyato
et al., 2018) have all been shown to benefit from stochastic weight averaging method (Athiwaratkun
et al., 2019), that averages network parameters at different training epochs to move the SGD 
solution
on borders of flat loss regions to their center and improve generalization.

Pseudo-labeling    Seeks the generation of labels or pseudo-labels for unlabeled samples to guide
the learning process. An early attempt at pseudo-labeling proposed in (Lee, 2013) uses the network
predictions as labels. However, they constrain the pseudo-labeling to a fine-tuning stage, i.e. 
there is
a pre-training or warm-up to initialize the network. A recent pseudo-labeling approach proposed in
(Shi et al., 2018) uses the network class prediction as hard labels for the unlabeled samples. They
also introduce an uncertainty weight for each sample loss, it being higher for samples that have
distant k-nearest neighbors in the feature space.  They further include a loss term to encourage
intra-class compactness and inter-class separation, and a consistency term between samples with
different perturbations.  Improved results are reported in combination with (Tarvainen & Valpola,
2017). Finally, a recently published work (Iscen et al., 2019) implements pseudo-labeling through
graph-based label propagation. The method alternates between two steps: training from labeled and
pseudo-labeled data and using the representations of the network to build a nearest neighbor graph
where    label propagation is applied to refine hard pseudo-labels.  They further add an uncertainty
score for every sample (softmax prediction entropy based) and class (class population based) to 
deal,
respectively, with the unequal confidence in network predictions and class-imbalance.

3    PSEUDO-LABELING

We formulate SSL as learning a model hθ(x) from a set of N training samples D. These samples are

split into the unlabeled set Du = {xi}Nu   and the labeled set Dl = {(xi, yi)}Nl   , being yi ∈ {0, 
1}C

the one-hot encoding label for C classes corresponding to xi and N  =  Nl + Nu.  In our case,
hθ is a CNN and θ represents the model parameters (weights and biases).  As we seek to perform
pseudo-labeling, we assume that a pseudo-label y˜ is available for the Nu unlabeled samples. We can

then reformulate SSL as training using D˜ = {(xi, y˜i)}N   , being y˜ = y for the Nl labeled 
samples.

The CNN parameters θ can be optimized using categorical cross-entropy:

N

T

i

i=1

where hθ(x) are the softmax probabilities produced by the model and log( ) is applied element-wise.
A key decision is how to generate the pseudo-labels y˜ for the Nu unlabeled samples.  Previous
approaches have used hard pseudo-labels (i.e.  one-hot vectors) directly using the network output
class (Lee, 2013; Shi et al., 2018) or the class estimated using label propagation on a nearest 
neighbor
graph (Iscen et al., 2019). We adopt the former approach, but use soft pseudo-labels, as we have 
seen
this outperforms hard labels, confirming the observations noted in (Tanaka et al., 2018) in the 
context
of relabeling when learning with label noise. In particular, we store the softmax predictions hθ(xi)
of the network in every mini-batch of an epoch and use them to modify the soft pseudo-label y˜ for
the Nu unlabeled samples at the end of every epoch. We proceed as described from the second to the
last training epoch, while in the first epoch we use the softmax predictions for the unlabeled 
samples
from a model trained in a 10 epochs warm-up phase using the labeled data subset Du.

We use the two regularizations applied in (Tanaka et al., 2018) to improve convergence.  The first
regularization deals with the difficulty of converging at early training stages when the network’s
predictions are mostly incorrect and the CNN tends to predict the same class to minimize the loss.
Assignment of all samples to a single class is discouraged by adding:


RA = Σ

pc log

. pc

Σ ,                                              (2)

c=1                    hc

where pc is the prior probability distribution for class c and hc denotes the mean softmax 
probability
of the model for class c across all samples in the dataset. As in (Tanaka et al., 2018), we assume a
uniform distribution pc = 1/C for the prior probabilities (RA stands for all classes regularization)
and approximate hc using mini-batches.  The second regularization is needed to concentrate the
probability distribution of each soft pseudo-label on a single class, thus avoiding the local 
optima in
which the network might get stuck due to a weak guidance:

N     C

R   = −  1  Σ Σ hᶜ(x ) log (hᶜ(x )) ,                                   (3)

where hᶜ(xi) denotes the c class value of the softmax output hθ(xi) and again using mini-batches
(i.e. N is replaced by the mini-batch size) to approximate this term. This second regularization is 
the
average per-sample entropy (RH stands for entropy regularization), a well-known regularization in
SSL (Grandvalet & Bengio, 2004). Finally, the total semi-supervised loss is:

l = l∗ + λARA + λHRH,                                            (4)

where λA and λH control the contribution of each regularization term. We stress that this pseudo-

labeling approach adapted from Tanaka et al. (2018) is far from the state-of-the-art for SSL (see
Subsection 4.2), and are the mechanisms proposed in Subsection 3.1 which make pseudo-labeling a
suitable alternative.

3.1    CONFIRMATION BIAS

Network predictions are, of course, sometimes incorrect. This situation is reinforced when incorrect
predictions are used as labels for unlabeled samples, as it is the case in pseudo-labeling. 
Overfitting
to incorrect pseudo-labels predicted by the network is known as confirmation bias. It is natural to
think that reducing the confidence of the network on its predictions might alleviate this problem
and improve generalization. Recently, mixup data augmentation (Zhang et al., 2018) introduced a
strong regularization technique that combines data augmentation with label smoothing, which makes
it potentially useful to deal with this bias. Mixup trains on convex combinations of sample pairs 
(xp
and xq) and corresponding labels (yp and yq):

x = δxp + (1 − δ)xq,                                               (5)

y = δyp + (1 − δ)yq,                                                (6)

where δ      0, 1   is randomly sampled from a beta distribution    e (α, β), with α = β (e.g. α = 
1

uniformly selects δ). This combination regularizes the network to favor linear behavior in-between
training samples, reducing oscillations in regions far from them.  Additionally, Eq.  6 can be re-
interpreted in the loss as l∗ = δl∗p + (1 − δ)l∗q , thus re-defining the loss l∗ used in Eq. 4 as:

N

l∗ = − Σ δ Σy˜T  log (hθ(xi))Σ + (1 − δ) Σy˜T  log (hθ(xi))Σ .                     (7)

i=1

As shown in (Thulasidasan et al., 2019), overconfidence in deep neural networks is a consequence
of training on hard labels and it is the label smoothing effect from randomly combining yp and yq
during mixup training that reduces prediction confidence and improves model calibration.  In the
semi-supervised context with pseudo-labeling, using soft-labels and mixup reduces overfitting to
model predictions, which is especially important for unlabeled samples whose predictions are used as
soft-labels. Note that training with mixup generates softmax outputs hθ(x) for mixed inputs x, thus
requiring a second forward pass with the original images to compute unmixed predictions. Mixup
data augmentation alone might not effectively deal with confirmation bias when few labeled examples
are provided. For example, when training with 500 labeled samples in CIFAR-10 and mini-batch size
of 100, 1 clean sample per batch is seen, which is especially problematic at early stages of 
training
where little correct guidance is provided. We find that setting a minimum number of labeled samples
per mini-batch (as done in other works (Tarvainen & Valpola, 2017; Chen et al., 2018; Berthelot
et al., 2019; Iscen et al., 2019)) provides a constant reinforcement with correct labels during 
training,
reducing confirmation bias and helping to produce better pseudo-labels.  Subsections 4.2 and 4.3
experimentally show that mixup, a minimum number of samples per mini-batch, and other techniques
(dropout  and data augmentation) reduce confirmation bias and make pseudo-labeling an effective
alternative to consistency regularization.

4    EXPERIMENTAL  WORK

4.1    DATASETS AND TRAINING

We use four image classification datasets, CIFAR-10/100 (Krizhevsky & Hinton, 2009), SVHN (Net-
zer et al., 2011) and Mini-ImageNet (Vinyals et al., 2016), to validate our approach.  Part of the
training images are labeled and the remaining are unlabeled. Following (Oliver et al., 2018), we 
use a
validation set of 5K samples for CIFAR-10/100 for studying hyperparameters in Subsections 4.2 and

4.3. However, as done in (Athiwaratkun et al., 2019), we add the 5K samples back to the training set
for comparisons in Subsection 4.4, where we report test results (model from the best epoch).

CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN    These datasets contain 10, 100, and 10 classes respectivelly,
with 50K color images for training and 10K for testing in CIFAR-10/100 and 73257 images for
training and 26032 for testing in SVHN. The three datasets have resolution 32×32.  We perform
experiments with a number of labeled images Nl = 0.25K, 0.5K, and 1K for SVHN and Nl = 0.25K,
0.5K,  1K, and 4K (4K and 10K) for CIFAR-10 (CIFAR-100). We use the well-known “13-CNN”
architecture (Athiwaratkun et al., 2019) for CIFAR-10/100 and SVHN. We also experiment with
a        Wide ResNet-28-2 (WR-28) (Oliver et al., 2018) and a PreAct ResNet-18 (PR-18) (Zhang et 
al.,
2018) in Subsection 4.3 to study the generalization to different architectures.

Mini-ImageNet    We emulate the semi-supervised learning setup Mini-ImageNet (Vinyals et al.,
2016) (a subset of the well-known ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009) dataset) used in (Iscen et al., 
2019).
Train and test sets of 100 classes and 600 color images per class with resolution 84 × 84 are 
selected
from ImageNet, as in (Ravi & Larochelle, 2017).  500 (100) images per-class are kept for train
(test) splits. The train and test sets therefore contain 50k and 10k images. As with CIFAR-100, we
experiment with a number of labeled images Nl = 4K and 10K. Following (Iscen et al., 2019), we
use a ResNet-18 (RN-18) architecture (He et al., 2016a).

Hyperparameters    We use the typical configuration for CIFAR-10/100 and SVHN (Laine & Aila,
2017), and the same for Mini-ImageNet.  Image normalization using dataset mean and standard
deviation and subsequent data augmentation (Laine & Aila, 2017) by random horizontal flips and 2

(6) pixel translations for CIFAR and SVHN (Mini-ImageNet). Additionally, color jitter is applied as
in (Asano et al., 2019) in Subsections 4.3 and 4.4 for higher robustness against confirmation bias. 
We

train using SGD with momentum of 0.9, weight decay of 10−⁴, and batch size of 100. Training always
starts with a high learning rate (0.1 in CIFAR and SVHN, and 0.2 in Mini-ImageNet), dividing it by

ten twice during training. We train for CIFAR and Mini-ImageNet 400 epochs (reducing learning rate
in epochs 250 and 350) and use 10 epoch warm-up with labeled data, while for SVHN we train 150
epochs (reducing learning rate in epochs 50 and 100) and use a longer warm-up of 150 epochs to start
the pseudo-labeling with good predictions and leading to reliable convergence. We do not attempt
careful tuning of the regularization weights λA and λH and just set them to 0.8 and 0.4 as done in
(Tanaka et al., 2018) (see Appendix A.2 for an ablation study of these parameters).  When using
dropout, it is introduced between consecutive convolutional layers of ResNet blocks in WR-28, PR-18,
and RN-18, while for 13-CNN we introduce it as in Laine & Aila (2017). Following (Athiwaratkun
et al., 2019)¹, we use weight normalization (Salimans & Kingma, 2016) in all networks.

4.2    EFFECT OF MIXUP ON CONFIRMATION BIAS

This section demonstrates that carefully regularized pseudo-labeling is a suitable alternative for 
SSL.
Figure 1 illustrates our approach on the “two moons” toy data. Figure 1 (left) shows the limitations
of a naive pseudo-labeling adapted from (Tanaka et al., 2018), which fails to adapt to the structure
in the unlabelled examples and results in a linear decision boundary. Figure 1 (middle) shows the
effect of mixup, which alleviates confirmation bias to better model the structure and gives a 
smoother
boundary. Figure 1 (right) shows that combining mixup with a minimum number of labeled samples
k per mini-batch improves the semi-supervised decision boundary.

Naive pseudo-labeling leads to overfitting the network predictions and high training accuracy in
CIFAR-10/100. Table 1 (left) reports mixup effect in terms of validation error. Naive

k = 64                   19.40     8.20          46.28

leads to an error of 11.40/48.54 for CIFAR-10/100 when training with cross-entropy (C) loss for
4000 labels. This error can be greatly reduced when using mixup (M) to 7.16/41.80. However, when
further reducing the number of labels to 500 in CIFAR-10, M is insufficient to ensure low-error
(32.10). We propose to set a minimum number of samples k per mini-batch to tackle the problem.
Table 1 (right) studies this parameter k when combined with mixup, showing that 16 samples per
mini-batch works well for both CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, dramatically reducing error in all cases
(e.g.     in CIFAR-10 for 500 labels error is reduced from 32.10 to 13.68).

Confirmation bias causes a dramatic increase in the certainty of incorrect predictions during 
training.
To demonstrate this behavior we compute the average cross-entropy of the softmax output with

a uniform U across the classes in every epoch t for all incorrectly predicted samples {xm }Mt

as: rt = −   1    ΣMt        U T  log (hθ(xm )). Figure 2 shows that mixup and minimum k are 
effective

regularizers for reducing rt, i.e. confirmation bias is reduced. We also experimented with using 
label

noise regularizations (Xie et al., 2016), but setting a minimum k proved more effective.

4.3    GENERALIZATION TO DIFFERENT ARCHITECTURES

There are examples in the recent literature (Kolesnikov et al., 2019) where moving from one ar-
chitecture to another modifies the belief of which methods have a higher potential.  Kolesnikov
et al. (2019) show that skip-connections in ResNet architectures play a key role on the quality of
learned representations, while most approaches in previous literature were systematically evaluated
using AlexNet (A. Krizhevsky, 2012). Ulyanov et al. (2018) showed that different architectures lead
different and useful image priors, highlighting the importance of exploring different networks. We,
therefore, test our method with two more architectures: a Wide ResNet-28-2 (WR-28) (S. Zagoruyko,
2016) typically used in SSL (Oliver et al., 2018) (1.5M parameters) and a PreAct ResNet-18 (PR-18)
(He et al., 2016b) used in the context of label noise (Zhang et al., 2018) (11M parameters). Table 2
presents the results for the 13-CNN (AlexNet-type) and these network architectures (ResNet-type).
Our pseudo-labeling with mixup and k  =  16 (M*) works well for 4000 and 500 labels across
architectures, except for 500 labels for WR-28 where there is large error increase (29.50).  This
is due to a stronger confirmation bias in which labeled samples are not properly learned, while
incorrect pseudo-labels are fit. Interestingly, PR-18 (11M) is more robust to confirmation bias than
WR-28 (1.5M), while the 13-layer network (3M) has fewer parameters than PR-18 and achieves
better performance.  This suggests that the network architecture plays an important role, being a
relevant prior for SSL with few labels.

Figure 2: Example of certainty of incorrect predictions rt during training when using 500 (left) and
4000 (right) labeled images in CIFAR-10. Moving from cross-entropy (C) to mixup (M) reduces rt,
whereas adding a minimum number of samples per mini-batch (*) also helps in 500 labels, where M*
(with slightly lower rt than M) is the only configuration that converges, as shown in Table 1

We found that dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014) and data augmentation is needed for good performance
across all architectures. Table 2 shows that dropout p = 0.1, 0.3 helps in achieving better 
convergence
in CIFAR-10, whereas adding color jitter as additional data augmentation (details in Subsection 4.1)
further contributes to error reduction. Note that the quality of pseudo-labels is key, so it is 
essential to
disable dropout to prevent corruption when computing these in the second forward pass. We similarly
disable data augmentation in the second forward pass, which consistently improves performance.
This configuration is used for comparison with the state-of-the-art in Subsection 4.4.

4.4    COMPARISON WITH THE STATE-OF-THE-ART

We compare our pseudo-labeling approach against related work that makes use of the 13-CNN
(Tarvainen & Valpola, 2017) in CIFAR-10/100: Π model (Laine & Aila, 2017), TE (Laine & Aila,
2017), MT (Tarvainen & Valpola, 2017), Π model-SN (Luo et al., 2018), MA-DNN (Chen et al.,
2018), Deep-Co (Qiao et al., 2018), TSSDL (Shi et al., 2018), LP (Iscen et al., 2019), CCL (Li et 
al.,
2019), fast-SWA (Athiwaratkun et al., 2019) and ICT (Verma et al., 2019). Table 3 divides methods
into those based on consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling. Note that we include pseudo-
labeling approaches combined with consistency regularization ones (e.g.  MT) in the consistency
regularization set. The proposed approach clearly outperforms consistency regularization methods, as
well             as other purely pseudo-labeling approaches and their combination with consistency 
regularization
methods in CIFAR-10/100 and SVHN (250 labels are reported in Table 3 and extended results are
in       the  Appendix  A.3).   These  results  demonstrate  the  generalization  of  the  proposed 
 approach
compared to other methods that fail when decreasing the number of labels. Furthermore, Table 4 
(left)
demonstrates that the proposed approach successfully scales to higher resolution images, obtaining 
an
over        10 point margin on the best related work in Mini-ImageNet. Note that all supervised 
baselines
are reported using the same data augmentation and dropout as in the proposed pseudo-labeling.

Table 4 (right) compares against recent consistency regularization approaches that use mixup. We
achieve  better  performance  than  ICT  (Verma  et  al.,  2019),  while  being  competitive  with  
MM
(Berthelot et al., 2019) for 500 and 4000 labels using WR-28.  Regarding PR-18,  we converge
to reasonable performance for 4000 and 500 labels, whereas for 250 we do not.  Finally, the 13-
CNN robustly converges even for 250 labels where we obtain 9.37 test error (see Appendix A.1
for some details on different architectures convergence). Therefore, these results suggest that it 
is
worth exploring the relationship between number of labels, dataset complexity and architecture type.
As shown in Subsection 4.3, dropout and additional data augmentation help with 500 labels/class
across architectures, but are insufficient for 250 labels. Better data augmentation (Ho et al., 
2019)
or self-supervised pre-training (Rebuffi et al., 2019) might overcome this challenge. Furthermore,

hyperparameters such as the regularization weights λA = 0.8 and λH  = 0.4 from Eq. 4 and the
mixup α require further study. However, it is already interesting that a straightforward 
modification of
pseudo-labeling, designed to tackle confirmation bias, gives a competitive semi-supervised learning
approach, without any consistency regularization, and future work should take this into account.

5    CONCLUSIONS

This paper presented a semi-supervised learning approach for image classification based on pseudo-
labeling. We proposed to directly use the network predictions as soft pseudo-labels for unlabeled
data together with mixup augmentation, a minimum number of labeled samples per mini-batch,
dropout and data augmentation to alleviate confirmation bias. This conceptually simple approach
outperforms related work in four datasets, demonstrating that pseudo-labeling is a suitable 
alternative
to          the dominant approach in recent literature: consistency-regularization. The proposed 
approach is,
to the best of our knowledge, both simpler and more accurate than most recent approaches. Future
work should explore SSL in class-unbalanced and large-scale datasets, synergies of pseudo-labelling
and consistency regularization, and careful hyperparameter tuning.

Figure 3:  Cross-entropy loss for labeled samples.  First (second) row show 500 (250) labels in
CIFAR-10. From left to right: 13-CNN, WR-28 and PR-18. The heavy lines represent the median
losses and the shaded areas are the interquartile ranges.

A    APPENDIX

A.1    CONVERGENCE FOR FEW LABELS

Figure 3 presents the cross-entropy loss for labeled samples when training with 13-CNN, WR-28
and PR-18 and using 500 and 250 labels in CIFAR-10.  This loss is a good indicator of a robust
convergence to reasonable performance as the interquartile range for cases failing (250 labels for
WR-28 and PR-18) is much higher.

A.2    EXTENDED HYPERPARAMETERS STUDY

This subsection studies the effect of α, λA, and λH hyperparameters of our pseudo-labeling approach.
Tables 5 and  6 report the validation error in CIFAR-10 using 500 and 4000 labels for, 
respectively, α
and λA and λH . Note that we keep the same configuration used in Subsection 4.2 with k = 16, i.e. no
dropout or additional data augmentation is used. Table  5 results suggest that α = 4 and α = 8 
values
might further improve the reported results using α = 1. However, we experimented on CIFAR-10
with 500 labels using the final configuration (adding dropout and additional data augmentation) and
observed marginal differences (8.54 with α = 4, which is within the error range of the 8.80     0.45
obtained with α = 1), thus suggesting that stronger mixup regularization might not be additive to
dropout and extra data augmentation in our case. Table 6 shows that our configuration (λA = 0.8 and
λH  = 0.4) adopted from (Tanaka et al., 2018) is very close to the best performance in this 
experiment
where marginal improvements are achieved.  In conclusion, more careful hyperparameter tuning
might slighltly improve reported results in the paper, while the configuration selected is already 
good
and generalizes across datasets.

A.3    SVHN EXPPERIMENTS

Table 7 reports a comparison of different state-of-the-art algorithms in SVHN using the 13-CNN
network. We train 150 epochs using labeled samples (i.e. warm-up) to compute initial pseudo-labels.
Then, we train 150 epochs reducing the learning rate in epochs 50 and 100. The long warm-up makes
the method robust to lower levels of labeled samples in SVHN. We also experimented in CIFAR-10
with longer warm-up (our results are reported using 10 epochs) and found that results are in the 
same
error range already reported.
