Effective Mechanism To Mitigate Injuries During
NFL Plays
Abstract—NFL(American football),which is regarded as
the premier sports icon of America, has been severely accused
in the recent years of being exposed to dangerous injuries that
prove to be a bigger crisis as the players' lives have been
increasingly at risk. Concussions, which refer to the serious
brain traumas experienced during the passage of NFL play,
have displayed a dramatic rise in the recent seasons
concluding in an alarming rate in 2017/18. Acknowledging the
potential risk, the NFL has been trying to fight via NeuroIntel
AI mechanism as well as modifying existing game rules and
risky play practices to reduce the rate of concussions. As a
remedy, we are suggesting an effective mechanism to
extensively analyse the potential concussion risks by adopting
predictive analysis to project injury risk percentage per each
play and positional impact analysis to suggest safer team
formation pairs to lessen injuries to offer a comprehensive
study on NFL injury analysis. The proposed data analytical
approach differentiates itself from the other similar
approaches that were focused only on the descriptive analysis
rather than going for a bigger context with predictive
modelling and formation pairs mining that would assist in
modifying existing rules to tackle injury concerns. The
predictive model that works with Kafka-stream processor
real-time inputs and risky formation pairs identification by
designing FP-Matrix, makes this far-reaching solution to
analyse injury data on various grounds wherever applicable.

I.	INTRODUCTION
Owing to the rigorous play practices adopted in NFL
games compared to contemporaries, NFL has been often
touted as riskier play [4,13] with comparatively higher
injury rate with the Offense players, who are generally
referred to those from team with ball’s possession, are
highly prone to injuries than defense players who attack
former to stop them scoring touchdown (similar to ‘goal’
in soccer). Thus, there arises the need to analyse and
modify age-old rules which have been provoking the
players to adopt rigorous tackles. Concussions, referring
to severe brain injuries, have become an increasingly
common phenomenon in NFL exhibiting a steady increase
over the last six years peaking in an alarming concussion
rate of 16% for the last reported 2017/18 season. This
ultimately paved way for the C.T.E(Chronic Traumatic
Encephalopathy) [2], a neuro-degenerative brain disease
found in 96% of deceased ex-NFL players [5] and was
diagnosed as the reason for death of infamous pro-NFL
player, Kevin turner[6],which is generally caused by
repetitive blows to the head and rigorous blows and
tackles intentionally harming the health condition of the
player while players have also started to report the
immediate repeated concussion effects such as loss of
consciousness and memory as well making a long time to
recover [1].
Having acknowledged the link to C.T.E[8] from its
football practice, NFL has been trying to combat the
concussions via Neuro-intel’s real-time tracking [3] of
helmet blows to predict concussion risk rate (C.R.I) but
also announced to be receptive for comprehensive analysis
and suggestions to fix concussion protocol such that it
would help in reducing concussions and severe injuries
during plays. NFL has been amending its rules [9] and
modernizing its riskier plays [10] citing concussion risks
[7] continuously despite being a work in progress [11] as
last reported statistics showed a surge in injuries. Being
mired in handling concussions, the future of the NFL is at
stake with players’ safety on the line unless an extensive
concussion analysis mechanism is set [12] incorporating
statistical inferences from past data and different
perceptions from its followers regarding head injuries as
they’ve started to discuss widely [13].
The proposed overall research area is presented as the
go-to solution that boasts of a comprehensive analytical
mechanism to effectively address the aforementioned
concussion crisis and related issues by incorporating pre-
processed NFL punt-play datasets utilizing the available
movement vectors in order to assist in predictive analytical
perspective and to analyse positional variation and propose
safer formation pairs by highlighting dangerous pairs via
comprehensive mapping through simulation of plays.
The rest of the contents of the paper is organized as
follows. In section II, the literature survey dealing with
similar contemporary studies and research gap has been
analysed. Section III describes the different types of
experimental data that are used throughout this research.
Section IV goes on to detail the phases of the methodology
adopted. The findings of the research and their resultant
discussions have been described in Section V of this paper.
Finally, Section VI wraps up with the conclusion and future
works of this research topic.
II.	RELATED WORK
A.	Injury Predictive Modelling
Analysing the injury risk encountered by a player
during a particular season deriving their injury probabilities
to develop a predictive model to foresee whether a player
would be concussed or not in NBA [14] was presented to
aid in strategic decision making throughout the season.
NBA coverage, play-play data, individual workload were
the sources to be collected and scraped to drive through net
impact and incremental injury risk modelling utilizing the
sliding window to encompass both aggregation and
prediction time window to match against injury response
variable. K-fold cross- validation was used to validate
windows' performance whereas the Committee machine
model was used to train models. Random forest was opted
to counter the drawbacks of earlier drawbacks of Linear
regression and SVM algorithms.
Contrary to the earlier approach, a multi-dimensional
approach was opted to handle injury prediction in Soccer
optimizing GPS data accumulated from training sessions
and machine learning techniques [15] to predict whether a
player would be concussed in the immediate game/training
session he encounters. Traditional predictors were initially
tested upon features extracted from the tracked data to
address on its inefficiency in precision and recall. The
Decision tree was chosen as the predictive algorithm. Four
different datasets were constructed and the Exponential
weighted moving average(EWMA) was applied to all.
Recursive feature elimination with cross-validation
(RFECV) was used as dimension reduction technique to
realize optimal features. The model built was found to be
performing accordingly on feature set. Weekly update of
classifier was also found to increase the accuracy giving
higher precision.
A Hierarchical multi-layered predictive system to predict
injury risk among athletes considering workload assigned
was proposed[17] addressing the inadequacy and
inefficiency of the classic technique, ACWR as described
in the above-mentioned study[15], the two-layer
mechanism was proposed that encompasses injury-prone
players and impacting factors and an evolving injury
prediction model from that. KNN algorithm using
Euclidean distance was used to build a training and testing
database along with K-means classifier for benchmarking
to identify overlapping features and infer them to be less
impacting than the others. Output was validated with a
multi-dimensional classifier. Injury prediction model
implemented SVM classifier and output was normalized
and validated with K-fold cross-validation culminating in a
probabilistic prediction map tailored for individual player
specific features. Though SVM fairly separates prediction
margins, more suitable algorithms such as the Random
forest could be utilized here as put forward by the
aforementioned studies [14,16].
B.	Impact of positional arrangement on injuries
The Exploring movement similarity and deriving
patterns prospectively could prove to be a virtue in
predictive modelling. The proposed study that explores the
movement similarity analysis of moving objects [19]
utilizing the GIScience approach puts forward the
conceptual framework to infer similarities from the
movement trajectories of dynamic objects. The four-stage
methodology namely framework to capture the movement
of objects, defined classification to identify movement
patterns, feature extraction on movements and trajectory
similarity search and its evaluation were used in this
workflow. Since this study explores the trajectories and
mining patterns, it could be very well suited in the
trajectory analysis of players in a game and understand the
variation of their game formations as well that could be
impactful in the occurrence of injuries subsequently.
Analysing team formation in football was made more
intuitive with the approach opted i.e. Static Qualitative
Trajectory Calculus(QTC) [18] which was one of Spatio-
temporal methods [19] used to analyse the team formations
within a game or for a season. QTC employs comparison
approach by defining relative positions between players in
a qualitative manner that aligns well with the way player
arrange themselves on the playfield. QTC could be used in
describing team formations at different time by
constructing a QTC matrix at different time stamps. i.e. if
the number of players in a formation is identical at each
timestamp, the matrix would have the same dimensions
utilizing the distances between them. Similarities among
the generally defined team formations could well also be
calculated and interpreted. Inferring generally accepted
formations or assigning new arrangement as the formation
is made possible opting for QTC based approach or
building relevant matrix in the context of the higher
concussions yielding formations among the rest.
III.	EXPERIMENTAL DATASET
The dataset utilized in this study was provided by NFL
sourced from Kaggle platform. NFL Punt Analytics data
consisted of details corresponding to games played during
the 2016 and 2017 pre, regular and post seasons. This
dataset encompasses a rich dataset for the aforementioned
seasons describing season, games and plays on various
grounds with concussion information. The data describes
the player movement vectors on each play during a
specific game including x coordinates, y coordinates,
orientation, direction, distance covered and event.
IV.	METHODOLOGY
In this section, the methodology used for this study that
includes two different modules namely predictive
modelling, and formation analysis will be discussed in
detail.
A.	Predictive Modelling
1)	How did we deal and explore with the enormity
and the unbalanced nature of data?
Movement vectors of each player (22 players at a play)
that are retrieved from data set that had captured each
player’s x, y coordinates, initial direction, current direction,
event specified, and the distance covered individually
during that specific play along with other relevant columns
such as time, position and play description, were utilized to
analyse the influence of the predictors and to develop the
subsequent predictive model that could distinguish the
concussions among the rest. Since the data was quite large
(4GB) to be processed at once, proper file format was
explored and data chunking mechanism was opted to
retrieve predefined chunks of data at a time to speed up
process. Feather, which is a fast-disk format used in
efficient reading and writing of data frames using defined
chunk sizes, around 500000 records per chunk, was applied
in this context.19 chunks were obtained, and 2 chunks were
chosen to be utilized in the model building process yielding
around 1000000 records. Preliminary data exploration
including missing value handling and descriptive analysis
were done to understand the data. Training and testing data
were planned to be exported as Feather format for easy
reads. On preliminary execution, it was found that the data
for injury occurrence is quite low compared to the non-
injuries [96.8% of 0s and 3.2% of 1s] as illustrated in Fig.1.
Fig.1. Distribution of Injured Vs Non-injured in data
So, the need to resample the data was realized to deal
with the highly unbalanced data in order to avoid the under
sampling and oversampling issues that could arise later.
Despite the imbalanced nature of the data, more preferred
algorithm [14], Random Forest Classifier was applied to
realize the model score, 0.9681, which obviously pointed
out the over fitting issue. After inspecting ROC and PXR
curve, true positive rate is found to be 0. i.e. Injury
detection during an injury occurrence is hardly made
possible as indicated in Fig.2. (one-one detection is 0)
confusion metri×

2)	How did we apply rebalancing and distinguish the
distribution of data?
SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling
Technique) from imblearn was chosen as the ideal
synthetic balancing technique to rebalance the data to be
used later. SMOTE was applied for training data only; but
not for testing set since synthetic samples created with this
sampling technique aren’t real but synthetic which makes
them not viable for testing purposes but adequate for
training. After balancing the total data (1290306 records),
equal 0s and 1s were derived (645153 records each).
Subsequently PCA was used to explore and illustrate the
variance before and after applying SMOTE as described in
Fig.3.
Fig.3. Before and After SMOTE variance explained using PCA
3)	Was there any decisive advantage with more
features?
Generating new columns for the model was also tried
using the open source, Feature tools. About 25 features
were generated by considering combination of 5 features
namely x, y, o, dis and dir. and PCA was applied on the
generated feature matrix data.
Fig.4. Variance vs Number of Components
As per Fig.4., the optimal number of components was
found to be 5. i.e. by choosing 5 components, almost we
could explain the variance of the injury prediction.
Thereafter the feature matrix data was then split into
training and testing data in 2:1 ratio and then SMOTE was
applied upon it and Random Forest Classifier was applied
to yield the model score (0.698,0.502) which was lesser
than before suggesting the inefficiency and inadequacy of
the generated features. Since the performance of the model
wasn’t good, the feature generation process was not
successful as intended.
4)	Didn’t we apply a wide range of algorithms and
choose the best out of it?
Thereafter, Random Forest algorithm is applied with
hyper parameter tuning along with Grid-search with 5
folds. An accuracy of 0.639 and F1-score of 0.75 is realized
from this model.
Then, K-Nearest Neighbour was tried with hyper parameter
Fig.5. Value of K for KNN vs. Cross-Validated Accuracy
Even for the lowest value for K, i.e. 30, as described in
Fig.5., when applied, model was found to be over fitting
too much illustrating a score of 0.924.
SVM was also tried as well but that was slow on
performance since the data row records are large in number
and it was inferred that it didn’t fit this scenario.
XG-Boost was found to be outperforming aforementioned
algorithms when it was applied subsequently yielding the
better accuracy of lot ,0.7959, since it follows
implementation of gradient boosted decision trees that
could enhance existing decision trees applicable on similar
scenario [15].

Fig.7. ROC curve compared Before and After XGBoost modelling
As illustrated in Fig.7., the ROC curve at the initial stage
and the curve after XGBoost modelling explicitly differs in
the smoothness of curve highlighting the better
performance of the finalized model.

Fig.8. Classifier report after building XGBoost modelling
After parameter tuning the above XG-Boost based model,
an accuracy of 0.8618 and F1-score of 0.90 was realized
and subsequently was finalized as the optimal model score
to be applied for this context.
5)	What’s the novel data pipeline to put this model
into practice?
Fig.9.Proposed overall architecture for predictive modelling
Events of NFL plays that are captured from IoT sensors
would be transferred to Apache Kafka (In this scenario,
data provided by NFL) and subsequently they would be
published and subscribed as topics. The subscribed topics
would then be captured and taken to a Stream processor,
Faust, to derive insights. Flask API would thereafter be
utilized in getting requests from Stream processor and
inbuilt deployed predictive model would be generating
injury percentage corresponding to each play for every
millisecond.
B.	Analyse team formations and choose optimal
formations to mitigate injuries.
In this section, a novel methodology to find optimal
formation pairs in NFL plays is introduced to mitigate
injuries by systematically analysing the occurrence of
injuries and mapping them with the formations in plays. A
brief overview of formations in American football will be
given first to reinstate the conceptual flow followed by the
methodological steps undertaken to realize the objective of
this component in detail.
1)	Formations in American Football
In the NFL each play starts with two main initial
formations such as offensive team formation and defensive
team formation. There are 16 offensive formations and 15
defensive formations. The 16 offense team formations are
T formation, I formation, Single set back, Pro set, Single
wing, Wildcat formation, Double wing, Short punt
formation, Shotgun, Pistol, V formation, Wishbone,
Flexbone, Wing T, Empty backfield, Goal-line formation,
Kneel, Tackle spread. The 15 defense team formations are
4-3 defense, 6-1 defense, 3-4 defense, 2-5 defense, 4-4
defense, 5-3 defense, 6-2 defense, 38 defense (split
middle), 46 defense (forty-six), 5-2 defense, Seven-man
line defense, Nickel formation, Dime formation, Quarter
and half-dollar formations (prevent defense), Other
variants[20]
2)	Systematic workflow
There are three steps to be adopted to achieve the
objective of obtaining optimal formation pairs. Simulating
the players’ movement and defining formations for each
play, Building FP(Formation-Play) matrix and finally
finding the optimal formation pairs to mitigate injury. The
workflow then individually elaborates the methodology
adopted by detailing into each subcomponent.
a)	Simulate the players’ movement and define
formations for each play
The dataset has x, y coordinates with the exact time for
22 players in each play. Each play is about 1 minute of
duration. An intuitive visualization tool, Power BI, which
provides functionalities to transform the Spatio-temporal
data into simulated result, is utilized as the simulator in this
context. The snapshot of player positions is taken from the
simulated result when the play starts. Then the offensive
and defensive formations are identified by comparing with
predefined formations mentioned above.
b)	Build FP (Formation Play) matrix
FP matrix is a matrix of Formation Play that specifies
the probability of concussed and non-concussed play
against offensive and defensive pairs. The probability of
occurrence range is between 0 to 1.
c)	Find optimal formation to mitigate injury
In this final step, in order to find optimal formation
pairs, the probability of non-concussion should be
maximum and the probability of concussion has to be
minimal. The significance of formation pairs is measured
by how often the formation pairs are used. Hence, optimal
formation pairs as well as dangerous set of pairs can be
identified adopting the proposed flow of steps.
V.	RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Since predictive modelling is one of the primary
components of the proposed research, the results of the
predictive modelling are well-assessed. On application of
different algorithms such as Random-forest, SVM and
KNN, different problems were encountered. SVM was
awful in performance requiring lots of time whereas
Random forest displayed poor scores. KNN, despite
depicting better accuracy score of the lot, wasn’t chosen to
be fitting the narrative illustrating the impending concern
for overfitting issues. XGBoost algorithm was chosen as
the appropriate model to be applied adequately displaying
higher scores without overfitting concerns.

recall	0.64	0.92	0.86
Accuracy-Score	0.639	0.924	0.861
Fig.10. Different Algorithms applied with respective model scores.
Since injury predictive mechanism relies on the sensitivity
(the proportion of detecting the injured/concussed players
correctly among those who’re injured actually), due care
should be taken to maximize the sensitivity along with
model score by increasing the volume of historical data and
training data on the Big Data Machine Learning platform.
The proposed injury predictive model works as an injury
predictor with fixed time stamp identifying the concussions
occurred time by providing an injury occurring percentage
to each play. Defining a threshold to the aforementioned
injury percentage outputs by model, we could distinguish
the awful concussions from the rest of the injuries
subsequently proving beneficial in providing pre-attention
and prevention to players succumbing to dangerous injuries
making the game safer.
Kafka is proposed as the message queue for streaming data
and the player movement vectors will be captured
accordingly. Through Faust, a Stream processor library to
port ideas from Kafka to python, the movements of 22
players in a play is input to the model. Utilizing the batch
window mechanism, fixed, non-overlapping time intervals,
Flask, micro web framework, is used to acquire requests
and deliver predictions on each millisecond timestamp.
This proposed architecture could very well be applied in
any injury predictive mechanism realizing the conceptual
framework behind its application.
In the formation analysis module, the following set of
results were derived and the need to handle and tweak the
rules corresponding to these formation pairs were realized.
The top 10 optimal formation pairs are illustrated in Fig.11
and the top 10 risky formation pairs are illustrated in

VI.	CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS
Throughout this research study, it is proven that the
necessity to build a comprehensive injury predictive
mechanism to mitigate injuries dealing with multiple
sources and different components that could redefine the
way that the injury control mechanism to be performed in
the near future. The proposed study highlights the benefits
to be yielded having roots implanted in different
components namely exploring and pre-processing data,
predictive modelling, formation analysis using simulation
& FP-matrix. Injury predictive modelling details into
extensive architecture to be followed in predicting injury
percentage from streaming feeds where as dangerous
formation pairs yielding higher concussion rate are mined
and chosen through simulation and mapped then to FP
matrix highlighting the need for authorities to relook into it
and regulate. Experimental results have validated the
theoretical framework specified. This proposed workflow
could be utilized for any games in developing their injury
predictive mechanism strengthening their existing injury
protocol by only tweaking little bit thus proving to be an
effective solution wherever applicable. Just in the case of
Srilankan context, National Rugby team is unable to cope
with the withdrawal of players due to injury fears in the
absence of proper injury control mechanism and
protocols[21,22].Thus, our proposed comprehensive
solution could very well be applied in similar contexts and
could be developed for different concussing games
accordingly.
Other than this, on the technical context, the future works
could shed light upon finding proper data capturing
mechanism to regulate inputs by introducing IoT concepts
into existing mechanism and enhance the modelling
approach by trying out multiple classification algorithms.
Also, due care should be put in using optimization
algorithms like genetic algorithms to derive optimal
formation pairs and they might yield better results than
current context. Automating the offensive and defensive
formation classification to reduce the time and cost would
be another future work that would significantly enhance the
value of the solution.
