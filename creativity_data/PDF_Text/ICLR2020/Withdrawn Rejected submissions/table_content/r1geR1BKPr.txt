Table A: Model Architectures. “CONV k w × h+s” represents a 2D convolutional layer with k filtersof size w × h using a stride of s in both dimensions. “MAX-POOL w × h+s” represents a 2D maxpooling layer with kernel size w × h using a stride of s in both dimensions. “FC n” = fully connectedlayer with n outputs. All activation functions are Tanh and last fully connected layers do not haveactivation functions. The number of neurons on the last fully connected layer is determined by thenumber of classes in the task.
Table B: The list of test sentences and pretraining sentences with the largest and the smallest absoluteinfluence function score values in our subset of pretraining data. The subset consists of 1000 randomsentences from one-billion-word, which is used to pretrained ELMo embedding.
