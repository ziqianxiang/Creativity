Table 1: Target-domain accuracy on 8 digit WUDA tasks (SYNDrMNIST). Bold value represents the highestaccuracy in each row.
Table 2: Target-domain accuracy on 3 real-world WUDA tasks. The source domain is the Bing dataset thatcontains noisy information from the Internet. Bold value represents the highest accuracy in each row.
Table 3: Target-domain accuracy on 2 UDA tasks. Bold value represents the highest accuracy in each row.
Table 4: Results of ablation study. Average target-domain accuracy on 8 simulated digit WUDA tasks (Digit),24 simulated human-sentiment WUDA tasks (Sentiment) and 3 real-world WUDA tasks (Real-world). Boldvalue represents the highest accuracy in each row.
Table 5: Target-domain accuracy on 12 human-sentiment WUDA tasks with the 20% noise rate. Bold valuesmean the highest values in each row.
Table 6: Target-domain accuracy on 12 human-sentiment WUDA tasks with the 45% noise rate. Bold valuesmean the highest values in each row.
