Table 1: Comparison of test negative log likelihood using importance sampling (nats)Rectangular Gaussian Gaussianlattice lattice VAE VAE94.45	89.35	88.85-The results of our experiments can be seen in Figure 3, where we illustrate the negative log likelihoodof the validation set as a function of the number of training epochs. As seen, the performance ofthe rectangular lattice VAE is not as good as that of either of the two Gaussian VAEs, which isexpected; as described in this article, simpler lattices wonâ€™t perform as well as high dimensionalgood lattices. Notice however that the performance of the rectangular lattice is quite competitive andfurthermore, notice that the performance of the two Gaussian VAEs are rather close to each other.
