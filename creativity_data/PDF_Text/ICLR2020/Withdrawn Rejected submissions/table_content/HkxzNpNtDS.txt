Table 1: Comparison of agent performance under different training strategies. Note that the single-task RCM model is independently trained and tested on VLN or NDH tasks.
Table 2: Comparison of agent performance when trained separately vs. jointly on VLN and NDH.
Table 3: Comparison of agent performance when language instructions are encoded by separate vs.
Table 4: Environment-agnostic versus environment-aware learning.
Table 5: Average agent progress towards goalroom when trained using different rewards.
Table 6: Average agent progress towards goal room when trained using different rewards and mixedsupervision strategy.
