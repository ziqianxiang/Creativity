Table 1: Comparison with other strict quantization methods on top-1 and top-5 accuracy for Ima-geNet. W/A indicates the quantization bitwidths for weights and activations, respectively. 32/32indicates full-precision models.
Table 2: Full-precision (FP) and quantized (Q) top-1 accuracy for 4-bit weights and activations inResNet-18 on ImageNet. Components of GQ-Net are progressively applied. The first row indicatesthe vanilla setting. A check mark in column “Alt {W, θ}'' means alternatingly optimizing W and θ.
