Table 1: Examples of objects and units for each dataset. Note that the object and unit need notcorrespond.
Table 2: Results obtained from linear and random forest regressors. Note that Corr. Coef. indicatesPearson’s correlation coefficient and MAE is mean absolute error(RF) regressor for comparison. In the RF, the number of decision trees was set to 10;in ARD, the parameters were set to alpha1=1e-06, alpha2=1e-06, lambda1=1e-06, andlambda2=1e-06. The LR input will be normalized before regression by subtracting themean and dividing by the l2-norm. After average numerical values were obtained from10 subjects, we conducted a 10-fold cross validation. To examine performances of thoseregressors, we use the mean absolute error (MAE) and the Pearson’s correlation coefficient.
Table 3: Mean absolute error results for 60 objects with 3 different fixed units obtained from linearand random forest regressors with unit on the left (Yen, cm, and g). Pearson’s correlation coefficientresults on the right. Bold digits in each row indicate higher performance.
