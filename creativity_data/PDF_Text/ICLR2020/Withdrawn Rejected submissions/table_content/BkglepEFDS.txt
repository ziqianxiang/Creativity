Table 1: Performance results in terms of false negative rate (FNR), false positive rate (FPR), Recall,Precision and F1-measure of VulDeePecker (VULD), MMD, D2GAN, DIRT-T, DDAN and Dual-GD-DDAN for predicting vulnerable and non-vulnerable code functions on the testing set of thetarget domain (Best performance in bold).
Table 2: Accuracies obtained by the DDAN and Dual-GD-DDAN methods when predicting vulner-able and non-vulnerable code functions on the source and target domains. Note that tr src, ts tar, trtar, ts src, and acc gap are the shorthands of train source, test target, train target, test source, andaccuracy gap respectively. For the accuracy gap, a smaller value is better.
Table 3: Performance results in terms of false negative rate (FNR), false positive rate (FPR), Recall,Precision and F1-measure of SCDAN and Dual-GD-SDDAN for predicting vulnerable and non-vulnerable code functions on the testing set of the target domain (Best performance in bold).
