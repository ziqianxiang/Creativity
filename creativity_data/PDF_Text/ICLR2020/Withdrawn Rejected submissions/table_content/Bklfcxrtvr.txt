Table 1: Single step prediction error with a single object. We show prediction error using differentnumber of views as inputs.
Table 2: Single step prediction error with multiple objects. We evaluate the models with fingertipsof various shape.
Table 3: Single step prediction error with a single object with detected objects. We show predictionerror using different number of views as inputs, using object pose estimated by the proposed 3Dobject detector.
Table 4: Success rate for pushing objects to target 3D locations.
