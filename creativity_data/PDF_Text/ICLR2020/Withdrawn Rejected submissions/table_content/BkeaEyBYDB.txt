Table 1: EMNIST-62 performance for 5 and 20 clients per communication round.
Table 2: Test performance on clients seen and unseen during FL-trainingFinally, we look at the performance of fine tuned models discussed above on both train and testclients. Table 2 shows that if we only looked at the initial accuracy, basic ML principles would3The same model was used as the starting point for fine tuning in Figure 2.
