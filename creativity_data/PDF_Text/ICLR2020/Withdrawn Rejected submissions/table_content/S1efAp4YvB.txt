Table 1: F1-score of each model on the datasets KTH Actions and Something-something.
Table 2: Statistics for the temporal masks and Grad-CAM maps on a subset of the Something-something validation set (791 samples). The analysis was run on 150 clips each (fewer if there werenot 150 samples of that class in the validation set) of the seven classes presented in this section. The’blobs’ were computed per frame, using the blob detection tool from OpenCV (Bradski (2000)).
Table 3: Hyperparameters used for training the two models on each dataset.
Table 4: Hyperparameters used for optimizing the temporal mask.
