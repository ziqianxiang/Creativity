Table 3: FID scores for CIFAR using SN-GAN as the batch-size is progressively doubled. The FIDscore is calculated using 50, 000 generated samples from the generator.
Table 4: FID scores for LSUN using SAGAN as the batch-size is progressively doubled. The FIDscore is calculated using 50, 000 generated samples from the generator. All experiments were runon the ‘outdoor church’ subset of the dataset.
Table 5: Timing to perform 50 gradient updates for SN-GAN with and without Core-sets. The timeis measured in seconds. All the experiments were performed on a single NVIDIA Titan-XP GPU.
Table 6: FID scores for CIFAR using SN-GAN. The experiment list is: A = Training an SN-GAN, B= Core-set selection directly on the images, C = Core-set applied directly on Inception embeddingswithout a random projection, D = Core-set applied only on the prior distribution, E = Core-setapplied only on target distribution.
Table 7: FID scores for CIFAR using SN-GAN. Each of the experiment shows a different pair ofover-sampling factors for the prior and target distributions. The factors are listed as: sampling factorfor prior distribution × sampling factor for target distribution. A = 2 × 2; B = 2 × 4; C = 4 × 2; D =4 × 4;E=8 × 4;F=4 × 8; G=8 × 8;H= 16 × 16;I=32 × 32believe that when the sampling factors are set too high, the algorithm becomes sensitive to outliers.
