Table 1: Validation IOU scores from three methods using similar model architectures with simi-lar and different number of parameters. Image Evolution represents evolution from an image to adistance map and Contour Evolution represents refinement of an initial contour.
Table 2: Scores for different methods and models with 15, 5 and 41 million parameters. All scoresare computed on binary maps produced by thresholding the ground truth saliency maps at 0.
Table 3: FÎ² Scores. PASCAL-S scores are computed on binary maps produced by thresholding theground truth saliency maps at 0.5.
