Table 1: Mean episode returns as reported in baselines SimPLe (Kaiser et al., 2019) and data-efficientRainbow (van Hasselt et al., 2019), versus our agents, on 26 Atari games. ’Denoised’ is the NoisyNetablation of Rainbow; ’TRL’ shows the performance of the data-efficient Rainbow with tensor regres-sion layers substituted for linear ones.
Table 2: Mean episode returns of our low-rank agents with second-order optimization and scattering.
Table 3: Our additional, architecture-specific hyperparameters.
Table 4: Data-efficient Rainbow agent hyperparameters, as per van Hasselt et al. (2019).
Table 5: Standard deviations across seeds for runs presented Table 1.
Table 6: Standard deviations across seeds for runs presented Table 2.
