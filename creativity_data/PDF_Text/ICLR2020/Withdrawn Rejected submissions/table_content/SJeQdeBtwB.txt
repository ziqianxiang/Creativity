Table 2: F1-Scores of baseline models6	ConclusionIn this paper we showed how GANs can be effectively used for anomaly detection in time seriesdata. We proposed a cycle-consistent GAN architecture that allows the encoding and decoding oftime series. We further proposed new reconstruction error measures based on local similarities thatoutperform the point-wise reconstruction. We have also shown that a combination of the Criticoutput and the reconstruction error can help to reduce the number of false positives, as well as mightincrease the number of true positives. This is due to the more robust anomaly scores that our methodis providing, where we effectively increase the distance between the scores of anomalous and non-anomalous regions. As a result, the anomaly scores are more robust and allow a better detection ofanomalous time series sequences.

We then use a point-wise predictionerror between the predicted and the observed time step to identify outliers. The model is similar tothe one used by Hundman et al. (2018).
