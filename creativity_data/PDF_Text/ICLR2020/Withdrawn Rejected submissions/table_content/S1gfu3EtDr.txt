Table 1: Comparison of key features of related worksmap for control in an environment. Visual Question Answering in Interactive Environments Gordonet al. (2018) creates semantic maps from 3D observations for planning and question answering and isapplied in a discrete state space.
Table 2: Results of the baseline and EgoMap architectures trained on four scenarios for 1.2 Benvironment steps. We show the mean and std. of the final agent performance, evaluated for threeindependent experiments on a held-out testing set of scenario configurations.
