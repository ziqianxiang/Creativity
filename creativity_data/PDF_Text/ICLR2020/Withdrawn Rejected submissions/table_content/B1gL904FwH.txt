To measure its impact on the clustering performance of SANECS, we vary λ in{0, 10-6, 10-3, 10-1, 100, 101, 103}. The performances in terms of accuracy (Acc), normalizedmutual information (NMI) and adjusted rand index are depicted in Figure 4; a Acc, NMI orARI corresponds to a better clustering result. First we note that with λ = 0 we rely only onminB,Q M - BQ>2s.t. B>B = I. In this case, we observe poor results in terms of qualityof clustering, this leads to show the impact of the second term in (3). This quality increases accord-ing to λ and we get better performance on all datasets with small values of λ. Around 10-2, it isworthy to note that the clustering result is stable and less sensitive to λ. However, the performanceof SANEC degrades sharply for λ greater than 10, this can be explained by the fact that the initializa-tion of G which is random and can often be far from the real solution. Through, many experimentson the three datasets and others not reported here, we choose to take λ = 10-2.
