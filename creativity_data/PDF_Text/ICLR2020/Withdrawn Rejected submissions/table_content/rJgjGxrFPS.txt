Table 1: Single-view 3D reconstruction results on ShapeNet. We observe that compared to otherstate-of-the-art learning based methods eigenSDF outperforms in normal consistency and Chamferdistance. Finetuning can further improve this result. Compare to training a linear autoencoder orjust finetuning the performance is substantially better, showing that eigen decomposition obtainsbest results.
