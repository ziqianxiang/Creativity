Table 1: We show the defense models that are incorporated into our benchmark for adversarial robustness evaluation. We also show the defensetype and accuracy (%) on clean data of each method. The accuracy is re-calculated by ourselves. More details about their model architecturesare shown in Appendix B.
Table 2: We show the attack methods that are implemented in our benchmark for adversarial robustness evaluation. We also show the adver-saryâ€™s knowledge, goals, capability, and distance metrics of each attack method.
Table 3: We show the network architecture of each defense model. Defenses based on input transformations use the baseline natural models asthe backbone classifiers. DeepDefense uses a very simple 5-layer CNN. FD modifies a ResNet-152 architecture with the proposed denoisinglayers. ADP ensembles the predictions of 3 ResNet-110 models. Convex uses a ResNet model with architecture provided in Wong et al. (2018).
