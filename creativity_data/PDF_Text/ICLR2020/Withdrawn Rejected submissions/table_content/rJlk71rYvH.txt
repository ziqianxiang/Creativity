Table 1: MiniPacMan environment: Mean squared error (MSE) of predicted video frames at selectedtimestep horizons H . Right Column: Average score of the model-predictive control agent on 100games. Ablation is trained with the standard reconstruction loss: each other network is trained withone of the proposed regularizations.
Table 2: StarIntruders environment: Per-episode cumulative reward for training and test tasks, averageof 10 episodes. The same model-predictive control (MPC) agent is applied using models trained withthe standard reconstruction loss, and models trained with each proposed regularization. A model-freemethod, Rainbow is included for comparison.
