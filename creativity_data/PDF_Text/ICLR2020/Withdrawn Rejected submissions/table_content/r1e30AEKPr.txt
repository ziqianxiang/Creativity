Therecent model RotatE and DihEdral achieved comparable results. The WN18RR dataset removes theinversion relations from WN18, left only 11 relations and most of them are symmetry patterns. Wecan see from Table 5, the DihEdral model and SU2E model performed well on this dataset due totheir nonabelian nature. Besides, as DihEdral uses a discrete parametrization in relation embedding,it may benefit in special cases where the number of relations is extremely small (11 in this task).
