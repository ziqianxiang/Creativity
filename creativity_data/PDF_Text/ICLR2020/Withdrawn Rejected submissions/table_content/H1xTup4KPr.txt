Table 1: Number of unique lesions extracted for each set of the nCAMELYON data for differen O2Iratios and crop sizes.
Table 2: Number of crops extracted for each set of the nCAMELYON data for differen O2I ratios andcrop sizes. Note that the dataset is balanced (e. g. 50% are positive images and 50% are negative).
Table 3: Schematic of the architecture of the different topological embedding encoders used in thispaper.  The operations and their corresponding parameters of the residual blocks are denoted inbrackets. The first block within each section performs downsampling using convolutions with stride 2.
