Table 1: Datasets used for evaluation of our proposed method, observations are the number ofobservations (rows) in the dataset. Wide variety of datasets are used to simulate real-world clinicalscenarios.
Table 2: Median Survival with associated confidence intervals and the test statistic for comparingtwo survival distributions. is the privacy budget for our method and “No privacy” are the resultsfrom the non-noisy model. Our method provides “close” estimates to the original non-noisy values.
