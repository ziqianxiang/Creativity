Table 1: Empirical analysis of model architecture runtime performance: Average wall-clock timeand standard deviation of evaluating (forward pass) and updating (backward pass) the three modelson traffic control and Atari. Unroll in the recurrent models indicates the length of the sequence ofexperiences that is used to update the model. One update involves processing an entire mini-batchof experiences. The test was run on an Intel Xeon CPU E5-2660 v4.
