Table 1: Neural network structure for the policies of the main agent. FC stands for Fully Connectedlayer. Inside the parentheses is indicated how many units were used, and the activation function forthat layer.
Table 2: Number of policies for the main agent for each Algorithm/Environment pair. In parenthesisis shown the total number of episodes taken.
Table 3: Training settings for the policies of the main agent. When using DDPG we sometimes useddifferent parameters for the actor and the critic. In that case in the table are shown 2 parameters, thefirst one for the actor, the second one for the critic.
Table 4: Training settings for the attacker.
