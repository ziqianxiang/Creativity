Table 1: Statistics for the datasets we used in our experiments. “#Predictors” refers to the total number ofpredictors in the dataset, “Average Redundancy” refers to the average number of predictions provided for eachinstance, “Average Accuracy” refers to the average predictor accuracy, and “Random Accuracy” refers to the accuracyobtained of a completely random predictor.
Table 2: Accuracy across varying levels of redundancy, for all datasets we used in our experiments. For eachexperiment, we report mean accuracy and standard error over 50 runs from random initializations. The bestresults are shown in red color (the best results within each sub-group are shown in bold). The methods markedwith a “?” are used for the ablation study of Section 4.3.
