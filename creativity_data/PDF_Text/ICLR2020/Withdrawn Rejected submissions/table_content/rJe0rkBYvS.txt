From apractical standpoint, the control variates and data aggregation enable the estimation/training processto be more stable and data-efficient at no expense of increased computational complexity. Froman analytical standpoint, a promising progress is made to reduce the rate gap of KMM towards theparametric when the regression function lies in range spaces outside of RKHS. For future work, notethe canonical rate is still not achieved and it remains unclear the suitable tool to improve the ratefurther, if possible. Moreover, besides the regularized empirical regression function in RKHS, theeligibility and effectiveness of other estimated regression functions also require rigorous analysis.
