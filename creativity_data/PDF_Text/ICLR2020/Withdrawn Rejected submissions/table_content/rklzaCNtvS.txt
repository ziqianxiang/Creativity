Table 1: ROUGE F1 scores on the test set. Our hierarchical (Hier-NSE) model outperform previoushierarchical and pointer-generator models. Hier-NSE-factor is the factored model and Hier-NSE-SCis the self-critic model.
Table 2: Performance of various NSE models on CNN/Daily Mail corpus. Please note that the datais not factored here.
Table 3:	Sample outputs for both non-factored and factored input articles. While factoring, eachsurface word is augmented with lemma and PoS tag separated by |.
Table 4:	Sample outputs for both non-factored and factored input articles. While factoring, eachsurface word is augmented with lemma and PoS tag separated by |.
