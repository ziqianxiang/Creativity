Table 1: Confirmation bias alleviation using mixup and a minimum number of k labeled samplesper mini-batch. Left: Validation error for naive pseudo-labeling without mixup (C), mixup (M), andalternatives with minimum k. Right: Study of the effect of k on the validation error.
Table 2: Validation error across architectures is stabilized using dropout p and data augmentation (A).
Table 3:  Test error in CIFAR-10/100 and SVHN for the proposed approach using the 13-CNNnetwork. (*) denotes that we have run the algorithm. Bold indicates lowest error. We report averageand standard deviation of 3 runs with different labeled/unlabeled splits.
Table 4:  Test error in Mini-ImageNet (left) and CIFAR-10 with few labeled samples (right).  (*)denotes that we have run the algorithm. Bold indicates lowest error. We report average and standarddeviation of 3 runs with different labeled/unlabeled splits.
Table 5: Validation error for different values of the α parameter from Mixup. Bold indicates lowesterror. Underlined values indicate the results of the configuration used.
Table 6: Validation error for different values of λA and λH . Bold indicates lowest error. Underlinedvalues indicate the results of the configuration used.
Table 7: Test error in SVHN for the proposed approach using the 13-CNN network. (*) denotes thatwe have run the algorithm. Bold indicates lowest error. We report average and standard deviation of3 runs with different labeled/unlabeled splits.
