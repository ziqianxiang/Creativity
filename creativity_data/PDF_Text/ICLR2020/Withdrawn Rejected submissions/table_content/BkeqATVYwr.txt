Table 1: Summary of datasets, the Features column is relevant to some of the baselines not GAPGiven a source node s, we seek to learn multiple context-sensitive embeddings of s with respect toa target node t it is paired with. In principle one can learn using all pairs of nodes, however that isnot scalable, and hence we restrict learning between pairs in E.
Table 2: Conifguration of GapThe first two datasets have features (documents) associated to nodes. For Cora, abstract of papersand Zhihu user posts. Some of the baselines, discussed beneath, require textual information, andhence they consume the aforementioned features. The Email dataset has ground-truth communityassignment for nodes based on a person’s affiliation to one of the 42 departments.

Table 7: AUC resUlts for the variants of Gap Using the Cora and Email datasets10Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 20201.	First we assume order is important in the neighborhood of nodes based on neighbors simi-larity with the current node. We use a topological feature to induce order, which is commonneighbors. This baseline is referred to as GapCn and uses the exact apn model to capture“order”.
