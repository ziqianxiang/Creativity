Table 1: Effectiveness of CRD against OPA. The first column lists the accuracy of the network onoriginal images and the OPA Acc. column shows the network’s accuracy on adversarial images. TheIHT. Acc. column shows the accuracy of the network on images reconstructed using IHT.
Table 2: The tavg column lists the average adversarial budget for each attack. The Orig. Acc columnlists the accuracy of the network on original test inputs, the Acc. columns under C&W `0 andJSMA list network accuracy on adversarial inputs. The IHT Acc. and the BP Acc. columns list theaccuracy of the network on inputs that have been corrected using IHT and BP respectively.
Table 3: The 也叫 column lists the average '2-norm of the attack vector. The Orig. Acc column liststhe accuracy of the network on original test inputs, while the Acc. columns under C&W `2 and DFcolumns report network accuracy on adversarial inputs. BP Acc. columns lists the accuracy of thenetwork on inputs reconstructed using BP.
Table 4: The '∞avg column lists the '∞-norm of each attack vector, Orig. Acc. and BIM Acc.
Table 5: Network architecture used for MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets in Section 4.1 andSection 4.2. The first four layers use ReLU activations while the last layer uses a softmax activation.
