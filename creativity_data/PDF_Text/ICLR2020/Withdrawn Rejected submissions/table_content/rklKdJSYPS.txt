Table 1: Test error rates (%) of different methods on CIFAR-10. Random horizontal flipping andrandom translation are used to augment training data. Results for methods in the first block (i.e.,Supervised, Supervised (Mixup), and Supervised (Manifold Mixup)) are duplicated from Vermaet al. (2019). Results of AdvMixup are averaged over 3 runs.
Table 2: Test error rates (%) of different methods on SVHN. Random translation is used to augmenttraining data. Results for methods in the first block (i.e., Supervised, Supervised (Mixup), andSupervised (Manifold Mixup)) are duplicated from Verma et al. (2019). Results for AdvMixup areaveraged over 3 runs.
Table 3: Test error rates (%) of different ablated versions on CIFAR-10. Random horizontal flippingand random translation are used to augment training data. Results are averaged over 3 runs.
