Table 1: The prediction accuracy for the breadth-first layout design flow. The F1 score (%) forretrieving parent-child pairs, next item accuracy (%), and Edit distances are calculated given 10%,50% and 80% of the ground-truth tree as the partial tree. For F1 and Next Item Accuracy, the largeris the better, while for Edit Distance, the smaller the better.
Table 2: The prediction accuracy for the depth-first layout design flow. The F1 score (%), next itemaccuracy (%), and Edit distances are calculated given 10%, 50% and 80% of the ground-truth tree.
Table 3: The prediction accuracy for the breadth-first layout design flow with a random spatialordering. The F1 score (%) for retrieving parent-child pairs, next item accuracy (%), and Editdistances are calculated given 10%, 50% and 80% of the ground-truth tree as the partial tree. For F1and Next Item Accuracy, the larger is the better, while for Edit Distance, the smaller the better.
