Table 1: Performance scores for the three task settings inViZDoom evaluated over 6 independent runs. Overall, onlyour approach and ‘RND’ could converge to 100% under allthe settings. Our method on average converges 2.0x as fast as‘RND’ and 3.1x as fast as ‘ICM’ in ViZDoom domains.
Table 2: The approximated environment steps taken by each algorithm to reach its convergencestandard under each task setting. Notably, our proposed algorithm could achieve an average speed upof 3.1x compared to ‘ICM’, and 2.0x compared to ‘RND’.
