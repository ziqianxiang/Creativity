Table 1: The average meansquared error (MSE) over eachof the paths in Figure 3 showingthat our approximation schemewell-approximates the true value-profile.
Table 2:	The average meansquared error (MSE) over each ofthe paths in Figure 9. As the prioris further away from the true valueof k = 0.05, the error increases.
Table 3:	The average meansquared error (MSE) over eachof the paths in Figure 10 whenthe underlying hazard is drawn ac-cording to a uniform distribution.
Table 4: Different hazard priors H = p(λ) can be alternatively expressed through weighting ex-ponential discount functions γt by w(γ). This table matches different hazard distributions to theirassociated discounting function and the weighting function per Lemma 3.1. The typical case in RLis a Dirac Delta Prior over hazard rate δ(λ - k). We only show this in detail for completeness; onewould not follow such a convoluted path to arrive back at an exponential discount but this approachholds for richer priors. The derivations can be found in the Appendix F.
