Table 1: Accuracy of hierarchical classifications for test and generated (Gen.) images.
Table 2: mAP results of retrieval for compared methods in different semantic levels.
Table 3: Hierarchical prediction performance for seen test set and unseen leaf-level categories.
Table 4: Hierarchical prediction performance of models trained on seen dateset and evaluated onunseen dataset.
Table 5: Accuracy of hierarchical classifications for real and generated images by baselines andour full method in different semantic levels on CelebA. w/o reconfea, reconimg, local denote HDNtrained without the feature reconstruction, image reconstruction or local classification loss, respec-tively. Real means the result of real images in test set.
Table 6: Comparisons of image quality of baselines and HDN. IS and FID measure the fidelity, andLPIPS measures the diversity of images. For IS and LPIPS, larger is better. For FID, lower is better.
