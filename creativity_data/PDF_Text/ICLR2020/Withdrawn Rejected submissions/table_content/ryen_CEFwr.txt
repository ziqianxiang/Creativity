Table 1: Evaluation of landmark accuracy on Human3.6M 1a and BBC Pose 1b. Human3.6M erroris normalized by image dimensions. For BBC Pose, we report the percentage of annotated keypointspredicted within a 6-pixel radius of the ground truth.
Table 2: Landmark evaluation onMAFL using 10 landmarks. Predic-tion error is scaled by inter-ocular dis-tance. While we can only use Ttps tosample pose perturbations on this non-video dataset, we still see strong im-provements over the baseline. We alsoablate the use of the masks M in Ours(No Mask), where no masks are pre-dieted and the predicted Xfg and Xbgare directly elementwise-added.
