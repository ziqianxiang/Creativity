Table 1: Cumulative reward of TS algorithmS on 10 real world data SetS. The context dim d and theSize of the action Space A are reported for each data Set. The mean reSult and Standard deviation ofeach algorithm iS reported for 50 runS.
Table 2: Cumulative reward on the wheel banditAppendix B	AnalysisB.1 Derivation of auxiliary results for the sanity checkThe realizability assumption gives Us a method to compute μo for the new features:μT = (μmd)T Enold (En)T = ((E 机(E 沁)T)-i(e 沁)T Rm) En(Enold)-1.	⑺Similarly, using the analytically solution to the SDP, we getEφn(Φ0)-1(Eφn)T =Eφnold(Φomld)-1(Eφnold)T,	(8)Using Eq. (7) and Eq. (8) and rearranging we get thatφ0μo =n n -1 m= Eφ (Eφold)	Eφold Rm= (Aφ bn)(Aφold bn)	Aφold bm Rm= Aφbmb-m1Aφ-o1ldAφoldbmRm= Aφbm Rm = Eφm Rm .
