Table 1: Floor positioning results averaged over 1,000 test episodes, including the success rate, themean value and the standard deviation of numbers of steps.
Table 2: Experimental results on the 3D navigation task. Results are averaged over 100 episodes after2,000 episodes of training. Methods With a filter are trained (tested) With 100 (400) particles.
