Table 1: Algorithm complexity per iterationALGORITHM	COMPLEXrTYHungarian EM	SN5d2K-means	SN2dGMM	SN2d215Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2020A.6 League-Wide AnalysisWe ran our formation discovery and alignment algorithm on every team-game-period combinationof an entire season. This analysis previously took upwards of 20 minutes to process a game underthe original approach, but now can be run in less than 10 seconds a game.
