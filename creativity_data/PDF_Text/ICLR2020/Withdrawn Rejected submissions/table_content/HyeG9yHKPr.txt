Table 1: Comparison between noncausal partial model and the proposed architecture. The shaded cells indicatethe key differences in architectures.
Table 2: Models and their properties.
Table 3: Hyper-parameters used. Each reported experiment was repeated at least 5 times with different randomseeds.
Table 4: Different types of model rollouts considered. Blue cells indicate variables that require interaction withthe real environment, depending on the agent’s state st . Orange cells indicate variables that can be computedfrom the model’s state ht .
