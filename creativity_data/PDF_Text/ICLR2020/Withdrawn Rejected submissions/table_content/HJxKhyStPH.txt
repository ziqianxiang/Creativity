Table 1: Region of truth and falsity.
Table 2: Link prediction results. Rows 1-8: Translation-based models with no injected relationpatterns. Rows 9-13: basic models with no injected relation patterns. Rows 14-18: models whichencode relation patterns. Results labeled with *, + and ++ are taken from (Zhou et al., 2017a),(Ebisu & Ichise, 2019) and (Akrami et al., 2018) respectively, while the rest are taken from originalpapers/code. Dashes: results could not be obtained.

Table 4: Link Prediction results. RPTransComPlEx4(w grounding) is trained on triPles and therelation Patterns which are grounded. RPTransComPlEx4(w/o grounding) is trained on triPles andthe relation Patterns which are not grounded.
Table 5: Link prediction results. Rows 1-4: TransE trained using condition (a), (b), (c)(with the loss4) and (c)(with the RotatE loss) with no injected relation patterns. Rows 5-8 TransComplEx trainedusing condition (a), (b), (c)(with the loss 4) and (c)(with the RotatE loss) with no injected relationpatterns. Rows 9-10: RotatE trained using condition (c)(with the loss 4) and (c)(with the RotatEloss) with no injected relation patterns.
