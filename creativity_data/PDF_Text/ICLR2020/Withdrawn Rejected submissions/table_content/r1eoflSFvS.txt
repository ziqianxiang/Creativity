Table 1: The overall results compared with different methods on CIFAR-10. We compare four dif-ferent neural network: VGG-16, ResNet-56, ResNet-110, DenseNet-40. Acc gain is the absoluteerror of the percentage of accuracy compared to each algorithmâ€™ own baseline for relatively faircomparison. Parameters and FLOPs represent the total parameters of the network model and thesum of addition and multiplication operations. Pruned and Reduced represent the percentage of pa-rameter reduction and computation reduction. CV represent the proposed Cross-validation methodby us.
Table 2: Ablation experiment for different start epoch of pruning on CIFAR-10 with VGG-16. StartEpoch means the epoch that begin to prune. Iter means one alternate training in training set and testset. P Paras and P rate mean the number of pruned parameters in the iteration and the percentage ofpruned parameter. Acc means accuracy rate.
Table 3: Ablation experiment for different number of start pruning epoches on CIFAR-10 withResNet-56 and ResNet-110. Model-Start Epoch means model and the number of start pruningepoches with the same meaning as table 2. -B means the baseline without pruning. P Paras andP rate means the number of the pruned parameter and the the percentage of pruned parameter. TestAcc means the accuracy rate.
