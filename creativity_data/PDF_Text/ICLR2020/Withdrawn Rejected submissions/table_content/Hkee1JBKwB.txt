Table 1: Hyper-parameters search values for Conv-TT-LSTM experiments.
Table 2: Comparison of 10 and 30 frames prediction on Moving-MNIST-2 test set, where lowerMSE values (in 10-3) / higher SSIM / lower LPIPS values (in 10-3) indicate better results. All ourmodels use kernel size 5: Conv-TT-LSTM-FW has hyperparameters as (order 1, steps 3, ranks 8),and Conv-TT-LSTM-SW has hyperparameters as (order 3, steps 3, ranks 8).
Table 3: Evaluation of ConvLSTM and our Conv-TT-LSTM under the ablated experimental settings.
Table 4: Evaluation of multi-steps prediction on KTH dataset, where higher PSNR or SSIM valuesindicate better predictive results. For Conv-TT-LSTM-FW, the reported model has hyperparameters(order 1, steps 3, ranks 8); and Conv-TT-LSTM-SW use hyperparameters (order 3, steps 3, ranks 8).
