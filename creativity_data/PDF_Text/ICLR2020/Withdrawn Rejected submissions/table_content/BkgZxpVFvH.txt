The LSTODperforms even better on city B compared to the baseline methods since the long-term periodicalpattern in city B may be more significant compared with that in city A. Detailed results about CityB are summarized in Table 3 of the appendix.

Variedcombinations of the short-term sequence length p1 and the long-term day-level sequence length p2are studied. We can see that the best performance is achieved as (p1,p2) = (7, 5) with RMSE =2.41. Specifically, settings with different p1’s under p2 = 5 consistently outperform those underp2 = 7. It may demonstrate that the shift can usually be captured within a short time range, while alonger time sequence may smooth the significance. Table 4 provides the detailed prediction resultsfor each data setting.
