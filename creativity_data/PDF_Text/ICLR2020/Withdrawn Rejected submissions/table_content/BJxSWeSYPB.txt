Table 1: Detection results on the H36M and Ski-PTZ-Dataset datasets. They are expressed in termsof mAP0.5, the mean probability of having an intersection-over-union (IOU) of more than 50%.
Table 2: Segmentation results on the Ski-PTZ-Dataset and Handheld190k dataset. Ours exceedsor is on par with the self-supervised methods (marked with s), and approaches the accuracy ofweakly-supervised (marked with w ) and fully-supervised methods (marked with d).
Table 3: Analysis of the mask prior effect and Imagenet pre-training on the Ski-PTZ-Dataset dataset.
Table 4: Hyper-parameter study on the Ski-PTZ-Dataset dataset. In this table we analyze theeffectiveness of our hyper-parameter choice for the minimum and maximum bounding box sizes(given in square brackets) as well as the threshold Î» for the `v loss.
