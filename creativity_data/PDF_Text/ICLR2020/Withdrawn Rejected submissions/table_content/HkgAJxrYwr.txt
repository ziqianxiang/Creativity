Table 1: Results of label-flipping attacks on CIFAR-10 dataset with different numbers of attackers.
Table 2: Results of label-flipping attacks on Amazon Reviews dataset with different numbers ofattackers. The total number of participants is 10.
Table 3: Results of backdoor attacks on MNIST and CIFAR-10. There are 10 participants, 1 of whomis an attacker. We denote the accuracy as Acc. and the attack success rate as A.S.R.
Table 4: Results of Gaussian noise attacks on the MNIST dataset when is sampled from a Gaussiandistribution with different standard deviations. There are 100 participants where 10 are attackers.
Table 5: The CNN architecture for MNIST classification.
Table 6: Results of tuning hyperparameters λ and δ. All experiments are performed on MNISTdataset with label-flipping attacks. The left table is results with i.i.d. setting and the right table iswith non-i.i.d. setting.
Table 7: Results of replacing linear estimator and weighting schemes with other methods. Allexperiments are performed on MNIST dataset with label-flipping attacks.
Table 8: The effect of blending adversarial models with honest models. Mix rate means to whichportion the parameters of a model is changed to an adversarial model.
