Table 1: Evaluation of naive factorâ€™s activation estimation, T = 200, 100 repetitionsTable ?? shows quality indicators of the estimator for different SNR ratio. The two first columnsgive respectively the mean and standard deviation of the precision of the estimator. The twofollowing columns are respectively the mean and the standard deviation of the recall of theestimator. Finally the last column is the number of experiments that ended without any inputvertices having a path towards the output, so that the construction of an estimator is not possible.
