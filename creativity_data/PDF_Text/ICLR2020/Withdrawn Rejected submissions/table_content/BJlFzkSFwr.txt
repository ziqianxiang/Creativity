Table 1: Sentence classification performance on SST, CoNLL-2003, and FCE datasets.
Table 2: Sequence labeling performance on SST, CoNLL-2003, and FCE datasets. Metrics startingwith C- represent span-sensitive scores, specific to the NER task.
Table 3: The effect of the stopping criterion metric during the training of MHAL-zero.
Table 4: We list, for sentences and tokens: number of unique labels, proportion of default labels (O),entropy of the label distribution, and entropy of the non-default label distribution (using log2).
Table 5: Statistics of the labeled sentences and tokens, separated by the train, dev or test split.
Table 6: Hyperparameter settings for all of our MHAL models.
