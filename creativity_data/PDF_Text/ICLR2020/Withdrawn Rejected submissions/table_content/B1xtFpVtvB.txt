Table 1: Average success rate and standard deviation of agents, that are trained on a different numberof randomly environments, when tested on 50 test environments whose textures are not seen duringtraining. The bold values represent the algorithm that resulted in the best average success rateaccording to an amount of training environments and an input type. We see that our method bringsstability to the average results and improves generalization even when no depth is added.
