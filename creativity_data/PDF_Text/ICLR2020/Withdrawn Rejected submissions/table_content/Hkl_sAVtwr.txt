Table 1: Evaluating the benefits of learned regularization (LR) on x-ray images With varying levelsof noise and number of measurements. Table values are percent decrease in error, e.g. at ση2 = 0and m = 500, LR reduces MSE by 9.9%. The term ση2 corresponds to variance of the noise vectorσ2η in Eqn. 1, i.e. each entry of η is drawn independently N(0, m). These results indicate that LRtends to provide greater benefit With noisy signals and With feWer measurements.
Table 2: Runtime (seconds) for each algorithm with varying number of measurements. Note thatour algorithm was run on a NVIDIA GTX 1080-Ti GPU, while baselines only leverage CPU. Thusour goal here is not to compare runtimes; instead we demonstrate that our algorithm can run in areasonable amount of time, which is an issue with other DIP methods.
