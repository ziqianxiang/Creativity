Table 1: Quantum property regressions for 12 targets and overall performance (top two raws)on QM9. We repeat all experiments 3 times with different random seeds and report theaverage performance. Full results with standard deviation are presented in Appendix A, e.g.,for MPNN and EIGNN, We have Avg. nMAE 0.0398 ± 0.0002 and 0.0357 ± 0.0005.

Table 3: Experimental results on WN18RR, FB15K-237 and NELL-995 test sets. Hits@Nvalues are in percentage. The best score is in bold and second best score is underlined.
Table 4: Full results of quantum property regressions for 12 targets and overall performance(nMAE and MAE in top two raws) on QM9. We repeat all experiments 3 times withdifferent random seeds and report the average performance and standard deviation. This isa supplement for Table 1. in the main text.

Table 6: Error Ratio [(MAE)/(Chemical Accuracy) (Gilmer et al., 2017)] on QM9. Notethat the energy values of {U0, U, H, G} are per molecule rather than per atom. Following(Gilmer et al., 2017), models are separately trained on each target.
