Table 1: List of methods compared, modifications required, and a short description.
Table 2: mIoU values for modified PSPNet and DeeplabV3+ architectures showing efficacy for			original segmentation task. Network modifications are described in Table 1.			7.2 Method Performance	(RQ2)		Figure 3 shows the comparison of the performance of the different methods using the PSPNet ar-chitecture. Each graph shows a different metric (c.f . Section 4) for each dataset. Max Softmax,ODIN, and Mahalanobis follow the same trend as their image classification counterparts with theSUN dataset, increasing in performance in that order. However, for the IDD dataset the order isMahalanobis, Max Softmax, then ODIN, in increasing performance. For image-level OOD detec-tion, the Confidence method outperforms the Max Softmax baseline. However, for pixel-level OODdetection it is worse. For real datasets, VarSum is worse than Mutual Information, but better on thesynthetic datasets.
