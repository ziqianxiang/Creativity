Table 1: FID scores together with reconstruction MSE evaluated in pixel space and Inception’s fea-ture space. In a control experiment setting, HBAE achieves significantly better FID scores than theVAE counterpart, while being more comparable to unconditionally trained GANs.  As a reference,the FID score for ground truth test data is 4.08. Next, reconstruction MSE for the HBAE is signifi-cantly larger than the VAE counterpart evaluated in pixel space, as expected given that the decoderis multimodal and stochastic.  However, when evaluated in Inception’s feature space, HBAE andVAE metrics are comparable. As a reference, the Inception MSE for a random pair of test images is0.126.
Table 2: Few shot classification results on ShapeNet (Chang et al., 2015). We show the test accuracyof each features while varying the number of training examples. Here random denotes uninitializedfeatures with the same architecture, and supervised denotes the supervised training setting with thesame encoder architecture.
