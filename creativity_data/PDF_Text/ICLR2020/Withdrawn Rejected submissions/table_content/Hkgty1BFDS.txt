Table 2: k-NN evaluation on fine-grained datasets. (SD: Stanford Dogs)Dataset	SD	CUB-200	Network	AccUracy	Network	AccuracyInstance	27.0	11.6	AlexNet	75.6	Full	89.2ISIF	31.4	13.2	ResNet18	89.2	w/o UE	88.7AND	32.3	14.4	ResNet101	90.5	w/o Sobel	88.3Super-AND	39.0	17.6			w/o Aug	86.4tion is that the difference between previous models and super-AND is mostly larger in the caseof ResNet18 than the AlexNet backbone network. These results reveal that our model is superiorto other methods and may indicate that our methodology can give more benefits to stronger CNNarchitectures.
