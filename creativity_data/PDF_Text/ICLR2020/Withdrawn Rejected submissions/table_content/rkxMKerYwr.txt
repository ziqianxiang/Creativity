We propose a simple probability mechanism to exit confused samples. Specifi-cally, we add an auxiliary classifier for a selected intermediate layer to get the prediction probabilitydistribution. Each auxiliary classifier contains fully connected layer and Sigmoid function. For eachsample, we denote the number of exceeding the threshold p = 0.5 as N. We also denote the numberof exceeding another threshold q as n. We denote the ratio as γ and γ = n/N . The threshold qand ratio γ are range from 0.5 to 1. We search for the best values of them to improve classificationperformance and show the results on Table 4.
