Table 1: Comparison of top 1 accuracy on CIFAR-10 of ResNet models after decomposed training,with or without orthogonality loss. [-Ch] means using channel-wise decomposition and [-Sp] meansusing spatial-wise decomposition.
Table 2: Results of applying the proposed method on ResNet models onthe CIFAR-10 dataset with various hyperparameters. [Decay] marks thedecay variable for the sparse regularization, i.e. λs. [Energy Pruned]means the energy threshold used for singular value pruning, i.e. e. [Ac-curacy Gain] denotes the gain of Top-1 accuracy from the accuracy of thebaseline full-rank model. [Speed Up] is computed as the ratio of #FLOPsof the original model and the achieved low-rank model.
Table 3: Results of applying the proposed method on ResNet-50 model on the ImageNet dataset.
Table 4: Baselines on the CIFAR-10 dataset. [Accu.↑] means the Top-1 accuracy gain comparing tothat of the full model. [Sp. Up] denotes speed up computed as the ratio of #FLOPs before and afterthe model compression. [-] is marked when no result is available in the paper.
Table 5: Baselines on the ImageNet dataset. [Accu.↑] means the Top-5 accuracy gain comparing tothat of the full model. [Sp. Up] denotes speed up computed as the ratio of #FLOPs before and afterthe model compression.
