Table 1: Test classification accuracy (%) on	omniglot with both a 2D and 64D embedding for		clean-support/clean-query, corrupt-support/clean-query, and clean-support/corrupt-query. PN is our			implementation of Prototypical Networks (Snell et al., 2017). SPE is our model. SPE is trained with			intersection sampling (1 sample per trial).

Table 2: Test classification accuracy (%) on 2- and 3-digit MNIST for clean-support/clean-query,corrupt-support/clean-query, and clean-support/corrupt-query. N : number of digits in each image;D: dimensionality of the embedding. Contrastive and HIB results from Oh et al. (2019). PN is ourimplementation of Prototypical Networks (Snell et al., 2017). SPE is our model. SPE is trained withintersection sampling (1 sample per trial). Reported accuracy for PN and SPE for each experimentalconfiguration is the mean over 1000 random test episodes.
