Table 1: The achieved best FID scores of three runs are reported after 50000 steps for different mod-els and datasets. In most cases, the FID score improves after applying the Pixel-wise CombinationRegularization (PCR). Positive improvement rates are highlighted in bold. The baseline scores areconsistent with that reported in Lucic et al. (2018).
