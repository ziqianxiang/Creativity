Table 1: Classification accuracies of the compared methods on benchmark datasets. The bestperformer w.r.t. the mean is highlighted with an asterisk. We perform an unpaired t-test withasymptotic significance of 0.1 w.r.t. the best performer and highlight with boldface the ones for whichthe difference is not statistically significant. 0-CLIP is the CLIP architecture without any colorings.
Table 2: Classification accuracies of the synthetic datasets. k-RP-GIN refers to a relational poolingaveraged over k random permutations. We report Ring-GNN results from Chen et al. (2019).
