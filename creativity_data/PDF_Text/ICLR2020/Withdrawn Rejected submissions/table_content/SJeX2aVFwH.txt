Table 1: Comparison with Ruggles et al. (2019). We set Î³ = 1 and ran until the maximum violationof a metric constraint was smaller than 0.01. We used a parallel version of the algorithm METRICViolation as our oracle. All of the computations were done on a machine with 16 physical coresand 13 GB of RAM per core. More details about the experiment can be found in the supplementarymaterial section.
Table 2: Results for our algorithm on larger graphs. We ran our experiment on a machine with 48physical cores and 13 GB of RAM per core, but we only used 32 threads for the computations.
Table 3: Table comparing the testing accuracy of Project and Forget and ITML. Here theaccuracy for ITML is the average over 100 trials.
