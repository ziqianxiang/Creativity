The HR image(top row) and LR image (first column), and the corresponding SR variants obtained with bicubicinterpolation (BC), SRCNN and SRGAN methods (3rd - 5th column, respectively). A trend ofgradually improved visual sharpness and texture quality from BC to SR and SR to SRGAN imagescan be observed. This is particularly clear for carbonate images that contain highly heterogeneousfeatures such as oolitic vugs and high frequency texture associated with microporosity. This visualtrend is as expected from SRGAN type networks, but is entirely lost when looking at the PSNR resultsin Table 1. In other words, the pixel mismatch caused by stochastic GAN generation is unaccountedfor, causing the drop in the pixelwise accuracy of SRGAN images. Thus, the spatial relationship of4Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2020Figure 3: Sample images from the validation set using EDSRGAN network. Based on the LR image, a bicubicSR, SRCNN and SRGAN images are generated. Results show improvement in feature recovery in SRCNN images,and texture recovery in SRGAN images that look perceptually identical to the HR images.
Table 2: Pixelwise (Higher is better) and texturewise (Lower is better) results for the DeepRock-SR dataset,comparing SRGAN network performance as trained using only the MSE, MSE+VGG, and MSE+GLCM. Averagevalues on validation dataset, the pixelwise mismatch is highest for VGG loss, while lowest for GLCM loss.
