Table 1: Overview of existing methods for uncertainty quantification in deep learning.
Table 2: AUC-ROC performance (    95% confidence intervals) of all baselines on the real-world UCI regressiondatasets. Numbers between brackets are the achieved (empirical) coverage rates. Bold numbers correspond tothe best performing method. Coverage rates marked with an asterisk achieve the 90% target rate.
