Table 1: CIFAR-10 Benchmark: Comparison with manual networks and SOTA NAS on final(Stage 3) results. The results are grouped by those for manually designed networks, full evaluationNAS, weight-sharing NAS, and methods that we evaluated. All test errors are for models trained withauxiliary towers and cutout (parameter counts exclude auxiliary weights). Test errors we report areaveraged over 10 seeds. “-” indicates that the field does not apply while “N/A” indicates unknown.
Table 2:  EDARTS stage 2 and 3 test error for 3 sets of random seeds.  The bolded test error is thebest stage 3 performance across the 3 sets of random seeds.
