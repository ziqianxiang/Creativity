Table 1: Comparison of MMN single model with published state-of-the-art methods on the blindtest2019 set, as reported on the leaderboard as of Sep. 2019.
Table 2: Three sets of ablation study on GQA. MS: Module Supervision; AS: Attention Supervision;w/o Bootstrap: Directly training on the balanced-split.
Table 3: Error analysis on different functions. “Objects” functions only appear in the intermediatestep, “String” function only appears in the final step, “Binary” functions can occur in both cases.
Table 4: Comparison between MMN and NMN on generalization ability to unseen functions.
Table 5: The statistics of different functions.
