Table 1: A summary of three fine-grained datasets.
Table 2: The results of differentreweighting parameters s on SOP interms of Recall@K (%). There are 90classes and 2 images per class in a mini-batch, i.e., the batch size is 180.
Table 3: Comparison with the state-of-the-art methods on CARS196, CUB-200-2011 and SOP interms of Recall@K (%). All the compared methods use GoogLeNet V2 as the backbone architec-ture. ‘一' means the results which are not reported in the original paper. The best results in the firstblock using single embedding are bolded.
Table 4: The impact of batch content C × k on SOP in terms of Recall@K (%). The batch size isN = 180 and the scaling parameter is s = 64.
Table 5: The results of different batch size N on SOP in terms of Recall@K (%). While changingC, we fix k = 2 and s = 64. Therefore, N = C × 2.
Table 6: The results of different embedding size on SOP in terms of Recall@K (%). In all experi-ments: s = 64, C = 90, k = 2. N = C × k = 90 × 2.
