Table 1: Top-1 validation accuracy (in %) of ensembles trained on subsets of CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100and ImageNet (mean of 3 trials), comparing different acquisition functions. Each column indicatesa subset with a size equal to the specified percentage of the full dataset. Mutual information (J) andvariation ratios (V) give the best performance.
Table 2: Effect of increasing the number of models in an acquisition ensemble trained with 40%of ImageNet. Results shown are top-1 accuracy evaluated on the 40% selected data (512k samplesused for training) and 60% unselected data (768k remaining samples). Gains in performance on theunselected data show that large scale checkpoint-based ensembles exhibit high diversity.
Table 3: Effect on the subset model of increasing the number of ensemble members in the acquisi-tion model using the V acquisition function. Results shown are top-1 validation accuracy of a singleResNet-18 model trained using 80% of the ImageNet dataset selected with different ensemble con-figurations, compared to a baseline of random acquisition. Best results are obtained by the combinedconfiguration, which uses different random seeds and training checkpoints in the acquisition model.
Table 4: Transferring the 80% subset of ImageNet using ResNet-10 and ResNet-18 to new architec-tures for the subset model. We observe that these subsets provide near equivalent performance totraining on the entire dataset (FUll-100) across all new architectures.
Table 5: Effect of leaving out the highest uncertainty samples as outliers while sampling 50% of theCIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets with the compress initialization scheme and mutual informationacquisition function. Results shown are the mean top-1 validation accuracy over 3 trials. We observethat the highest uncertainty samples are outliers on CIFAR-100, but this is not the case on CIFAR-10.
Table 6: Effect of class-balanced random sampling on the ImageNet dataset. Results shown are thetop-1 validation accuracy of a single trial for training a single ResNet-18 model. We observe thatclass balancing does not have significant impact on performance.
