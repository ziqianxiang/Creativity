Table A.1: The mean, standard deviation (“std”) and median of the test power of the various methods computedfrom nrun = 400 test runs over nrep = 20 replicas on the 1D example in Sec. 3. The gmmd, net-acc, net-logittests are computed on |Xte| = |Yte | = 100 samples, where net-acc and net-logit train a classification networkon another training set of size |Xtr| = |Ytr| = 100. gmmd only uses the test set and sets the kernel bandwidthσ to be the median distance. gmmd+ and gmmd++ accesses both the training and test sets, where gmmd+ usesthe median distance as σ, and gmmd++ reports the best power over varying range of choices of σ, as describedin Sec. 3. The results of gmmd, net-acc, net-logit are also reported in Fig. 1.
Table A.2: The values of Mean, Std, and their ratio of the three tests, where p and q are as in the 1D examplein Sec. 3, c.f. Fig. 1.
