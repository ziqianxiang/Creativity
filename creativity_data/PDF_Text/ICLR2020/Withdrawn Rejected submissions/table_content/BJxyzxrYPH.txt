Table 1: RMSE test set scores for runs on Synthetic Netflix (Monti et al., 2017), Flixster (Jamali & Ester,2010), Douban (Ma et al., 2011), and Movielens-100K (Harper & Konstan, 2016). For Flixster, we showresults for both user/item graphs (right number) and user graph only (left number). Baseline numbers aretaken from (Monti et al., 2017; Berg et al., 2017).

Baseline scores are taken from (Zheng et al., 2016; Berget al., 2017)4.3	Cold start analysisA particularly interesting scenario in the context of recommender systems is the presence of cold-startusers, referring to the users who have not rated enough movies yet. We perform an analysis ofthe performance of our method in the presence of such cold start users on the ML-100K dataset.
