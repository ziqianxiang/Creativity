Table 1: 5-shot and 1-shot classification accuracy on all datasets. Four-layer convolution backbone(Conv-4) with an input size of 84x84 is used as a feature extractor for all methods for a fair compar-ison. No finetuning is performed on CIFAR-H and CIFAR-FS, all the hyperparameters are the oneused in the mini-ImageNet dataset. All accuracy results are averaged over 600 test episodes and arereported with 95% confidence intervals. *Results reported by Chen et al. (2019).
