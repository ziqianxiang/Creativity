Table 1: Existing models of molecular graph generation. We propose the first invertible flow-basedgraph generation model in the literature..
Table 2: Performance of generative models with respect to quality metrics. Baseline scores areborrowed from the original papers. Zinc results of JT-VAE are reproduced based on the settingswritten in the original paper. Scores of GraphNVP are averages over 5 runs. Standard deviations arepresented below the average scores.
