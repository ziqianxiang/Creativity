Table 4: Alps Seasons: Comparing TriGAN with StarGAN (Choi et al. (2018))5	ConclusionsIn this work we proposed TriGAN, an MSDA framework which is based on data-generation frommultiple source domains using a single generator. The underlying principle of our approach to to ob-tain domain-style invariant representations in order to simplify the generation process. Specifically,our generator progressively removes style and domain specific statistics from the source images andthen re-projects the so obtained invariant representation onto the desired target domain and styles.
