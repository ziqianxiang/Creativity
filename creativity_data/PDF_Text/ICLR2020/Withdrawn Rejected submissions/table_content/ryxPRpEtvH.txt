Table 1: Results on benchmark datasets comparing accuracy and uncertainty estimates producedby different types of methods. The top-2 performing results for each metric are bold-faced. MComnibus-dropout is consistently one of the best methods, outperforming even deep ensembles, whichrequires five times more computational resources, in many cases. The numbers in bracket next todropout methods corresponds to the optimal drop_rate found by grid search using the NLL metric.
Table 2: Results comparing accuracy and uncertainty estimates obtained using a single model whendrop_rate = 0.1 for all models. The top-2 performing results for each metric is bold-faced. MComnibus-dropout is the best method in general.
Table 3: Results showing accuracy and uncertainty estimates produced by different types of explicitensembles when drop_rate = 0.1 for all models. five models are used for each ensemble. Wegenerate 6 sampled models from each dropout models during evaluation (30 samples in total). Thetop-2 performing results for each metric is bold-faced.
