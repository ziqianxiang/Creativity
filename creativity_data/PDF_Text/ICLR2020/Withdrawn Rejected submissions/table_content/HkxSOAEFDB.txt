Table 1: The overview of dataset statistics.
Table 2: Experimental results (in percent) on semi-supervised node classification.
Table 3: Learned weights αL and αH of OctGCN for low and high frequency w.r.t the best fractionof low frequency components d/n (number followed after the name of datasets).
Table 4: The mean Silhouette Coefficient of learned samples. Larger is better.
Table 5: The average gap of MAD and INR between the low- and high- frequency components inbenchmark datasets. Smaller MAD indicates better smoothness and larger INR indicates that thefrequency components contain richer information.
