Table 1: MSE scaled by 103, posterior variance scaled by 103 and SSIM on test data for different undersamplingrates and mask design algorithms. The reconstruction is computed as the average of 2 samples. The lowestvalue (highetst for SSIM) for each undersampling rate is in blue. The value in parentheses corresponds to thenumber of samples used to compute the average.
Table 2: MSE scaled by 103 on test data for different undersampling rates and mask design algorithms. Thereconstruction is computed as the average of 10 samples. The lowest MSE for each undersampling rate is inbold.
Table 3: SSIM on test data for different undersampling rates and mask design algorithms. The reconstructionis computed as the average of 10 samples. The highest SSIM for each undersampling rate is in bold.
Table 4: Estimated posterior variance scaled by 103 on test data for different undersampling rates and maskdesign algorithms. The reconstruction is computed as the average of 10 samples. The lowest estimated variancefor each undersampling rate is in bold.
