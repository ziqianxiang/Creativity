Table 1: We compare our PIFO lower bounds with existing results of IFO or PIFO algorithms, whereK = L∕μ. Note that the call of PIFO could obtain more information than IFO. Hence, any PIFOlower bound also can be regarded as an IFO lower bound, not vice versa.
Table 2: We compare our PIFO lower bounds with previous results, including the number of PIFOor IFO calls to obtain ε-suboptimal point and the required number of dimensions in correspondingconstruction.
