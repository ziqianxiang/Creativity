Table 1: The relative delta 2Î´(X )/diam(X ) and curvature parameter values calculated for differentdatasets. For image datasets we measured the Euclidean distance between VGG16 features. S2 andS2,z > 0 denote the two-dimensional unit sphere and upper hemisphere correspondingly (1700points were sampled from each one).
Table 2: Kolmogorov-Smirnov distances between the distributions of distance to the origin of theMNIST and Omniglot datasets embedded into the POinCare ball with the hyperbolic classifier trainedon MNIST, and between the distributions of pmax (maximum probablity predicted for a class) forthe Euclidean classifier trained on MNIST and evaluated on the same sets. See further description inSubsection 5.1 and visualization on Figure 3. We observe that distance to the origin mostly presentsa more statistically significant indicator of the dataset dissimilarity.
Table 3: Few-shot classification accuracy values on Omniglot.
Table 4: Experimental results on two datasets: MiniImageNet and CUB averaged over 10, 000 testepisodes and are reported with 95% confidence intervals.
Table 5: Person re-identification results for Market-1501 and DukeMTMC-reID for the classificationbaseline (bs) and its hyperbolic counterpart (hyp). (See 5.5 for the details).
