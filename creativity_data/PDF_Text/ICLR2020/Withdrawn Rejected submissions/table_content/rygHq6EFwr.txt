Table 1: A Summary of Graph Residual Terms and Physical Meanings.
Table 2: Best performance (accuracy) and model depth summarization of GResNet with differentresidual terms on the benchmark datasets (we take GCN, GAT and LoopyNet as the base models).
Table 3: Learning result accuracy of node classification methods. In the table, ‘-’ denotes the resultsof the methods on these datasets are not reported in the existing works. Performance of GCN, GATand LoopyNet shown in Table 2 are not provided here to avoid reporting duplicated results.
