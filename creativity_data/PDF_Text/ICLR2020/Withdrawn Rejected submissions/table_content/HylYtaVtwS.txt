Table 1: Clean and adversarial accuracies of texture- and shape-based ResNet-50 backbones andcache models. The adversarial accuracies report the results for a standard normalized perturbationsize of = 0.06.
Table 2: Clean and gray-box adversarial accuracies of different cache models. As in Figure 4, onlythe results for the layer4_bottleneck1_relu layer are shown. Colors highlight the retrievalmethod (continuous or 50-nn), cache dimensionality (full, 4- or 8-times reduced), and cache size(full, 4- or 8-times reduced).________________________________Model	Clean Gray-box ( = 0.06)	Cache (continuous, full-dims., full-cache)	0.641	0.170Cache (50-nn, full-dims., full-cache)	0.656	0.181Cache (50-nn, full-dims., 1/4-cache)	0.626	0.151Cache (50-nn, full-dims., 1/8-cache)	0.612	0.143Cache (50-nn, 1/4-dims., full-cache)	0.516	0.109Cache (50-nn, 1/8-dims., full-cache)	0.498	0.103implies that the higher layers of the backbone used for caching are not very compressible and drasticdimensionality reduction measures should be avoided to prevent a substantial decrease in accuracy.
Table 3: ImageNet-C results. The numbers indicate corruption errors (CE) for specific corruptiontypes and the mean CE scores as percentages. More robust models correspond to smaller numbers.
Table 4: Summary of our main results. This table is a distilled version of Tables 1 and 3. In eachcell, the first number represents the adversarial accuracy (gray-box accuracy for cache models andwhite-box accuracy for cacheless models, both with = 0.06); the second number represents themCE score. Note that better models have higher accuracy and lower mCE score. Starting from abaseline model with no cache and no shape bias (bottom right), adding a cache memory (bottomleft) only improves adversarial accuracy; adding a shape bias (top right) only improves naturalrobustness; adding both (top left) improves both natural and adversarial robustness with a synergisticimprovement in the latter.
