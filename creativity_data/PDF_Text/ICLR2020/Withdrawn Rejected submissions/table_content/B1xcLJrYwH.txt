Table 1: Results of our experiments. The fraction of images on which a correct estimation wasobtained out of the total number of valid images evaluated (the higher the better). For geo-matchingwe use the nearest neighbor measure (nn) and for geo-interpolation the Manhattan distance (D).
Table 2: Examples of the`2 errors for an experi-ment with Edges+Faces im-age types in each sub-space:spatial (x, y) errors in (ap-prox.) meters, and orienta-tion (θ, φ)) errors in degrees.
Table 3: Testing network learningcapacity. These results are from asingle experiment where the imageinput type is only edges. The net-work ability to learn drops when thenumber of images grows beyond acertain point.
Table 4: Low grid density results. Datasets (single experiment each) with sparser spatial sampling(top two blocks), and sparser spatial and orientation sampling (bottom two blocks) where the pitchangle is ∈ [6, 12], and yaw ∈ {45i}i7=0. The sparser the data, the worse the results. Geo-interpolationcould not succeed in very sparse and very small datasets.
