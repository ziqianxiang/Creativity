Table 1: Results of symbolic regression methods. Search expressions in holdout sets M [f] ≤ 4,M [f] = 5 and M [f] = 6 with data points on Dtrain and / or leading powers Px→0 [f] and Px→∞ [f].
Table 2: Results of force field expressions found by each method.
Table 3: Metrics for conditional production rule generating NN and baseline models.
Table 4: Examples of top-3 probable expressioncompletions for different desired conditions.
Table A.1: Minimum, median and maximum of the lengths of the production rule sequence. Spacesize is the number of possible expressions within the maximum length of the production rule sequence.
Table H.1: Comparison with GVAE on subset of holdout sets.
Table K.1: Results of symbolic regression methods with noise. Search expressions in holdout setsM [f] ≤ 4, M [f] = 5 and M [f] = 6 with data points on Dtrain and / or leading powers Px→0 [f]and Pχ→∞[f]. The options are marked by on (√), off (×) and not available (-). If the RMSEs ofthe best found expression g(x) in interpolation and extrapolation are both smaller than 10-9 and∆P [g] = 0, it is solved. If g(x) is non-terminal or ∞, it is invalid. Hard includes expressions in theholdout set which are not solved by any of the six methods. The medians of ∆gtrain, ∆gint., ∆gext.
Table L.1: Examples of syntactic novelties to demonstrate what the NN model learned. Sem-identical expression refers to the expression in the training set that shares the same simplifiedexpression as the corresponding syntactic novelty. The first column shows the mathematical rulesa human needs to know and apply to derive each syntactic novelty from its semantically identicalexpression in the training set.
