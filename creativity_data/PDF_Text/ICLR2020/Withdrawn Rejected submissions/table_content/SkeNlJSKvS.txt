Table 1:	Test NLL on StaticMNIST. “t” indi-cates a hierarchical model with 2 latent variables,while “*” indicates at least 3 latent variables.
Table 2:	Test NLL on MNIST. “t” and “*” hasthe same meaning as Table 1.
Table 3: Average test NLL (lower is better) of different models, with Gaussian prior & Gaussianposterior (“standard”), Gaussian prior & RealNVP posterior (“RNVP q(z|x)”), and RealNVP prior& Gaussian posterior (“RNVP p(z)”). Flow depth K = 20.
Table 4: Test NLL of ResnetVAE on MNIST, withRealNVP posterior (“q(z|x)”), RealNVP prior(“p(z)”), and RealNVP prior & posterior (“both”).
Table 5: Average number of active unitsof ResnetVAE, with standard prior & poste-rior (“standard”), RealNVP posterior (“RNVPq(z|x)”), and RealNVP prior (“RNVP p(z)”).
Table 6: Average test ELBO (“elbo”), reconstruction loss (“recons”), Ep*(χ)DκL(qφ(z∣x)∣∣pλ(z))(“kl”), and Ep*(χ)DκL(qφ(z∣x)∣∣pθ(z∣x)) (“kQx") of ResnetVAE with different priors.
Table B.1: Avg. Mean(Zk) and Var(Zk) of regularized/un-regularized ResnetVAE with RealNVPprior.
Table B.2: Test bpd on Cifar10.
Table B.3: The minimum Std ("min_std")，average learned Std of Gaussian qφ(z∣x) (“std")，the ratioof minimum std with respect to the learned std ("min_std / std"), the test NLL and the active units(“au”) of ResnetVAE with RealNVP p(z) and Gaussian p(z) on MNIST.
Table B.4: Test NLL of our ResnetVAE with low complexity and ResConv VAE (Huang et al., 2017)on StaticMNIST. “pure” refers to the original RealNVP flow, without invertible dense and actnorm.
Table B.5: DKL(qφ(z)kpλ(z)) of a ResnetVAE with RealNVP prior trained on MNIST, estimatedby Algorithm B.2. nz = 10 for all nx. We only tried nx for up to 8, due to the growing computationtime of O(nX).
Table B.6: Test NLL of ResnetVAE, with prior trained by: joint training, iterative training, post-hoctraining, and standard VAE (“none”) as reference. Flow depth K = 20.
Table B.7: Average reconstruction loss (“recons")，Ep*(χ)DκL(qφ(z∣x)∣∣pλ(z)) (“kl”)and activeunits (“au”) of ResnetVAE with iteratively trained and post-hoc trained RealNVP priors.
