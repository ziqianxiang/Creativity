Table 1: Statistics on Enron-Context and Reddit-Context datasets.
Table 2: Statistics of the parallel and non-parallel datasets on the two text style transfer tasks.
Table 3: Quantitative evaluation results of different models on the two style transfer tasks .
Table 4: Examples from the two datasets, where orange denotes the sentence to be transferred, and blue denotescontent that also appears in the context. C-Seq2Seq: Contextual Seq2Seq; H-Seq2Seq: Hybrid Seq2Seq.
Table 5: Ablation study of CAST on the two style transfer tasks.
Table 6: Results of pairwise human evaluation between CAST and three baselines on both tasks. Win/lose/tieindicate the percentage of texts generated by CAST are better/worse/equal to the compared model.
