Table 1: Test accuracy (in percentage) and epoch number (inside parentheses) for different GCNarchitectures and training algorithms. For the same architecture, initialization is the same. Theepoch number is the one when best validation accuracy occurs.
Table 2: Data sets.
Table 3: Hyperparameters for different GCN architectures and training algorithms.
Table 4: Time per epoch in seconds.
