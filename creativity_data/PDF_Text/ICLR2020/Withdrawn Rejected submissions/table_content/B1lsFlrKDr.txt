Table 1: Comparing model performance on WSJ data set with 10% labeled data. “L” means only10% labeled data is used, while “L+U” means both 10% labeled and 90% unlabeled data are used.
Table 2: In this table we compare different models on multiple languages from UD. Models weretrained in a fully supervised fashion with labeled data only (noted as “L”) or semi-supervised (notesas “L+U”). “ST” stands for self-training.
Table 3: Statistics of multiple languages we used in our experiments are shown here. The tableshows number of sentences in the training, development and test data divisions.
