Table 1: Numerical results (mean and 95%-confidence interval) for PSNR and SSIM for testedmethods on the two-digits Moving MMNIST dataset. Bold scores indicate the best performing methodand, where appropriate, scores whose means lie in the confidence interval of the best performingmethod.
Table 2: Numerical results (mean and 95%-confidence interval, when relevant) for PSNR, SSIM,LPIPS, and FVD for tested methods on the KTH dataset. Bold scores indicate the best performingmethod for each metric and, where appropriate, scores whose means lie in the confidence interval ofthe best performing method.
Table 3: Numerical results (mean and 95%-confidence interval, when relevant) with respect toPSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, and FVD for tested methods on the BAIR dataset. Bold scores indicate the bestperforming method for each metric and, where appropriate, scores whose means lie in the confidenceinterval of the best performing method.
