Table 1: Dice scores of segmentation results on the testimages of SEM images of ice cream dataset.
Table 2: We compare the two methods under similar annotation time budgets. In each budget, twodifferent combinations of SL and WL that take similar annotation time are used. The WL in this tablecontains 75% labels for the detection task and 100% labels for the separation task. From budget 1to budget 3, we increase the amount of labels (that means more annotation time is needed) in thetraining data, and the dice score is reported for each case.
Table 3: Average dice score for segmentation of gland. Our method uses both SL and WL. The ratioof strong labels (SL) is increased from 2.4% to 100%, and the scores of the methods are reportedhere for two parts A and B of the test sets, as split in Sirinukunwattana et al. (2017).
