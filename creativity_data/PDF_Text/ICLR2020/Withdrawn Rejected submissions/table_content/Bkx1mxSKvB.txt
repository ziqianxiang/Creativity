Table 1: Evolution of the NTK spectra and ∆(l). The NTKs of FCN and CNN-F are essentially thesame and the scaling of λ(ml)ax, λ(rle)st, κ(l), and ∆(l) for these networks is written in black. Correctionsto these quantities due to the addition of an average pooling layer with window size d is written inblue.
