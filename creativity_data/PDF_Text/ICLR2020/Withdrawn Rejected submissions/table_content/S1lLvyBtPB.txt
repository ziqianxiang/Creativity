Table 1: Detection power for individual subset scanning over all layers (convolutional, maxpooling and up-sampling) for both datasets under three different adversarial attacks. Thenoised columns refer to the autoencoder being trained with 1% and 9% BIM noised samples. Underdifferent datasets and attacks, the same initial layers hold the highest detection power.
Table 2: Detection power for individual subset scanning over reconstruction error space forboth dataset under three different adversarial attacks, two baselines for reconstruction error overAE (Sakurada & Yairi, 2014) and One-SVM over reconstruction error of the AE (SCholkoPf et al.,2001).
