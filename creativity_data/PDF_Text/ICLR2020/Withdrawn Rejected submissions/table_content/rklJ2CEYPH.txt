Table 1: Log-likelihood Comparison. LL is reported for synthetic and real datasets.
Table 2: Mean Absolute Error Comparison. MAE is reported for synthetic and real datasets.
Table 3: Comparison of log-likelihood, MAE, and accuracy on Breakfast dataset.
Table 4: Log-likelihood comparison of PPF-D and PPF-P. LL score represents the difference of log-likelihood under the true underlying distribution and log-likelihood under the learned model. Arrow(↑)∕(J) shows higher/lower values are better.
