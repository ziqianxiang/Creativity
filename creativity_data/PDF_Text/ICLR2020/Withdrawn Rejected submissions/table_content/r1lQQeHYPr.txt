Table 1: Table showing training and test sets for both the tasks, Semantic Goal Navigation (SGN) and EmbodiedQuestion Answering (EQA). The test set consists of unseen instructions and questions. The dataset evaluates amodel for cross-task knowledge transfer between the embodied multimodal tasks, SGN and EQA.
Table 2: Accuracy of all models for both Easy & Hard difficulties. ‘MT’ stands for multi-task.
Table 3: Accuracy of all the ablation models onSGN and EQA test sets for the Easy setting.
Table 4: The performance of the trained policy appendedwith object detectors on instructions containing unseen words(‘red’ and ‘pillar’).
Table 5: Instructions and questions for ViZDoom experiments. We used 5 object classes (torch, pillar, keycard,skullkey, armor), 4 colors (red, green, blue, yellow), 2 sizes (tall, short), and 2 superlative sizes (smallest,largest).
Table 6: Performance of the DA model trained in a 2D envi-ronment with different vocabulary sizes.
Table 7: Accuracy of all the models on the SGNand EQA train and test sets for the House3D Do-main.
Table 8: Instructions and questions for House3D experiments. We used 6 object classes (refrigerator, office_chair,fish_tank, fireplace, bed, sofa) and 4 colors (red, green, blue, yellow).
