Table 1: Bayes factor E[BR] against various measures of confidence. For CIFAR-10 we used X1,the probability of the correct label; for CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K we used X5 the probabilitythat the correct label is in the Top5. Data is binned into 100 bins, chosen to have equal weight.
Table 2: Confidence bins for ImageNet-1K. The values of a and b are chosen such that P (top5 |Y < a) = 0.99 and P(a ≤ top5 | Y < b) = 0.95. For the model used here, P (top5) = 0.9406.
Table 3: Discarding out-of-distribution images from ImageNet-1K. For each confidence measure Y ,the value of a is chosen such that P(Y ≤ a | image is from ImageNet-Ik) = 0.9.
Table 4: Adversarial detection with ResNeXt-34 (2x32) on CIFAR-10. Clean images which the modelcorrectly labels are perturbed until they are misclassified with four attack methods (PGD, Boundaryattack, Carlini-Wagner, and an evasive Carlini-Wagner designed to avoid detection). Images arerejected if |Vf (χ)∣2 ∞ > 2.45.
Table 5: Brier score of various measures of confidence. For CIFAR-10 we used X1 , the probabilityof the correct label; for CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K we used X5 the probability that the correctlabel is in the Top5. Data is binned into 100 bins, chosen to have equal weight.
Table 6: Confidence bins for CIFAR-100. The values of a and b are chosen such that P (top5 | Y <a) = 0.99 and P (a ≤ top5 | Y < b) = 0.95. For the model used here, P (top5) = 0.916.

The question is whether to send a text message or phone their number. Approximately95% of people prefer to message. Let X be the probability that a person prefers to message. Theexpected value and odds for X is given bypX = 0.95,	O(pX) = 19Now suppose we have additional information, which gives these statistics based on age. Suppose wewish to predict X. Knowing the age U has a value. Let U(x) be the age, and consider three bins forU given by the values 20, 65 and let Y1, Y2, Y3 be the corresponding histogram random variables.
