Table 1: OOD detection results for housing price prediction (top) and age estimation (bottom).
Table 2: Performance of generative models for OOD detection.
Table 3: OOD detection performance as a function of the GMM mixture size (1, 2, or 4). Wedisplay the TNR and AUROC for each GMM, as well as the GMMâ€™s log likelihood on in-distributionfeatures. Blue columns correspond to the model with the highest log likelihood (the model selectionCriterion). Best results are in bold.
