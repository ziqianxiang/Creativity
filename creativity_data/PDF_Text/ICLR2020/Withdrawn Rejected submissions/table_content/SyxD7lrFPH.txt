If theresolution is μ + 2x-μ, . . . , x-1, x0, x1 . . . , xμ, xμ+1	(25)In this case, it contains imaginary part. But we can recover the symmetry and eliminate the imag-inary part by setting ^μ+ι to zero. We call this trick odd padding. We show the effects of oddpadding in appendix B. A drawback of odd padding is that more information is lost during downsampling which may reduces accuracy. We don’t use it in this paper.
