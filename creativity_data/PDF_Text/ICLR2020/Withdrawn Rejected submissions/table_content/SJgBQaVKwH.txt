Table 1: Inter-speaker same-text prosody transfer results for C = 150 with and without speakerdependencies in the variational posterior (Var+Txt+Spk and Var+Txt, respectively). SpkID denotesthe fraction of the time the target speaker was chosen by the speaker classifier. For reference, weprovide MOS and SpkID numbers for the baseline model and ground truth audio (though neither are“prior” samples).
Table B.1: Detailed subjective reference similarity scores and objective MCD-DTW reference distancefor single speaker models at different capacity limits, C, and with and without text conditioning inthe variational posterior (Var+Txt and Var, respectively). Notice how subjective reference similarityfor same-text transfer is strongly negatively correlated with MCD-DTW.
Table B.2: MOS naturalness scores for single speaker models at different capacity limits, C, withand without text conditioning in the variational posterior (Var+Txt and Var, respectively). Scoresare shown for prior samples (Prior), same-text transfer (Same-TT), and inter-text transfer (Inter-TT).
Table B.3: Transfer using hierarchical latents. “Ref.” is the the average MCD-DTW distance fromthe reference, and “X-samp.” is the average inter-sample MCD-DTW. These are the numbers used inthe plots in Figure 5.
