Table 1: Success probability AUC and average distortion D of our method BP on ImageNet withdifferent quantization strategies.
Table 2: Success probability AUC and average distortion D with quantization. EPP is the successrate under distortion budget I)UPP = 2 for MNIST, 0.7 for CIFAR10, and 1 for ImageNet.
Table 3: Success probability Auc, average distortion D, and success rate EPP under adversarialtraining defense with I-FGSM, DDN, or BP (with 20 iterations) as the reference attack. For theMNIST, the model is trained from scratch. For CIFAR10, it is fine-tuned for 30 extra ePochs assuggested by Rony et al. (2018) with DDN and BP, and trained from scratch for 200 ePochs withFGSM. Tâ…›p measured at distortion DUPP = 2 for MNIST, and 0.7 for CIFAR10.

Table 5: Success probability AUc, average distortion D, and success rate EPP under adversarialtraining with PGD as the reference attack, following (Madry et al., 2017) for MNIST and CIFAR10;and ensemble adversarial training (Tramer et al., 2017a) for ImageNet. Epp measured at I?UPP = 2for MNIST, 0.7 for CIFAR10, and 1 for ImageNet.
