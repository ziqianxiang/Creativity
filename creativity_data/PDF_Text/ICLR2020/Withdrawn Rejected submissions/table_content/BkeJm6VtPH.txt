Table 1: Final average test accuracy on permuted MNIST for various methods (results taken fromrespective papers). A hidden layer size of {n1,n2 } indicates two hidden layers, the lower hidden layerhaving n1 hidden units, the upper hidden layer having n2 (followed by a softmax over the 10 MNISTclasses). Methods with an asterisk (*) use some sort of episodic memory. Results marked with a doubleasterisk (**) were read from a graph in the source paper.
Table 2: Split CIFAR narrow multi-head model. Convolutional layers and Dense 1 are followed by ReLUactivation.
Table 3: Split CIFAR wide single-head model. Convolutions 1-5 are followed by BatchNorm then ReLUactivation.
