Table 1: 2D Mazes: Test performance with varying training data size{200, 1000, 5000} and different graph sizes. GrMPN-GN and GrMPN-GN usea smaller training size of 200.
Table 2: Irregular Dense Graphs: Test performance with varying num-ber of nodes used in training {10, 100}.
Table 3: Irregular Sparse Graphs: Test perfor-mance with varying number of nodes used intraining {10, 100}.
Table 4: 2D Navigation motion planning problems: Test perfor-mance with varying number of configurations {200, 500}. Notethat algorithms with suffix -T denote trained models using tree-likegraph data.
