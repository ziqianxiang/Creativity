Table 1: Top-1 error rates (%) on various image classification tasks and model architectures. Wereported the mean and standard deviation over 3 runs with different random seed. Boldface valuesin parentheses indicate relative error rate reductions from cross-entropy.
Table 2: Top-1 error rates (%) of compatibility experiments with mixup regularization on variousimage classification tasks. We reported the mean and standard deviation over 3 runs with differentrandom seed, and the best results are indicated in bold.
Table 3: Top-1 error rates (%) of compatibility experiments with knowledge distillation (KD) onvarious image classification tasks. Teacher network is pre-trained on DenseNet-121 (large) by CS-KD, and student network trained on ResNet-10 (small). We reported the mean and standard deviationover 3 runs with different random seed, and the best results are indicated in bold.
Table 4: Top-1 / 5 error, ECE, and Recall at 1 rates (%) of ResNet-18. The arrow on the right sideof the evaluation metric indicates ascending or descending order of the value. We reported the meanand standard deviation over 3 runs with different random seed, and the best results are indicated inbold.
