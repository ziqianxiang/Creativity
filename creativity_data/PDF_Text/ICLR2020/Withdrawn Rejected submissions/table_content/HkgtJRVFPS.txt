Table 1: Multiple evaluation metrics (Section 5.1). The hyperparameters of all tunable methods wereselected to minimise the objective KL0.1. The winner is shown in bold and underlined, the runner-upin bold. Please refer to Supplementary Table A.2 for more Ïƒ scales and variance estimates.
Table A.1: Various topological distances calculated between the test data set and the correspondinglatent space. For computational efficiency reasons, we used subsamples of size m = 500 and repeatedthe process 10 times. Individual cells thus contain a mean and a standard deviation.
Table A.2: Extended version of the table from the main paper, showing more length scales and variance estimates.
