Table 1: Results in StarCraft using Imitation Learning (IL) on the whole training set, IL on individualclusters (C10, C11, C30, and C32), Behavioral Repertoire Imitation Learning (BRIL) with fixedbehavioral features corresponding to centroids in C10, C11, C30, and C32. Additionally, results areshown in which UCB1 selects between the four behavioral features in-between games. Each variantplayed 100 games against the easy Zerg bot. The nearest demonstration in the entire dataset wasfound based on the botâ€™s mean behavior (normalized army unit combination) and the distance toeach cluster centroid are shown. The results demonstrate that by using certain behavioral features,the BRIL policy outperforms the traditional IL approach as well as IL on behavioral clusters.
Table 2: Test accuracy and loss for IL, BRIL, and IL trained on clusters 10, 11, 30 and 32. Resultsshow no significant difference between the IL and BRIL in terms of prediction accuracy. BRIL is,however, able to express multiple behaviors based on the additional input (see Table 1).
