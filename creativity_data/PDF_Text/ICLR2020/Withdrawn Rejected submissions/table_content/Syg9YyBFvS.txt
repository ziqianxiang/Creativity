Table 1: Tabular data experiments: mean score over 5-fold cross-validation. For the Kaggle compe-titions, we also included Kaggle-computed results obtained via the “late submission” system.
Table 2: Each column is the average precision per class obtained on the test set. The last column isthe mean average precision of all classes. The first two rows correspond to the sensor-only task andlast two rows, to the sensors+video data.

Table 4:	Hyper-parameters range for the tabular datasetsB Checkerb oard Effects in the Titanic DatasetTo demonstrate the checkerboard phenomena in tabular data, we plot the probability estimates forthe Titanic dataset (Dua & Graff, 2017). The goal of this task is to predict individual passengersurvival. For the demonstration here, we considered two real-valued features. The first is age, whichmight be missing and replaced with -1 (a common practice). The second is the ticket fare. Theeffect of gender is so great, so we chose to display plots on the male population. The first plotis univariate, where the x-axis is age and the y-axis is the survival probability. Clearly, there isa sharp transition change from -1 (missing data) to 0 (babies) and another sharp transition at 14(kids). There are two more softer transitions at 25 and 42. These transitions indicate a checkerboardbehavior. The second plot if bivariate, where the x-axis is age and the y-axis is ticket fare, while thecolor indicates the survival probability. The checkerboard-like pattern is apparent.
