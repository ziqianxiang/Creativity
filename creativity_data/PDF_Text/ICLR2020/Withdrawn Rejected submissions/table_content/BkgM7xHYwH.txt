Table 1: Test accuracy on the Copy task.
Table 2: Test accuracy on sequential MNIST and permuted MNIST.
Table 3: Test accuracy on TIMIT. Results for the RNN, LSTM and KRU-LSTM are taken from Joseet al. (2018)	nh	Valid.	TestRNN(Jose etal.,2018)	600	65.84	64.53LSTM(Jose et al., 2018)	300	65.99	64.56KRU-LSTM(Jose et al., 2018)	2048	66.54	64.81LMN-ortho	420	67.4	66.1LMN-laes	420	65.0	63.4We found that without any regularization the norm of the memory state mt tended to grow indefinitely,which degraded the final performance. We did not find the same problem on the MNIST dataset.
Table 4: Comparison between the LAES initialization on sequential and permuted MNIST for theRNN and the LMN using the test accuracy. The LMN is a better approximation and therefore reachesthe same performance, while the RNN has a much lower accuracy.
