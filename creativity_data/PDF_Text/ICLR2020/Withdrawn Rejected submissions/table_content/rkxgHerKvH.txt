Table 2: Pearson correlation between the predicted graph and empirical graph 11 synthetic datasets. Eachcolumn denotes the Pearson correlation of the synthetic dataset generated by the kernel function of the secondrow. Each row denotes the Pearson correlation of the prediction method of the first column. Some results are“gold standard” ones because the predictor and synthetic data generator use the same graph kernel, and henceare marked as “GS” for those results. The right-most column denotes the average Pearson correlation amongall 11 synthetic datasets. The highest Pearson correlation in each column/dataset is highlighted in bold fontwhile the second-highest Pearson correlation is marked with an underline.
Table 3: Pearson correlation between the pre-dicted graph and empirical graph on real-worlddatasetsThe GT-GAN method achieves the highest SC-FC dataset, but performs worse than C-DGT andGSEN on other three datasets. The GT-GAN method is also the slowest method in terms of theper epoch training time. None of the methods can achieve the Pearson correlation higher than 0.5including the top four methods that are exclusively designed for the SC-FC mapping problem in theneural science domain. This might be caused by the noise in the resting-state fMRI data. We willshow some insightful reasons through multiple case studies below.
