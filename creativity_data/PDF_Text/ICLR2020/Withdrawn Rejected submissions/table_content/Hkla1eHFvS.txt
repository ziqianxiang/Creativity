Table 1: Environment parameters specifying the observation space dimension |S |; action spacedimension |A|; max episode length T ; the environment reward, related to the target distribution byexp{renv(s)} a P*(s), and other environment parameters.
Table 2: Per-epoch Wall-clock time on the Manipulation environment. One epoch is 1e3 env. steps.
Table 3: Hyperparameter Settings. Hyperparameters were chosen according to the following eval metrics:Manip.-Uniform: State entropy of the discretized gripper and block positions (bin size 0.05), after rolling out thetrained policy for 50K env steps. Manip.-Half: DKL(P*(s) k ρ∏ (S)) and TV(p* (s),ρ∏ (S)) of the discretizedgripper and block positions (bin size 0.01), after rolling out the trained policy for 50K env steps. 2D Navigation:State entropy of the discretized XY-positions of the trained policy. D’Claw: State entropy of the object angle.
