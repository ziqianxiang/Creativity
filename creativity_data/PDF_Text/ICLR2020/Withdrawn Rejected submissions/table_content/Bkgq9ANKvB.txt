Table 1: Experiment results on 10 UCI Benchmarks (N+ , N- are the numbers of positive and negative sam-ples). Surr: surrogate loss method (Natarajan et al., 2013); DMI: (Xu et al., 2019); Symm: symmetric lossmethod (Ghosh et al., 2015). Entries within 2% from the best in each row are highlighted in bold. All resultsare averaged across 8 random seeds. Neural-network-based methods (Peer, Surrogate, NN, Symmetric, DMI)use the same hyper-parameters. Full table with complete set of comparisons is in Appendix.

Table 3: Experiment Results on 10 UCI Benchmarks. Entries within 2% from the best in each roware in bold. Surr: surrogate loss method (Natarajan et al., 2013); DMI: (Xu et al., 2019); Symm:symmetric loss method (Ghosh et al., 2015). All method-specific parameters are estimated throughcross-validation. The pro- posed method (Peer) are competitive across all the datasets. Neural-network-based methods (Peer, Surrogate, NN, Symmetric, DMI) use the same hyper-parameters.
