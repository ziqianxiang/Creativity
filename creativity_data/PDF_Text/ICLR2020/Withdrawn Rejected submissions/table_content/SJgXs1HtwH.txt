Since there is no alternative approach existing in the literature for routinga variable set of capsules to a static set of capsules, we compare the proposed routing algorithmwith dynamic pooling. The output of the PVC layer, Xpvc ∈ RNpvc ×Dpvc consists of a variablecomponent, Npvc. Using dynamic max pooling across all the Npvc capsules will result in one outputcapsule, Xdmp ∈ R1×Dpvc. Since Xdmp has no variable components across the training samples,2Collected from https://github.com/crestonbunch/tbcnn.
