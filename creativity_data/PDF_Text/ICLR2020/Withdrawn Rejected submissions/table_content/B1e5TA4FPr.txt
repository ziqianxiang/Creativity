Table 7: Basic characteristics of real datasetsMIMIC-III. This dataset consist of clinical records collected from adult ICU patients at the BethIsrael Deaconess Medical Center (MIMIC-III dataset) Johnson et al. (2016). The goal is predictingpatient mortality from clinical notes. We follow the pre-processing methodology outlined in Chenet al. (2018), where we analyze clinical notes acquired during the first 48 hours of ICU admission;discharge notes where excluded, as where ICU stays under 48 hours. Tf-idf statistics on the 10, 000most frequent words in clinical notes are taken as input features.
Table 8: Summary of network architectures and losses. All networks have a final softmax dense layer as theoutput layer.. CE refers to crossentropy and BS to Brier score or categorical MSE. Training was done usingADAM optimizer with the learning rates (lr) specified in the table.
