Table 1: Summary of gating mechanisms considered in this work as applied to the main forget/inputgates of recurrent models. To preserve parameters, refine gate methods use a tied input gate, and mastergate methods use a downsize factor C> 1. (Left) Existing approaches and our main method. (right)Ablations of our gates with different components.
