Table 1: Approximation. For each method, the discriminators are trained 20 times for 500 iterationson minibatches of size 64 drawn without replacement, after which training is stopped and the errorbetween the ground truth and the estimate are computed.
Table 2: Stability. The discriminators are trained using two training batch sizes, N = 64 andN = 512. Then, the distances between the measures are estimated, by evaluating the discriminatorson the full measures (of size M = 512), or by evaluating minibatch-wise with batch size M = 64.
