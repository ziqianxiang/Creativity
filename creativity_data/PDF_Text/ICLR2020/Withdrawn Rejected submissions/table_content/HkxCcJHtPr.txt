Table 1: Results for ResNet-18, ResNet-50, and SSD512. For comparison we include the resultsobtained by Gudovskiy et al. (2018) for the SSD512 model on the same task but with a differentbackbone, for which we obtain a better compression rate with a lower accuracy degradation. Computedenotes activation bitwidth used for arithmetic operations. Memory denotes average number of bits formemory transactions (after compression). Compression ratio denotes the reduction in representationsize. Weight bitwidth is 8 except the full-precision experiments. Additional experimental results areprovided in Appendix A.
