Table 1: FID score comparison of different layer translation. Each translation was trained indepen-dently. We compare the FID scores on three datasets, measured both directions per dataset. The twodirections appear side-by-side, →/-, at each cell.
Table 2: FID score comparison. We compare FID scores on three datasets, measured for bothtranslation directions per dataset. The two directions appear side-by-side, →/-, at each cell.
Table 3: Deepest layer translation architecture.
Table 4: AdaIN component for the second deepest layer. The output x is equal to the number ofparameters the AdaIN normalizes. AdaIN for different VGG layer’s translation are defined similarly,where we simply add more conv layer for each shallower VGG layer.
Table 5: Coarse to fine translator. The input number of channels, x, varies according to the currentVGG layer.
