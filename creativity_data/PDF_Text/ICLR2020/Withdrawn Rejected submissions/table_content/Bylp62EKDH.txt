Table 1: Retrieval Performance on the CUB, CAR, SOP and In-shop datasets comparing to the bestreported results for more complex approaches and/or ensembles. All test are trained with ResNet50negative mining (EPSHN) and easy-positive hard-negative mining (EPHN) for both 1st order and2nd order loss functions on CUB, CAR, SOP and In-shop dataset. Figure 4 shows a another gap ofL2nd with EPHN and EPSHN on CUB, CAR and In-shop dataset for most choices of the group sizen of elements per class in each batch. This result indicates that both Problem 1 and 2 are importantfor metric learning.
