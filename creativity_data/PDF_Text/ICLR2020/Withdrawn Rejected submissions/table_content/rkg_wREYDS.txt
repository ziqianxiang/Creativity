Table 1: Multi-domain Medical Image Completion Resultstime. Then we investigate a more general scenario when there are more than one missing domainsand show that our proposed method is capable to handle the general random n-to-n image com-pletion. Multiple quantitative metrics are used to evaluate the similarity between the generatedimage and original one, i.e., normalized root mean-squared error (NRMSE) and mean structuralsimilarity index (SSIM) between generated images and target images. We compare our results withprevious arts on all three datasets for this task. The results of the proposed method (“ReMIC”),ReMIC without reconstruction loss (“ReMIC w/o Recon”) and ReMIC with cross-domain transla-tion (“ReMIC+Multi-Sample”, more details in Appendix C.2) are reported. Note that in our method,by leveraging the unified content code and sampling the style code for each domain respectively, theproposed model could handle any number of domain missing, which is more general and flexiblefor the random n-to-n image completion. Besides, these compared methods have their own limits.

Table 5: ProstateX results: multi-domain image completion (full table)for high-level tasks. As shown in Fig. 2, a segmentation branch is added after the learned contentcode to generate segmentation prediction map. We adopt dice loss as the segmentation loss in thetraining. We run the segmentation experiments on both BraTS and ProstateX datasets, and use dicescore as evaluation metric. In the following, we look into two specific settings in missing-domainsegmentation.
Table 6: RaFD results: Multi-domain image completion (full table)and the nearest neighbor (NN) among training samples. We show the dice scores for these base-line methods in Table 7. Oracle results give the average testing dice score when all the domainsare available in inference. Each column shows the dice score of segmentation prediction when thecurrent domain is missing during inference. Moreover, based on image translation methods, we cangenerate fake images for missing domain imputation, and the results for different methods are alsoshown in Table 7. We show that our proposed method achieves the best dice score compared withall aforementioned baselines and other GAN-based image translation methods. This also indicatesthe our method could generate superior images preserving a better content representation throughdisentangled latent space. Furthermore, from the results in Table 7, we know that the T1Gd modalityand the T2 modality are the most significant contrasts in the segmentation of BraTS and ProstateXdata, whose missing will cause a severe decrease in dice score performance. Our method couldalleviate such a loss to a large extent. Here, the dice score for BraTS is the average number for thethree classes: WT, TC, and ET. Please see Table 9 in Appendix for a full table with all per-class dicescores.

Compared with WT and TC classes, ET class is definitely more challenging in thebrain tumor segmentation task, since enhancing tumor always just occupy a very small region amongthe whole tumor. In the ET class, we can see our method outperforms the other methods to a largeextent.
