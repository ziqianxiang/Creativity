Table 1: Sample context, query and answer triples and their training sizes per task. For distributionof generated number of examples per task on Sequence and Grid data refer to Appendix B.
Table 2: Aggregate error rates (%) on bAbI 1k for UMN and N2N, GN2N, MemNN by Sukhbaataret al. (2015), Liu & Perez (2017) and Weston et al. (2015) respectively. Full comparison on individ-ual tasks are available in Appendix D.
Table 3: Aggregate task error rates (%) on the logical reasoning dataset for UMN and DMN, IMA byCingillioglu & Russo (2019). Strong supervision, more data and only 1 invariant seem to improvethe performance of UMN over plain iterative models. Individual task results are in Appendix D.
Table 4: Sample context, query and answer triples from sequences and grid tasks.
Table 5: Training sizes for randomly generated fixed length sequences and grid tasks with 8 uniquesymbols. The reason for Grid task (i) to be smaller is because there are at most 32 combinations of2 × 2 boxes in a 3 × 3 grid with 8 unique symbols.

Table 7: Comparison of individual task error rates (%) on the bAbI (Weston et al., 2016) datasetof the best run. We preferred 1k results if a model had experiments published on both 1k and 10kfor data efficiency.
