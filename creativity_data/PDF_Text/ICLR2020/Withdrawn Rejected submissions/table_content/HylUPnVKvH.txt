Table 1: ResNet-44 gradient correlation on CIFAR10. We measure the Spearman correlation coef-ficient ρ between different spatial size of random images ρ x(s1) , x(s2) , as well as non-identicalrandom images of the same size ρ x(s1), y(s1) . We also compute the variance V (x) for the gradi-ents of each spatial size.
Table 2: Test accuracy (Top-1) results for CIFAR and ImageNet. Each row represents models trainedusing the same computational and memory budget per step. Steps and accuracy are reported at thecompletion of a fixed epoch budget (e.g., 90 epochs for ResNet on ImageNet, 200 for ResNet onCIFAR). Accuracy is reported for model’s original size (32 for CIFAR, 224 for ImageNet).
