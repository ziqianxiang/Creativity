Table 1: Result of objective evaluation for our singer models and a few baseline methods.
Table 2: Mean opinion scores (MOS) and standard deviations with respect to four evaluation criteriacollected from the user study, for three different versions of accompanied singer (female). Thescores are in 5-point Likert scale and are from 1 to 5; the higher the better.
Table 3: MOS from the second user study, comparing our model and two existing SVS systems.
Table 4: Network architecture of the generator (G) and the discriminator (D) of the proposedG3BEGAN model. It uses two G3 blocks introduced in Section 3.1. For the noise input, we setthe dimension U to 20. For the G and D of a free singer, the input dimensions are 20 and 80, re-spectively. For the G and D of an accompanied singer, the input dimensions are 100 = 20 + 80 and160 = 80 + 80, respectively.
Table 5: A summary of the datasets employed in this work. The first three datasets and the 4.5-hourPiano solo part of the last dataset are Jazz music, whereas the others may not. The ‘Processing’ col-umn indicates the music processing models that have been applied to process the respective dataset.
