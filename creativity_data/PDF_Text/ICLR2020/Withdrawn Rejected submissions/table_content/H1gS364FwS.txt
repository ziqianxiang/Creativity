Super-vised machine learning classifiers such naive bayes, support vector machine and decision tree haveused to detect events. Stand alone rule based approach and hybrid approach have also employed toextract events. Our system has been evaluated on our own data-set using standard evaluation metricsprecision, recall and F-measure. From the study we have showed that the hybrid approach have beeninformative, and outperformed the standalone rule based approach to extract events from the text.
