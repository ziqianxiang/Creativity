Table 1: Results on models and some AV on the test setRank	Model	Detection	Detection at 0.5%	Detection at 0.2%1	McAfee	0.993		-6^^	AVG	0.975		-7^^	ModelB	0.960	0.953	0.939-7^^	ModelA	0.961	0.950	0.8078	GData	0.940		Figure 3: Histogram of the AV detectionWe can also note that the ModelB is more robust and efficient than the two other, and maintain ahigh detection rate even at a FPR of 0.2%. Finally we remark that ModelA still performs as well at1%FPR. This suggests that imitating the AV work, with signature matching, seems like an effectiveapproach for detecting PDF malware.
