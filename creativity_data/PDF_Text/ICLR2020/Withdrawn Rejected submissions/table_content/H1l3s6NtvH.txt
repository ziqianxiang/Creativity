Table  1:  Classification  accuracy  values  for  the  different  symmetric  datasets  for  the  original  andadversarial (in brackets) samples.
Table 2:  Real test images classification accuracy for CNNs trained on real training data vs CNNstrained on samples from the symmetric dataset. Accuracy shown is for the robust CNNs.
