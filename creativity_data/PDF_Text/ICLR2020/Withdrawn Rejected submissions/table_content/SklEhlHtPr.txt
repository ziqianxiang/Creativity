Table 1: Results for the random and temporal split experiments performed on the benchmark dataset.
Table 2: The table indicates the hyperparameters that were tested for the DeepPCM model. Boldindicates the hyperparameters that were chosen for the final model based on performance on thevalidation set of the temporal splits.
