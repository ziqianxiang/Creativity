Table 1: Macro-F1 scores from political blog network classifications using graph topology em-beddings only. MONET is successful in removing all metadata information from the topologyembeddings - the links in the graph are no longer an effective predictor of political party. Comparisonof the metadata transformation product Î£T between GloVemeta and MONETG shows MONETallows for considerably more metadata information learning. Finally, only MONET removes metadataleakage to precision error (recall ML() is a Frobenius norm).
Table 2: Results from the shilling attack experiment. Attackers attempt to insert 10 items in the top-20recommendations of a target video. The results show that MONET can best mitigate the effect of anattack under incomplete information. We note that there is an implicit trade-off between debiasingand maintaining correlation with the original (biased) embeddings.
Table 3: Additional metrics from the political blogs experiment. Wall time is the user wait time duringtraining. SVM Accuracy is the accuracy on a non-linear SVM with an RBF kernel. EmbeddingDistance Correlation with GloVe is the Pearson correlation of the pairwise embedding distancesbetween each set of embeddings and GloVe embeddings.
