Table 1: Training losses, training error rates, and validation error rates with original dropout andmulti-sample dropout (after trained for 96 million images for ImageNet, 16 million images forImageNet-100, and 1,800 epochs for others). Multi-sample dropout reduced losses and error ratescompared with original dropout.
Table 2: Execution time per iteration relative to that of original dropout for different numbers ofdropout samples. Increasing the number of dropout samples lengthened the computation time periteration. We failed to execute VGG16 with 16 dropout samples due to the out-of-memory error.
