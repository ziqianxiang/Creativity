Table 1: KAR and ROAR results per dataset. The Difference Score shows the results using Eq8. The Information Score uses Eq 9. They are sorted by the average difference score (AVG). TheSMOE Scale from Eq 2 performs best overall using both scoring methods. The vanilla standarddeviation is second best. Recall it is SMOE with normal entropy. Truncated normal entropy isbest on the COWC set and ranks third overall. It is interesting to note that the difference in scoresover COWC are not as large as the other two datasets. The top four methods all are informationrelated and mean activation style methods are towards the bottom.

Table 2: Combined KAR and ROAR scores for several methods on ImageNet Only. The topthree rows show several popular methods with Squared SmoothGrad (Smilkov et al., 2017). Thesescores are created by simply summing the individual scores together. ROAR is negative since wewant it to be as small as possible. Prior Layer Weights means we applied layer weights based on theprior determined accuracy of the layer saliency map. We include our top three scoring methods. TheSMOE Scale method outperforms the three baseline methods on KAR. It outperforms Guided Back-prop and Integrated Gradients on ROAR as well as overall. The Gradient method is best overall, butas we discuss later, it is at least 1456 times more computationally expensive to compute. Truncatednormal entropy scores about the same as SMOE Scale. Since SMOE Scale gains its largest perfor-mance boost in the earlier layers, when we apply prior weighting, we reduce that advantage. Finergrain details can be seen in Appendix Table 5.
Table 3: Examples of SMOE Scale results given different data. This shows in particular whenlog variance and standard deviation give similar or diverging results. It is easier to see how SMOEScale as a measure or variance is proportional to the mean. So, if we have lots of large values in anoutput, we also need them to exhibit more variance relative to the mean activation.
Table 4: KAR and ROAR results per dataset. This is a more detailed version of Table 1 andFigure 4. The differing effects of the distribution of data in the three sets seems to manifest itself inthe L5 scores whereby the more concentrated the information is spatially, the better the ROAR/L5score seems to be.
Table 5: Combined KAR and ROAR scores for several methods. This is a more detailed versionof Table 2 and Figure 5. The top six rows show several popular methods with and without SquaredSmoothGrad applied to give optimal results. These are taken from (Hooker et al., 2018). PriorLayer Weights means we applied layer weights based on the prior determined accuracy of the layersaliency map. We include our top three scoring methods. The SMOE Scale method outperformsthe three baseline methods on KAR. It outperforms Guided Backprop and Integrated Gradients onROAR as well as overall. The Gradient method is best overall, but as we discussed, it is much moreexpensive to compute.
Table 6: FLOPs for each layer. This is the breakdown of FLOPs for each layer. Log and ErrorFunction are counted as one operation in this example. SMOE Ops is how many operations it takesto compute the initial saliency map using the SMOE Scale statistic. Norm Ops is the number ofoperations needed to normalize the saliency map. Combine Ops is the number of ops needed toupsample and combine each saliency map.
