Table 1: Comparison of model performance on synthetic Lorenz dataset. A hyphen indicates it isnot possible to compare, as the model does not infer this variable. The top row is italicized as itis considered the upper limit on performance in this task with LFADS since there is no additionalobservation noise from fluorescence.

Ofthe four methods tested, our model is the only one capable of reconstructing all three. Furthermore,our model performed best in reconstructing latent dynamics in our synthetic dataset We will need toassess our model on further synthetic benchmark data to assess the validity of our approach.
