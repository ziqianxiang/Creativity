Table 1: Test error (%) for CIFAR-10 (1st row) and CIFAR-100 (2nd row). In general, a model withmore parameters admits more space for our regularizer. The representation power of ResNet-20 istoo limited for CIFAR-100 (resulting in poor convergence); so we ignore it in our experiments.
Table 2: The proposed metric computed on local minima obained with or without applying theproposed regularizer. Each entry represents mean Â± std. among 5 runs. Smaller values are bolded.
