Table 1: Interventions: We perturb the learning process in order to understand the causes of differ-ent strategies during visual hide and seek. When the speed is “A”, the agent has allowed to accelerateto reach higher speeds at a rate of two units per time period squared.
Table 2: Hider Performance: We show the success rate and average number of living steps ofdifferent Hider agents and environments. The maximum number of steps for each episode is 1,000.
Table 3: Downstream Visual Perception Tasks: the table shows the classification accuracies ontwo important visual perception tasks using mid-level features from all the trained policies. Regard-less of the advantages of the hider agent and high performance in the hiding task, the “visibilityre-ward + faster” policy has the worst performance on both of the two tasks.
Table 4: Policy Network Architecture We list all the parameters used in the policy network.
