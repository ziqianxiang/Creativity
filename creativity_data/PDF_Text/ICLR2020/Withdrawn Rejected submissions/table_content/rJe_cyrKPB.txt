Table 1: Convolution to grouped bottleneck. We detail how the convolutional parameters can beapplied to the bottleneck when factorising using BTD for equivalency.
Table 2: Full network and fixed configuration accuracy and inference cost.
Table 3: Exhaustive search. Here we evaluate the top 2 configurations returned from the exhaustivewith the fixed configuration (bold) setting the upper bound for inference cost. We list the meanaccuracy and standard deviation from 5 runs of the fixed configuration when trained separately,as well as the median accuracy of all configurations in the GroSS decomposition. After the newconfigurations have been trained separately, we detail whether they are still more accurate than thefixed configuration. The numbers in the configuration column correspond to the group-size of eachdecomposed layer within the network.
