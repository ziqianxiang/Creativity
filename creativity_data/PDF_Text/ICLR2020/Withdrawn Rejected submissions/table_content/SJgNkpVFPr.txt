Table 1: Performance in the last 100 iterations in terms of the mean and standard error of cumulativerewards over 5 trials (higher is better). Boldfaces indicate best and comparable methods according tot-test with significance level 0.01. (G) denotes Gaussian noisy policy and (TSD) denotes time-signal-dependent noisy policy. The performance of VAIL is similar to that of GAIL and is omitted. Theperformance of InfoGAIL (best context) is overall similar to that of InfoGAIL and is also omitted.
Table 2: Performance of a random policy π0,the optimal policy ∏<, and demonstrators withthe Gaussian noisy policy.
Table 3: Performance of a random policy π0 ,the optimal policy ∏<, and demonstrators withthe TSD noisy policy.
Table 4: Performance in the last iterations in terms of the mean and standard error of cumulativerewards over 5 trials (higher is better) in the robosuite reaching task. Boldfaces indicate best andcomparable methods according to t-test with significance level 0.01.
