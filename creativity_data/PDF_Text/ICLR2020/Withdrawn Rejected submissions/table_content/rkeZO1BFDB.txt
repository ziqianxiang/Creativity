Table 1: Performance comparison for zero-shot setting. Reported results are averages of5 individualruns. train w/ MT indicates the model trained with Chinese MT data. meta-learner is our basicframework in Figure 1. meta+txt2img equips the meta-learner with txt2img module. The first threemodels are all for zero-shot learning. The last one, train w/ AN is to train the agent with 100%Chinese human annotated data. All models are tested with Chinese human instructions.
Table 2: Performance comparison for cross-lingual VLN models. All models are trained and testedwith English and Chinese annotation data. Results are averaged over 3 runs.
Table 3: Performance comparison on the English test set. The first two rows are for zero-shotlearning, the last two rows are trained with access to 100% target training data (i.e. English annotatedinstructions).
Table 4: Ablation study for the meta-learner. Reported results are averages of 5 individual runs. en-semble is to assign equal weight to each language. meta-learner is our basic framework in Figure 1.
Table 5: Ablation study for domain adaptation. Reported results are averages of 3 individ-ual runs on Chinese human instructions. meta+txt2img is our model for zero-shot setting.
