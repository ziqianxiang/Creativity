Table 1: Number of variational parameters for a variationalfamily for a matrix W ∈ Rm×n. MN (diagonal) is fromLouizos & Welling (2016).
Table 2: Impact of low-rank approximation of the GMFVI-trained posterior standard deviation matrix on100 models samples.
Table 3: Impact of the low-rank approximation of the GMFVI-trained posterior standard deviations of aResNet-18 model on the model’s ELBO and predictive performance. We report mean and SEM of each metricacross 100 models samples.
Table 4: Training step evaluation times for a simple model architecture with two dense layers5 for differenttraining methods. We report mean and SEM across a single training run. The k-tied Normal posterior doesnot increase the train step evaluation times compared to the standard parameterization of the GMFVI posterior.
