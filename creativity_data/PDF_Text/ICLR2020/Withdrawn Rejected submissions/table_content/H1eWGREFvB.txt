Table 1: Averaged test RMSE and test log-likelihood on UCI datasets. Results are averaged over 20trails. The boldface indicates the method has the best average performance and the underline marksthe methods that perform the best with a significance level of 0.05.
Table 2: Cumulative Regrets on two bandits problem. Results are averaged over 10 trails. Boldfaceindicates the methods with best performance and underline marks the best significant methods withsignificant level 0.05.
Table 3: Comparing SRLD with different number of samples with SVGD on test RMSE. The resultsare computed oVer 20 trials. For SRLD, the Value is set to be boldface if it has better aVerageperformance than SVGD. The Value if with underline if it is significantly better than SVGD withsignificant leVel 0.05 using a matched pair t-test.
