Table 1: Comparison of results on different benchmarks. S-1 represents the supervised learningmodel via 13 conv layers and S-2 represents supervised learning model via ResNet-101. MN and RWindicate the MentorNet and Reweight approach respectively. Error rate percentage % is used as themeasurement unit.

This dataset contains32 × 32 pixels RGB images belonging to ten different classes. To have a fair comparison, we followthe same experimental setting as used in (Tarvainen & Valpola, 2017). We randomly select 100 datasamples from each category. In total, 4, 000 labeled data samples are included in the training set. Therest of the training data are used for unlabeled data. The results are summarized in Table 1. From thelisted results, we can see that UMN achieves the best performance among all experiments.
