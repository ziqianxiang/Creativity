This confirmsthat the theory was applied consistently and that the group theoretic approach benefits attentionmechanisms. We ran a subset of the models on Cifar100, results are shown in Table 1. The tableshows that both ASC and roto-translation equivariance are more beneficial on this dataset. Thisindicates that these models generalize better when there is less data available.
