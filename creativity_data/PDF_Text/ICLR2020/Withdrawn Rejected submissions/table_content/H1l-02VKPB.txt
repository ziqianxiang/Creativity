We evaluate them on PTC, IMDB-MULTI, andREDDIT-BINARY datasets and summarize the results in Table 3. Note that these models use the sameexperimental setups to ensure fair comparisons. The results demonstrate the superior performance ofour proposed TAP layer compared with other pooling layers using the same network architecture.
