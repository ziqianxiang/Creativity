Table 1: A number of recurrent architectures written in the form 1. K is the set of pre-activationsubscripts, f is the state update function in eqn. (1a) and gk is the function in eqn. (1c). The LSTMcell state is unrolled in order to emphasize that it can be written as a function of variables that areGaussian at the large N limit. See Table 3 for additional architectures.
Table 2: Test accuracy on unrolled MNIST andCIFAR-10.
Table 3: Additional recurrent architectures written in the form 1. pt is the output of the network atevery time step. See Table 1 for more details.
