Table 1: Number of parameters (in thousands) left in each model at each pruning fraction.
Table 2: Sub-network accuracies at each pruning iteration. Ensembling of sub-networks obtainedthrough different pruning techniques can yield higher performance, hinting at the complementarityof information learned by each sub-network.
