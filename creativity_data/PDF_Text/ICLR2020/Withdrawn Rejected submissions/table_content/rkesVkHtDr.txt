Table 1: On the test set of class (low-freq), MLRK was considerably faster (less many steps) thanthe baseline controller on average, while causing only a mildly larger mean global error at the endof the integration interval. Both the baseline controller and MLRK showed a gradually increasingmean global error at the end of the integration interval over the test set consisting of 1500 harmonicoscillators of class (med-freq).
Table 3: The mean number of steps, local error and wall clock time over 1500 van der Pol equationsare shown for different lengths of the integration interval. Our method err is slightly faster anduses less steps than the baseline while producing smaller local errors during the integration, see alsoFigure 3. While partial and grad reduce the number of steps even further, wall time is increased.
Table 4: The mean values over the test set consisting of 1000 harmonic oscillators of class (high-freq)are shown. While the baseline needs much more steps than our trained model, it achieves a smallerglobal error. The global error of the baseline stays approximately the same for all integration intervals.
Table 5: The mean number of steps and the mean global error at the end of the integration intervalwas computed over a test set of 1500 harmonic oscillators of class (higher-freq). While the baselinecontroller needs much more steps than our learned controller, it has on average a lower global error,which stays approximately the same for different interval lengths.
