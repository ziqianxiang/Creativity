Table 1: Comparison of candidate saliency map generator methods described in Section 3.2. Wereport AUC for the insertion and deletion metrics described in Section 4.1.
Table 2: Comparison of how attribute recognition (mAP) and attribute explanation (insertion, dele-tion) metrics described in Section 4.2 are affected for different approaches. We use fixed-referenceRISE as our saliency map generator for both datasets. Higher numbers are better for all metrics.
Table 3: Runtime comparison of the compared saliency generation methods and how using a fixedreference image, or manipulating both the query and reference images affects performance.
Table 4: Discovered attribute explanation performance comparison using the full SANE model.
