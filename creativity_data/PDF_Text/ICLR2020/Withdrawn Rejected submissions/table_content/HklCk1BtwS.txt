Table 1: The performance and similarity corresponding to α = 0 (SVD embedding) and α = 0.5(symmetric embedding). Left is the peformance on every testset and right is the similarity computedby equation 3, considering the words appearing in that testset.
Table 2: The results of incorporating α to the original SGNS.
Table 3: The performance and similarity corresponding to different α. Left is the peformance onevery testset and right is the similarity computed by equation 3, considering the words appearing inthat testset.
