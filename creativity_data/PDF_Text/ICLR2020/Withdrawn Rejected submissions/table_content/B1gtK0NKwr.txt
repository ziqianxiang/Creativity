Camera coordinate has theorigin at the focal point, and axes aligned with the orientation of the camera. We define the focalcoordinate to have its origin also at the focal point, but with axes aligned with the world coordinate(the coordinate system used in Appendix C.1). RCF is the rotation matrix that transforms fromcamera coordinate to focal coordinate. Pp represents the projection to the road plane through thefocal point, in the focal coordinate. Finally, TFW is the translation matrix that transforms from the
