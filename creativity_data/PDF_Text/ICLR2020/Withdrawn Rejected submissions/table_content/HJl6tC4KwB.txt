Table 1: Quantitative comparison: inception score (IS), text-image similarity (sim), L₁ pixel differ-ence (diff), and manipulative precision (MP) of state-of-the-art approaches and ManiGAN on theCUB and COCO datasets.  “w/o CoA” denotes without co-attention module.  “w/ Concat.” denotesusing concatenation method to combine hidden and image features.  “w/o main” denotes withoutmain module.  “w/o DCM” denotes without detail correction module.  For IS, similarity, and MP,higher is better; for pixel difference, lower is better.
