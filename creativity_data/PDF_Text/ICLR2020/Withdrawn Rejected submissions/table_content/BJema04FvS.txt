Table 1: Comparison of Point cloud smoothing algorithms. Mesh refers to meshing and smoothing, Taubinrefers to directly applying Taubin smoothing to point clouds. DDS below 0.05 are italicized, indicating extremeunsmoothness. It can be seen both Taubin and Ours converged well, but Taubin is very unsmooth in the middle.

In order to smooth the point clouds without abrupt changes, we proposeda novel smoothing approach that gradually smooths the point clouds and eventually converge toa shape with constant mean curvature. Experiment results show that our algorithm outperformsbaselines on both point cloud smoothing and classifier visualization. As compared with 2D resultsin Qi et al. (2019), the 3D shapes consistently show higher deletion metric and lower insertionmetrics, indicating that point cloud networks use more parts than 2D image CNNs to classify. Wehope those visualization results improve our understanding on these new networks.
