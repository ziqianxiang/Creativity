Table 1: Dataset statistics. Density: % ratings relative to the total amount of user-item combinations.
Table 2: NDCG@K of our method (VaHSM-CF) against baselines using hash codes of length 32and 64 bits. The missing results for CCCF on Amazon are due to the model requiring more than 128GB of RAM. Statistically significant improvements using a paired two tailed t-test at the 0.05 level,compared to the best existing hashing-based baseline (DCF), are indicated by *.
