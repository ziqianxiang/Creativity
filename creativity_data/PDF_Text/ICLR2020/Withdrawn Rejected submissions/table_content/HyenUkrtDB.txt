Table 1: Test-error comparison of noisy-data training methods on datasets with corrupted train-ing labels. All methods train a ResNet-32 on the CIFAR10/CIFAR100 datasets with varyingamounts/types of label noise. (Uniform: mislabeled samples are assigned a random incorrect la-bel. Pair Flip: mislabeled samples are assigned ato a class-specific incorrect label.)Dataset Noise Model % Mislabeled	Uniform 0.20	Uniform 0.40	CIFAR10 Uniform 0.60	Uniform 0.80	Pair Flip 0.40	Uniform 0.20	Uniform 0.40	CIFAR100 Uniform 0.60	Uniform 0.80	Pair Flip 0.40Standard	23.2 ± 0.2	40.3 ± 0.5	57.1 ± 0.5	75.3 ± 0.5	40.3 ± 0.2	50.3 ± 0.3	62.0 ± 0.7	76.0 ± 0.1	91.1 ± 0.7	61.8 ± 0.6Random	16.5 ± 0.7	22.8 ± 1.6	35.8 ± 2.8	55.6 ± 5.5	21.2 ± 0.1	43.0 ± 0.1	51.2 ± 0.5	63.5 ± 0.9	83.7 ± 1.8	51.4 ± 0.4Reed-Hard	22.4 ± 0.4	37.4 ± 0.9	52.0 ± 0.5	68.8 ± 0.9	37.2 ± 0.2	48.6 ± 0.3	58.9 ± 0.5	70.3 ± 0.4	89.8 ± 1.6	58.8 ± 0.7MentorNet-PD	13.3 ± 0.2	18.1 ± 0.4	—-	66.0 ± 4.9	—-	35.8 ± 0.6	42.5 ± 0.4	—-	75.7 ± 1.4	—-Co-Teaching	11.2 ± 0.2	13.5 ± 0.2	19.3 ± 0.2	80.7 ± 1.2	16.9 ± 0.6	35.9 ± 0.2	39.8 ± 0.4	52.0 ± 0.5	89.1 ± 1.4	51.7 ± 0.4D2L	12.3 ± 0.5	15.6 ± 0.6	27.3 ± 1.2	Diverged	23.6 ± 3.0	46.0 ± 2.0	70.3 ± 3.6	Diverged	Diverged	83.1 ± 2.3INCV	10.5 ± 0.2	13.2 ± 0.2	18.9 ± 0.5	46.7 ± 3.8	16.1 ± 1.0	41.4 ± 0.9	44.6 ± 0.4	56.3 ± 0.6	76.3 ± 1.1	52.0 ± 0.6AUL	9.2 ± 0.1	11.5 ± 0.2	16.0 ± 0.3	37.8 ± 2.4	11.1 ± 0.3	34.2 ± 0.4	39.9 ± 0.6	50.5 ± 1.0	76.5 ± 0.9	40.2 ± 0.2Oracle	9.0 ± 0.1	9.7 ± 0.8	10.8 ± 1.8	12.6 ± 3.5	10.8 ± 0.1	35.5 ± 0.1	39.0 ± 0.4	44.8 ± 1.0	55.1 ± 0.7	38.6 ± 0.7corrupt the labels of the CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets according to two predefined noise mod-els. The uniform noise model assumes that discrepancies between true labels and observed labelsare random. A given label can be changed to any other class label with equal probability. The pairflip noise model assumes that mislabeling mistakes depend on the true label. If an observed label isincorrect, then it will belong to only one other possible class. More formally, if p is the percentageof mislabeled points, we have
