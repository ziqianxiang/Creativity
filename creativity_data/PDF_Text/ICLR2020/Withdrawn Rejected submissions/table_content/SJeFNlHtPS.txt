Table 1: Rewards for the HIDS unit test. Note that the myopic defect action always increasesreward at the current time-step, but decreases reward at the next time-step - the incentive is hiddenfrom the point of view of a myopic learner. A supposedly myopic learner ‘fails’ the unit test if theincentive to cooperate is revealed, i.e. if we see more cooperate actions than defect.
Table 2: β controls the extent to which myopic and nonmyopic incentives are aligned.
