For all the models, the maximum '∞ perturbation is e∞ = 8/255 of the pixel dynamicrange and the False Positive Rate of the clean input are 5%. The best detection performance arehighlighted in bold.

In contrast,our proposed reconstruction-based detection mechanism has the best undetected rate in detectingdefense-aware adversarial attacks and a very small undetected rate of 4.6% in detecting CW attacks.
