Table 1: FID scores on the CelebA extrapolation task.
Table 2: Correlation between observed change in spike-ins and applied change to samples. Neu-ron editing most accurately applies just the transformation observed as batch effect and not truebiological variation.
Table 3: Correlation between real and predicted means/variances on the combinatorial drug predic-tion data. The GANs generate data that is less accurate (means are off) and less diverse (variancesare smaller) than the real data, while neuron editing best models the true distribution.
