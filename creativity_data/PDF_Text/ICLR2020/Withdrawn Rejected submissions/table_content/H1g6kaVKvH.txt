Table 1: Results of Long-term Remembering (LTR).
Table 2: Comparison of MEGA and MEGA-D.
Table 3: Results on Many Permutation.
Table 4: The results of Average Accuracy (AT), Forgetting Measure (FT) and LCA of differentmethods on Permuted MNIST and Split CIFAR. The results are averaged across 5 runs with dif-ferent random seeds.
Table 5: The results of Average Accuracy (AT), Forgetting Measure (FT) and LCA of differentmethods on Split CUB and Split AWA. The results are averaged across 10 runs with differentrandom seeds.
Table 6: Comparison of MEGA-C, MEGA and A-GEMMethods	Permuted MNIST AT (%)	Split CIFAR AT (%)	Split CUB AT (%)	Split AWA AT (%)MEGA	91.21 ± 0.10	66.12 ± 1.93	80.58 ± 1.94	54.28 ± 4.84MEGA-C	91.15 ± 0.12	58.04 ± 1.89	68.60 ± 1.98	47.95 ± 4.54A-GEM	89.32 ± 0.46	61.28 ± 1.88	61.82 ± 3.72	44.95 ± 2.97From Table 6 we observe that except on Split CIFAR, MEGA-C outperforms A-GEM on all thedatasets. This demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach for modifying gradient direction.
