The result is depictedin terms of parameters including the number of roots generated mean of words perconflation class and in-dex compression factor. Based on the results of stemmers,the strength of our stemmer is weaker (or lighter) than Hornmorpho by nearly afactor of 0.5. That means, hornmorpho removes more affix related strings whichcould contain semantic information as it removes affixes to get root from input word.
Table 3: The categories of errors generated by stemmers (Ours and HornMorpho) on small corpus(300 words)Error Types	Number of errors (in %)		Our Stemmer	HornMorphoUnder-Stemming	9%(28)	20%(60)Over-Stemming	0%(1)	4%(11)Spelling errors	^0%	^0%Unchanged	3%(15)	1%(3)Others	8%(24)	6%(17)Accuracy	77%(231)	一	70%(208)	一Discussion: For small corpus of 300 words, stemmer errors related to under-stemming,over-stemming, spelling errors, unchanged (input word is unchanged), accuracy andother error reports are presented in Table 3. The errors related to under-stemming andover-stemming of hornmorpho is higher than our Stemmer. The word 单笈n^/'kidus’means 'saint' /is stemmed 孕4_KC and 孕4C by hornmorpho and our stemmer. Butour stemmer is correctly generating the root word 孕4九 Hornmorpho generates stem单4_KC which is not in root form and its stem size greater than the root size. Thismight be error related to under-stemming. On the other hand, our stemmer leavesgreater number of input words than hornmorpho. Similarly, the numbers of inputwords without root are greater in our stemmer. However, the accuracy (77%) of

Table 4 presents the results of sentimentclassification using our stemmer and HornMorpho. The result reveals the effect ofstemming operations on Amharic texts improving the performance of Amharic senti-ment classification. The accuracy of Amharic sentiment classification increases from53.7% to 86.2% by our stemmer and 53.7% to 67.9% by hornmorpho. In conclusion,the results of our stemmer and Hornmorph shows that applying stemmer is necessaryfor efficient Amharic sentiment classification revealing that our stemmer preserves sen-timent information than root stemmers (Alemayehu & Willett, 2002; Gasser, 2017).
