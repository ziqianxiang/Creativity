Table 1: Biased MNIST results. Architecture families are set as F = LeNet and G = BlindNet1 forSingle-bias and BlindNet3 for Multi-bias MNIST. Accuracy results are shown.
Table 2: Factor analysis. DefaultREBI’S parameters: last rows.
Table 3: ImageNet results. We show results with F and F⊥⊥G corresponding to (F is ResNet18 and G isBagNet18) and (F is ResNet50 and G is BagNet50). IN-A indicates ImageNet-A.
