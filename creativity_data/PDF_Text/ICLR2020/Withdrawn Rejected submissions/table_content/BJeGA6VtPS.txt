Table 1: Test accuracy of RN50 trained on different tasks. Mean and standard deviation are computedover 5 individual runs. See text for details.
Table 2: Test accuracy of RN50 trained on different tasks combined with training a regression modelfor SVHN. Mean and standard deviation are computed over 5 individual runs. See text for details.
Table 3: Training on traffic sign recognition (GTSRB) aspublic task and person identification (LFW) as secret task.
Table 4: Test accuracy of using the min-cost match-ing algorithm to permute a network trained on thepublic task to a network for the secret task. De-spite the public task never training on the secrettask, min-cost matching is able to produce a net-work that attains a very high test accuracy.
Table 5: Test accuracies of RN50 with group normalization trained on different tasks. Mean andstandard deviation are computed over 5 individual runs. See text for details.
