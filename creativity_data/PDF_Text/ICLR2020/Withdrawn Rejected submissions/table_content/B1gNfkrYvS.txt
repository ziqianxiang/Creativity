Table 1: Comparison between P-CapsNets and CapsNets with routing procedures in terms of errorrate on MNIST. The number in each routing type means the number of routing times.
Table 2: Comparison between P-CapsNets and three compressing algorithms in terms of error rateon MNIST.
Table 3: Comparison between P-CapsNets and several CapsNets with routing procedures in termsof error rate on CIFAR10. The number in each routing type is the number of routing times.
Table 4: Robustness of P-CapsNets. The attacking method is FGSM Goodfellow et al. (2014). Inthis table, we use The baseline is the same CNN model in Sabour et al. (2017).
Table 5: Comparison on time consumed between CPU mode and acceleration solutionC Acceleration Solution for P-CapsNetsDifferent from convolution operations in CNNs, which can be interpreted as a few large matrixmultiplications during training, the capsule convolutions in P-CaspNets have to be interpreted as12Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2020a large number of small matrix multiplication. If we use the current acceleration library likeCuDNN (Chetlur et al. (2014)) or the customized convolution solution in CAFFE (Jia et al. (2014)),too many communication times would be incorporated which slows the whole training process a lot.
