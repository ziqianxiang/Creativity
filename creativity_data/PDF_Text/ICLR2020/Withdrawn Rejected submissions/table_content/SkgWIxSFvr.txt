Table 1: The length ratio of Euclidean interpolation to geodesic. The Riemannian distance and thedistance in the latent space are computed. We randomly sample 100 pairs of points and interpolatebetween each pair. The mean and the standard deviation of the ratios are listed below.
Table 2: Comparisons between different descriptors for the purposes of object tracking and re-identification (Ristani et al., 2016). The bold and the red numbers denote the best results among allmethods and among non-supervised methods, respectively.
Table 3: Model architectures. FC refers to fully-connected layers. Conv2D and Conv2DT denotetow-D convolution layer and transposed two-D convolution layer, respectively. See the definition ofÎ½ in (Klushyn et al., 2019).
