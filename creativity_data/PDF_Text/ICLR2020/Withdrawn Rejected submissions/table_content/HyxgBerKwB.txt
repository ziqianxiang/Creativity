Table 1: Comparison of state-of-the-art QA methods. At the residue level we compare LDDTscores and report Pearson correlation and Pearson correlation per model. At the global level wecompare GDTTS scores and report Pearson correlation and Pearson correlation per target.

A low cutoff implies a sparsely connected graph, with few edges and long pathsbetween nodes. A higher cutoff yields a denser graph with more edges and shorter paths.
