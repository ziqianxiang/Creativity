Compared with GNN,GLENN achieves nearly the same performance and gets little better score with respect to ROC-AUC. As for GENN, it outperforms others with respect to all metrics in both datasets which give the

For the first pair of DDI type,decreasing metabolism has large correlation with increasing the bradycardic activities in groundtruth but GNN only got medium correlation coefficient much lower than GENN’. As for the lasttwo pairs of DDI type, GNN performed bad and gave a nearly zero coefficient for the second andoverestimated the coefficient for the last. In the meantime, GENN corresponds with the ground truthwhich in some extent gives the evidence that GENN has the power to capture correlation betweenlabels.
