Table 1: Number of sentences and tokens for all corpora used. For WP, we report the sizes forboth the monolingual/comparable editions. Sizes for pseudo-comparable EP corpora are reportedfor both true+false splits. Average sentences per article (0) is given for all comparable corpora.
Table 2: BLEU, TER and METEOR scores of the self-supervised NMT systems trained on the threeen-{fr, de, es} comparable WPs and tested on NT13âˆ•NT14. We compare the performance withcurrent state-of-the-art (SOTA) systems in supervised NMT (Edunov et al.) / unsupervised NMT(Lample et al., 2018b) / unsupervised NMT+SMT (Artetxe et al., 2019).
Table 3: BLEU scores of a supervised NMT system trained on Wikimatrix as well as the uniquepairs collected by SS-NMT in the first (NMTinit), intermediate (NMTmid), final (NMTend) andall (NMTall) epochs of training. Evaluation performed on NT14 (en-{f r,de}) and NT13 (en-es)respectively.
