Table 1: Results from training a DNN on ISIC to recognize skin cancer (averaged over three runs).
Table 2:	Results on ColorMNIST (test accuracy). All values averaged over thirty runs. CDEP is theonly method that captures and removes color bias.
Table 3:	Results on Grayscale Decoy set.
Table 4:	Results on SST. CDEP substantially improves predictive accuracy on the unbiased test setafter training on biased data.
Table S1: Memory usage and run time were recorded for the DecoyMNIST task.
