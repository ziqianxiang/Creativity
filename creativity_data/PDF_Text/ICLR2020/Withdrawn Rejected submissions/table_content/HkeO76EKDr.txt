Table 2: PointWise localization performance over GlaS, CUB5, CUB, and OXF test sets.
Table 3: Impact of our incremental recursive erasing algorithm over the classification error of ourapproach over GlaS, CUB5, CUB, and OxF test sets.
Table 4: Impact of our incremental recursive erasing algorithm over the pointwise localizationperformance of our approach over GlaS, CUB5, CUB, and OxF test sets.
Table 5: Comparison of training time, of 1 run, over 400 epochs over GlaS and CUB5 of our modelusing identical computation resources (NVIDIA Tesla V100 with 12GB memory) when using ourerasing algorithm (u = 4) and without using it (u = 0).
Table 6: Pointwise localization performance of different WSL models over the different test setswhen post-processing the predicted masks using CRF (Krahenbuhl & Koltun, 2011). *+ indicatesimprovement while *- indicates degradation of performance compared to Tab.2. Deep MIL (Ilseet al., 2018) is discarded since the produced plans do not form probability over the classes axe atpixel level which is required for the CRF input (Krahenbuhl & Koltun, 2011). To preserve horizontalspace, we rename the methods CAM-Avg, CAM-Max, CAM-LSE, Grad-CAM to Avg, Max, LSE,G-C, respectively.
