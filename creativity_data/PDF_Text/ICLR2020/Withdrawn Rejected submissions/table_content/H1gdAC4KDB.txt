As we can see from the last column in Tables 1 and 2, the defense successrate of models trained using our proposed method is much higher than the baselines. In particular,the defense success rate of the model trained with λ = 0.3 in the 10k experiment is competitiveto the model trained using PGD-adv on the whole dataset. This clearly shows the advantage of ourproposed algorithm.
