Table 1: presents the spearman rank correlations between human selection frequency and AVH, Model Confidenceand L2 Norm of the Embedding in ResNet50 for different visual hardness bin of samples. Noted here we showthe absolute value of the coefficient which represents the strength of the correlation. For example, [0, 0.2]denotes the samples that have human selection frequency from 0 to 0.2.

Table 4: presents the spearman rank correlations between human selection frequency and AVH, Model Confidencein AlexNet. Noted here we show the absolute value of the coefficient which represents the strength of thecorrelation. Z value is computed by Z scores of both coefficients. p-value< 0.05 represents the result issignificant.
Table 5: presents the spearman rank correlations between human selection frequency and AVH, Model Confidencein VGG19. Noted here we show the absolute value of the coefficient which represents the strength of thecorrelation. Z value is computed by Z scores of both coefficients. p-value< 0.05 represents the result issignificant.
