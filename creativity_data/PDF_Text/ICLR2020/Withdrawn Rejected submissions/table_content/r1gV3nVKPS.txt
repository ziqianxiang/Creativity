Table 1: Results on MNIST dataset using Ballistic filters with K = 8 compared with traditionaldiffusion-based graph convolutional network with K = 25 in Defferrard et al. (2016)Baselines We compare our approaches with the following baselines:6Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 202015 Âçú......................
Table 3: Accuracy with different randomized Hadamard operations. We use 25 filters with differentsteps and randomness for each case.
