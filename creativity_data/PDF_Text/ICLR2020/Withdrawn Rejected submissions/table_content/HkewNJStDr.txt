Table 1: Comparison of some properties of the hard thresholding algorithms for solving sparsity-constrainedproblems. |B| is the mini-batch size of block coordinate descent methods, and k is the number of coordinateblocks. Since the sparsity level S = Ω(κgs*) required in our algorithms (i.e., SBCD-HTP and its parallelvariant, ASBCD-HTP) is much smaller than those of other algorithms (e.g., Ω(K2s*)), the condition numberKb in our algorithms is also smaller than Ke in other algorithms, where b= 2Ω(κgs*)+s* and Se= 2Ω(κes*)+s*.
