Table 1: Summary of our framework-differential privacy (-DP), which uses ∞-divergence to measure the distance between the prob-abilities of predictions on randomized natural samples and randomized adversarial samples and istherefore called D∞ robustness. The other is inspired by -zero concentrated differential privacy(E-ZCDP) that uses the Maximal Relative Renyi (MR) divergence as the probability distance mea-surement and is called DMR robustness. For both of them, we focus on certifying robustness ineither '2 or '∞ norm by randomized smoothing. Specifically, our contributions are five-fold:1.	We propose a unified and self-contained framework for certifying D∞ and/or DMR robust-ness in '2 and '∞ norms by randomized smoothing.
