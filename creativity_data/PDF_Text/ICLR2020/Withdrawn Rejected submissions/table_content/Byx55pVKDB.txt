Table 1: Architecture of the custom NN.
Table 2: OOD and adversarial example detection results on MNIST and CIFAR-10, for both thecustom NN and the Wide Residual Network (referred to as WR-28-8). The best result for eachmetric/experience, in italic, is always achieved by the NN-based detector. However, as this detector isthe only one which has the advantage of knowing beforehand the OOD and adversarial datasets, wealso highlight the second best results in bold.
Table 3: Comparison of detection performances between using the softmax and logits values as inputfor both the KDE and NN detectors. For each detector, the best result of each settings is in bold.
