Table 1: Accuracy of various classification models on the datasets, with and without defenses, un-der adversarial attacks. For each model (Word-CNN, LSTM, or Bi-LSTM), if we look at each row,the highest classification accuracy for various defense methods is highlighted in bold to indicatethe best defense efficacy; if we look at each column, the lowest classification accuracy under var-ious adversarial attacks is highlighted in Underline to indicate the best attack efficacy. NT: NormalTraining, AT: Adversarial Training.
