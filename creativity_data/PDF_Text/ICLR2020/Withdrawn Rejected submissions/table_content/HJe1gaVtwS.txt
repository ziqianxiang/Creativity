Table 1: Differences between the proposed RUN with O²P (Ionescu et al. (2015)), G²DeNet (Wanget al. (2017a)),  MPN-COV (Lin & Maji (2017)),  Improved B-CNN (Lin & Maji (2017)),  iQRT-COV (Li et al. (2018)) and MoNet (Gou et al. (2018)). Here, K is the number of iterations, D is thelocal feature dimension and N  is the number of local features.  Our RUN takes a low computationcomplexity O(KDN ), is well supported by GPU and well supports compact bilinear pooling (CBP).

Table 3: The average σF,₁/σF,₂ on four datasets.
Table 4: The influence of η on the proposed RUN.
Table 5: The influence of K on the proposed RUN.
Table 6: Comparisons with SVD-based method (Lin & Maji (2017)) and Newton-Schulz (NS) iter-ation (Li et al. (2018)).
Table 7: The influence of the dimension based on tensor sketch (TS) and random Maclaurin (RM).
Table 8: Comparisons between ours and MoNet-2 (Gou et al. (2018)).
Table 9: Comparisons with other pooling methods. We compare the feature dimension, the time costfor matrix normalization per batch (Norm Time) and the accuricies on four benchmarks.
