Table 1: Running time for methods testedRunning Time. In order to determine the feasibility of using OP-DMA instead of one of the leadingmethods in practice, we ran an experiment to determine the running times of each method. Thisconsisted of performing 5 runs of OP-DMA, WAE, VAE, and AAE on the Satellite dataset (24). Theaverage running time of each method over the 5 iterations is shown in the following table. Eachmethod was run on a machine with 32GB of DDR4 RAM and a Intel Xeon Platinum 8160 CPU.
