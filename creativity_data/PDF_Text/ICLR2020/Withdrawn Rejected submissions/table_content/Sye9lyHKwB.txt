Table 1: Mean/block-wise/pixel-wise correlation of L1/L2 loss and uncertainty on SR bench-mark dataset set 14. Our infer-transformation and infer-noise injection are compared with MCdropout (Gal & Ghahramani, 2016) and deep ensemble (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017). Modelsevaluated: SRresnet trained with L2 loss and SRGAN trained with L2 loss and adversarial loss.
Table 2: Mean/block-wise/pixel-wise correlation of L1/L2 loss and uncertainty on NYU DepthDataset V2. Our infer-transformation and infer-dropout are compared with MC dropout (Gal &Ghahramani, 2016). Models evaluated: FCRN model for depth destimation.
Table 3: Correlation of uncertainty and cross-entropy loss, comparing using entropy with baselineMC dropout, models evaluated are UNET for segmentation on SNEMI3D dataset and Resnet forclassification on CIFAR100 dataset.
