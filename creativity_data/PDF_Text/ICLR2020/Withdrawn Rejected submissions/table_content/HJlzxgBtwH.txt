Table 1: Performance summary of all attacks on MNIST and CIFAR-10 (aggregated). Wereport, for each norm, "avg. rob. acc.", the mean of the values of robust accuracy across allthe models and datasets, "# best", number of times the attack is the best one, "avg. diff.
Table 2: As in Table 1 statistics of the performance of different attacks on RestrictedImageNet (on the first 500 points of the validation set). In total we consider 5 thresholds ×3 models = 15 cases for each of the 3 norms.
Table 3: We report the values of e used for sampling in case our FAB-attack uses randomrestarts.
Table 4: We report mean lp-norm of the adversarial perturbations found by the attacks(when successful, excluding the already misclassified points) for every model.

Wereport the accuracy in percentage of the classifier on the test set if the attack is allowed toperturb the test points of E in lp-distance. The statistics are computed on the first 1000points on the test set for l∞ and l1 , on 500 points for l2 .
