Table 1: KID×100 ± std.×100 (Lower is better) computed for different combination on ap-ple2orange and summer2winter. Left 4 columns shown the target only KID and the rest 4 columnsshown the mean KID (Lower the better). Best results are bolded.
Table 2:	KID×100 ± std.×100 (Lower is better) computed using only target domain for differentmethods and on different datasets. Best results are bolded.
Table 3:	KID×100 ± std.×100 (Lower is better) computed using both target and source domain fordifferent methods and on different datasets. Best results are bolded.
