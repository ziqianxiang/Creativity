Table 1: mAP@All (%) on MNIST (higher is better). Best results (second best) for each hashlength are in bold (underlined). BioHash demonstrates the best retrieval performance, substantiallyoutperforming other methods including deep hashing methods DH and UH-BNN, especially at small k.
Table 2: mAP@1000 (%) on CIFAR-10 (higher is better). Best results (second best) for each hashlength are in bold (UnderIined) BioHash demonstrates the best retrieval performance, especially atsmall k.
Table 3: Effect of Channel Inhibition. Left: mAP@All (%) on MNIST, Right: mAP@1000 (%)on CIFAR-10. The number active channels per spatial location is denoted by kCI. It can seen thatchannel inhibition (high sparsity) is critical for good performance. Total number of available channelsfor each kernel size was 500 and 400 for MNIST and CIFAR-10 respectively.
Table 4: mAP@1000 (%) on CIFAR-10CNN. Best results (second best) for each hash lengthare in bold (underlined). BioHash demonstrates the best retrieval performance, substantiallyoutperforming other methods including deep hashing methods GreedyHash, SAH, DeepBit andUSDH, especially at small k. Performance for DeepBit,SAH and USDH is unavailable for somek, since it is not reported in the literature. * denotes the corresponding hashing method usingrepresentations from VGG16 fc7.
Table 5: mAP@100 (%) on MNIST, using Euclidean distance in pixel space as the ground truth,following protocol in Li et al. (2018). BioHash demonstrates the best retrieval performance,substantially outperforming SOLHash.
Table 6: Robustness to shadows. mAP@1000 (%) on CIFAR-10 (higher is better), when query sethas "shadows". Performance of other hashing methods drops substantially, while the performance ofBioConvHash remains largely unchanged due to patch normalization. For small k, BioConvHashsubstantially outperforms all the other methods, while still being competitive at higher hash lengths.
