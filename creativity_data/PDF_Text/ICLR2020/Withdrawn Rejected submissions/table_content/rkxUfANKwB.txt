Table 1: Fully supervised regression on ZINC250k (a), evaluated using the mean absolute error;and Tox21 (b), evaluated with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), averaged over all 12 toxicity types. Aside from All SMILES, results are those reported byECFP: (Rogers & Hahn, 2010), cVaE: (Gomez-Bombarelli et al., 2018), GraphConv: (DUvenaUdet al., 2015), Graph Conv + Super Node (SN): (Li et al., 2017), PotentialNet: (Feinberg et al., 2018),and ToxicBlend: (Zaslavskiy et al., 2019). The ablation of atom harmonization is also evalUated onthe Tox21 dataset.
Table 2: Properties of the top three optimized molecUles trained on ZINC250k. Other resUlts aretaken from JT-VAE: (Jin et al., 2018), GCPN: (YoU et al., 2018), MolDQN: (ZhoU et al., 2018), andCGVAE: (LiU et al., 2018). Following prior work, penalized logP is normalized by the statistics ofthe Zinc250k dataset.

Table 4: Root-mean-square error of the log octanol-water partition coefficient (logP) on the ZINC250kdataset. Results other than the All SMILES VAE are those reported in the cited papers.
Table 5: Mean absolute error (MAE) of semi-supervised property prediction on the log octanol-waterpartition coefficient (logP), molecular weight (MW), and the quantitative estimate of drug-likeness(QED) on ZINC310k dataset. Results other than the All SMILES VAE are those reported by (Kang& Cho, 2018).

Table 7: Effect of the hierarchical radius constraint on penalized logP optimization. Predictedpenalized logP was evaluated on 1000 optimization trajectories. From these, the true logP wasevaluated on the 100 best trajectories, and the top three true penalized logPs are reported. Eachoptimization was repeated 5 times.
