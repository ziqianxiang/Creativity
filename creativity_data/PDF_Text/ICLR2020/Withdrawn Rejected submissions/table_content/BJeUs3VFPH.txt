Table 1: Result of experiments as mean error in percent over each dataset group. Bold markswinner. * marks statistical differences with a P-ValUe of 1% against NBT. The standard deviationwas omitted, since it is the same for all and on average around 2-3%.
Table 2: Overview of dataset characteristics containing numbers of samples, features and labels.
Table 3: Result of experiments shown in mean time in seconds per dataset group. All consideredmethods using a baseline classifier, hence the SVM is not compared as standalone solution.
Table 4: Result of cross-validation test shown in mean error in percent per dataset. Mean overdataset group at the end of each section. Bold marks winner. * marks statistical differences witha p-value of 1% against NBT. The study shows that none of the listed algorithms is statisticallysignificant better as NBT.
