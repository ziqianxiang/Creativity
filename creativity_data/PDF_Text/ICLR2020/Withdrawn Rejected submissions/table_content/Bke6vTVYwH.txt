Table 1: Comparison with baselines using noisy examples. We report top-5 accuracy on novel classeswith classification by class prototypes (6).
Table 2: Comparison to the state of the art on the Low-shot ImageNet benchmark. We report top-5accuracy on novel and all classes. We use class prototypes (6), cosine classifier learning (7) and deepnetwork fine-tuning (8) for classification with our GCN-based data addition method.
