Table 1: Dataset statistics of different networks.
Table 2: Comparison of running time of 5 different runs in seconds between our algorithm (FeatProp)and Coreset. OOT denotes out-of-time. Note in order to get a more accurate solution, CoresetMIPcosts much more time than Coreset-greedy.
Table 3: Comparison of Macro-F1±standard_deviation averaged over different number of labelednodes for training. Bold fonts represent the best methods. CorsetMIP does not scale up for PubMedand CoraFull datasets.
Table 4: Comparison of Micro-Fl ±standard_deviation averaged over different number of labelednodes for training. Bold fonts represent the best methods. CorsetMIP does not scale up for PubMedand CoraFull datasets.
