In order toevaluate the robustness of the learned features, we performed the same algo-rithm on the representation associated to corrupted data, i.e. Z 〜q(z∣x + V),considering two types of noise: Gaussian and mask. In the Gaussian case,we add to each pixel a ν value sampled from N(0, σ2) with σ ∈ {0.2, 0.3, 0.4}, and in the masking8Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2020Table 2: Semi-supervised classification CIFAR10.

Thatresults combined with the high value of the rate term, suggest that the VIMAE are actually learninga maximal informative decoder. We conclude observing that, according to what seen until now,the high rate value for βA-VAE is associated to an high entropy h(q(z)), this is well visible by thegenerated samples from p(z) in figure 7, where the samples associated to βA-VAE seem to belongto the same cluster.
