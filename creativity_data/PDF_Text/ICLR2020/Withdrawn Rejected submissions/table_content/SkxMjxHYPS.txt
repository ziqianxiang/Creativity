Table 1: Model performances with the original distribution and four templates for the same numberof filters evaluated on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. After filter redistribution models surpassthe base accuracy. Results show average of three repetitions.
Table 2: Model performances (left) and parameters (right) with the original distribution and fourtemplates for the same number of filters evaluated on Tiny-ImageNet dataset. After applying tem-plates, models improve in accuracy or resource utilisation.
Table 3: Parameters, memory and inference time for selected models when applying our templateskeeping the same number of filters evaluated on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Models are normally opti-mised to exploit GPU operation, therefore the original base distribution has a good effect in speedbut the redistribution of filters induced by our templates makes models capabilities improve on theother metrics. Memory footprint is shown as reported by CUDA.
