Table 1: Performance comparison on the Flickr30k Entities test set: ATT-FCN (You et al., 2016),NBT (Lu et al., 2018), Up-Down (Anderson et al., 2018), GVD (Zhou et al., 2019), and Baseline isour reimplementation of GVD. *: our results are averaged across five runs. Only numbers reportedby multiple runs are considered to be bolded.
Table 2: Performance comparison on the ActivityNet-Entities val set: GVD (Zhou et al., 2019)and Baseline is our reimplementation of GVD. *: our results are averaged across five runs. Onlynumbers reported by multiple runs are considered to be bolded.
