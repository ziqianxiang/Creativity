Table 1: ECE, TACE, SCE, and ACE (with 15 bins) on a ResNet-110 applied to CIFAR-100 beforecalibration, and after the application of post-processing methods. The best recalibration methoddepends on the metric, which motivates its study.
Table 2: ECE, SCE, and ACE (with 15 bins) on a ResNet-50 applied to ImageNet before calibration,and after the application of various extensions to Platt scaling and Isotonic regression. Thesepercentages across metrics are not directly comparable.
