Table 1: Experimental results with varying proportions of labeled and unlabeled data. D&M standsfor the supervised model of Dozat & Manning (2018) trained on labeled data only. Ours-Sup standsfor our model trained on labeled data only. Ours-Semi stands for our model trained on both labeledand unlabeled data.
Table 2: Experimental results on all the three representations. D&M stands for the supervisedmodel of Dozat & Manning (2018). Ours-Sup stands for our model trained on labeled data only.

Table 4: Summary of hyper-parameters.
Table 5: Experimental results on three randomly sampled datasets. D&M stands for the supervisedmodel of Dozat & Manning (2018). Ours-Sup stands for our model trained on labeled data only.
Table 6: Experimental results on all the three SDP representations with four different word repre-sentations. D&M stands for the supervised model of Dozat & Manning (2018). Ours-Sup standsfor our model trained on labeled data only. Ours-Semi stands for our model trained on both labeledand unlabeled data.
