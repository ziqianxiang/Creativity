Table 1: Results for unsupervised training on synthetic data under various noise conditions. Thetable plots out the weights (mean and standard deviation) of the edges reconstructed by our model,for true positive matches and true negative ones. This shows under various noise conditions that ourarchitecture can still recover the original connectivity structure of the matching graph.
Table 2: Results on Rome16K Correspondence graphs, showing the mean and standard deviationof the L1 and L2 . Our method was not trained on ground truth correspondences but using unsuper-vised methods and geometric side losses. Thus we test against ground truth correspondence graphadjacency matrices computed from the bundle adjustment output. Our method performs better than35 iteration of the MatchALS (Zhou et al., 2015b) method, but does not perform as well as 50 iter-ations. We perform better than a simple eigenvalue based method (Pachauri et al., 2013). Note thatwe perform much better in L1 performance rather than L2, as we optimized the network weightsusing an L1 loss.
