Table 1: Comparison between DAP/NMF/RPCA/KAM on numerical metrics: SDR/SIR/LSD. ForSDR/SIR, higher is better and for LSD, smaller is better. The best results on the three metrics arefrom our method, DAP.
Table 2: Better sample ratio (%) comparing with NMF/RPCA/KAM in terms of numerical metrics:SDR/SIR/LSD on Universal-150. All results are larger than 50%, which shows that our DAP canachieve better results than the compared methods on a majority of testing samples.
Table 3: Comparison between DAP/NMF/RPCA/KAM in terms of numerical metrics:SDR/SIR/LSD on a standard source separation benchmark (Vincent et al., 2007). For SDR/SIR,higher is better and for LSD, smaller is better. The best results on the three metrics are from ourmethod, DAP.
Table 4: Better sample ratio (%) comparing with NMF/RPCA/KAM in terms of numerical metrics:SDR/SIR/LSD on the source separation benchmark (Vincent et al., 2007). Most ratio results arelarger than 50%, which shows that our DAP can achieve overall better results than the comparedmethods.
