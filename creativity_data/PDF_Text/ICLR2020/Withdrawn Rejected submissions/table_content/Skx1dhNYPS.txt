Table 1: Breakdown of comPutation of VideoEPitoma v.s. baseline CNNs. We rePort 3 differenttyPes of HeavyNet: i. ResNet2D (RNet2D), ii. ShuffleNet3D (SNet3D) and iii. I3D. The comPu-tational cost of LightNet and the gating module is marginal comPared to that of the HeavyNet. Inaddition, our selector retains the Performance of the HeavyNet but with using half of the timestePsand almost half of the comPutational cost.
Table 2: Our stand-alone timestep selector helps improving the performance of off-the-shelf CNNvideo classifiers, regardless of the CNN used - be it 2D CNN as ResNeL heavyweight 3D CNN asI3D or even lightweight 2D CNN as ShuffleNet3D.
