Table 1: Performance of two vector quantized models. The light cyan row stands for the vanillamodel without vector quantization, while those cells with gray color means that they are under the90% performance of vanilla model. The pink row is the model with K-means initialization.
Table 2: Actually used codewords. The gray cells mean that models use all codewords in theircodebooks.
