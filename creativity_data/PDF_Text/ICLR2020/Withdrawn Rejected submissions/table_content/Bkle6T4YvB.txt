Table 1:	Zero-shot classification results on XNLL 0 indicates parallel data is used. RAMEN onlyuses parallel data for initialization. The best results are marked in bold.
Table 2:	LAS scores for zero-shot dependency parsing. 0 indicates parallel data is used for initial-ization. Punctuation are removed during the evaluation. The best results are marked in bold.
Table 3: Comparison between random initialization (rnd) of language specific parameters and ini-tialization using aligned fastText vectors (vec).
Table 4: Evaluation in supervised UD parsing. The scores are LAS.
Table 5: UAS/LAS scores for zero-shot dependency parsing. 0 indicates parallel data is used forinitialization. Punctuation are removed during the evaluation.
Table 6: Comparison between b-BERT trained from scratch for 1,000,000 updates and RAMENtrained for 175,000 updates.
