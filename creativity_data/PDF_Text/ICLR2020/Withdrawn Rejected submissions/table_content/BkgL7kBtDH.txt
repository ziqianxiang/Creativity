Robust and flexible event representations are important to many core areas inlanguage understanding such as script learning, narrative generation, and discourse understanding(Chambers & Jurafsky, 2009; Pichotta & Mooney, 2016; Modi, 2016; Weber et al., 2018). Weevaluate event similarity on two benchmarking data sets: GS199 (Grefenstette & Sadrzadeh, 2011a)and KS108 (Kartsaklis & Sadrzadeh, 2014). GS199 contains 199 pairs of SV O triplets/events. Inthe GS199 data set only the V is varied, while S and O are fixed in the pair: this evaluation preventsthe model from relying only on simple lexical overlap for similarity computation.10 KS108 contains108 event pairs for the same task, but is specifically constructed without any lexical overlap betweenthe events in each pair.
