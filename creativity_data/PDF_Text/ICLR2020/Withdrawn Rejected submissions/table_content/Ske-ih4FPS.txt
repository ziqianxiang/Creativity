Table 5: Comparison of the soft-margin triplet loss and the hard cutoff triplet loss on two datasetswith margin m = 0.5 and m = 1.0.
Table 6: The model performances using the hardtriplet loss with different m values on Omniglot.
Table 7: The frequency of clustering during training. Experiments are carried on the Omniglotdataset. “Number of Update Epochs” means how many epochs are taken before the clustering.
