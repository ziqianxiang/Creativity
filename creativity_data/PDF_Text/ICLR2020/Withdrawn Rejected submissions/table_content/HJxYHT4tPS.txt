Table 1: Results for {Car, Bus} → Red vehicles with three different target data distributions (ratio cars:busesequal to 0.3:0.7, 0.5:0.5 and 0.7:0.3) (top row) and {Living room, Bridge, Church, Kitchen} → Tower/Bedroom(two bottom rows). We show FID scores between real and generated samples (left) and estimated probabilitiespi for each model (right).
Table 2: Quantitative results of mining on MNIST, expressed as FID / classifier error.
Table 3: Distance between real data and generated samples as measured by FID score and KMMD value. Theoff-manifold results correspond to Imagenet → Places365, and the on-manifold results correspond to Imagenet→ Imagenet. We also indicate whether the method requires the target label. Finally, we show the inferencetime for the various methods in seconds.
