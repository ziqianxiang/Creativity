Table 1: Results for the OOD detection test set data for image classification when the in-distributiondataset is CIFAR-100 and the OOD dataset is iSUN. We trained Dense-BC for each method underthe same conditions. All results are averaged over three runs Â± one standard deviation. All valuesare percentages, and the best results are indicated in bold.
Table 2: Results for the OOD detection test set data for various situations. All results are averagedover three runs. All values are percentages, and the best results are indicated in bold.
Table 3: AUROC score for OOD detection test set data. All results are averaged over three runs. Allvalues are percentages and the best results are indicated in bold.
