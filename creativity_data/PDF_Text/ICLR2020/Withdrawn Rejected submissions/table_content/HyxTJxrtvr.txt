Table 3: Comparing the effect of noisy against ground-truth clustering and mask segmentation onthe KITTI MOTS dataset.
Table 4: Influence of the sequence length on model performance. This indicates that our model canlearn short-term motion features effectively, but not long-term cues. We reason that this is becauseover longer sequences, the loss prevents the embedding smoothly shifting, which naturally occurs tochanging pose, appearance, context and lighting in the scene. We find the optimum sequence lengthon this dataset to be five.
