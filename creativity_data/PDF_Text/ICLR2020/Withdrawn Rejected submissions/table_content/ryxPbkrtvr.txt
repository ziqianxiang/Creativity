Table 1: Results of hard-label black-box attack on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-1000. Wecompare the performance of several attack algorithms under untargeted setting.
Table 2: Comparions for the effectiveness of successive halving and TPE resampling. The RelativeGain is based on Multi-Directional attack and Queries means total queries of all directions.
Table 3: Comparison of results of untargeted at-tack on gradient boosting decision tree.
Table 4: Results of attack on MNIST detectormodels under untargeted setting.
Table 5: Comparison of results of untargeted attack on white-box attack.
Table 6: Parameters for Sign-OPT attack on different image classification datasets.
Table 7: Results of hard-label black-box attack on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-1000. Wecompare the performance several attack algorithms under untargeted setting.
Table 8: Results of hard-label black-box attack on MNIST and CIFAR-10. We compare the perfor-mance based on run-time.
