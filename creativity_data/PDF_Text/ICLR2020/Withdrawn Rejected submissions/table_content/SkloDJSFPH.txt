Table 1: Mean `1 -error and the acceptance ratio over in image sequence generation.
Table 2: The speed up and visual quality of the results on CelebA dataset. The speed-up of theinference time with (SU) and without anchors (SU \A) compared to that of PixelCNN++ is measured.
Table 3: Mean '1-error and the acceptance ratio over e in image generation sequence.
Table 4: Generation time per an image and skimming ratio over e on CIFAR-10 Dataset. Here, [F]denotes the original Fast PixelCNN++. Note that the maximum acceptance ratio is 28/32 = 87.5%since our method starts from the four lines which is already drawn by the original Fast PixelCNN++.
