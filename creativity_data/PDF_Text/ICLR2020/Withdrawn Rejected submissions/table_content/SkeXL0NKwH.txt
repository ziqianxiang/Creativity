Table 1: Accuracy recovery beyond inference (%, mean with standard deviation from 5 random seeds)between different algorithms (all with max-norm; effective batch size B = 100 if applicable), testedat different ranks (r), and learning rates (Î·). Optimal learning rates are bolded.
Table 2: Importance of unbiased SVD. Accuracy is calculated from the last 500 samples of 10ksamples trained from scratch. Mean and unbiased standard deviation are calculated from five runs ofdifferent random seeds.
Table 3: Miscellaneous selected ablations. Accuracy is calculated from the last 500 samples of 10ksamples trained from scratch. Mean and unbiased standard deviation are calculated from five runs ofdifferent random seeds.
