Table 1: Alignment results of different methods on testset, and a subset of testset containing onlyloosely corresponded data-text pairs.
Table 2: Detailed alignment results of differnt models over each slot.
Table 3: Different combinations of local models with sequence labeling frameworkbad in EatType, which is one of the most common missing slot in the training set. The slotfamilyFriendly contains various expressions in corresponding texts, where Modified LSTM-CRF performs a lot worse than our proposed L2GA. The result indicates the necessity of integratingalignment guidance from the local model.
