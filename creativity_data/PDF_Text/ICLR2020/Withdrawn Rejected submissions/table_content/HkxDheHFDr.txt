Table 1: Quantitative results on multi-MNIST and multi-dSprites test sets. The log likelihood lowerbound is estimated with 100 importance samples. Note that the MNIST-10k dataset is a more com-plex task than MNIST-1k because the model has to capture a larger variation in appearance. Theobject count accuracy is measured as the percentage of images for which the inferred number ofobjects matches the ground truth (which is not available during training).
