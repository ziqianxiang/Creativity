Table 1: This shows the number of trajectories neededfor the algorithm to converge to five uniformly sampledtarget states in each environment.   A successful con-vergence is measured as 90% of the states receive theextrinsic reward with a standard deviation of less then3%. The two other methods Skew-Fit and RND cannotsolve the problem below upper limit 3000 trajectories.
