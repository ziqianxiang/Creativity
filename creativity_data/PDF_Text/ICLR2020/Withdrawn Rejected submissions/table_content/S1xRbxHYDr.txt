Table 1: Network training and performance details: “BN” refers to batch normalization, “DA”refers to data augmentation, “DO” refers to dropout, and “WD” refers to L2 weight decay. “Best”refers to learning rate/batch size combinations that we found to achieve the highest accuracy. Stars(?) indicate factors for which we tested different hyperparameters/variants.
