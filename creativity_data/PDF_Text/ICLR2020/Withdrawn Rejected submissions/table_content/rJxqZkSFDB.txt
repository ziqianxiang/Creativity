Table 1: Experiments on deep face recognition with real data sets. All models are trained with noisyVggFace2-R data set, and evaluate on the four clean test data sets. Except the proposed method, allperformance are copied from (Wang et al., 2019); F-correction is not reported as its performance isnot available in (Wang et al., 2019).
