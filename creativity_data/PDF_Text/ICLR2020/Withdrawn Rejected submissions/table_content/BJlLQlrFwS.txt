Table 1: Best hyperparams (Î· = 0.0001, h = 128).
Table 2: Mean (std) of the final average accuracy (%) with the best hyperparameters, 5 seeds. Onlythe best result from DM-I, II, III, IV (constrained as well as unconstrained) is shown. The compari-son among the constrained and unconstrained variants of DM are given in Table 3.
Table 3: Mean (std) of the final average accuracy (%) with the best hyPerParameters for DM-I, II,III, IV, constrained (toP) and unconstrained (bottom), 5 seeds. Values are also Provided for EWC forcomParison.
Table 4: Mean (std) of the likelihood retention R (%) with the best hyPerParams for DM-I, II, III,IV (constrained) and DM-P, 5 seeds.
