Table 1: The aggregate performance of our method to predict physical derivatives in unseen direc-tions of perturbations to the parameters.〈•〉shows time average. The first column is the normalizedtime averaged MSE. The second column is the time averaged GP score (closer to 1 is better. See ap-pendix E.4 for definition). The third column is the time averaged misalignment between derivatives.
