Table 1: Shared head results on disjoint CIFAR-10. Total memory per class M measured in samplememory size. We report (a) Accuracy, (b) Forgetting (lower is better).
Table 2: Offline training evaluation of storage from online continual compression. We see a cleargain over a standard Reservoir sampling approach. We then ablate each component of our proposalshowing each component is important. Note storage used in each experiment is identical (includingaccounting for model sizes).
