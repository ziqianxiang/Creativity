Table 1: OoD detection results on various training and testing experiments. We compared ourmethod with MSP (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2016), and Outlier Exposure (OE) (Hendrycks et al.,2019b).
Table 2: OoD detection results on various training and testing experiments comparing our methodwith a baseline ensembling method that uses a fixed architecture trained multiple times with differentrandom initializations.
