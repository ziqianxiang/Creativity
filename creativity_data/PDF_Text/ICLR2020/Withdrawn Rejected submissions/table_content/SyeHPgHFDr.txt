Table 1: Comparison between the standard NN, pruned networks on the hidden layer and all layers, and retrainedpruned networks with random weights and the initial weights from the beginning of CPNA.
Table 2: Datasets used for evaluating the performance of fully connected NN and sparse NN with CPNA.
Table 3: Performance results of NN(best), NN(equivalent) and NN+CNPA for each dataset.
