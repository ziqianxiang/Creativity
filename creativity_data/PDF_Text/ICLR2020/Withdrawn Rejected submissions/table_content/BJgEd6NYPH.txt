Table 1: Default parametersDatasets We use two real-world datasets for image classification, namely CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST12. While Fashion-MNIST consists of greyscale 28 × 28 images, CIFAR-10 are coloredimages of size 32 × 32. Both datasets have a fixed training-test split consisting of 60,000 and 10,000images, respectively.
