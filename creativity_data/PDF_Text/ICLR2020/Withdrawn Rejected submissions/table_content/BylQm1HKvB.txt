Table 1: Symbol identity among labels using Jaccard coefficient. Same label means the averageof the Jaccard coefficients between the same labels. Other label means the average of Jaccard co-efficients between different labels. The s/o ratio is the proportion between the Same label and theOther label. No statistically significant difference was observed between the learning objects.
Table 2: The label analysis and the head symbol analysis. Each value is obtained from the averageof five trials.
Table 3: Comparison of formal rules. We analyzed the message in which Dream reconstruction isguaranteed for each label. One agent group was extracted from each learning object. [xxx]* meansthat the xxx symbol is repeated. “y” symbol of [xxx]*y means an unrepeated symbol. ((z) means thesymbol that may be required depending on the repetition state of the messages. “without s” meansan exclusive symbol that cannot be reconstructed if the symbol exists.
Table 4: Similarity evaluation between generated and formalized messages. We constructed ahistogram for each label and analyzed the peaks. Comparing the formal rule with the generatedsymbol, we discovered labels with one peak value and labels with bimodality. We considered thatthe higher the peak value, the more similar tendencies existed in the formal rule.
Table 5: Formal rules aligned for each leading symbol. To verify the structure, the formal ruleswere aligned for each leading symbol (left, NORMAL; right, INTERNAL). If the first symbol up tothe second digit in the same series is unique, then that part is indicated by an underline. Symbolsthat are not used elsewhere in the same series are shown in italics.
