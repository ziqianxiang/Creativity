Table 1: NotationNotation	Descriptionm, [m], q	Number of workers, set of integers {1,..., m}, number of Byzantine workersDi, S	Di is the training dataset on the ith worker, S is the validation dataset on Zeno++ servern, ns	Mini-batch size of workers, mini-batch size of Zeno++ serverT, t, Y	Number of global iterations, index of global iteration, learning rateρ, 6, k	Hyperparameter of Zeno++, k is the maximum delay of gr, also called “server delay”kw	Maximum delay of workers, also called “worker delay”, different from the “server delay” kk∙k	All the norms in this paper are l2-norms4 MethodologyIn this section, we introduce Zeno++, a Byzantine-tolerant asynchronous SGD algorithm based oninner-product validation. Zeno++ is a computationally efficient version of its prototype: Zeno+.
