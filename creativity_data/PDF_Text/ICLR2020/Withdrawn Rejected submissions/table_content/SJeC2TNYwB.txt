Table 1: Log-likelihood (measured in bits per dimension) calculated with RealNVP, VAE, Pixel-CNN++ models on MNIST, Fashion MNIST, CIFAR10, and SVHN test sets. We train RealNVPand VAE on FashionMNIST, and train RealNVP and PixelCNN on CIFAR10. We report likelihoodresults with training mode, evaluation mode, and their difference (∆).
Table 2: Out-of-distribution classification evaluated with AUC (left) and Average Precision (right).
Table 3: Architecture for VAE convolutional layers. k denotes image width divided by 4, c denotesthe number of channels of the image (1 for gray, 3 for colored).
Table 4: Log-likelihood (measured in bits per dimension) calculated with a RealNVP trained onCIFAR and evaluated on generated samples from a RealNVP trained on SVHN. We report likelihoodresults with training mode, evaluation mode, and their difference (∆).
