Figure 1: Overview of AGMC-HTS. The generator synthesizes features for an ICD code and the discriminatordecides how realistic the input feature is. For a zero-shot ICD code, the discriminator distinguishes between thegenerated features and the real features from the data of its nearest sibling in the ICD hierarchy. The generatedfeatures are further used to reconstruct the keywords in the input documents to preserve semantics.
Figure 2: ZAGRNN as the feature extractor model . ZAGRNN extracts label-wise features and constructembedding of each ICD codes using GRNN. ZAGRNN makes a binary prediction for each code based on thedot product between graph label embedding and the label specific feature.
Figure 3: T-SNE projection of generated features for zero-shot codes using (a) LWGAN and (b) LWGAN-Z . Lightercolor are projection of generated features and darker color are of real features from the nearest sibling codes.
