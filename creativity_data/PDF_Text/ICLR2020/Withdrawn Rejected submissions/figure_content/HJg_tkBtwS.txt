Figure  1:   Using  results  from  (Strack  et  al.,  2014)as a clinically validated ground truth, we observe thatAMI-CRT  is able to achieve the highest area under thereceiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) whencompared to state-of-the-art benchmarks.
Figure 2:  Instance-wise feature selection using AMI. The first and third columns show the original imageof ambulances or policevans respectively.  The second and fourth columns show only the patches which werefound to have non-zero AMI with the label, given the rest of the patches.
Figure 3:  Quantile-Quantile plot showing uniformity of p-values across various FDR-controllingmethods. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test is performed to test if each set of p-values is uniformlydistributed.
Figure 4:  Quantile-Quantile plot showing uniformity of p-values across various FDR-controllingmethods in the case of poor approximations of q(xj    x  j).  A Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test isperformed to test if each set of p-values is uniformly distributed.
Figure 5:  Instance-wise feature selection using AMI-CRT.  The first and third columns show theoriginal image of ambulances or policevans respectively. The second and fourth columns show onlythe patches which were found to have non-zero AMI with the label, given the rest of the patches.
Figure 6: Instance-wise feature selection using LIME. The first and third columns show the originalimage of ambulances or policevans respectively.   The second and fourth columns show only thepatches which were found to be important.
Figure 7: Instance-wise feature selection using SHAP. The first and third columns show the originalimage of ambulances or policevans respectively. The second and fourth columns show patches thatare found to contribute to the label. Green indicates a patch found relevant for the ambulance class,and red indicates a patch found relevant for the policevan class.
