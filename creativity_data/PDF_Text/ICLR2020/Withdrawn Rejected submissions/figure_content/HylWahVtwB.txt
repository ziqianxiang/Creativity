Figure 1: Overview of NAS with reinforcement learning. The child network receives informationfrom the controller and generates a network architecture to evaluate date. The controller networkreceives a reward from the evaluation of the child network for updating network parameters.
Figure 2: Overview of NAS on the embedding space. We used three functions namely architecturecontroller, architecture decoder, and architecture simulator, rather than the origin controller networkfor searching the neural architecture. Architecture controller received the origin architecture andgenerated architecture-embedding. Architecture decoder received the architecture-embedding andgenerated the origin architecture. Architecture simulator received random distribution and generatedarchitecture-embedding.
Figure 3: Double-axis diagram that illustrates the testing loss and embedding size, which offeruseful information for selecting an appropriate embedding size. Right axis: testing loss. Left axis:embedding size.
Figure 4: The NASES final architecture discovered on the macro search for image classification. Itis a 15-layer convolutional architecture by using 20 NASES hyperparameters.
