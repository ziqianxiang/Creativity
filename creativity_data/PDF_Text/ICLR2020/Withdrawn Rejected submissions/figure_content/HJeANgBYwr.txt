Figure 1: A depiction of the training and inference. For training the trajectories of a set of agents isrecorded as demonstrations.  After we train our GNN model, it can be used to create a copy of theswarm.  In addition, it is possible to create larger and smaller swarms by changing the number ofagents.
Figure 2:  Predicted trajectories (colored arrows) overlaid on ground truth (gray dash lines).  OnlyTw initial states are supplied, and the prediction is done repeatedly upto 40 steps in future.  Left:Trajectories of 5 boids by a network trained with data of 5 boids.  Middle: Trajectories of 10 boidsby      the same network used in the left pane.  Right:  Trajectories of 10 boids by the network aftertuning on padded data of 5 and 10 boids.
Figure 3:  Predicted trajectories for chaser swarms of different sizes N .  Colored arrows mark thepredicted  velocities  and  positions,  against  the  grey  dashed  lines  as  the  ground  truth  trajectories.
Figure 4:  Distribution of output vector norms of critical components in our GNN, before and aftertuning, on data sets with various (N, M ).  Left:  Output of function φᵉ.  Middle:  Output of edgemessage summation before entering function ψᵉ¯. Right: Final output of the network from functionφᵛ, as changes to agent states.
Figure 5:  Predicted trajectories after tuning against the ground truth for chaser model with variousswarm sizes N and neighborhood sizes M . Only the trajectories of 2 agents are shown for legibility.
