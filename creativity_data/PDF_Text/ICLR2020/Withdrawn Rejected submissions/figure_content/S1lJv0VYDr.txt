Figure 1: Distribution matching enables the learned transition to generate similar rollouts to the realones even when the policy is stochastic or the initial states are close. On the other hand, trainingwith supervised learning does not ensure rollout similarity and the resulting policy gradient may beinaccurate. This figure considers a fixed policy sampling in the real world and a transition model.
Figure 2: Learning curves of our MI versus two model-free and four model-based baselines. Thesolid lines indicate the mean of five trials and the shaded regions suggest standard deviation.
