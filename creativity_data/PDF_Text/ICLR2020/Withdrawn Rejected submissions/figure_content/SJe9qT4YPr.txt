Figure 1: (Upper) A segment ofa time series with missing data. Simplified layouts of (Middle) Riseand (Lower) Dise. Whereas Rise attends to timestamps whose data points are missing and updatesits hidden state accordingly, Dise skips them and only updates its state with observed values.
Figure 2: (Upper) Time hori-zon and (Lower) next observedvalue prediction problem. Pre-dictions (blue triangles) are madebased on current (green squares)and past observed values (red cir-cles). Black-filled shapes repre-sent missing data.
Figure 3: Mean APE vs Damounts to 6 observations. Dise-gru [R] shows the best performance for almost each of the timepoints within the 30-minute prediction window. The recursive approach matches the performance ofDise-gru [R] at the first place of the time window. However, its performance degrades as the timehorizon increases, being quickly surpassed by the multi-output approaches DeepMO and SeqMO.
