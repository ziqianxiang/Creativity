Figure 1: The risk function proposed in (Clarke & Kovatchev, 2009). The mapping between bloodglucose values (in mg/dL, x-axis) and Risk values (y-axis). The hypo- and hyperglycemic thresholdsare shown as shaded regions. The risk at the threshold of each region is approximately 7.75.
Figure 2:	The mean risk over 10 days from different methods applied to different simulated patients.
