Figure 1: Illustration of two adversarial learning schemes. Different from class-agnostic adversariallearning that pursues the marginal distribution alignment but ignores the semantic consistency, (a)conditional adversarial learning relies heavily on the instance-level pseudo labels to perform con-ditional distribution alignment, while (b) our prototype-assisted adversarial learning integrates theinstance-level pseudo labels and global class prototypes to make the conditional indicators morereliable. Class information is denoted in different shapes with source in solid and target in hollow.
Figure 2: Overview of the proposed PACDA framework which consists of a shared feature extractorG, a shared classifier F, and two domain discriminators (Df, Dp). Mema represents the global classprototype matrix while Ms,t is computed by source or target instances within current batch.
Figure 4: t-SNE (Maaten & Hinton, 2008) embedding visualization of UDA methods for C→I onImageCLEF-DA (class information is denoted by different colors with source in 4 with target in ?).
