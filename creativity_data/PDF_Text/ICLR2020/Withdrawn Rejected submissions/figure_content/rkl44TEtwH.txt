Figure 1: Comparison of different motion generation schemes. Three rows from top to bottom corre-spond to generated results of parametric, non-parametric and semi-parametric modelling respectively.
Figure 2: Proposed framework for motion generation. Step 1: We search for reference subsequenceswithin a held-out set. Step 2: A novel subsequence is then generated based on reference one withlocal motion composition. Step 3: All edited subsequences are connected together in temporal orderwith global motion composition.
