Figure 6: Optimization trajectory of AutoGrow, tested by Basic3ResNet on CIFAR10. (a)c-AutoGrow with staircase learning rate and ZeroInit during growing; (b) c-AutoGrow withconstant learning rate and GauInit during growing; (C) p-AutoGrow with K = 50; and (d) p-AutoGrow with K = 3. For better illustration, the dots on the trajectory are plotted every 4, 20, 5and 3 epochs in (a-d), respectively.
