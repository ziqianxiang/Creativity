Figure 1: Test error (%) on CIFAR-10-C, level 5. See subsection 3.1 for details.
Figure 2: Test accuracy (%) on ImageNet-C, level 5. The lower panel shows the accuracy of the onlineversion as the average over a sliding window of 100 samples; test-time learning online generalizes better asmore samples are tested on, without hurting on the original distribution. We use accuracy instead of error herebecause the baseline performance is very poor with most corruptions. See subsection 3.1 for details.
Figure 3: Scatter plot of the inner product between the gradients (on the shared feature extractor Î¸e) of themain task lm and the self-supervised task le, and the improvement in test error (%) from test-time training, forthe standard (left) and online (right) version. Each point is the average over a test set, and each scatter plot has75 test sets, from all 15 types of corruptions over five levels as described in subsection 3.1. The blue lines andbands are the best linear fits and the 99% confidence intervals. The linear correlation coefficients are 0.93 and0.89 respectively, indicating strong positive correlation between the two quantities, as suggested by Theorem 1.
