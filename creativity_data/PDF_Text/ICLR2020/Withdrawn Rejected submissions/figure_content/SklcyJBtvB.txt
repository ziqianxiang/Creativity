Figure 4:	Behaviour of SD(π∣∏o) + Dχ(∏∣∏o)B.2 Supplementary resultsReliability of approximating support divergence using control variate. In this experiment, weempirically verify the reliability of estimating support divergence using control variate. The tar-get policy is the uniform policy while the logging policies are varying in their support deficiency.
Figure 5:	Model selection result for credit card fraud detectionincreases. Meanwhile, the variance decreases as shown in the right figure. For different supportdeficiency curves, the curve converges in a similar fashion and we conjecture it is due to the effectof clipping the propensity at the same threshold = 0.01, which makes pmin = 0.01 in the boundshown in Proposition 3.
