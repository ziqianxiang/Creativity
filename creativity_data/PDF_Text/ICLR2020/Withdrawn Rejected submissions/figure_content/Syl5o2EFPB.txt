Figure 1: Comparison of word count ratios (Shetty et al., 2017) on two splits of MS COCO. x axis is the {testfrequency}/{train frequency} of a word and y axis is the word count of the corresponding ratio. GT representsground truth distribution.
Figure 2: Captions produced by different methods from the test set (standard split). Beside each caption wereport SPICE score. Captions generated by rAIRL are correct and human-like in these examples.
Figure 3: Failed examples of rAIRL. The objects and relations are not correctly recognized in these pictures.
Figure 4:	Examples showing diversity of the captions. The left and right columns show pictures with similarcontent but different details. The proposed rAIRL successfully recognizes these differences and gives diversecaptions.
Figure 5:	Examples of the top-5 generated captions of rAIRL. Driven by the compact reward function, thegenerator describes a given image with semantically similar words.
Figure 6: Examples showing the generated captions from AIRL before and after re-written.
Figure 7: An example of the images shown to the human evaluator. The captions were produced by MLE,GAN, RL, AIRL and rAIRL methods in a randomized order.
