Figure 1: Left: dsprite-textures images. center: Bounding box labels. Right: Mask labels.
Figure 2: Image quality: FiD and FJDexhibit similar trends for class, bound-ing box, and mask conditioning undervarying noise levels added to images.
Figure 3: Conditional consistency: Change in FJD with respect to offset on Dsprite-textures datasetfor class, bounding box and mask conditionings.
Figure 4: Intra-conditioning diversity: FJD and FID as intra-conditioning diversity decreases.
Figure 5: Left: samples from two multivariate Gaussian distributions. Center: Histograms of marginaldistributions for the Y variable. Right: Histogram of conditional distributions for Y conditioned onX ∈ (0.9, 1.1).
Figure 6: Comparison between FID and FJD for class, bounding box, and mask conditioning undervarying noise levels for COCO-Stuff dataset. Evaluated at 128x128 resolution.
Figure 7: A summer tanager, as described by a variety of captions (ground truth caption highlightedin blue). The Hamming distance between attribute vectors associated with each caption and theground truth caption provides an indication of how well each caption describes the image.
Figure 8: Change in FJD and FID with respect to the average Hamming distance between originalcaptions and swapped captions. FJD increases as captions become worse at describing their associatedimage, while FID is insensitive.
Figure 9: Alpha sweep for BigGAN at various truncation values σ . FID is equivalent to FJD atα = 0. The black dashed line indicates the α value that is selected by calculating the ratio betweenthe average L2 norm of image and conditioning embeddings.
Figure 10: Sample sheets for ACGAN model trained with different conditioning weighting λ. Eachcolumn is conditioned on a different digit, from 0 to 9. Low values of λ produce models with verylittle conditional consistency, while overly large values of λ yield models with reduced image qualityand diversity.
