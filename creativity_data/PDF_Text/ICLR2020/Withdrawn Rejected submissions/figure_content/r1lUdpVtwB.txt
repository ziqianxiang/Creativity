Figure 1: The proposed combination methodThe combination of the CBMT and the NMT follows the mixed approach proposed by Niehues et al.
Figure 2: Overview of the CBMT systemThe source sentence is converted into N-gram phrases and then it is translated using bilingual dic-tionary. CBMT’s performance is mostly dependent on the efficiency of the dictionary. We havemanually built a phrase based dictionary aided by Google translate. A synonym finder helps thedictionary’s search using WordNet(Soergel, 1998). WordNet is a library with large lexical databaseof English words. It provides synonyms of the English words whose Amharic translations are not indictionary. In this paper, a maximum of four N-grams has been used. Most phrases of English thatare translated to a single word in Amharic have a length of four or less words.
Figure 3: Manual translation result of the word acknowledge4.1.1	DatasetWe have fed the same dataset to all systems with minor variations. In the CBMT, we have used thebook of Mark and the book of Romans as a test set. The flooded texts for the book of Romans werethe book of Romans itself and Paulian epistles without Romans. The flooded texts for the book ofMark were the book of Mark itself and the gospels without Mark. The books have been flooded tothemselves in order to evaluate the performance of the CBMT when the searched text is found in theflooded text and also to see the impact of the bilingual dictionary on the CBMT.
