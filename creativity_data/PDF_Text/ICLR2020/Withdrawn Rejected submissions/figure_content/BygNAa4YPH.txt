Figure 1: Examples of the support set, in-distribution, OOE and OOS inputs in one episode.
Figure 2: Standard episodic set-up. A testepisode in standard few-shot classification consistsof a few training (or support) examples from novelclasses, and test/query examples from those classes.
Figure 4: The toy example in PyTorch. a is our embedded query, and we have a prototype at 0, andanother at 1. When a = .5, SPP is 0.5. When a = 100, SPP is 1, which is undesirable.
Figure 5: Calibration results. ABML with 10 posterior samples (ECE=0.40%) have better calibrationthan ABML with 1 posterior sample (ECE=1.16%), and MAML (ECE=3.61%). ECE is the expectedcalibration error (Guo et al., 2017).
