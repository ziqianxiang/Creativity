Figure 4: Sensitivity analysisWe use two real-world datasets, namely the IoT-60 dataset and the SC-FC dataset to test the sensi-tivity of the proposed method to its hyper-parameters. The proposed method includes three hyper-parameters: 1) the number of layers, 2) the degree of power K, and 3). the activation function. Forthe choice of activation function, We exclusively select the Sigmoid(∙) and tanh(∙) function becausethey can easily constrain the eigenvalues to a valid range (e.g. [0,2) for the normalized Laplacianmatrix). The results of the sensitivity test to the poWer degree K are plotted in Figure 4a, Which fixthe number of layers to 3. Our method is quite robust for K > 1 on both datasets using both activa-tion functions. When K = 1, the Pearson correlations are dropped on the SC-FC datasets becauseof the inaccurate estimation of the Taylor expansion. On the other hand, the sensitivity tests for thenumber of layers are plotted in Figure 4b. The propose method is also insensitive to the numberof layers as long as the number of layers is greater than one. Recall When there is only one layer,our method is reduced to a single graph spectral kernel that may not be able to handle sophisticatedgraph translation problem (e.g. the SC-FC prediction problem). Therefore, this result has validatedthe necessity of the “deep” proposed in this paper.
