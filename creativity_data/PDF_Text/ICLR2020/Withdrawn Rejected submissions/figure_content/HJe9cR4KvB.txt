Figure 1: Illustration of the task settings for the two applications in this work: (a) learning consensusmodel from crowd annotations; (b) unsupervised cross-domain model adaptation.
Figure 2: CONNET Overview. The decoupling phase constructs the shared model (yellow) and source-specificmatrices (blue). The aggregation phase dynamically combines crowd components into a consensus representa-tion (blue) by a context-aware attention module (red) for each sentence x.
Figure 3: Performance on simulated crowd-sourced NER datasets with (a) 5 annotators on different reliabilitylevels; (b) various numbers of annotators whose reliability r = 1/50.
Figure 4:  Visualizations of (a) the expertise of annotators; (b) attention weights for sample sentences.  Morecases and details are described in Appendix A.1.
Figure 5: Visualizations of (a) the expertise of annotators; (b) attention weights for additional samplesentences to Fig. 4. Details of samples are described in Tab. 3.
