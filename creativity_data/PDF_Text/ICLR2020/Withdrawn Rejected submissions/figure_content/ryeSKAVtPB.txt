Figure 1: The average case usingResNet-50. AD is better than the mod-ified C&W method (CW*). The thick-ness represents the `2 energy (thinneris better). Please see Sec. 4 for detailof experimental settings.
Figure 2: Learned adversarial examples for ordered ToP-10 (top), Top-5 (middle) and Top-1 (bottom) attacksusing ReSNet-50 (He et al., 2016). The proposed AD method has smaller perturbation energies and “cleaner”(lower-entropy) prediction distributions. Note that for Top-10 attacks, the 9 × 30 search scheme does not work(see Table. 2).
