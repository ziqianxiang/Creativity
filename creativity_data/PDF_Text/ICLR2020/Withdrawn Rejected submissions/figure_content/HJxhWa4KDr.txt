Figure 1: Example of a random forest with T trees: blue nodes denote the internal nodes N := {d1 , ..., d7}while purple nodes are the leaf nodes L := {'ι,…，'8 }. The black thick path illustrates the routeof a sample x falling into the `6 leaf node of the t-th tree.
Figure 2: Example of a connection between CNN network d0-dimensional output h(∙; Θn ) and random forestwith T trees and depth 2. The internal node d31 in the left tree has the probabilityp13(x; θN, θF1 ) = σ(w31h1(x; θN) + b13) and therefore the routing function of leaf node `14 isμ'4(x; Θn,θp) =(1 - σ(w1 hd，(x; Θn) + b1 ))(1 - σ(w3hi(x; Θn) + b3)).
Figure 3: Visualization of three kernels by draWing filled contours: (a) & (b) - A direct visualization of2-dimensional kernels With reference to (0, 0); (c) - A 2-dimensional visualization of the multi-dimensional random-forest kernel With the help of t-SNE (Maaten & Hinton, 2008). The detailsof visualization are shoWn in Appendix A.2.
