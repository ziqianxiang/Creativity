Figure 1: Left: a typical search process of the first-order DARTS, in which 200 search epochs areused. Red, green and blue lines indicate the average weight of none, the ratio of dominant skip-connect operators (over 14 normal edges) and the re-training accuracy, with respect to the numberof search epochs, respectively. Right: the normal cell obtained after 200 search epochs, in which allpreserved operators are skip-connect. We executed both first-order and second-order DARTS forseveral times, and such failure consistently happens in each individual run.
Figure 2: Normal (left) and reduction (right) cells (the standard DARTS space) obtained by differentamending coefficients, namely, η = 0 (top), η = 0.1 (middle) and η = 1 (bottom).
Figure 3: Top: normal and reduction cells found in S1. Middle & Bottom: the overall architecturefound in S2 by DARTS, with and without the amended term, in which red and blue edges indicateskip-connect and sep-conv-3x3 operators, respectively.
