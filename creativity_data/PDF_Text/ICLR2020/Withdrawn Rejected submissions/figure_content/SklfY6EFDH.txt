Figure 1: Raw Zero-Shot Illustration.
Figure 2: Illustration of both DBI and Amalgam metrics.
Figure 3: Visualization of the results in Table 3 using a topology preserving two-dimensionalprojection with Isomap. Each row shows the Isomap of one architecture. From top to bottom:WideResNet, DenseNet, ResNet, NIN, AllConv, CapsNet, LeNet.
Figure 4: Visualization of the DBI Metric with t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding(t-SNE) which focuses on the neighbour distances. Each row shows the t-SNE projections in twodimensional space for one architecture. From top to bottom: CapsNet, AllConv, ResNet, NIN andLeNet.
Figure 5: Histograms from which the AM is calculated. Each row shows the histograms of onearchitecture. Dark shaded thinner and light shaded wider bins are respectively the soft-labels from theground-truth from the classifier trained on all classes and the soft-labels of the classifier trained onn - 1 classes. From top to bottom: WideResNet, DenseNet, ResNet, NIN, AllConv, CapsNet, LeNet.
Figure 6: Histograms of D for each soft label. Each row shows the difference in histograms for onearchitecture. From top to bottom: CapsNet, AllConv, ResNet, NIN and LeNet.
