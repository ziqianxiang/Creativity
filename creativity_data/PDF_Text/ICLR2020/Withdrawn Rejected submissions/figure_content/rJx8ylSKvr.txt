Figure 1: The relation between the attention matrix E and the matching matrix T : Pij is the blockmatrix from the matching matrix T, Eij is equal to the trace of matrix Pij . Tki,,lj (k, l ∈ [m], i ∈[a], j ∈ [b]) is the entry of block matrix Pij, the trace represent the summation of diagonal elementsof matrix Pij .
Figure 2: We compare our model (adaptive settings for kernels) to two fixed modes, deep-more-kernels for the whole dataset and shallow-more-kernels for the whole dataset. For TREC-QA, ourmodel with an adaptive setting for kernels achieved significant improvements on MAP and MRR(with p < 0.01) over the fixed settings. For YAHOO-QA, we can get similar results. Both thestatistic tests are based on Wilcoxon signed-rank test.
Figure 3: Assuming the compound relation of word vectors in VQ with a words (or VA with b words)are considered in the 2-order which represents c (c = Cb2) compound semantics of any two-wordvectors in VA. The relation between the attention matrix E and the matrix T : Pij which can beregarded as a 3-order tensor is the block matrix from the matrix T , Eij is equal to the trace ofmatrix Pij (i ∈ [a]; j ∈ [c]).
