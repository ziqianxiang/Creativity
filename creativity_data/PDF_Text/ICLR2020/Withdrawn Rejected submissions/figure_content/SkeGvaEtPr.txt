Figure 1: The process of individuating structural patterns in anonymized fragments. Whitecircles represent constants, while the two relations are represented as solid and dashed arrows (ab-sence of an arrow means that the relation is false). The given world is shown on the left. Twopossible fragments are shown in the middle. All their possible anonymizations are shown on theright. Grey circles show two repeated anonymized fragments found in two different fragments. Themodel exploits these regularities on fragments to model the distribution of the larger structure.
Figure 2: Knowledge Base Completion in the Smokers dataset. Circles represent constants. Agrey circle means that the predicate smokes is True. A white circle means that the value of thepredicate smokes is unknown. Links represent the relation friendOf (absence ofan arrow meansthat the relation is False). The given world is shown on the top (2a), while the completed knowledgebase is shown on the bottom (2b). The system learnt the symmetric nature of the friendship relation.
Figure 3: Molecules generation. A comparison between a sample of training data and a (random)sample of molecules generated by the proposed model. The generated samples fairly resemblestraining data both in structural patterns and variety. Better viewed in color.
Figure 4: Molecules generation. Comparing the distributions of some chemical properties of thetraining data with the ones of generated data. The generated samples are capable of perfectly fittingstructural properties and to very well resembling functional properties.
Figure 5: An example of moleculeC Generating MoleculesEven though molecules can be described with a high level of precision, using both spatial features(i.e. atoms distances, bond length etc.) and chemical features (i.e. atom charge, atom mass, hy-bridization), in this work, we focused mainly on structural symbolic descriptions of molecules.
