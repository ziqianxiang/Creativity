Figure 1: Ratio of average reconstruction error of outliers/inliers for an autoencoder trained onGaussian data with cluster outliers (a) or uniform noise outliers (b)AE Recreation Error Cluster Outliersto an average reconstruction error that is indistinguishable from that of inliers as the networkconverges (19). This is a greater issue for the case where outliers occur in clusters as opposed touniform noise, as shown in Figure 1. The cluster outlier case is is likely to arise when the outliersrepresent a small minority class or when they are caused by a systematic error.
Figure 2: a) Standard deep distribution mapping methods that enforce a certain prior distribution onthe latent space (VAEs, WAEs) in practice map both outliers and inliers to high probability regions.
Figure 3: An overview of OP-DMA. a) Input data is encoded into latent space. b) The divergencebetween the latent distribution PQ and the prior distribution PZ is calculated and added to the lossterm. c) The latent data is reconstructed, and the reconstruction error of each datapoint is weighted bythe likelihood of observing the latent point according to the prior distribution PZ. d) After trainingthe network, outlier detection is performed by calculating the Mahalanobis distance of each point inthe latent spacetransformation with OP-DMA, outliers can be separated from inliers with a simple distance metric.
