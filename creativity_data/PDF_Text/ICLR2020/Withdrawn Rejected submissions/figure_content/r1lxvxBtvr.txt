Figure 1: Two equivalent ways of expressing relations. (a): relations defined in a hypothetical KG. (b): relationsdefined in a set-theoretic perspective (Definition 1). Because is_father_of ⇒ is_parent_of, the set for is_father_ofis a subset of that for is_parent_of (Definition 2). (c): Hierarchical depiction of familial relations.
Figure 2: Two perspectives of viweing TransH in R3; the orange dot is the origin, to emphasize that a vectoris really a point from the origin but can be translated and considered equivalently. (a): first projecting h and#» onto His_famii»_of, and then requiring h⊥ + j ≈ t⊥ (b): first substracting #» from h, and then projectingthe distance (t - h) to His_f amily_of and requiring (t - h)⊥ ≈ rj. The red line is unique because it is whenr# is _ famiiy _ o (f is translated to the origin.
Figure 3: (a): Vieweing TransINT as intersection of H,s and projection of ?»'s. The dotted orange lines are the'projection constraint. (b): Viewing TransINT in the relation space (Figure 2b) perspective. The blue line, redline, and the green plane is respectively is_father_of, is_mother_of and is_parent_of ’s relation space - wheret - h’s of h, t tied by these relations can exist. The blue and the red line lie on the green plane - is_parent_of ’srelation space includes the other two’s.
Figure 4: Orthogonality of P and I — p. (a) X is be decomposed into two orthogonal directions, when projectionis applied. (b) The constraint Px = b does not impose anything to the orthogonal direction; x can have anymagnitude in (I — P)’s direction.
Figure 5: Fig. 3(b)'s relation spaces When Pi(t — h) — r» ≈ 0 ≡ ∣∣Pi(t — h — r»)∣∣2 < e is required. (a):Each relation space now becomes regions with thickness , centered around figure 3(b)’s relation space. (b):Relationship of the angle and area of overlap betWeen tWo relation spaces. With respect to the green region, thenearly perpendicular cylinder overlaps much less With it than the other cylinder With much closer angle.
Figure 6: Projection matrices of subspaces that include each other.
