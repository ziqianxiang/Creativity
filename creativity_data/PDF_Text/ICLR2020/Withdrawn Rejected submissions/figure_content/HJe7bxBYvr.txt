Figure 1: The proposed approach, illustrated. The transition dynamics of the environment is learnedand a directed graph called imaginative module is created from the rollouts. This is then used to planand check if the agentâ€™s next action will lead to negative consequences in the future.
Figure 2: (a) The gridworld environments are specifically designed to test agents against negativeside effects. Usage of imaginative module ensures that the agent does not take actions which lead tonegative side effects in the future. (b) The car simulator environment used to train the agent to drivesafely without going off the track. The baseline states here represents unsafe states.
Figure 3:  Illustration of our approach on the Side Effect Sokoban environment.  The baselinestate     is chosen as the environment state in which the obstacle is in its original position, hence,representing a safe state. Based on the imaginative module, a safe action is the one which allows theagent      to reach the baseline state in the future.
Figure 4: The Imaginative Module reduces visits to unsafe states. We plot the number of unsafestates visited by the agent in the respective environments, shown across training steps. Without anysafety constraints, the agent visits a high number of unsafe states. Incorporation of the imaginativemodule reduces the number of unsafe states visited even while training. The plot shows the averageacross 3 random seeds, with the dark line depicting an exponential moving average of the light line.
