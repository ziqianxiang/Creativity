Figure 1: Illustration Fractional Generalized Graph Convolutional Network model. The input is thefeature matrix X and the graph within dotted circle represents embedding LeVy Flights into randomwalks on graph (where Lγ is the Laplacian matrix L to a power γ). FGCN architecture consists ofthree main components: (i) FGS conVolutional layer with parallel structure; (ii) gated max-aVeragepooling layer; (iii) actiVation block for residual learning.
