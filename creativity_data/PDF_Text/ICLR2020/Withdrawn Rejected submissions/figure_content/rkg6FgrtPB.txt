Figure 1: Trainng NNE across generationsTo bound the error, We consider the subset of columns of W that have a nontrivial inner productwith a and take their sum, i.e., let J = {i : wi ∙ a ≥ √mIlakkwik} and d = | J|, and consider therandom variables:Y = 1 X wi and Z = Y ∙ a.
Figure 2: Convergence of allele distribution after t generations: x-axis shows the distance of the allele prob-abilities from 0 or 1 and the y-axis shows the fraction of n allele probabilities that are at a distance [x, 1 — x]from 0or1.
Figure 3: Number of genes (n) Vs performance of NNE: (a) Accuracy rates of NNE on MNIST 0 — 4 showingthe effect of number of genes on performance. (b) Similarly, We also plot the accuracy rates of NNE on MNIST0 — 9 dataset while varying the number of genes. The accuracy trends show that more the number of genes,better the performance of NNE, but at the cost of more training time.
