Figure 1: Plot of cratio as a measure of relative cost of labeling vs. obtaining unlabeled data.
Figure 2: Test accuracy (y-axis) under different number of labeled samples (x-axis, log scale). MMA(best) refers to the highest accuracy that any MMA variants achieves (with full results listed intables found in Appendix A.2). Note, the AL methods are essentially overlapping.
