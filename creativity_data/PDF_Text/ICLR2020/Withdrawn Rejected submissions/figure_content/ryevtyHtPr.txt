Figure 1: Intersections of the Ray and the Curve. (a) Example of ray going from one region tothe opposite one when crossing the curve. (b) Example of ray staying in the same region afterintersecting the curve. (c) All cases in which a ray could intersect a curve. In the three cases abovethe ray travels from one region to the opposite one, while in the two cases below the ray does notchange regions.
Figure 2: The Coloring Method with ConvLSTM. (a) The coloring method consists of several iter-ations of the coloring routine, ie. expanding the outside region and blocking it on the curve. (b)Diagram of the ConvLSTM implementing the coloring method, we highlight the connections be-tween layers that are used for insideness. X denotes the element-wise “Boolean not” of X .
Figure 3: Datasets and Results in Polar. (a) Images of the curves used to train and test the DNNs.
Figure 4: Cross-dataset Results. Evaluation of the networks trained in 24-Polar, Spiral and both24-Polar and Spiral datasets. The tesing sets are 24-Polar, Spiral and Digs datasets.
Figure 5: Learning the Coloring Routine. (a) 64 possible inputs and outputs of the training set ofthe Coloring Net for the relevant inputs. The Coloring Net is trained to reproduce one step of theColoring Routine. (b) Per image accuracy for different datasets training with different amounts ofexamples. 2-LSTM and Dilation are trained on 24-Polar.
