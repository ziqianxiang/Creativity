Figure 1: Example in the WikiBio dataset (Lebret et al., 2016) showing the biography of Frank Lino. Thebaseline Pointer-Generator (See et al., 2017) exhibits hallucination.
Figure 2: Example of learned attention score, base-LM probability, and confidence score. For content words thebase-LM probability is lower, and the confidence score depends more on the attention score.
Figure 3: Example of sampling a sub-sequence according to the confidence score. Our variational Bayesobjective combines the sampling probability Q(z|y, x) and the generation probability P(z|x).
