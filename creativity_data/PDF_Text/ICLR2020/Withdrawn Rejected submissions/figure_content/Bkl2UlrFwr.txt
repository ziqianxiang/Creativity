Figure 1: Overview of the proposed model. Dashed lines in the leftmost data points indicate theinitial graph topology A0 either from the ground-truth graph if it exists or otherwise from the graphconstructed using the kNN strategy. Best viewed in color.
Figure 2: Information floW of the proposed iterative learning procedure.
Figure 3:	Test accuracy (± standard deviation) in percentage for the edge deletion scenario.
Figure 4:	Test accuracy (± standard deviation) in percentage for the edge addition scenario.
Figure 5: Evolution of the learned adjacency matrix and test accuracy (in %) through iterations inthe iterative learning procedure.
Figure 6: Performance comparison (i.e., test accuracy in %) of two different stopping strategies:i) using a fixed number of iterations (blue line), and ii) using a stopping criterion to dynamicallydetermine the convergence (red line).
