Figure 1: Examples by feature space attack. The top row presents original images. The middle rowdenotes adversarial samples. The third row shows the pixel-wise difference (×3) between originalimages and adversarial samples. The '∞ and '2 norms are shown on the bottom.
Figure 2: Procedure of feature space adversarial attack. Two phases are involved during the attackgeneration process: (a) decoder training phase and (b) feature space attack phase.
