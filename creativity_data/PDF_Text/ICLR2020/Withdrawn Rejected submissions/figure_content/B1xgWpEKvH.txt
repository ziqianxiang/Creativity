Figure 1: Evaluation results on HPatches dataset (Balntas et al., 2017). “-LIB” indicates descrip-tors trained on Liberty subset of UBC Phototour dataset (Brown et al., 2011) and “-HP” indicatesdescriptors trained on training set of HPatches (split ‘a’). Marker color indicates the level of geo-metrical noises and marker type indicates the experimental setup. Inter and Intra indicate thesource of negative examples for the verification task. VIEWP and ILLUM indicate the sequence typefor the matching task.
