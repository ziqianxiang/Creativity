Figure 1: Structure of vanilla encoder and split encoder. The blue and short-dash box denotessharing-parameter block, and the red and long-dash box represents no-sharing-parameter block.
Figure 2:	MIG scores of verifying experiments in vanilla VAE and FactorVAE on dSprite. Insubfigures, the first violin graph is the baseline, the second one is a vanilla encoder with correlatednoise (σ = 0.9), and the third one is a sharing-parameter encoder with uncorrelated noise.
