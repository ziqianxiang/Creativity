Figure 1: We get excellent agreement of theory and simulation for spectral densities for any biasdistribution. We set φ = 1.5, ψ = 0.8, σX = σW = 1, and f = ReLU. Simulations are performedon matrices of size m = 214. Left Gaussian distribution over the biases with distribution N(0, 1).
Figure 2: Empirical spectral densities agree with our predictions for varied data distributions andshape parameters. Top left: One class from CIFAR (airplane), mean subtracted. Top right: Classes{0, 8} from MNIST, mean subtracted. Bottom left: Gaussian input data, varying the NN parametersettings and activation function. Bottom right: Input data with a bimodal spectrum. All plots usedf = ReLU, φ = 1.5, ψ = 0.8 and σW = σB = 1, except for the indicated modified parameter.
Figure 3: Comparisons of simulated ridge regression error and our theoretical prediction. We useReLU with σχ = σw = σp = 1 for all plots and vary the shape parameters φ and ψ. For simulationswe use m = 213 throughout. Note we also normalize the activation function so that Eb [η(b)] = 1.

Figure 5: Comparison of right singular vectors of X and F for MNIST (left) and CIFAR10 (right).
Figure 6: Comparisons of simulated ridge regression error and our theoretical prediction. Here Wevary the activation function by changing the slope α in leaky ReLU. In particular a = -1 is a linearfunction, α = 0 is regular ReLU, and α = 1 is the a scaled absolute value function. We normalize allfunctions so that Eb [η(b)] = 1. We get excellent agreement with theory from only a single sample.
