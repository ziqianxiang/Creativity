Figure 1: An illustration of multi-class learning from label proportions. Before training, the data aregrouped according to a bag generation procedure. During the training stage, we are given bags ofunlabeled data and their corresponding proportion labels. The goal of LLP is to learn an individual-level classifier.
Figure 2: In this toy example, we generate 5 bags, each of which contains 20 data points uniformlysampled from the “two moons” dataset without replacement. The vanilla approach, which simplyoptimizes the proportion loss, suffers from poor performance as the label information is insufficient.
Figure 3: The distribution of bag sizes from the K-means procedure on three benchmarks. When thenumber of clusters increases, the distribution of bag sizes becomes various.
