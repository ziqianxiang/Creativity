Figure 2: Inference Network	Figure 3: Generative Network2.1	Inference network modelWe assume that an observed data X is generated from a GMM with |C| components. Then, the latentrepresentation u is inferred according the following procedure:1.	One of the components of the GMM is chosen according to a categorical variable C .
