Figure 1: Spectrogram and waveform representations of the same 4 second audio signal. The waveformspans nearly 100,000 timesteps whereas the temporal axis of the spectrogram spans roughly 400.
Figure 2: The context x<ij (grey) for the element xij (black) is encoded using 4 RNNs. Three of theseare used in the time-delayed stack to extract features from preceding frames. The fourth is used inthe frequency-delayed stack to extract features from all preceding elements within the current frame.
Figure 3: Computation graph for a singlelayer of the network. Flt and Flf are thefunctions computed by the time-delayedstack and frequency-delayed stack, respec-tively. The outputs of these functions areprojected (by the matrices Wlt and Wlf)and summed with the layer inputs to formresidual blocks.
Figure 4: A sampled spectrogram viewed at different stages of the multiscale generation procedure.
Figure 5: Schematic showing how tiers of the multiscale model are interleaved and used to conditionthe distribution for the subsequent tier. a) The initial tier is generated unconditionally. b) The secondtier is generated conditionally given the the initial tier. c) The outputs of tiers 1 and 2 are interleavedalong the frequency axis and used to condition the generation of tier 3. d) Tier 3 is interleaved alongthe time axis with all preceding tiers and used to condition the generation of tier 4.
