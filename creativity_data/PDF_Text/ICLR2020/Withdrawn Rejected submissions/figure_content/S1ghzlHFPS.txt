Figure 1: Diagram (a) shows how the system state si evolves over time, generating observable events alongthe way. The event ei depends stochastically on the systemâ€™s current state si . The current state then updateseither deterministically or stochastically to si+1, where ei also affects this new state. Diagram (b) showshow the state may be factored into 3 node blocks. In this example, the relative probability of green events nowdepends on only the rightmost 2/3 of the state, and if a green event occurs, it affects only the leftmost 2/3 ofthe state. The update computation involves a matrix multiplication shown in (c); by zeroing out some blocksof the matrix, as illustrated in (d), we can ensure that the updated center node block is not affected by thepreceding state of the other node blocks at time i, nor vice-versa.
