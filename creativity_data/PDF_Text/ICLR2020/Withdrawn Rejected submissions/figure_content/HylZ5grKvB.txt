Figure 1: Visualization of spatially correlated noise and action space resolution. Left Close-upof a StarCraft: Brood War game with two players (blue and red), showing ≈ 12% of the wholemap area). The “fog of war” limiting the blue player’s observations is not shown here. RightFor the agent playing blue, we show (from left to right) the sampling noise for unit selection lu ,example distributions over positions for Attack and Move commands at different spatial levels l(top to bottom). Green represents high values, red stands for low values; actual values are scaled forvisualization purposes.
Figure 2: The toy micro task, where the goalis to find the opponent base. We play 30games between each agent after training forone day, and display the winrate in a head-tohead matchup, e.g. first to find enemy base.
Figure 3: Mid-game scenarioproper exploration scheme. Indeed, for a retreat action to be successful, the policy has to select anentire group of units (retreating half of the army causes the loss of the other half), and commit to thisaction for a few seconds until the group reaches a safe place.
