Figure 1: An original signal composed of three frequency components at 600, 750 and 900Hz - timedomain plot (top left) and frequency domain (top right) plots. The plots below show the upsam-pling results using the nearest neighbor, linear interpolation and Kaiser resampling methods. Theexamples illustrate the occurrences of high frequency sidebands (noise) when the first two simplerupsampling methods are used. This may be problematic if the high resolution output is required.
Figure 2: Overview of PUGAN. The generator is composed of the lightweight Wavegan Module forfirst generating the low sampling rate audio and several encoder-decoder architectures called ”band-width extension module (BWE)”, which upsample the input to a high sampling rate and enriches thecontent. We eliminate the number of layers from WaveGAN and instead attach a series of BWEs.
Figure 3: Original signal composed of three frequency components at 60, 75 and 90Hz - time domainplot (top left) and frequency domain (top right) plots. The plots below show the upsampling resultsusing the nearest neighbor, linear interpolation and Kaiser resampling methods. The examples illus-trate the occurrences of high frequency side bands (noise) similar to Fig. 1, however, the magnitudeof noise decrease. It demonstrates that upsampling method is more important in high frequency thanlow one.
