Figure 1: Fraction of violated constraints (left) and accuracy (right) as the number of iterations ofLPTML increases (average over 10 executions). Each curve corresponds to the Wine data reduced tod dimensions using PCA.
Figure 2: Accuracy in a syntetic data set scenario where a small fraction of points were placedadversarially. See Figure 3a.
Figure 3: Synthetic + Adversarial Noise scenario. On the left, the data set before learning. The centerimage shows the correct transformation recovered by LPTML. On the right, a magnified view of therecovered data.
Figure 4: Average running time of 10 executions of LPTML at different levels of dimensionalityreduction using PCA on the Wine data set. Each curve corresponds to LPTML limited to t iterations.
Figure 5: Running time for parallel LPTML on an increasing number of machines (average over 10executions).
