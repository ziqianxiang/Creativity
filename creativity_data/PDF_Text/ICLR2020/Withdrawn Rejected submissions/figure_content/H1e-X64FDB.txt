Figure 1: An example PWL defined by 8 key-value pairs, and the formula for linearly interpolatingthe PWL at any point x ∈ [k1, k8] (inputs outside the domain are clipped to the domain).
Figure 2: The effect of the proposed optimized index-mapping on a calibrated multilinear modelwith 8 PWLs. Untuned refers to the compiled implementation using an auxiliary mapping functionthat has B = 50 uniform buckets. Tuned refers to our proposed keypoint-dependent tuned indexmapping. Opt also uses a bounded linear searchWe estimate the cost Cm (x) to be CT (x) + λB + 4, where λ is a relatively insensitive parameterthat should represents the cache behavior cost of large arrays, and is set to 0.001 for all of ourexperiments.
Figure 3: We propose encoding the index in the low-order bits of the interpolation weight for bettermemory usage. For the double-precision floating point format the exponent instead has 11 bits andthe mantissa has 53 bits.
Figure 4: Left: Wine Model. The proposed strategies with float (in red) is 5.8 - 9.5× faster thanthe baseline interpreter (in dark green). Right: Selector Model. The proposed strategies with float(in red) is 5 - 6.5× faster than the baseline interpreter (in dark green).
Figure 5: Left: Travel Time Estimation Model. The proposed strategies with float (in red) is 5.25 -11.5× faster than the baseline interpreter (in dark green). The big speed-up here is because thereare a lot of PWLs compared to the other operations, and the proposed indexed calibrator strategytakes advantage of the fact that there are 4 PWLs for each of 39 inputs. Right: Whole Path Model.
