Figure 1: Scenario I: varied size of the confusion set. 5 models are trained for each size of theconfusion set (x-axis). Solid lines are the average result; shaded areas represent the Â± 1 standarddeviation (same for Figure 2 and 3). A larger confusion set leads to a higher test error, a trend wellcaptured by our metric and the other two; the robustness based metric fails.
Figure 2: Scenario II: varied data augmentation schemes. Four different schemes are used. Ourmetric works well as an indicator of the test error while all the other metrics completely fail.
Figure 3: Scenario III: varied batch size. Large batch size leads to poor generalization, captured byall the metrics except for the robustness based one.
