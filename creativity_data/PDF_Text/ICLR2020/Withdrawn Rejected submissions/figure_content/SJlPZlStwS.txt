Figure 1: Structure of the proposed pipeline. EdgeNetRob feeds the output of edge detection tothe classifier to produce robust predictions, while EdgeGANRob refill the edge image with textureinformation to reconstruct a new instance for predictions.
Figure 2: Visualization of intermediate stages of Vanilla Canny (Upper) and Robust Canny (Lower)on an image randomly sampled from Fashion MNIST. Results for clean images (Left) and adversarialimages (Right) are presented.
Figure 3: Test accuracy under different iterations in adaptive attacks.
