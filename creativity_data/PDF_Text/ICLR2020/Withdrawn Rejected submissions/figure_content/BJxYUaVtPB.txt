Figure 1: Overall architecture of our proposed algorithmic framework.
Figure 2: Detailed architectures of the key modules: module R (or P) (left) and module G (right).
Figure 3: Results of experiments. From left to right: BTL-sum model, BTL-product model, HOImodel, and a generalized Thurstone model. Off-the-scale curves are not shown. Amount of dataused for training is described in fractions of Dobs , 90% of the entire dataset for training (x-axis).
