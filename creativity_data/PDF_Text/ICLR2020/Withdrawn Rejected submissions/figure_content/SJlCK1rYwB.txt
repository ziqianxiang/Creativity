Figure 1: An illustration of our debiasing strategies on NLI. Solid arrows show the flow of inputinformation, and dotted arrows show the back-propagation flow of error. The combination is donein different ways for different models. Blue highlighted modules are removed after training. At testtime, only the predictions of the base model fM are used.
Figure 2: Accuracy of InferSent model trained with Debiased Focal Loss on SNLI and SNLI hardsets for different values of γ. Increasing γ reduces the contribution of the biased examples to theloss and concentrates the model on learning hard examples.
