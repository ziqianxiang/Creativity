Figure 1:	The rate-prior distortion function with (a) arbitrary distortion function d(x, f (z)) and (b)negative log-likelihood distortion function of - log p(x|z).
Figure 2:	AIS chain for estimating the rate-prior distortion function with NLL distortion.
Figure 3: The rate distortion curves of GANs.
Figure 4: RD curves OfVAEs, GANs, AAEs.
Figure 5: (a) Effect of damaging the prior of VAE by using a mixture with a bad prior. (b) Effectdamaging the conditional likelihood of VAE by adding a Gaussian kernel after the last decoder layer.
Figure 6: The RD curves of GANs, VAEs and AAEs with MSE distortion on the deep featurespace. The behavior is qualitatively similar to the results for MSE in images (see Fig. 3 and Fig. 4),suggesting that the RD analysis is not particularly sensitive to the particular choice of metric.
Figure 7: Analytical vs. AIS rate distortioncurves for a linear VAE.
Figure 8: The rate-prior distortion curves obtained by adaptively tuning the HMC parameters in thepreliminary run, and pre-loading the HMC parameters in the second formal run. ”rs” in the legendindicates the random seed used in the second run.

Figure 11: High-rate reconstructions (βmax) of VAEs, GANs and AAEs on MNIST. βmax = 3333 for100 dimensional models, and βmax = 36098 for the 2 and 10 dimensional models.
