Figure 1: Super-resolution global reasoning network (SRGRN) architecture3.1	ArchitectureAs shown in Figure 1, our SRGRN includes feature extraction part, global reasoning upsamplemodule(GRUM) and global reasoning reconstruction block(GRRB). Let’s denote ILR and ISR asthe input and output of SRGRN. The feature extraction part can use the relevant architecture of mostother models. Here we introduce the feature extraction part of the RDN (Zhang et al., 2018b) as anexample.
Figure 2: Global reasoning upsampling module (GRUM) architectureG = (V, E, u), where nodes in graph represent different regions in the image, E represents therelationship weight between the different regions, stored in the adjacency matrix of the graph, and uis the global information of the entire image.
Figure 3: Global reasoning reconstruction block (GRRB) architecture3.3 Global reasoning reconstruction blockAs shown in Figure 3, the specific details are similar to GRUM. We also construct a graph model forreconstruction block.
Figure 4: The results are evaluated on the Set5 dataset for 4 × SR. The proposed SRGRN strikes abalance between the number of parameters and the reconstruction effect.
