Figure 1: An example prediction task: on the left is the input target SMILES, and on the right arethe output reactants SMILES. The input is a single molecule, while the output is a set of moleculesseparated by a period (“.”).
Figure 2: For the input target compound shown on the left, three possible reactant predictions areshown on the right. Prediction 1 suggestions a heterocycle formation reaction, while Predictions 2and 3 both suggest substitution reactions. The only difference between the latter two is the halidefunctional group (Cl vs Br) highlighted in red. They share similar chemical properties and thusprovide no additional insights for chemists.
Figure 3: Input target molecule (1) with two automatically generated pre-training targets formedby breaking the bond highlighted in red. Examples (2) and (3) are generated from the random andtemplate-based methods respectively. The only difference is that the template-based pre-trainingexample (3) adds an additional function group to the molecule (blue).
Figure 4: An example of a template, where the exact bond changes are described in red. The “C-N”bond (left) is broken and a “Br” atom is attached to the broken “C” atom (right).
Figure 5: An example beam search; often times, the outputs of a beam search will be very similar toeach other, here only differing in a single atom for the top 3 predictions.
Figure 6: Heat map plotting the frequency that each latent class generates a specific reaction class.
Figure 7: A single molecule has many different SMILES representations. On the left (a) is thecanonical SMILES string, and on the right (b) is another SMILES string representing in the samemolecule.
Figure 8: The carbon atom (red) and the oxygen atom (blue) are neighbors on the molecular graph.
