Figure 1: A toy dataset generated by different GAN methods. Figure (a) is the original trainingdata and the others are data generated by ACGAN, WGAN and our BWGAN respectively. Thebackground color indicates the decision boundary of a random forest trained on corresponding data.
Figure 2: 2D visualization of real and generated Sensorless dataset. The mislabeled points areemphasized with border lines. The background color indicates the spaces of each class according tothe projection classifier.
Figure 3: Gnerated samples from WGAN and our BWGAN. The images in the same column are inthe same category.
