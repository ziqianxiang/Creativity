Figure 1: Confederated machine learning trains model across multiple dimensions of data separation.
Figure 2: The confederated machine learning train a model where an individual’s data are verticallyseparated in nodes.

Figure 4: (A)Two degrees of separation. Horizontal separation refers to fragmentation of an in-dividual’s data across silos, for example across hospitals and clinics. Vertical separation refers todifferences in the domain, semantics and structure of the data, for example, data from pharmacies,clinics and labs, each in their own nodes. (B) Study period. Patient’s data are divided into threeperiods. Observational period is 12 months, gap period is 1 week and follow-up period is 21 months.
