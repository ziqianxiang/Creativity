Figure 4: Rayleigh quotients of one-hot encoded label vectors for Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed, and Reddit(non-augmented) adjacency matrix acts as a low-pass filter (i.e., high-frequency components mustdecrease). We can increase the low-pass filtering effect by adding self-loops (i.e., considering theaugmented adjacency matrix) since it shrinks the eigenvalues toward zero as follows.3Theorem 3. Let λi (γ) be the i-th smallest generalized eigenvalue of (D, L) = (D + γI). Then,λi (γ) is a non-negative number, and monotonically non-increasing in γ ≥ 0. Moreover, λi (γ) isstrictly monotonically decreasing if λi(0) 6= 0.
