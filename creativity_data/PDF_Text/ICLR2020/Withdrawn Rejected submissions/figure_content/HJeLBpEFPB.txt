Figure 1: Illustration of our U2GNN learning process, e.g., for node 3 with d = 2 and N = 3.
Figure 2:  Effects of the number of steps (T ) (in the 3 top figures), and the number of neighbors(N ) sampled for each node (in the 3 bottom figures) in the unsupervised fashion.  Regarding eachdataset, for all 10 folds, we vary the value of either T  or N while using the same fixed values ofother hyper-parameters.
Figure 3: A visualization of the node and graph embeddings learned by our unsupervised U2GNNon the DD dataset. We do not include the embedding visualization of other baselines because thosemethods are significantly different from our unsupervised U2GNN.
Figure 4:  Effects of the number of steps (T ) in the unsupervised fashion.  Regarding each dataset,for all 10 folds, we vary the value of T while using the same fixed values of other hyper-parameters.
Figure 5: Effects of the number of neighbors (N ) sampled for each node in the unsupervised fashion.
