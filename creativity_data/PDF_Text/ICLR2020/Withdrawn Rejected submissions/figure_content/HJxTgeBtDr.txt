Figure 1: Relation chart among at-tributes, models, and datasets. Theattribute-aimed method could bridgethe gap between the model biasesand dataset biases.
Figure 2: The attribute defini-tion of the entity New Yorkin the sentence: “No newfixtures reported from NewYork .”Formally, We refer to M = mi,…,m∣M∣ as a set of models andP = pi, ∙∙∙ ,p∣p । as a set of attributes. As describe above, the test set E could be split into differentbuckets E = Ej,…,EjEI based on a attribute pj. We introduce the notion of performance tableT ∈ RIMl×lPl×lEl, in which Tijk represents the performance of i-th model on the k-th sub-test set(bucket) generated by j-th attribute. Next, We Will shoW hoW these approaches are defined based onT.
