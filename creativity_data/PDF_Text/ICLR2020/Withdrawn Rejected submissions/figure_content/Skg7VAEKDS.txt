Figure 1: Illustration of VAE modeling behavior as dim[z] = K and the capacity of μχ(z; θ*) arevaried. Blue dots and dashed blue circles represent training and testing samples located within theground-truth data manifold shown in blue. Analogously, red dots are outliers. The learned manifoldas produced by μχ(z; θ*) is shown in green, with dashed green lines denoting spread around themanifold from Y》0 in subplots (a) and (b). In the top row, the support of μgt is a 2D blob (i.e.,r = 2); for the bottom row it is 1D curve (i.e., r = 1). See Section 3.1 for a detailed explanation.

Figure 3: Histogram of VAE NLL values. Training on CIFAR-10, testing on CIFAR-10, CelebA,and SVHN. Increasing the network capacity makes the inlier NLL smaller but the outlier NLL largeras expected; larger capacity can potentially separate them even further.
