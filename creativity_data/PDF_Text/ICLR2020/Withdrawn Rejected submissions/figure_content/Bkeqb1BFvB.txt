Figure 1: Experimental results to illustrate how GLS behaves under edge addition (left), edge with-drawal (right). In this case, studied adjacency and perturbation matrix are binary.
Figure 2: Experimental results illustrate how truncated GLS behaves under iterative addition of 20new nodes with respectively 0, 1, 2 and 3 random connections with graph, for respectively synthetica 80-nodes Erdos-Reyni graph (left) and a 28-nodes molecular graph from MUTAG dataset (right).
Figure 3: Illustration of the impact of the truncation in term of classification accuracy of the molec-ular graphs. We represent the impact relatively to the 95-percentile truncation adopted for classifi-cation experiments.
Figure 4: Illustration of the relative importance of the dimensionality of GLS-embedding, after theiterative addition of 20 new nodes with respectively 0, 1, 2 and 3 random connections with graph,for respectively synthetic a 80-nodes Erdos-Reyni graph (left) and a 28-nodes molecular graph fromMUTAG dataset (right). We see that the first largest eigenvalues of the Laplacian are the mostimportant to discriminate a graph and its perturbed version.
