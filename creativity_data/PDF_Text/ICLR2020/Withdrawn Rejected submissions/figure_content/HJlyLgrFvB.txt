Figure 1: Incomplete State Solver Network (ISSN). Given an observation with incomplete informa-tion, traditional approaches (e.g., GIB) first sample its possible complete information states, solvethem to get good actions and accumulate the good actions to get a accumulated count/probabilityof each action. In contrast, we directly learn a Incomplete State Solver Network (ISSN) to predictwhich actions are likely given the incomplete information observation.
Figure 2: Reweighing sampled states by backtracking. Given the current observation ot , we samplepossible complete states sit and check whether they likely happen given the previous actions. This isdone via checking whether the likelihood of each previous actions a-j is high given the backtrackedstate, using ISSN. Note that ISSN takes an incomplete state as the input to mimic how the otherplayers reason about the current situations from what they can see. Disclaimer: the probabilities arenot real results from trained network.
