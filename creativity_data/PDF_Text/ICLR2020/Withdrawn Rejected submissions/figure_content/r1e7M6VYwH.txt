Figure 1: Two types of Dropout. The weight layer can be convolutional or fully connected layer.
Figure 2: The variance shif ratio for differet dropout variants in the 18 residual blocks fromResNet110, the third residual stage. Lower values are better.
Figure 3: Left: values of f (B) against different values of B. Right: the error rates of ImageNetclassification against different values of batch size.
