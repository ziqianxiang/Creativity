Figure 1: (a) The framework is mainly composed of encoder, DNN and FM. (b) The embeddinglayer maps both categorical fields and numerical fields into dense vectors. (c) The encoder layeris composed of multi-head self-attention module (MHSA) and position-wise feed forward modulewith the layer normalization and residual connection.
Figure 2: (a) The procedure for one head in MHSA includes vector mapping, similarity computingand output vector generation. (b) The bilinear function used in MHSA of DeepEnFM encoder.
Figure 3: Encoder serves in different positions. (a) Encoder serves as the feature extractor for DNN.
