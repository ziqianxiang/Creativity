Figure 1: Graphical depiction of the loss function in Eq. 4.
Figure 2: Comparison of the two loss function variants in Eq. 3 and 4. Here, a 5-layer CNN is trainedon the CIFAR-10 dataset to output a 2-dimensional embedding. The labeled loss function is used totrain the network for each figure. The displayed figures generated by sampling training examples andplotting their embeddings. Plots of test examples appear similar, albeit slightly more spread out forboth loss functions.
