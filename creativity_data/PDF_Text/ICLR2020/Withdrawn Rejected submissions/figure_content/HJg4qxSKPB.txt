Figure 1: Data augmentation reduces rugosity. The blue and black curves correspond to experimentswith and without data augmentation, respectively.
Figure 2: Explicit rugosity regularization. We plot the rugosity and accuracy on the training and testdata over training time for several different values of the penalty weighting factor Î». We observe thatrugosity can be used as an explicit regularization penalty at no cost to training accuracy but there areno test accuracy gains.
