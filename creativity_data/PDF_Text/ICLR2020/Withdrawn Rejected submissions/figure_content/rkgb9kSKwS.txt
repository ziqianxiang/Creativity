Figure 1: The comparison between the nonlocal operator (NL), nonlocal stage operator (NS) andours spectral nonlocal operator (SNL). Our SNL has more widely attention range as shown in thetwo red boxes benefited from the composition of the self-attention term and the self-preserving termwhich is taken effect by the W1 and W2. Our SNL degrades into the NL when W1 = 0 and NSoperator when W1 = -W2 = W.
Figure 2: The histogram of the strength statistics of the affinity matrix A where the abscissa is therange of the strength and the ordinates is the number of the elements in A in these ranges. We cansee that the histogram of Ak is nearly the same.
Figure 3: The implementation of the generalized Spectral Nonlocal Block, which added the self-preserving part (green map) and the full-order approximation part (red map) than the NL block.
Figure 4: The Feature maps of Nonlocal-based Network. Our SNL block has better results for thecrucial part of the birds as shown in the highlighted boxes.
Figure 5: The eigenvalue of the the nonlocal weight matrix trained on the CIFAR100 datasetThe number of the nonlocal blocks We test the robustness for adding multiple nonlocal blocks intothe backbone network which forms the three type network “Different Position 3 (DP 3)”, “SamePosition 3 (SP 3)” “Same Position 5 (SP 5)” as shown in Table. 4. The result are shown in Table. 4.
Figure 6: The histogram of the strength statistics of the affinity matrix A where the abscissa is therange of the strength and the ordinates is the number of the elements in A in these ranges. We cansee that the histogram of Ak is nearly the same.
