Figure 1:  Average return of POUM model over 3 different randomly selected random seeds com-pared with SoTA appoaches.  Solid lines indicate the mean and shaded areas indicate one standarddeviation. POUM beats all other solutions on environments tested, except for HalfCheetah-v2 whereit      has a competitive performances compared to MBPO.
