Figure 1: Euclidean space quickly "runs outof space" when fitting exponentially volumegrowing data such as trees. The embeddingdistance between the red and the green nodekeeps decreasing as the number of tree nodesincreases, meaning that the graph distance(shortest path length) is no longer accuratelyrepresented. Details in appendix B.

Middle: Poincare gyromidpoints (red dots)of two points for different weights on the left and Poincare gyromidpoints in a hyperbolic triangle onthe right with two equal and one free weight. Right: Mobius gyromidpoint in the Poincare modeldefined by (Ungar, 2008) and alternatively, here in eq. (10).
Figure 4: Histogram of Curvatures from "Deviation of Parallogram Law"Minimizing Distortion Our first goal is to evaluate the graph embeddings learned by our GCN mod-els on the representation task of fitting the graph metric in the embedding space. We desire to minimizethe average distortion, i.e. defined similarly as in (Gu et al., 2019): n12 Pi j∙ (( dxj ) - 1),where d(xi , xj) is the distance between the embeddings of nodes i and j, while dG(i,j) is their graphdistance (shortest path length).
Figure 5: Euclidean embeddings of trees of different depths. All the four most inner circles areidentical. Ideal node embeddings should match in distance the graph metric, e.g. the distance betweenthe pink and green nodes should be the same as their shortest path length. Notice how we quickly runout of space, e.g. the pink and green nodes get closer as opposed to farther. This issue is resolvedwhen embedding trees in hyperbolic spaces.
