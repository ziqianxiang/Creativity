Figure 1: This figure shows the overall structure of our non-parametric point process modeling vianormalizing flow. We learn a non-parametric distribution over the inter-arrival time of asynchronousevent sequences by transforming a base probability density which is conditioned on the past historythrough normalizing flow transformations.
Figure 2: Part (a) shows the deterministic approach of utilizing RNNs for predicting conditionaldistributionPθ,ρ(τi∣τLi-ι). RNN encodes history into the base distribution, then it gets transformedto the target distribution by flow transformation gθ. Part (b) shows the generation phase of incorpo-rating the flow module in a probabilistic framework. During generation, the prior network gets thehistory and output the latent space distribution for the next time-step. Then a sample of this distri-bution is passed to the decoder which generates the non-parametric distribution over the inter-arrivaltime of next time-step by incorporating the flow module.
Figure 3: Part (a) shows the results of modeling conditional distribution P(xi|x1:i-1) = N(4, 1).
