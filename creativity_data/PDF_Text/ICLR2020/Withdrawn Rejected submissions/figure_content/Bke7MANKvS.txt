Figure 1: Encoded model architecture. An uncoded model simply feeds the input features to a basemodel, while the encoded model stacks the input features and encoded features and feeds those to abase model with enough input channels to handle the original and encoded features.

Figure 4: Robustness is tested with samples perturbed by the white-box PGD attack (left), transferPGD attack generated on the uncoded VGG-16 model (middle), transfer PGD attack generated onResNet-18 model (right).
