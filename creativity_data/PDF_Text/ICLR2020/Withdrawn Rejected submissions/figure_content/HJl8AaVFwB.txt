Figure 1: The two proposed architectures for solving the MIL task. The models can process multiplereads (only two reads shown for compactness) independently from each other. During the MILpooling phase, the outputs for each read are combined to create a representation for the whole readset. Subsequently, the model can use this to directly predict the distribution over the taxa.
Figure 2: Rank-abundance curve for each taxonomic rank. All taxa are sorted using their abundance.
Figure 3: Distribution of taxa at the class rank. The target distribution is denoted in orange and theoutput of the model is denoted in blue.
Figure S1: Performance comparison of GeNet vs GeNet + Deepset. GeNet + Deepset achievessuperior performance on taxonomic ranks upto Family.
