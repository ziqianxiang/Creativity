Figure 1: We design agents that learn to reason over graphs by sequentially performing actionsfor inference. (a) We learn a function set. Each function is a possible message along an edge. Ateach time step of inference, our reasoning agent examines the current graph states and produces adistribution over the function set to sample from. (b) A set of these agents, each one considering itsown edge, is run to produce the full set of messages for a graph. Each agent maintains its own stateand can communicate with the other agents via a shared memory.
