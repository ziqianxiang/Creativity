Figure 1: Model Overview of G-PATE. The model contains three parts: a student data generator, adifferentially private gradient aggregator, and an ensemble of teacher discriminators.
Figure 2: Visualization of generated instances by G-PATE. Row 1 (real image), row 2 (ε =10, δ = 10-5) and row 3 (ε = 1, δ = 10-5) each presents one image from each class (the left 5columns are MNIST images, and the right 5 columns are Fashion-MNIST images). When ε = 1,G-PATE does not generate high-quality images. However, it preserves partial features in the trainingimages, so the synthetic images are useful to preserve data utility which can be seen from ourquantitative results.
