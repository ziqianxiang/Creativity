Figure 1: The general concept of multi-layer softmaxing for training multi-layer neural models withan example of a 4-layer model. Figure 1a is a depiction of our idea in the form of multiple vanillamodels whose layers are tied together. Figure 1b shows the result of collapsing all tied layers intoa single layer. The red lines indicate the flow of gradients and hence the lowest layer in the stackreceives the largest number of updates.
Figure 2: Distribution of oracle translations determined by chrF scores between reference and eachof the hypotheses derived from the 36 combinations of encoder and decoder layers (2,998 sentences).
