Figure 1: The crossbar structure. V is the applied voltage that correspond to the input x, G is theconductance of devices that correspond to the weight W, I is the output current, which can indicatesthe output y according to the Ohms law and Kirchhoffs law.
Figure 2: The test errors of different models on MNIST with varies level of uncertainty. The ‘mlp1’indicates the smaller MLP model, which has 100 hidden units. The ‘mlp2’ model indicates thebigger MLP model, which has 300 hidden units. The (α, β) indicates the level of uncertainty in theequation (1) and (4), respectively(0.1, 0.1)(0.5, 0.1)(0.5, 0.5)No uncertainty ∙• (0.3,0.1) ∙• (0.5,0.3) ∙Figure 3: The test errors of different models on MNIST with varies level of uncertainty using UATS.
