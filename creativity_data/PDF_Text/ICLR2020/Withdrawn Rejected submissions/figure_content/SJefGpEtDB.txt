Figure 2: CNN Analysis50, FMA instructions represent 60.93% and 62.95% of the total, respectively. Therefore, FMAinstructions constitute a large portion of the whole training workload, while other FP32 instructionsrepresent a small instruction count that remain below 1.1% for these three CNNs. This justifies tofocus on FMA instructions, as executing them in half-precision has a large potential for performanceimprovement.
