Figure 1: The DiagGCN model. The signal propagation from source node j to the target neighbor iinvolves j’s rescaling function according to its importance, i’s convolutional operation which sumsover the signals in its neighborhood and again rescales (renormalizes) the resulting signal, and finallyi choosing an encoder according to its current importance.
