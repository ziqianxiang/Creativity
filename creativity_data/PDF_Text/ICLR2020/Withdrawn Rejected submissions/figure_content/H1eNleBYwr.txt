Figure 1: Warfarin as an anticoagulant, if taken together with antibiotic drugs such as Cefixime orFluconazole, will have high risk to cause DDIs inhibition of clotting and gastrointestinal bleeding.
Figure 2: Graphical structure of GENN. Message passing procedure is conducted using Eq. 1 toupdate i-th node hidden state by aggregating neighbor edges and nodes information. Predictionis made for edge ei,j based on Eq. 2. Furthermore, we use an energy function via GNN to buildinteraction among all labels Y globally as introduced in Eq. 3.
Figure 4: Correlation Analysis. Pearson corre-lation coefficients between four randomly chosenDDI types. Each diagnoal subplot shows the cor-relations between ground truth and different meth-ods, while upper diagonal subplot shows the pair-wise correlations between DDI types.
Figure 3: Analysis of Robustness. Methods aretrained on 5%, 10% and 30% of edges on Deep-DDI dataset. Mean PR-AUC with standard devia-tion values are reported on the rest of edges. (Notethat the performance of LP is missing at the ratioof 30% because of memory error.
