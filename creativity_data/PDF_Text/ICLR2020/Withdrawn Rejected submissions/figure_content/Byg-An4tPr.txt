Figure 2: Conventional accuracy on the MNIST dataset given the privacy budget, under l∞ (μa =0.2).
Figure 3: Conventional accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset given the privacy budget, under l∞ (μa =0.2).
Figure 4: Conventional accuracy on the MNIST dataset given the attack size μa, under (e1 + e1 /γx +e1 /γ + e2) = 0.2 (tight DP protection).
Figure 5: Conventional accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset given the attack size μa, under (e1 +e1 /γx + e1 /γ + e2) = 2 (tight DP protection).
Figure 6: Certified accuracy on the MNIST dataset. The privacy budget is set to 1.0 (tight DPprotection).
Figure 7: Certified accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The privacy budget is set to 2 (tight DPprotection).
