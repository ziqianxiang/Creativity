Figure 1: Different estimators of total correlation vs. ground truth on latent space of dimension lowto high.
Figure 2: One dimension of mean has low variance (shutting down), and the distribution is stronglycorrelated (It appears to be almost flat due to small scale of the shutdown dimension). A sampleddistribution (e.g. z∣μ 〜N(μ, 1)) has a very low TC.
Figure 3: The shaded region indicates 90% confidence interval. (a) The total correlation of sampleand mean representation of FactorVAE on dSprite with β = 2, 6, 10. There is a large difference inscales of T Csample and T Cmean. (b) The total correlation of sample and mean representation ofRTCVAE on dSprite with β = 2, 6, 10 and η = 10. There is almost no difference between T Csampleand T Cmean due to the variance penalty term in equation 4.
