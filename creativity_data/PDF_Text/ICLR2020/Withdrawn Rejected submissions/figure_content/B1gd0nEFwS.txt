Figure 1: Various label-set relationships (category-gap).
Figure 2: Latent space cluster arrangement during adaptation (see Section 3.1.1).
Figure 3: A) Simulated labeled negative samples using randomly created spline segments (in pink),B) Proposed architecture, C) Procurement stage yields compact source clusters on experimental data.

Figure 5: Ablative analysis on the task A→D in OffiCe-31 dataset. A) Histogram of SSM valuesof xt separately for target-private and target-shared samples at the Procurement iteration 100 (top)and 500 (bottom). B) The sensitivity Curve for β shows marginally stable adaptation aCCuraCy for awide-range of values. C) A marginal inCrease in Tavg is observed with inCrease in |Cn |.
Figure 6: Comparison across varied label-set relationships for the task A→D in Office-31 dataset.
Figure 7: Comparison of target-unknown accuracy Tunk across varied label-set relationships for thetask A→D in Office-31 dataset. A) Visual representation of label-set relationships and Tunk at thecorresponding instances for B) UAN* (You et al., 2019) and C) ours source-free model. Effectively,the direction along x-axis (blue horizontal arrow) characterizes increasing Open-set complexity. Thedirection along y-axis (red vertical arrow) shows increasing complexity of Partial DA scenario. Andthe pink diagonal arrow denotes the effect of decreasing shared label space.

Figure 9: t-SNE plot showing placement of all the four clusters computed after adaptation for the taskA→D in Office-31. It validates our hypothesis in both Procurement and Deployment stages as shownby the highlighted clusters and the corresponding inferences in the legend under "Category clusters".
