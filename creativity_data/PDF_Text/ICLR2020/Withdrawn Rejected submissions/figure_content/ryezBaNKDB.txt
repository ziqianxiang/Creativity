Figure 1: Different contexts of the hand in four different categories. In Figure 1a, since the handmoves from left to right and the hand is on the right side of the iron, it is pull from left to right.
Figure 2: One example of a second-operation on 2D data with channel number C, width W, andheight H . For every position p in the feature map (HW positions in total), the ConvNet derives 9C-dimensional vectors. They are concatenated into a C × 3 × 3 filter to extract the pth output featurefrom a 3 × 3 region of the input feature map centered at p.
