Figure 1: Test accuracy of 10-layer CNN with various values for the c parameter in BF.
Figure 2: Randomly sampled images with full translation data augmentation and local translationdata augmentation from CIFAR-10. Full translation data augmentation can create unrealistic imagesthat harm the performance whereas local translation data augmentation creates more realistic images.
