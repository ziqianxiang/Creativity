Figure 1: Left: The number of constraints is on the y axis (log scale) and the number of iterations onthe x axis. Right: Plot for the maximum violation of a metric constraint (log scale) versus iterations.
Figure 2: The red line is the mean running time over 5 samples for the algorithm from Brickell et al.
Figure 3: The red line is the mean running time for the algorithm from Brickell et al. (2008). Theblue line is the running mean time for our algorithm. All computations were done on a machine with4 physical cores, each with 13 GB of RAM.
