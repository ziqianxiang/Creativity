Figure 1: Unrolled computation graph of a HRNN with two hierarchical levels.
Figure 2: Gradient floW in the unrestricted and gradient restricted HRNN.
Figure 3: Results on copy task with a sequence length of 500. Three different runs of deep HRNNs with theauxiliary loss in both levels (red) and with the auxiliary loss only in the lower level (green).
