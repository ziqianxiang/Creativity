Figure 1: Vision-language-navigation: performance of the agent drops in unseen environments.
Figure 2: The language ,distance, distribution (defined by language scores) and its relationship tosuccess rate.
Figure 3: Graph split: left is original data and right is re-splitting data. Black vertices are viewpointsvisited during training; red paths are val seen / val path-seen; blue paths are val path-unseen.
Figure 4: The success rate declines as the path moves further from training regions.
