Figure  1:  Overview  of  the  proposed  student-teacher  collaboration  method  compared  with  othermethods.  (a) Student and teacher network.  (b) Attention transfer (c) Factor transfer (d) Student-teacher collaboration.   Different from the previous methods,  we employ a collaboration networkwhich  is  a  connection  of  the  front  part  of  the  student  network  and  the  back  part  of  the  teachernetwork.  The difference between the predictions from the collaboration network and the teachernetwork is taken into account of loss during the training process. It can be clearly seen that our STCmethod additionally utilizes the knowledge from the top part of the teacher network.
Figure 2: Training process of the proposed student-teacher collaboration method.  We take the out-put tensor from the teacher network as the target of the collaboration network. The student networkis trained with the collaboration loss and the classification loss.  During the training process, theweights of the teacher network and teacher sub-network are fixed, only the weights of student net-work are updated.
Figure 3:  STC method on object detection task.  We take the backbone of the student network asstudent sub-network and RPN, ROI pooling,  detector module of teacher network as teacher sub-network.
