Figure 1: The input is de-rendered (step 1) to its intermediary representation (IR) - semantic, graphic,and textural maps. Then, this is adversarially perturbed (e.g., the red car is rotated) as described inÂ§ 3.2 (step 2). The resulting IR is then re-rendered to the generate the SAE (step 3).
Figure 2: Semantic space adversarial examples. Benign re-rendered VKITTI image (left), adver-sarial examples generated by iterative sFGSM over a combination of semantic features (right). Cyanboxes indicate car detected, purple indicated pedestrian, and yellow indicate cyclist. The adversarialexample introduces small changes in car positions and orientations, and noticeable changes in theircolor. This causes the network to detect pedestrians where there are none (top) and to fail to detecta car in the immediate foreground (bottom).
