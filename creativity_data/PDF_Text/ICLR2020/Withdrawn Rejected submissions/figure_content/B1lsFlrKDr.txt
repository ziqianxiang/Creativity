Figure 1: A dependency tree: directional arcs represent head-modifier relation between words.
Figure 3: Illustration of two different parsers. (a)LAP uses continuous latent variable to form thedependency tree (b) GAP treats the dependencytree as the latent variable.
Figure 4: In this illustration of the arcscoring matrix, each entry representsthe (h(head) â†’ m(modif ier)) score.
