Figure 1: Illustration of a two-layer fully connected TrojanNet. The transport network (top) is trainedto recognize traffic signs. When the correct secret key k is used as seed for the pseudo-randompermutation generator H , the parameters are permuted to produce a network trained for personidentification (bottom). Using an invalid key results in a random permuted network.
Figure 2: Test accuracy of TrojanResNet50 (TRN50), HashedResNet50 (HRN50) and ResNet50(RN50) on CIFAR10 (left) and CIFAR100 (right). Individual models, accuracy is represented by thedarker portion of each bar, and the ensemble accuracy is shown in the lighter shade. The error barsindicate standard deviation across different keys/models. See text for details.
Figure 3: Decrease in test accuracy for TrojanNets when training with multiple keys on CIFAR10(left) and CIFAR100 (right). Error shows standard deviation across different keys. See text for details.
