Figure 1: Behavioral Repertoire Imitation Learning (BRIL) trains a policy π(s, b) supervised ona data set of state-action pairs augmented with behavioral descriptors in R2 for each demonstration.
Figure 2: Visualizations of the 2D behavioral space of Terran army unit combinations in 7,777Terran versus Zerg replays. Each point represents a replay from the Terran player’s perspective.
Figure 3: Screenshots of typical army compositions produced by our trained BRIL policy withbehavioral features corresponding to the centroids of cluster 10, 11, 30 and 32. BRIL (C10) executesearly timing pushes with Hellions and Cyclones, BRIL (C11) is aggressive with Marines only, BRIL(C30) creates mixed armies with many Marines and Siege Tanks, and BRIL (C32) also creates mixedarmies but with less Marines and more Widow Mines.
