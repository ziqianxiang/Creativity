Figure 2: Reduction Graphof RNNDefinition 4 (Path in Reduction Graph). A path in the reduction graph for RNN is a list of nodesthat satisfies the following conditions: (1) it starts from an input node and end at an output node ofthe reduction graph; (2) it can at most cross one recurrent edge.
Figure 3: (a) An example of reduction graph. (b) An example of Skeleton MethodIn Skeleton Method, we first define the skeleton edges in the feedforward part and then use the skeletonedges to construct the basis paths. We prove that the paths that contains at most one non-skeletonedges are basis path.

Figure 5: An example of reduction graph of RNNHere, we use the example in Figure 5 to illustrate the above formulation. There are five weightsin Figure 5, denoted as (w1, w2, w3, w4, w5). Consider the path N1I,(1) → N3H,(1) → N3H,(2) →N3H,(3) → N3H,(4) → N4O,(4) whose counting vector is Cp = (1, 0, 3, 1, 0). It can be calculated asCp = 1 ∙ (1, 0,0,1, 0) + 3 ∙ (1,0,1,1, 0) + 1 ∙ (1, 0, 0,1,0) - 4 ∙ (1,0,0,1, 0), where (1,0, 0,1,0)and (1, 0, 1, 1, 0) are paths in the reduction graph.
