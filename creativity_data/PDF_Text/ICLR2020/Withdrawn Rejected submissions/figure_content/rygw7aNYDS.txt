Figure 1: RiverSwim ProblemWe first demonstrate the validity of our large-sample results. We use a policy that swims rightwith probability 0.8 at each state, i.e. π(1∣s) = 0.8. Tables 1 and 2 show the coverage rates ofthe constructed 95% CIs, for a small ms = 6 (using Theorem 1 and Corollary 1) and a largems = 31 (using Theorem 4 in the Appendix) respectively. The latter case uses a linear interpolationwith S0 = {1, 4, . . . , 28, 31}. All coverage rates are estimated using 103 independent experimentalrepetitions (the bracketed numbers in the tables show the half-widths of 95% CI for the coverageestimates). For the Q-values, we report the average coverage rate over all (s, a) pairs. When thenumber of observations n is large enough (≥ 3 × 104 for exact update and ≥ 105 for interpolation),we see highly accurate CI coverages, i.e., close to 95%.
