Figure 1: Subgraph isomorphism counting examples in different settings. The first is the homogen-eous graph counting problem. The second is a heterogeneous vertex graph counting problem wherethere are two types of nodes. The third is a heterogeneous vertex and heterogeneous edge graphcounting problem where there are two types of nodes and two types of edges.
Figure 2: General framework of neural subgraph isomorphism counting models.
Figure 3: Two views of different encoding methods. There are three labels of vertices (marked asorange, blue, and yellow) and two labels of edges (marked as solid and dashed lines). The numbersaffixed show one possible set of ids for the vertices.
Figure 4: Illustration of dynamic intermedium attention memory network (DIAMNet). Φ1 repres-ents Eqs. (1) and (2), Φ2 represents Eqs. (4) and (5), and two types of gates are Eqs. (3) and(6).
Figure 5: Model behaviors of three models in small dataset. The x-axis is the example id and they-axis is the count value. We mark the ground truth value as orange + and the predictions as blue ×.
Figure 6: Subgraph isomorphism counting distributions of two datasets.
Figure 7: Model behaviors of three CNN based models on the small dataset. We compare MaxPool,AttnPool, and DIAMNet in four different view settings. Here OV means that on the x-axis the binsare ordered by the size of pattern/graph vertex, OE by the size of edge, OX by the size of vertexlabel, and OY by the size of edge label. The orange color refers to the ground truth and the bluecolor refers to the predictions.
Figure 8: Model behaviors of three models on the large dataset. We compare CNN, RNN, andRGCN-SUM with our DIAMNet in four different view settings. Here OV means that on the x-axisthe bins are ordered by the size of pattern/graph vertex, OE by the size of edge, OX by the size ofvertex label, and OY by the size of edge label. The orange color refers to the ground truth and theblue color refers to the predictions.
