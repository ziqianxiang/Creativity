Figure 1: Plots: Top-left: Two densities P and q as in (2); Right three columns: The test statistic T on |Xte| =|Yte| = 100 samples i.e. under Hi (red cross) and the histogram of T under 1000 permutation tests i.e. Ho(blue curve). The population witness function (black curve) and the empirical one evaluated on test data (redcross for Xte, blue crosses for Yte) of the three methods are shown in the bottom row. Table: The mean, standarddeviation (“std”) and median of the test power computed over nrep = 20 replicas, as described in Sec. 3.
Figure 2: Three examples of 1D data in Sec. 5.1. Test power of: gmmd (blue), gmmd-ad (green), net-aCC(pink), net-logit (red), error bar standing for the standard deviation of the estimated power over 20 replicas, andgmmd+ (blue dash), gmmd++ (green dash). nall = |X| + |Y | including half-half training-testing split.
Figure 3: Test power of the different tests on data on sphere in R3 in Sec. 5.1. Markers same as in Fig. 2.
Figure 4: Two-sample problem of differentiating p, the density of authentic MNIST digits, and q which containsa δ = 0.4 fraction of digits “faked” by a generative model. |X| = |Y | = 500. The gmmd-ad and net-logittests use half as training set, and test on the other |Dte | = 500 samples. Left and middle: the most likely fakedigits identified by the empirical witness functions of the two tests, red box indicates authentic digits incorrectlyidentified. Right: The test statistic T (HI) and the histogram of its value under 1000 permutation tests (Ho).
Figure 5: Test power of gmmd (blue) gmmd-ad (green) net-acc (pink) net-logit (red) on differentiating authenticvs synthesized MNIST digits produced by a generative model, where sample X has all authentic ones, and δstands for the fraction of synthesized ones in Y , nall = |X| + |Y | including half-half training-testing split.
