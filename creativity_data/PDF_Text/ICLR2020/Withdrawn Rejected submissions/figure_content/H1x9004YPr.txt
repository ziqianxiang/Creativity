Figure 1: (a) Temperature of each word using the proposed method over training epochs. Each linein the figure represents a distinct token ranked by the frequency. The vertical axis shows the actualtemperature value with a minus of 2.  (b) Mean and confidence interval of the temperature over theposition in the sentence.  We can see that the average temperature is high at the beginning of thesentence and gradually decreases over time.
Figure 2:  The architecture of the proposed CT-MoS model.  Black components are those the sameas the MoS model, while the blue ones are the newly added ones in our approach.
Figure 3: (a) The weighted temperature over the token index ranked by frequency. Here the weightedtemperature refers to the absolute temperature multiplied by the frequency of the word in the corpus.
