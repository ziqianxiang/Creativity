Figure 1: Schematic depiction of DeepAGREL. At each node, a feedforward neuron (blue) and afeedback neuron (green) are present; separate feedforward and feedback weights connect the nodesin the network.
Figure 2: DeePAGREL algorithm plasticity gating. a) Example hidden layers of a network; b) Whenthe activity of the feedforward neuron is above the threshold, the feedback signal is propagated tolower neurons and plasticity is enabled; c) when the input to the feedforward unit stays below thethreshold for activation the feedback signal is not propagated to the lower layer and plasticity isdisabled.
