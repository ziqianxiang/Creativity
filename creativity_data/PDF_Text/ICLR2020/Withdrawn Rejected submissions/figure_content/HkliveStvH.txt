Figure 1: Left: image with scribbles from Pascal VOC dataset. Mid-left: semantic segmentationresult of our heuristic with layer 3 of ResNet 101. Mid-right: result of our ILP with probability mapof DeepLab V2. Right: ILP without connectivity prior (with DeepLab V2 prob. map).
Figure 2: Left: our scribble policy to draw as many scribbles as there are separated regions. Right:ILP-P that introduces pseudo edges which connect multiple regions of the same class.
Figure 3: Top: Cityscapes original image and image with superpixels and artificial scribbles, Bot-tom: semantic and panoptic segmentation of `0 H -prob, with DCNNâ€™s probability map as input.
Figure 4: Interactive segmentation on VOC 2012 val set. The mIoU increases significantly with justone correction scribble per iteration. Blue dot is our baseline and red dot the current SOTA DCNN.
Figure 5: K-Nearest cut generation strategy. Active nodes are shoWn in black, and the tWo vertexseparator sets are marked in red and blue.
