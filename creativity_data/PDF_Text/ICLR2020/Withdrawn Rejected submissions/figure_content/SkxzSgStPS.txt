Figure 1: Illustration of the relation between the prediction errors(i.e., flow loss) and the attention areas of an agent. (a) and (b)are two consecutive frames, (c) visualizes the flow loss, and (d)depicts the attention areas (Greydanus et al., 2018) of an agent.

Figure 5: Mean extrinsic rewards (with standard error) that pure exploration agents obtained in SuperMario Bros. and five selected Atari games. These environments feature complex moving patterns,and therefore our proposed FICM outperforms the baselines in Super Mario Bros., CrazyClimber,Enduro, KungFuMaster, and Skiing, while delivering comparable results in Seaquest.
