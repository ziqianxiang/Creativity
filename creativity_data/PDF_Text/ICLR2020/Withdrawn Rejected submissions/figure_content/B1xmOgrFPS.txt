Figure 1: Few-Shot object detection in the meta-learning setting. From the meta-train dataset, aKway-N shot support set and a query set are sampled to create a task. The meta detector makespredictions on the query set by using the knowledge from the support set, and updates the detectorbased on the loss on the query set. In the example above, there are many objects (person, dog andtruck), but it is annotated with the goal of detecting only a person. At test time, a single annotatedimage from a novel class (bear) is available for the detector to learn a model that can generalize.
Figure 2: The Meta-RCNN workflow. A set of prototypes of different categories are extracted fromthe support set. For each class, conditioned on these prototypes, a class-specific feature map fromquery set is generated by applying the class attention module to the feature map of the entire image.
