Figure 1: Example of attribution maps of different methods.
Figure 2: Results of the bias of the attribution map at the pixel level. RoW (I) and row (II) usedtrained LeNet, ResNet20, ResNet32, ResNet44, ResNet56 on the CIFAR-10 dataset from left toright; row (III) and row (IV) used trained ResNet50, ResNet101, VGG16, VGG19, AlexNet on thePascal VOC 2012 dataset from left to right. Row (I) and row (III) sampled pixels with the highestattribution values; row (II) and row (IV) sampled the pixels with the lowest attribution values.
Figure 3: Heat maps of mutual verification. A low value of Mmutual between two methods indicatesa more convincing mutual verification between them.
