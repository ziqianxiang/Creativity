Figure 1:	Equidistance in the latent space of the pendulum dataset. The black curves are points ofequal distance to a center. The distance is computed using (7).
Figure 2:	Boxplot of the condition number and the normalised MF for pendulum and MNIST datasets.
Figure 3: Equidistance in the latent space of the human motion dataset. (a) Jogging is a large-rangemovement compared with walking, so that jogging is reasonably distributed on a larger area in thelatent space than that of walking. (b) In contrast, without regularisation, walking is larger thanthe jogging in the latent space. For FMVAE, the Euclidean interpolatioins are much closer to thegeodesics.
Figure 5: Smoothness of the human dataset. Themean and standard deviation are shown. Thesmaller the value is, the smoother the model is.
Figure 4: Boxplot of the condition number andthe normalised MF of human motion dataset.
Figure 6:	Generated movements of the human motion dataset. The abrupt motions are marked byblue boxes.
Figure 7:	Influence of the data augmentation and the Jacobian normalisation. The movements arecoloured the same as Fig. 3.
Figure 8:	Equidistance in the latent space of MNIST dataset. (b) The data ranges on z1 and z2 of theVHP-VAE are [-106.21, 369.38] and [-365.64, 164.08], respectively. For better visualisation, we cropout the less dense areas.
Figure 9: Example identity switches between overlapping tracks. For vanilla SORT, track 3260gets occluded and when subsequently visible, it gets assigned a new ID 3421. For deeSORT andVHP-VAE-SORT, the occluding track gets assigned the same ID as the track it occludes (42/61), andsubsequently keeps this (erroneous) track. For VHP-FMVAE-SORT, the track 42 gets occluded, butis re-identified correctly when again visible.
Figure 10: Vector field of the human motion dataset. The vector field is a vector of L2 norm overthe output of Jacobian. The figures are corresponding to Fig. 3. The vector field of VHP-FMVAE ismore regular than that of VAE-VHP.
