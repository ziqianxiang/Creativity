Figure 1: Comparison between a model without our scheme (Without) to the same model withAdversarial pNML scheme (With) for various attack strength . For each dataset the correspondingmodel was trained with PGD trainset. (a) MNIST dataset. (b) CIFAR10 dataset.
Figure 2: (a) CIFAR10 performance for different attack strength . Two models are tested, thefirst trained with adversarial PGD trainset and the second with natural trainset. We compare theperformance of those models with and without our proposed scheme. (b) Regret histogram forcorrectly classified natural samples and PGD adversarial samples which causes misclassification.
Figure 3: (a) Regret histogram for correctly classified natural samPles and BPDA adversarial sam-Ples Which cause misclassification. In (b) the accuracy rePresents the ratio betWeen adversarialsamPles correctly classified or detected and the total number of samPle for various Î² . The black starPoint rePresents the Worst-case attack (PGD) against the same model Without our defense.
