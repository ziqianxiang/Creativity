Figure 1: Relationship between number of landmarks and mean classification error over all Reutersdatasets, shown in left figure and mean over all Office-Caltech datasets, shown in right figure.
Figure 2: Process of Nystrom Basis Transfer with ten landmark samples applied to Caltech vs Ama-zon image dataset as a surface plot. The left column shows the target and the right column showssource data. The first row shows samples used for creating NBT transformations. The differencesare clearly visible. The second row shows the data after transformation. Note the similarities instructure but differences in scale, based on the approximation error of singular values. The last rowcontains the normalization correction and differences are hardly visible with the bare eye. This isfinally used for training and testing. Note that this is a toy example approximation unsuitable forproper classification due to small landmark size, shown in figure 1. Best viewed in color.
