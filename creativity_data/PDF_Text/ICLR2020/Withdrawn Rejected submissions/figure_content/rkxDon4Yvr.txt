Figure 1: Find rates of programs satisfying IO specifications, over sub-corpus count, for both ourapproach (blue, higher) and random baseline (red, lower). Find rates for all 200 I/O specificationson left, find rates for unique functionalities on right. First standard deviation shown.
Figure 2: Program find rates over sub-corpus ancestry. From white at 0 find rate, to fully blackindicating 1.0 find rate. Border used to indicate a non-zero value. Plot cut off at ancestry = 8 dueto low sample size past this point. The way actual program outputs evolve is detailed in appendix 6.3.
