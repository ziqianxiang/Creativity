Figure 1: Simple tests of shift-equivalent. Blue lines are obtained by pooling, up sampling, andshift in order. Orange lines are obtained by shift, pooling, and up sampling in order. All Poolingoperations down sample original signals by a factor 4. The shift operation shifts original signals by2 pixels. The up sampling operation is set to equation 8. Best viewed on screen.
Figure 2: An illustration of the forward process of F-pooling. We assume the lowest frequencies areat center.
Figure 3: An illustration of how to replace max-pooling, average pooling, and stride convolutionwith F-pooling. We follow the settings in Zhang (2019).
Figure 4: With odd padding, F-pooling is strict shift-equivalent. Without it, F-pooling is not strictshift-equivalent. But the error is acceptable. Best viewed on screen.
