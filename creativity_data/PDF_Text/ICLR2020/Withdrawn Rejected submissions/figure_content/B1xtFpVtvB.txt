Figure 1: The figure shows how environments maydiffer in their visual aspects, like textures of thesurfaces. The textures provide a differentiator foreach environment, where without them the envi-ronments would have shared the same state space.
Figure 2: Different regularization methods tested on the RGB input. (Left): The average successrate show that some of these methods achieve similar results to ours in some instances. (Right): Thelower SPL of the other regularization methods relative to ours indicates some randomness in theirlearned policiespossibly due to the previously-common poor practise of testing and training in the same environmentso there is no generalization gap Cobbe et al. (2018).
