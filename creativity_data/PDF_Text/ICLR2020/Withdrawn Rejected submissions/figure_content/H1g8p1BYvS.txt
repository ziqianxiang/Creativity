Figure 1: Random ImageNet images for two labels - Monarch Butterfly and Chickadee - that wereeither selected (left) as adversarial by our AfLite algorithm, or excluded (right). The heatmapshows pairwise cosine similarity between EfficientNet-B7 features (Tan & Le, 2019). The AfLiteimages show significantly greater diversity - such as the cocoon of a butterfly, or the non-canonicalchickadee poses - that is in turn reflected by the cosine similarity. This diversity suggests that theAfLite examples more directly measure progress on the true task of image classification, versusfitting to dataset bias.
Figure 2: Four sample datasets with artifacts as input to AfLite (top). Blue and orange indicatetwo different classes. Only the original two dimensions are shown, not the artifacts. For the leftmostdataset with the highest separation, we flip some labels at random, so even an RBF kernel cannotachieve perfect performance. AfLite makes the data more challenging for the models (bottom).
