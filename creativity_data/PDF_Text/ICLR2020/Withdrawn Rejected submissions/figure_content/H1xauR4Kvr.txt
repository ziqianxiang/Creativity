Figure 1: Pictorial depiction for coverage and discrimination in uncertainty estimates. Red dots correspondto training data and dotted black line corresponds to the target function. Confidence intervals are visualized asshaded blue regions, and dotted blue lines are the upper and lower confidence bounds. The left panel shows aconfidence interval that perfectly covers the data points, but does not discriminate high-confidence predictions(regions with dense training data) and low-confidence ones (regions with scarce training data). The middle panelshows a confidence interval with a width proportional to the density of training data, but does not cover any datapoint. The right panel shows a confidence interval that satisfies both coverage and discrimination requirements.

Figure 3: Uncertainty estimates by all baselines on the synthetic dataset. Training data is shown as red dots andthe true function is displayed as a black dotted line. Confidence intervals are shown as a shaded blue region.
