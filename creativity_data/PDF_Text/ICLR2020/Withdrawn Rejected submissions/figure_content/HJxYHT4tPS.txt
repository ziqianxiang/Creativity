Figure 1: (a) Intuition behind our approach for a simple case. The mining operation shifts the prior inputdistribution towards the most promising regions with respect to given target data DT . (b) Architecture imple-menting the proposed mining operation on a single GAN. Miner M identifies the relevant regions of the priordistribution so that generated samples are close to the target data DT . Note that when training the miner thegenerator remains fixed. (c) Multiple generators. Miners M1 and M2 identify subregions of both pretrainedgenerators while selector S learns which pretrained model is preferable for the inference stage.
Figure 2: (Left) Illustration of generating target digit ‘9’ from MNIST (unconditional case) for on-manifoldand off-manifold targeted generation. (Right) Results for off-manifold generation. We generate 20 samples ofdigits ‘9’, ‘8’, ‘7’ or ‘5’.
Figure 3: Results: (left) On-manifold (CelebA→FFHQ women), (right) Off-manifold (CelebA→FFHQ chil-dren). Based on pretrained Progressive GAN. More examples are shown in Appendix C.
Figure 4: KMMD and FID on CelebA→FFHQ women (left) and CelebA→FFHQ children (right)manifold targeted image generation (see Fig. 2 left). We use 1000 images of size 28 × 28 as targetdata. In the on-manifold case, the trained network G already possesses this exact knowledge, andthus the miner’s goal is to correctly identify these regions by restricting the sampling regions in p(z).
