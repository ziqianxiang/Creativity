Figure 5: Distributions of certified bounds in (0, ) for CIFAR10 models trained against l∞ attacks. The totalnumbers of such test points are 1045, 2162, 1396, 1122, 1489 for KW, MMR, MMR+at, PER, PER+at models,respectively.
Figure 6: Parameter value distributions of CIFAR10 models trained against l∞ and l2 attacks. The Euclidieannorm of parameter for KW, MMR+at, PER+at model against l∞ attack is 18.08, 38.36 and 94.63 respectively.
