Figure 1: The problem family fm is characterized by regular polygons, where polygon Pm has2m+1 edges.
Figure 2: Constructing P 3 using folding and rotation transformations. The 3 blackened markersshow how 3 points in the input space are transformed during this process. (a-b) a foldXY operationmaps all points to the first quadrant. (C) the slice is rotated clockwise by 45° using a linear transfor-mation. (d-e) the bottom half is mapped into the first quadrant using a f oldX operation. (f) rotateby 45/2°. (g-h) folding. final rotation by 45/4° and a final linear decision boundary that correctlyclassifies the three points.
Figure 3: : a.) The response regions of the constructed solution for P2 . b.) A shallow, one layerMLP that solve P2 - Such an MLP must model each of the regular polygon edges separately .
Figure 4: Left: Ve0ven are created by taking every second vertex of P m then moving them slightlysuch that they are strictly outside Pm. Right: a chord a in green connecting any two verticesof Ve0ven, must cross Pm . Had both of the chord vertices been in the same response region, byconvexity so do all points on a. By linearity, the final network activation of a’s points will interpolatethe activation of a’s endpoints.
Figure 5: By iteratively introducing lines we can count the maximal number of regions created byk lines. In general positions, the 4th introduced line (d. in greed) will intersect its 3 predecessorin 3 different points. These will create 4 sections, each splitting a region into two (red-blue) henceadding 4 regions to the total count.
