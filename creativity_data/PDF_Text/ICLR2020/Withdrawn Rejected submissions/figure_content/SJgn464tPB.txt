Figure 1: Performance plots of the TD3 [6] algorithm.
Figure 2: Conservative Policy Gradients.
Figure 3: Evaluation without (TD3) and with the Conservative (C-TD3) update rule. X-axis denotesthe number of gradient steps taken.
Figure 4: Failure analysis of the Ant-v2 domain.
Figure 5: Stationary distribution of a bounded random walk process. As the probability of improving(moving to the right) increases, the distribution shifts towards a delta function around the optimalvalue.
Figure 6: C-TD3, parameter ablation. Comparison is performed every 1,000 steps over 5 episodeswith swap confidence of 1 - δ = 95, 90, 80 and 50.
Figure 7: C-TD3, parameter ablation. Comparison is performed every 1,000 steps over 10 episodeswith swap confidence of 1 - δ = 95, 90, 80 and 50.
Figure 8: C-TD3, parameter ablation. Comparison is performed every 1,000 steps over 100 episodeswith swap confidence of 1 - δ = 95, 90, 80 and 50.
Figure 9: C-TD3, parameter ablation. Comparison is performed every 10,000 steps over 5 episodeswith swap confidence of 1 - δ = 95, 90, 80 and 50.
Figure 10: C-TD3, parameter ablation. Comparison is performed every 10,000 steps over 10episodes with swap confidence of 1 - δ = 95, 90, 80 and 50.
Figure 11: C-TD3, parameter ablation. Comparison is performed every 10,000 steps over 100episodes with swap confidence of 1 - δ = 95, 90, 80 and 50.
Figure 12: On the left is the evaluation of the online network, whereas on the right we presentthe performance curves of the target network. It is clear across all domains that the target networkexhibits a dramatic reduction in variance.
