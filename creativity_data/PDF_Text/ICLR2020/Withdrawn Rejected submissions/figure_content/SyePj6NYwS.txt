Figure 1: Left: an image from VG with ground truth bounding boxes and labels. Right: an exampleofa scene graph. The graph contains the objects player and ball. The interaction between them,which we would like to infer is dribbling, is absent from the training data.
Figure 2: An overview of RONNIE. Our model comprises four components: (1) an object detector,(2) an object attention mechanism, i.e., neighbor self-attention mechanism, (3) an object-relationshipmapping (ORM), and (4) a relationship attention mechanism. An image is fed into an object detectorto extract visual features, the visual features of the objects go through a self-attention mechanismand then are classified. At this stage, we pool visual features for the relationships using a CNN. Weextract relationship candidates given the object classes we detected with the ORM. Lastly, we feedthe top-K relationship candidates into a relationship attention mechanism to leverage the linguistictext and classify the relationships.
