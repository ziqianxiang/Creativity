Figure 1: The number indicates the total swapping by AMSGrad at vt,i. The darker heat map colorsreveal the lower average swapping interval.

In general, from the experiments, AdamALconstantly achieve 1% more accuracy gain than Adam. Notice that we only conduct our experimentswith 80 epochs, this is due to that fact that we observe there is no further accuracy improvementwithout performing any hyperparameter tuning. If we perform hyperparameter tuning, the resultsshow in Table.1. AdamAL can finally reach to 95% accuracy on average on test data, however, thebest run of Adam is still lower than AdamAL. It is also worth mentioning that AMSGrad have evenworse performance than Adam due to non-alignment. We also compare the result of AdamAL usingdifferent mini-batch settings, the result shows that AdamAL is also not sensitive to min-batch size.
