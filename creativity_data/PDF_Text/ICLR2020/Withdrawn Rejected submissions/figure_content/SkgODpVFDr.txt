Figure 2: The result of CIFAR-10 across various α. WRN 16-4 (Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2016)and DenseNet-BC 12-100 (Huang et al., 2017) are used. The test error at the last epoch is used andthe reported results are averaged out of 5 runs.
Figure 3: The layerwise RF of ImageNet-1k pre-trained models. The layerwise RF images in the toprow are based on ResNet50 with the regular convolution, the ones in the middle row are calculatedfrom ResNet50 with ss convolutions and the ones in the bottom row are generated from SEResNet50.
Figure 4: The channelwise RF of ImageNet-1k pre-trained model. The RF is calculated based onthe output of the channel 64 in ConV2_1. (a)-(b) RF of ReSNet50 with SS convolution. (c)-(d) RF ofSEResNet50. The red color indicates that the pixel there changes features inside the blue box, andthe white color repreSentS that featureS are invariant. For clarity, we convert the valueS that SatiSfyσ(R) ≥ 0.1 into 1.0.

Figure 6: The reCeptive field of ImageNet-1k pre-trained ResNet50. The red Color indiCates thatthe pixel there Changes features inside the blue box, and the white Color represents that features areinvariant even if the pixel there Changes the value itself.
