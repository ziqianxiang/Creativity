Figure 1: An example of the program synthesis task, wherean agent is presented with a context s0 consists of a naturallanguage question and a table, and is asked to generate aprogram z = (z1, z2, .., zn). The agent receives a reward of1 if execution of z on the relevant data table leads to thecorrect answer g (e.g., “Nicky English”).
Figure 2: Overview of GACA: it consists of mul-tiple actors for sampling and storing high rewardepisodes into buffer B and zero reward episodesinto buffer C , gradient is estimated at centrallearner periodically using samples from both B, Cbased on Equation 13.
Figure 3: Comparing GACA and baselines on benchmarks. The plotis average of 5 runs with a bar of one standard deviation.
