Figure 1: Examples of CIFAR-10 (Krizhevsky, 2009) Images augmented by Copyout.
Figure 2: Comparison of Copyout with different buffer sizes to store augmented images. “Copyout- no Buf” selects the source images from the whole training set without buffer and augmentation.
Figure 3: Comparison of Cutout, SamplePairing, Copyout and CopyPairing. Also illustrated is thebaseline with just default image augmentation and without any further augmentation. Method nameand median test error rate is given by the caption. Each experiment has been repeated at least 12times to draw the boxplots.
Figure 4: Comparison of three different extends of the square area for Copyout. Method name withthe selected extend and median test error rate is given by the caption. Each experiment has beenrepeated at least 12 times to draw the boxplots.
Figure 5: Comparison of different CopyPairing experiments. The ratios of SamplePairing andCopyout epochs have been varied. For example 3:1 means 3 epochs of SamplePairing followedby 1 epoch of Copyout in phase 2 of the SamplePairing technique. CopyPairing 1:1 noFT showsthe results of a 1:1 CopyPairing experiment without phase 3 (fine-tuning). Method name with theselected ratio and median test error rate is given by the caption. Each experiment has been repeatedat least 12 times to draw the boxplots.
