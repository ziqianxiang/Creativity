Figure 1: Visualization of pointspread functions (convolutional kernels) observed to be learned inthe early layers of ConvNets. Brightness corresponds to pointwise function values. The majority ofthe plots show characteristics of oriented bandpass filters in two spatial dimensions, i.e., oscillatingvalues along one direction, while remaining relatively constant in the orthogonal direction, evenas there is an overall amplitude fall-off with distance from the center. The specific examples derivefrom the early layers of a ResNet-50 architecture (He et al., 2016) trained on ImageNet (Russakovskyet al., 2015).
Figure 2: Visualization of an analytically defined oriented bandpass filter (12). The left panel showsthe pointspread function corresponding to the odd symmetry (sin) component, while the right panelshows its power in the frequency domain. Brightness corresponds to pointwise function values.
