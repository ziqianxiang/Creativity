Figure 1: Our MIL model. First, we extract features from a deep feature extractor φ for each in-stance. Then the instance classifier ψ outputs classification scores for each instance. The bottomstream consists of two sub-functions, the instance weighting 夕 and the Gaussian normalization func-tion σ. Finally, the scores of two streams are multiplied and aggregated by ρ to get the bag score.
Figure 2: A bag from CIFAR-10-MIL dataset with one positive instance (horse) where the bag sizeis 10. The bag is labeled as category horse. Each bag has positives only from a single category.
Figure 3: Results for varying the num-ber of positive instances for a fixed bagsize of 50.
Figure 4: (a-e): Multi-class MIL classification performance (averaged over 10 runs) on CIFAR-10-MIL dataset. Each training bag has a maximum of 10 positive instances and a minimum of 1.
