Figure 1:  Feature extraction network architecture.  D denotes the dilation rate, 1*1 conv denotesthe convolution layer with kernel size of 1,  Cat denotes concatenate operation,  Mul denotes thechannel-wise multiplication and BN denotes the batch normalization.
Figure 2: The effect of the dilation rate on the size and density of the receptive field. We normalizedthe  value  change  to  the  range  of  [0,1]  and  mapped  it  to  the  input  images.   For  clarity,  only  the100*100 pixel images that are centered on the high-level neuron are retained.
