Figure 1: Identity clustering pattern analysis on StyleGAN and PGGAN, both trained on CelebAHQ.
Figure 2: Visualization of the worst-case dense mode Im w.r.t. different size of the S. S is a collectionof randomly sampled images.
Figure 3: Empirical study on possible causes of the mode collapse. The shaded areas denote thevarianCes of neighboring statistiCs for different experiments (Caused by re-initialization/training;running different iterations; and varying arChiteCtures: see the texts for details). We empiriCally set m(|S|) to be 100, 000 and M (|T |) to be 1, 000, 000. To study the worst-case dense mode, p (|Robs|)and is set to be 1.

Figure 8: Identity clustering pattern analysis of StyleGAN on CelebAHQ using different percentileas clustering anchorIn this figure, we show the clustering pattern of choosing different percentiles in step 1 mode detection.
Figure 9: Identity clustering pattern analysis of StyleGAN on CelebAHQ using training data asclustering anchorWe can observe that the Rref overlays with Robs and we can not reject the hypothesis. Generatedimages are not severe clustered around anchors from training data, indicating that GAN models havethe capability to generate "new faces". The width of the Rref band in Fig. 8 is similar to that in Fig.
