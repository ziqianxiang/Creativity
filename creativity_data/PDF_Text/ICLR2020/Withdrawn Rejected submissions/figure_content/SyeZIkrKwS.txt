Figure 1: The overall framework of the proposed dynamic convolution.
Figure 2: Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient between feature maps. S, M, W, N denotestrong, middle, weak and no correlation respectively.
Figure 3: The coefficient prediction module.
Figure 4: Basic building bolcks for Dynamic Network variants of MobileNet (a), shuffleNet(b)?ResNet18 (c), and ResNet50 (d).
Figure 5: Compare with MobileNetV2 under thesimilar Flops constraint.
Figure 6: The correlation distribution of fixed kernel and the generated dynamic kernel, S, M, W,N denote strong, middle, weak and no correlation respectively. We can observe that compared withconventional fixed kernels, the generated dynamic kernels have small correlation values.
Figure 7: Latency for different input size.If we denote the latency ofMobileNetV2(1.0),Dy-mobileas LFix and LDym, then Latency Reduced Ratio is defined as 100% - LLDym.
