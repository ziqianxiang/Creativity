Figure 1: Conditional MDN density estimate (red) and true conditional density (green) for differentnoise regularization intensities hz âˆˆ {0.0, 0.05, 0.2}. The MDN has been fitted with 3000 samplesdrawn from a conditional Gaussian.
Figure 2: Comparison of different noise intensity schedules hn and their implications on the Perfor-mance of various CDE models across different training set sizes.
Figure 3: Comparison of various regularization methods for three neural network based CDE mod-els. The models are trained with simulated data sets of different sizes.
Figure 4: Conditional density simulation models. Conditional probability densities correspondingto the different simulation models. The coloured graphs represent the probability densities p(y|x),conditioned on different values of x.
