Figure 1: a) An example from YELP for the task of sentiment transfer. <POS> represents positivetarget style, <SRCSTART> indicates the start of the input sentence, <START> indicates the start of theoutput sentence and <END> is end-of-sentence marker. b) RL-STâ€™s training algorithmDecoder (MD) (Fu et al., 2018), Unpaired (UnP) (Xu et al., 2018), DeleteOnly (DO) (Li et al.,2018), DeleteAndRetrieve (DR) (Li et al., 2018), Back-translation (BT) (Prabhumoye et al., 2018),Unsupevised MT (UnMT) (Zhang et al., 2018), Revision in Continuous Space (RC) (Liu et al.,2019), Masked Language Model (MLM) (Wu et al., 2019c), Point-Then-Operate (PTO) (Wu et al.,2019a), B-GST (Sudhakar et al., 2019), G-GST (Sudhakar et al., 2019) and DualRL (DRL) (Luoet al., 2019). Each of these models were among the state-of-art models at different points of time.
