Figure 1: Illustration of two characteristics; (a) Positive attention, (b) Negative separation. Datapoints with same shape and same color in this plot are positive samples. Otherwise, they are negativesamples.
Figure 2: Illustration ofbasic architecture in SUPer-AND. Original RGB images and Sobel-Processedimages are encoded by backbone CNN networks and concatenated. These vectors then projected to128 dimensional sphere embedding with l2 normalization. Finally, adjacency relationship vectorand probability vector are calculated.
Figure 3: t-SNE visualization for the learned representationsof three selected classes from CIFAR-10 in (a) AND (Huanget al., 2019) and (b) Super-AND.
Figure 4: Neighborhood con-sistency over training rounds.
Figure 5: The nearest-neighbor retrievals of example queries from STL-10. The upper retrieval rowfrom every query shows the results from the AND model, and the lower ones are from the Super-AND model. The left-side results are successful cases for both models, and the right-side results arefailure cases. Images with surrounding red frames indicate the wrongly retrieved negative samples.
