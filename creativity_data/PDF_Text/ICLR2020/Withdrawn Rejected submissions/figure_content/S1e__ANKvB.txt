Figure 1: Overview of GET. The input SMILES will be processed by the two-sub encoders (graphencoder and transformer encoder) somehow to be transformed to its hidden representation. Then, ateach step, the decoder will utilize the hidden representation and all outputs of the previous steps togenerate the present step,s SMILES character.
Figure 2: Illustration of four fusion strategies in the encoder of GET. The integral encoder is com-posed of two sub-encoders: graph encoder and transformer encoder. The embedding layer is asdescribed in 4.2 . The hidden representation of the target molecule can be obtained in four ways(GET-LT1, GET-LT2, GET-CT and GET-LG).
