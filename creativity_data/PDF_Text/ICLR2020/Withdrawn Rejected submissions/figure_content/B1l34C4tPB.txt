And for the Rastrigin function, we again use a network with 3 hiddenlayers, but with 16, 16, and 8 hidden units. In both cases, we approximate the Hessian with a rank 5matrix. We report two sets of results, using different schemes for setting the βt parameter (used ininf and lcb methods).

Figure 3:	MNISTis proportional to the probability (as predicted by the model), that the image belongs to the particularclass. With this, we can define an optimization task: find the image that maximizes the output ofa particular unit. This is similar to a neuroscience visual stimulus selection experiment, where theoutput unit could be a single neuron in the visual cortex.
