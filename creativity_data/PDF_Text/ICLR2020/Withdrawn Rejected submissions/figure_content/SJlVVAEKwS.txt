Figure 1: The proposed adversarial imitation attack. For the training stage, the objective of G is togenerate samples X = G(X) + X and let y° (X) = yτ(X). The objective of D is to guaranteeyD(X) = yτ(X). For the testing stage, the imitation model D is utilized to generate adversarialexamples to attack T.
Figure 2: Visualization of some adversarial examples generated by the imitation model on MNIST.
Figure 3: Visualization of some adversarial examples generated by the imitation model on CIFAR-10. Original examples are in the first row. Examples from the second row to the third row aregenerated through FGSM, BIM, PGD, respectively.
Figure 4: Visualization of some disturbances generated by the generator in training stage. The cleanimages added with the disturbances are used to train the imitation network.
Figure 5: Accuracy curve of the imitation model on the 500 testing samples of MNIST and CIFAR-10 in adversarial imitation training. The number of training samples is 9500. We show the raw datawithout filtering.
Figure 6: Comparison of attack success rate between the proposed method and the practical methodon the early training stage.
