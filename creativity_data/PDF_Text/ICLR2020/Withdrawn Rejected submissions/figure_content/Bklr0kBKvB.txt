Figure 7: Qualitative results of adopting different α and β . All the adversarial examples are gen-erated via targeted attacked method to the same target. We fix all the other hyperparameters whentuning one. The default parameters are α = 0.1 and β = 1.0. As can be seen in the figure, smallerα leads to more obvious outliers; and larger α leads to the deformation of the point cloud, due to theoverwhelming focus on the outliers while ignoring the whole shape. On the other hand, smaller βleads to high frequency outliers near the surface; and again, larger β leads to the deformation of thewhole point cloud.
