Figure 1: Recovery error (∣∣AA> - Z*∣∣f) with different observed sample sizes n and outputdimension d.
Figure 2: Comparisons of different performance with leakyReLU and tanh activations. Same colorstarts from the same starting point. For both cases, parameters always converge to true covariancematrix. Each arrow indicates the progress of 500 iteration steps.
