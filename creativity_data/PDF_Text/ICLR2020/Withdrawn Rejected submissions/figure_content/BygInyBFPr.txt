Figure 1: Illustration of the Pareto-frontier on a random toy categorical distribution with size 20.
Figure 2: Evaluation of quality and diversity on synthetic data. Vertical dashed lines show theboundary of maximum diversity. Left: The original metrics. Right: The quality discrepancy underthe same diversity level compared with the Pareto-frontier.
Figure 3: Evaluation of quality and diversity on MSCOCO dataset. We apply 7 hyper-parametersfor each method, their corresponding values from left to right are: [1.3, 1.2, 1.1, 1.0, 0.9, 0.8, 0.7]for t in temperature-based method; [-0.85, -0.9, -0.95, -1.0, -1.1, -1.2, -1.3] for w in QDTC-logarithm; [1e9, 1e8, 1e7, 0, -1e6, -2e6, -5e6] for b in QDTC-reciprocal.
