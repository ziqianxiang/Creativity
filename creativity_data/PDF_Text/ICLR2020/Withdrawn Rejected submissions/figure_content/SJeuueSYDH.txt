Figure 1: DTS maintains a good scala-bility when network latency increases,while the performance of conventionalalgorithms degrades quickly.
Figure 2: Network conditions across different continents (Left) and the comparison between connec-tions inside a cluster (Right). Different from training inside a data center, long-distance distributedtraining suffers from high latency, which proposes a severe challenge to scale across the world.
