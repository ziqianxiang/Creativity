Figure 1: Feature set comparison on simulated prediction tasks. Each point represents a single task,and the legend shows the portion of tasks in which the method on y-axis outperforms the method onx-axis.
Figure 2: Features are selected by learning a restricted autoencoder (RAE), and can be applied indownstream prediction tasks.
Figure 3: Imputation loss results. The MSE is normalized by the total variance of each dataset.
Figure 4: Results from the simulation study using scRNA data. Heatmaps provide pairwise compar-isons, showing the portion of tasks in which features from the method on the y-axis achieved betterperformance than features from the method on the x-axis.
Figure 5: Downstream prediction accuracy versus imputation loss for subsets of 10 features selectedby each method. Results across both datasets reveal a relationship between reconstruction abilityand the predictive power of subsets of features.
Figure 6: Variance of imputation loss achieved by RAEs, and comparison with randomly selectedfeatures.
Figure 7: Bar chart of gene selections on single-cell RNA sequencing data. The stacked bar chartshows how many times each gene was among the 10 genes selected by each method, within 20 trials.
Figure 8: Comparison of RAEs learned through iterative elimination, and a single ranking step.
Figure 9: Results from the simulation study using single-cell RNA sequencing data. 250 responsevariables were simulated with three kinds of dependencies on the original features (750 total tasks)and were predicted using subsets of features. Heatmaps show pairwise comparisons between featuresets, displaying the portion of tasks in which features from the method on the y-axis outperformedthose on the x-axis.
