Figure 1: We assume the underlying sequence to follow a graphical model in the form of (a), wherec encodes constant and zt encode dynamic features. Observed variables are shaded. Our model usesthe graphical model shown in (b) to approximate this sequence without a representation of c.
Figure 2: A pair of samples (x0, x1) from the CarRacing-v0 experiment. Shown are x0, x1 and theweighted pixel-wise error contribution to L(x0, x1), brighter indicates larger error-contribution.
Figure 3: Visualisation of μ(xt+ι, Xt) for two of the models depicted in Figure 5 obtained by choos-ing the same input image and transforming it with Φ, varying θ0 and θ1 for fixed r = 1. (a): Forthe model in Figure 5d, fix θo and vary θι - θo ∈ [-∏∕4, ∏∕4]. It is clear to see that the featuresapproximate a piece-wise linear function with discontinuity. Note that features Zi < 2 are outsidethe visible range ofFigure 5d. (b): For the model in Figure 5b, vary θ° ∈ {2π ∙ i/10 | i = 1,..., 10}and θ1 -θ0 ∈ [-π∕4, π∕4]. Colors encode θ1 -θ0. The black line is an example track of the featuresfor fixed θ0 . Note that θ0 and θ0 + π lead to almost the same encoding.
Figure 4: Visualization of the three features with largest variance of μ(xt+ι, xt). (a) - (c): Recon-struction of features with Z chosen along the direction of the eigenvectors with largest variance usingthe VAE-Z trained on the stationary dataset. (d): Histograms of reconstruction errors of the the mod-els trained on the stationary dataset. The non-stationary results are similar. (e) - (h): Histogram andscatter-plot of the two features with largest variance in the VAE-Z-model trained on both datasets.
Figure 5: Visualization of the 2D latent space of z learned by different architectures on MNIST. Shown are models where the decoder has either an FFNet orregistration architecture and the encoder either models z or z. Models are trained with transformed pairs (xt, xt+ι) with relative rotations with an angle in either[—45,45] (top row) or [—180,180] (bottom rows) degrees. Reconstructions are sampled on a z ∈ [—1.5,1.5] × [—2, 2] grid and the reconstruction of the originalimage is in the center. The Overlayed scatter-plot represents the mean z-values computed by N(X叶I)Xl) for different transformed versions of xt+ι. Colors/markertype symbolize different relative scalings: orange-squares=85%, blue-circle= 100% and green-crosses=115%. Each color has 30 points with angles between themin-and max trained angle range. Note that in d), only a fraction of points are visible.
