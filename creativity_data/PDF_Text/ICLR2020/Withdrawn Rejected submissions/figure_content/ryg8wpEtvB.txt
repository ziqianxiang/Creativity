Figure 1: Regression with random uncertainty (independent of actual uncertainty) almost perfectlycalibrated by the method proposed in (Kuleshov et al., 2018), when the expected and observedconfidence level are identical. As anything can be perfectly calibrated, this calibration definitionbecomes uninformative. The task is object bounding box regression, using the KITTI dataset (Geigeret al., 2012). See details in Section 4.2.
Figure 2:	Reliability diagrams for the synthetic regression problem with random uncertaintyestimation. Reliability diagram using our method before (a) and after (b) calibration. (c) Before andafter calibration based on the confidence intervals method (Kuleshov et al., 2018).
Figure 3:	Synthetic regression problem with predicted uncertainty. (a) ground truth vs. predictedstandard deviation. (b) Reliability diagram before and after calibration. (c) Reliability diagram usingconfidence intervals (Kuleshov et al., 2018) before and after calibration.
Figure 4:	Reliability diagrams for bounding box regression on the KITTI validation set beforeand after calibration. Each plot compares the empirical RMSE and the root mean variance(mV AR) in each bin. Grey dashed line indicates the ideal calibration line. See Sec. 4.2 for details.
