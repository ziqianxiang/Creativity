Figure 1: In (a) we see a dH -continuous loop in FH≤4 where ‘x’ marks the center-of-mass. Though the point cloud continuously changes from a 4-point set to a 2-pointset, the center of mass discontinuously changes at the moment of convergence. In (b)we see the triangle formed by Cp, Cq and F ({p, q}) in Lemma 4.3 and how the ballof radius less than kCp - Cqk /4 ensures the predicted error for |||F - Cent|||.
Figure 2: In (a) we see the training curve for the PointNet model learning the center-of-mass of random 10-element point clouds. In (b) we see that we are always able tofind adversarial examples to this task producing errors at least as large as the theoret-ical gaurantee.
