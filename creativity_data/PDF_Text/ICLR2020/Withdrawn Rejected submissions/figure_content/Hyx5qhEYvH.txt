Figure 2: The gradient of Ft (red line refers to points that have gradient): (a) since Ft is retrievedfrom a common step function, its gradient only exists in one point which leads to rather harshconditions in updating learnable weights before it. (b) we use a novel gradient broading tactic tosolve this problem with a hyperparameter a.

Figure 4: Model architecture for text summarization. The encoder on the left side has 2 blocks of LNand Bi-LSTM, the decoder on the bottom right, Uni-LIF-LSTM interspersed throughout LN. Com-mon strategies like teacher-forcing, multi-head attention and the introduction of prior distributionhave been taken to improve the performance as well as setting topK of beam search to 10.
