Figure 1: On the left are 6 of the configurations produced by the vectorized simulation function. Onthe right is the time-per-simulation using the Vmap functionality of JAX.
Figure 2: Left panel shows the agreement between predicted energies and the correct energies of thebubble rafts in the test set. Right panel shows the distribution of the inner product between the correctforce and the predicted force.
Figure 3: Panel a shows the average energy and the standard deviation of the energy at D. Panel bshows the derivative we calculate by differentiating through energy optimization by gradient descentas a function of D.
Figure 4: On the left is the average energy plotted against time for a glasses cooled at different rates.
Figure 5: An experiment of a bubble raft compared With the results of a simulation.
