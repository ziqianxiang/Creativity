Figure 1: (a) Not all pairs of q and x are equally important: for x, it is more important to accuratelyquantize the inner product of hq1, xi than hq2, xi or hq3, xi, because hq1, xi has a higher inner productand thus is more likely to be the maximum; (b) Quantization error of x given one of its quantizer c2can be decomposed to a parallel component rk and an orthogonal component r⊥. Notice that c3 incurmore parallel loss (rk ), while c2 incur more orthogonal loss (r⊥). (c) Graphical illustration of theintuition behind Equation (7). Even if c3 is closer to x in terms of Euclidean distance, c2 is a betterquantizer than c3 in terms of inner product approximation error of hq1, x - ci.
Figure 2: (a) λ(T = 0.2, b = 1) in Theorem 3.2 computed analytically as function of d usingrecursion of (13), quickly approaches its limit. Therefore we use its limit for computing λ in ourexperiments. (b) The retrieval Recall1@10 for different T when b = 1. (c) The relative error of innerproduct estimation for true Top-1 on Glove1.2M dataset, across multiple number of bits settings.
Figure 3: (a) Recall 1@N curve on Glove1.2M comparing with variants of QUIPS Guo et al.
