Figure 1: Overview Approach of InvocMap1.	Designing a strategy for classifying Method Invocation by levels of abstraction, from veryabstract to details level.
Figure 2: Representations of AST_LeVel3Definition 5 Local Context of a method invocation is the information about types of local entitiesand suggested terms. Local entities are local variables, local method invocations and literals insidethe MI. The suggested terms are the words that appeared inside the MI.â€˜Along with 4 levels of abstraction in MI, we have the definition of local context provided for eachMI. An example of 4 levels is shown in Figure 2(a). In this code snippet, we have level 1 asmethod name println. The level 2 of abstraction brings us information about type, which isjava.io.PrintStream.println.The level 4 is the final source code which is compile-able.
