Figure 1: Input representation. With the decision point shown in the example, South will markthe following bits in the bidding history encoding: 18 in "Own" segment, 1 帛 and 2帛 in "Partner”segment, 14 in "Left Opp" segment, and 1 4 in "Double Indicator" segment.
Figure 2: Network Architecture. Supervision from partner’s hand is unused in the main results, andused in the ablation studies. BCELoss stands for Binary Cross Entropy Loss.
Figure 3: Training curves for different update frequency. From left to right, the opponent model isupdated every 1, 50, 100, 200 minibatches. Epoch is defined as 200 minibatches.

Figure 6: Bidding examples. D marks the dealer, and red seats indicate vulnerable side.
Figure 7: (a) A bidding example. North-South prevail and will declare the contract 4⅛. Duringthe bidding, assuming natural bidding system, the bid 1⅛, 2*, 4* and 4⅛ are natural bids, whichshows lengths in the nominated suit. The bid 3* is an artificial bid, which shows a good hand with ⅛support for partner, and shows nothing about the * suit. To make the contract, North-South needs totake 10 tricks during the playing phase. (b) A playing example. Currently shown is the 2nd round ofthe playing phase. The dummy’s card is visible to all players, and controlled by his partner, declarer.
