Figure 1: Overview of the adversarial grammar model. The initial non-terminal is produced by anencoder based on some observations. The grammar then generates multiple possible sequences fromthe non-terminal. The generated and real sequences are used to train the discriminator.
Figure 2: Example video and activity sequence from Charades. At various times, we show multiplefutures predicted by the grammar, some matching the true sequence and others very different.
