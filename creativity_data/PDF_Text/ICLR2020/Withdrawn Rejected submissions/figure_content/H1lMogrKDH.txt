Figure 1:  The steady state approximation of a biological neuron i with excitatory valence.  Theneuron has its voltage Vi determined as in Equation 1 by the firing probabilities pj of the contingentneuron, each of which has an influence gated by the conductance Gij of the synapse ij and the firingprobability pj. This influence is either inhibitory (negative) or excitatory (positive) depending on theinherent, fixed state of the contingent neuron. There is also a resting inhibitory bias.
