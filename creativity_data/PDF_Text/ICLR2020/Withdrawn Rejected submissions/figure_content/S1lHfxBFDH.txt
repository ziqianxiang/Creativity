Figure 1: Comparison of the ‘full sharing’ and ‘no sharing’ patterns for the case of unrelated tasks(left) and almost equal tasks (right). The plots show loss over time (averaged over the two tasksand smoothed over a window of 100 steps). We ran each experiment 30 times, and the shaded areacorresponds to the 90% confidence interval.
Figure 2: A general example of a routing model. The input is passed through two components in thefirst layer, and one component in the second layer.
Figure 3: An example routing network with two tasks. Some components are used by both tasks(purple), some by only one of the tasks (red or blue, respectively), and one identity component iscompletely unused (white). Below each layer we show the corresponding routing matrix.
Figure 4: Multi-task model architecture for the experiment on the synthetic data. We denote fullyconnected layers by FC, and name the two pairs of tasks A1, A2 and B1, B2, respectively.
Figure 5: Comparison of the ‘no sharing’ pattern with the learned Gumbel-Matrix routing on thesynthetic data experiment. The plot shows loss over time (averaged over the four tasks and smoothedover a window of 100 steps). We ran each experiment 20 times, and the shaded area corresponds tothe 90% confidence interval.
Figure 6: MNIST multi-task network.
Figure 7: Omniglot multi-task network.
Figure 8: Components inside a routed layer in the Omniglot multi-task network. We denote Group-Norm by GN, and the layer stride as s. Note that for this specific architecture we have s ∈ {1, 2}.
Figure 9: Connection probabilities over time (for one run, and one task). Each plot above shows theconnection probabilities for all components of a certain routed layer in the network.
