Figure 1: Illustration of prior architectures (1a and 1b) and the newly proposed architectures (1c and1d). ψi denote feature representations of the input data and h indicate hidden states. gi are gatesthat are responsible for handling redundancy and synergy effects in the DCR architecture. Eacharrow models a (potentially non-linear) function. The + sign indicates addition of latent utilities andthe ㊉ sign indicates addition of vectors. V and Ui indicate the predicted set utility and predictedlatent utilities, respectively.
