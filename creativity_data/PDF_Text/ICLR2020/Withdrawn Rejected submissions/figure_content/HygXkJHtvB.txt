Figure 1: Distributions of the number of parameter update steps (left) and the difference in test error(right) between the Jeffreys prior parametrization and the minimum test error from 935 individualtraining procedures (Kernel Density Estimate shown in red on the left).
Figure 2: Impact of the addition of noise on 3 of the 5 Principal Curvatures of the Loss Landscape.
Figure 3: The Jeffreys prior parametrization is found in the area of parameter space minimizing testerror and maximizing entropy on the principal sub-manifold.
