Figure 1: (a) Given assembly code of an executable, (b) we reconstruct calls to external APIs anddeduce their argument kinds; (c) these external calls are placed in the reconstructed Control-FlowGraph which approximates their runtime call order; (d) our model learns all potential runtime callorders; and (e) the decoder generates the target name while attending to all potential call orders.
Figure 2:	Typical call instructions for starting aserver in order of appearance in the binary code.
Figure 3:	Typical call instructions for starting aserver, in their correct call order, automaticallyfiltered from error handling calls. This order andfiltering could be obtained only by analyzing callpaths the Control-Flow Graph.
