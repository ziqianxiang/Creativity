Figure 2: A cover with 7 elements, and the cor-responding nerve (left column). The cyan andgreen vertices are connected by a single edge.

Figure 4: Pareto frontier between length and sta-bility of path.
Figure 6: Persistence diagrams for the Vietrois-Rips filtration and the approximate Steinhaus filtra-tion of a set of uniformly sampled points in the plane.
Figure 7: Pareto frontier of stable paths betweenMulan and Moulin Rouge.
Figure 8: Constructed Mapper from logistic regression model of Fashion-MNIST data set. Thewindow marks the frame of Figure 917Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2020This application is based on the work of using paths in the Mapper to provide explanations forsupervised machine learning models (Saul & Arendt, 2018). We build a Mapper from the predictedprobability space of a logistic regression model. We then extend the constructed Mapper to be aSteinhaus Mapper Filtration and proceed to analyze the stable paths in that object.
Figure 9: Depiction of stable paths found along Pareto frontier in Figure 10.
Figure 10: Pareto frontier of stable paths between predominatelysneaker vertex and predominately ankle boot vertex.
Figure 11: Path visualizations for shortest path (left) and stable path with length 12 (right). Columnsin the visualization are based on the class and each row represents a node in the Mapper. Weshow one representative for each node in each column. Columns with no shoes shown had norepresentative of that class in the node.
