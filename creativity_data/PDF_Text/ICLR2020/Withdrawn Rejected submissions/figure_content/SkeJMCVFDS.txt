Figure 1: Sinusoidal functions discretization by time positionsT E(time,2i) = sin(time/maxtime2i/dT E)	(3)T E(time,2i+1) = cos(time/maxtime2i/dT E)	(4)To do it we redefine the equations based on irregular timestamps. Instead of a position indicatorthere is a time variable, which is continuous. The dimension of TEs (dTE) can parameterized and amaxtime defines a maximum time that can be represented.
Figure 2: a) Additive model b) Concatenated modelTo have also a baseline of non-recurrent models and assess the TE effect on them, we tested afour layer MLP and Linear/Logistic regression (linear for length of stay and logistic for in-hospitalmortality task).
Figure 3: Evaluation of models at in-hospital mortality with observed data from 10% to 100%4.3	ResultsResults for in-hospital mortality shows that self-attention seems to deteriorate the vanilla LSTMperformance, but when added the TEs it got improved sufficiently to surpass it and achieve our betteraverage result.
Figure 4: Evaluation of models at length of stay with observed data from 10% to 100%6	Future WorkWe see a promising future for the method proposed. We expect to extend it to improve other types ofirregular time-continuous data and also evaluate how can TE improve recent models proposed forirregularly time series, like the GRU-D (Che et al., 2018), interpolation networks (Shukla & Marlin,2018) and Temporal-Clustering Regularization (Bahadori & Lipton, 2019). The code for TEs resultsreported will be publicly available in the future.
