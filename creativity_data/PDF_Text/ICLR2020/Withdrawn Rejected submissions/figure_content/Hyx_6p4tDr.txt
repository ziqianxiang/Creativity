Figure 1: Performance of our RPBinary and RPGaUssian model, versus dimension / rank, on datasets50Salads and GTEA. In each plot, x-axis is the multiplier on the number of matrix rows N, y-axisis the respective performance measure, and colors denote different ranks.
Figure 2: A combination of MS-TCN Farha & Gall (2019) and our bilinear pooling method, inwhich the blue layers are proposed by Us and the orange layers are proposed by MS-TCn.
