Figure 1: Neural-Linear contextual Thompson sampling with limited memory.
Figure 2: Catastrophic forgettingWe use the Shuttle Statlog data set(Newman et al., 2008), a real world,nonlinear data set. Each context iscomposed of 9 features of a spaceshuttle flight, and the goal is to predictthe state of the radiator of the shuttle(the reward). There are k = 7 pos-sible actions, and if the agent selectsthe right action, then reward 1 is gen-erated. Otherwise, the agent obtainsno reward (r = 0).
Figure 3: Cumulative reward on Amazon review’slinear TS and both prior computations with an -greedy baseline. We experimented with 10 valuesof , ∈ [0.1, 0.2, ..., 1] and report the results for the value that performed the best (0.1). Looking atFig. 3 we can see that the limited memory version performs almost as good as the full memory, andbetter than the -greedy baseline.
