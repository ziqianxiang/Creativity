Figure 1: Images generated by our GAN from latent representations of an input image (test images)based on different β value on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, the first column is the original image.
Figure 2: Examples of input-output pairs of images. The left image is an image from the test dataset.
Figure 3: The comparison between reconstruction images of VAE and LSR-GAN on test dataset.
Figure 4: Examples of input-output pairs of images for different β values for a β-VAE. The firstrow is from the test dataset. The second and third rows are Others reconstruction generated byLSR-GAN for VAEs trained with different β values.
Figure 5: Performance of the VAE (blue points) and LSR-GAN (red points) versus β. In (a) we showthe means squared error, while in (b) we show the classification performance using a classifier takingthe reconstructed images. The images are taken from CIFAR-10. Error bars show ±1 standard error.
Figure 6: Graphs showing the classification performance of images generated by our GAN withdifferent λ values (on test dataset). The left-bottom graph shows the mean square error betweenreconstruction images and imagination images. The right-bottom graph shows the variance betweenimages generated by our GAN from latent representations of an input image. The x-axis is the logvalue of different λ, the errors are too small which make error bars look like lines.
