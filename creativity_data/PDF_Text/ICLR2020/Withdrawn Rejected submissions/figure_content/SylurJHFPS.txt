Figure 1: The illustration of two measures. In (a), the yellow area denotes the negative and the greenone denotes the positive. In (b), the half of the shadow area equals to the result of equation 11.
Figure 2: The results of pre-train SeqGAN’ generator 80 epochs on EMNLP dataset. All the palelines denote batch instances’ discrepancy and the curve is the exponential moving average on thissampled batch for each epoch.
Figure 3: The compare of discrepancy between pre-train and the generator is updated with thefeedback signals from DDφ which is obtained from pre-train. The vertical dash line represents theend of pre-training. SeqGAN’s generator is pre-trained 80 epochs and the dataset is COCO.
Figure 4: A third party discriminator evaluates two GANs’ performance variety on COCO.
Figure 5: The results of pre-train SeqGAN’ generator 80 epochs on COCO dataset (upper), RelGANon EMNLP (middle) and RelGAN on COCO(below). All the pale lines denote batch instances,discrepancy and the curve is the exponential moving average on this sampled batch for each epoch.
Figure 6: The compare of discrepancy between pre-train and the generator is updated with thefeedback signals from DDφ which is obtained from pre-train. The vertical dash line represents theend of pre-training. SeqGAN’ generator is pre-trained 80 epochs and the dataset is EMNLP.
