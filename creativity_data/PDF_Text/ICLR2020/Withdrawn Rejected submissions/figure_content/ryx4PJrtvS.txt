Figure 1: Results using only error information, with the current optimum plotted against the numberof used evaluations.
Figure 2: Two example tasks using both error and time information, with the current optimumplotted against time.
Figure 3: CDF of error metrics for the three tasks. Every line represent one dataset. The metrics arescaled first by min-max scaling and the x-axis is log scaled.
