Figure 1: Adjacency matrices for the largest connected component (LCC) of cora (left), citeseer(middle), and pubmed (right). The LCCs contain the majority of the graph, so deleting other nodesdoes not affect the overall arrow pattern. For simplicity, we treat them as undirected graphs here.
Figure 2: (a) An example of non-chordal graph. The edge {d, e} is a chord in the path (a, e, c, d).
Figure 3: Left. The (symmetric) adjacency matrix of the graph G shown in Figure 2c. (For simplicitywe only show the lower triangular part.) A bullet in the (i, j)th entry means nodes i and j areadjacent. The dashed lines separate the supernodes (clique residuals) in the clique tree. Right. Thecorresponding postordered clique tree Tc. Every node in Tc is a clique in G, and the red index i inevery clique indicates the clique representative. The dashed box shows an example clique.
Figure 4: Validation accuracy of Chordal-GCN on the datasets: cora, citeseer, and pubmed. Theblue curve shoWs the validation accuracy With the consistent loss Lhconsi While the red curve shoWsthat Without Lhconsi.
Figure 5: Memory (left) and time (right) versus number of GCN layers. Both curves scale linearly,which is promising and consistent with theoretical analysis.
