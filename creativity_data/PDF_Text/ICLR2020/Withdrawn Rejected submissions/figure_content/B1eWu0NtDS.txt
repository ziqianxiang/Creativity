Figure 2: Comparison to magnitude pruningWe would like to emphasize that the magnitude approaches may be more appropriate for the unstruc-tured pruning where single weights are removed based on its magnitude. However, in the the caseof pruning entire channels, considering a norm of weights may be too simplistic as the interactionsbetween the weights within a channel are rather complex. The proposed new paradigm treats thechannels as whole units that directly contribute to the task generalization.
