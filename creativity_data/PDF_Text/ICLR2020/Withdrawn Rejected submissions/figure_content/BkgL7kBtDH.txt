Figure 1: Left: Nearest neighbours in a function-specific space trained for the SVO structure. In theJoint SVO space (bottom) we show nearest neighbors for verbs (V) from the two other subspaces (Oand S). Right: Illustration of three neighbourhoods in a function-specific space trained for the SVOstructure. The space is structured by group (i.e. S, V, and O) and optimised such that vectors forplausible SVO compositions will be close. Note that one word can have several vectors, for examplechicken can occur as subject or object (e.g., it can eat something or someone/something can eat it).
Figure 2: The directionality of prediction in neural models is important. Representations can be ofvarying quality depending on whether they are induced at the input or output side of the model. Ourmultidirectional approach resolves this problem by training on shared representations in all directions.
