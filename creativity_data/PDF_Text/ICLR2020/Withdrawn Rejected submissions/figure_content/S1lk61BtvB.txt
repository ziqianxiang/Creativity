Figure 1: Overview of our BMS-VAE-GAN framework. The terms of our novel objective (7) arehighlighted at the right. We consider only the best sample from the generator Gθ while computingthe reconstruction loss.
Figure 2: CelebA Random Samples. Our “Best of Many” reconstruction cost leads to sharper results.
