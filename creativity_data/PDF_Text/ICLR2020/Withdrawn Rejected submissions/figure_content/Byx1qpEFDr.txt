Figure 2: Firing graphGraph PolynomialsAs for bits of the measure grid and factors, a vertex v (I, l0) of a firing graph is assiociatedwith the set of polynomes {PI,l}l∈{l0,...,|I| }. Each polynome is a segment of its characteristicpolynome Pv that describes activation, at instant t, of v, given its input domain’s activations atinstant t - 1. If we denote by n, I and l0 respectively the size of the input domain of v, the setof vertex that has a link toward v and the level of v, thenPv,l : F (2)n → F (2)Pv,l [x] =π∈S(I,l) xπ10,xπ2xπl, if l ∈ {l0,...,|I|}otherwisePv : F (2)n → F (2)|I|Pv [x] = X Pv,l [x]l=l0Where S(I, l) is the set of all permutations of size l of elements of I and x ∈ F2 ({I}, Dv), whereDv is the input domain of v . Furthermore, all operators on polynome defined previously is
Figure 3: Single sampled firing graphIn figure ??, sampled bits {b1, . . . , bns} are used as vertices of the layer 0 of a firing graph G,nS = |S|. Then vertex v({b1 , . . . , bns }, 1) is added at the layer 1 of G. Furthermore, we setGmask so to allow only layer 0’s outcoming edges to be updated through draining.
Figure 4: Joint sampled firing graphIn figure ??, sampled bits {bι,…，bns} and pre-selected bits {b；,...,bk} for some k ∈ N* Com-pound the layer 0 of the firing graph G, nS = |S|. Then, vertices v({b1, . . . , bns }, 1) and13u({b1 , . . . , bk}, k) are added at layer 1 of G and vertex w({u, v}, 2) at layer 2 of G. Finally,we set Gmask so that only b1 , . . . , bns ’s outcoming edges are allowed to be updated throughdraining.
Figure 5: Draining diagramWe use ni , nc and no to refer to the number of respectively input, core and output vertices.
Figure 7: Observation of the score process in a joint sampled firing graph with T = 500 and(p, q) = (7, 1)25In this case, we obtain N = 7 and ω5 ' 0.062 when following the procedure described in previoussection. As for the first experiment, blue lines show the weight of edges outcoming from sampledbit b ∈ G(f) and red lines correspond to the weight of edges outcoming from sampled bit b ∈/ G(f).
Figure 8: Observation of the score process in a single sampled firing graph with T = 1000 and(p, q) = (1, 1)We clearly see a rapid differentiation of score processus according to their purity rank. We canalso observe that, at the end of draining, the higher the purity coefficient is, the closer are weights28of corresponding edges. Finally, the behaviour of score processus validates the efficiency of thedraining algorithm to rank bits of the measure grids blindly, in an attempt to identify latentfactors. The second experiment with the sparse measure grid model aims to give intuition onthe choice of δ used for draining a joint sampled firing graph. As for the previous simulation, wegenerate n = 1000, bits with K = 10 latent factors that activate with probability pf = 0.3 andwe link measure grid’s bits independently with probability pg = 0.3. Then we choose randomlyi = 5 bits, denoted by I = {bj,..., b*}, with purity rank 4 with respect to the target factorf . Finally we sampled and built the joint sampled firing graph using pS = 1 and the set ofpre-selected bits I. The procedure described in the previous section to choose the target puritycoefficient consists in estimating the purity coefficient ωI,∣I∣,f and to set δ so that ω = ωI,∣I∣,f - δ.
Figure 9: Observation of sampled bit’s score processus in a joint sampled firing graph i = 5,T = 500 and (p, q) = (1, 1)In each simulation, ωI,∣I∣,f has been estimated using 1000 samples and We use T = 500. FUr-thermore, each figure corresponds to a different value of δ that induces different values of ω , setas ω = ω1,∣1 ∣,f — δ. As for the first experiment, the different colored lines in each subfigure showthe weight of edges outcoming from sampled bits with different purity ranks. As expected, we29can see that the higher δ is, the more discriminative the draining procedure is. If δ is set to 0,then every sampled bits will remain connected in the firing graph after draining, which is not ofgreat interest. Yet, if δ is set too high we may end with two connexe components, which is notdesirable neither. Thus, the experiment confirms the difficulties that we may face choosing theright value for δ .
