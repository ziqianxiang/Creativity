Figure 1: Validation lossFigure 2: Validation character error rateextractor well-trained and learn more about the data pattern, it makes the classifier further overfitthe feature extractor. Furthermore, compared to the baseline, some rounds of retraining take moreepochs to reach the lowest validation loss, confirming that the small partial derivatives of the bottomlayers may make the training slow but cannot prevent the feature extractor from being well-trained.
