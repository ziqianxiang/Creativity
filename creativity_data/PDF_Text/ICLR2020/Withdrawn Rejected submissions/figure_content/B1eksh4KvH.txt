Figure 1: Different training strategies for modulating negative cosine similarities of hard samples (i.e., themis-classified sample) in ArcFace, SV-Arc-Softmax and our CurricularFace. Left: The modulation coefficientsI (t, cos θj ) for negative cosine similarities of hard samples in different methods, where t is an adaptivelyestimated parameter and θj denotes the angle between the hard sample and the non-ground truth j-class center.
Figure 2: Illustrations on the adaptive pa-rameter t (red line) and gradient modulationcoefficients M(∙) = 2 cos θj + t of hard Sam-ples (green area). Since the number of minedhard samples reduces with the model training,the green area M(∙) is relatively smooth in earlystage and there are some burrs in later stage.
Figure 3: Illustrations on (ratio between ourloss and ArcFace, maximum cosθj ) fromearly (Top) to later (Bottom) training stages.
Figure 4: From left to right, decision boundaries of ArcFace,SV-Arc-Softmax, and ours. Blue line, red line, green line andpurple line denote the decision boundary of Softmax, ArcFace,SV-Arc-Softmax, and ours, respectively. m denotes the angularmargin added by ArcFace. d denotes the additional margin of SV-Arc-Softmax and ours. In SV-Arc-Softmax, d = (t - 1) cos θj +t - 1. In ours, d = (t + cos θj - 1) cos θj.
