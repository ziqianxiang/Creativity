Figure 1:	Insensitive (green shaded) and sensitive (white) regions of sigmoid (left) and tanh (right)nonlinear functions.
Figure 2:	Dynamic region distribution across timesteps and inputs. The white and black colorsdenote neurons in the insensitive and sensitive regions, respectively. The left and right patterns arefrom different inputs.
Figure 3: Output activation distribution of sigmoid and tanh gates as in LSTM.
Figure 4: Comparison of memory access data and operations between baseline layers and the littlemodule of dual-module enhanced layers. L750 indicates single-layer LSTM with 750 hidden units;G is short for GRU; L1024r indicates LSTM with residual input.
