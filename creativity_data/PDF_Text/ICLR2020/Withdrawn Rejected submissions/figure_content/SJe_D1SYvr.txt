Figure 1: Illustration of the transition kernel in an eMDP. (a) two players are playing the gameof Pong. We wish to imitate the left (blue) one at the presence of the right (red) expert. The state issplit into two components: (b) Responsive components that we can simulate, and (c) Unresponsivecomponents that we do not know how to simulate. (d) the eMDP model produces the next state byupdating each component separately and then stitching them together. The unresponsive elements(gray) are extracted as is from the consecutive state in the demonstration, while the responsiveelement (blue player) is updated according to an external command. Notice that the original expertis faintly visible next to the blue agent for visualisation purposes.
Figure 2: Performance Comparison: results on 7 games. The x-axis represent the number of gameframes and the y-axis Numbers represent the cumulative return from the eMDP model.
