Figure 1: Model description. Graphs of different sizes are passed through GCN layers. The outputsize of each GCN layer is proportional to the number of nodes in the current graph. The last layeris a QGCN which gets as input which is proportional to the graph number of nodes and outputs aconstant size output. Note that the weights of the QGCN are of fixed dimensions and as such can belearned on all graphs simultaneously.
Figure 2: Test and train accuracy. We ran 40 experiments, applying the Q-GCN on the Mutagenicitydataset. The x-axis shows the test accuracy, the y-axis shows the train accuracy and each dotrepresents a single experiment.
Figure 3: Model comparison. We compared the 4 possible models on the Mutagenicity dataset.
