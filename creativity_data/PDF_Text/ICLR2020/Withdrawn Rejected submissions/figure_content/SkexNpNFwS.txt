Figure 1: Schematic of generator without and withL2 optimal transport regularity.
Figure 2: Comparison of different methods: vanilla generator with L2 transport cost penalty, discretepotential flow generator (D-PFG), continuous potential flow generator (C-PFG), and CycleGAN inproblem 1 (left) and 2 (right). The red and blue arrows represent the map of generators, the blackarrows represent the analytical optimal transport map.
Figure 3: Potential flow generator in (a) WGAN-GP and (b) continuous normalizing flow for differentproblems. Each column shows the setup and results of one problem. The top row shows the samplesor the unnormalized density functions of Î¼ (purple) and V (orange), the bottom row shows the mapestimated by potential flow generator G and samples of G#m.
Figure 4: Potential flow generator on the MNIST.
Figure 5: Comparison between our method, vanilla WGAN-GP, CycleGAN with WGAN-GP asGAN loss and L1 or L2 loss as cycle-consistency loss, as well as official CycleGAN. The first tworows are the original images and their projections on the 700-dimensional Euclidean space inducedby PCA, which are similar. The next five rows are the corresponding outputs. The last three rows arethe reconstructed images from different CycleGANs.
Figure 6: Potential flow generator on the MNIST (a) training and (b) testing dataset. In each raw, thetop images are reconstructed from the input vectors, while the bottom images are reconstructed fromthe corresponding output vectors.
Figure 7: Potential flow generator on the CelebA (a) training and (b) testing dataset. In each raw, thetop images are reconstructed from the input vectors, while the bottom images are reconstructed fromthe corresponding output vectors.
