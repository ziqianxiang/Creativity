Figure 1: Method Overview. our proposed framework is based on (a) Subjective Bayesian GNN designedfor estimating the different types of uncertainties including (e) vacuity, dissonance, aleatoric, and epistemicuncertainties for the applications in graph data. The loss function includes (d) square error to reduce bias and (b)(c) two KL components to reduce error in predicting uncertainty.
Figure 2: PR curves for Node Classification Prediction: S-BGCN-T-K is used to predict nodeclassification where test nodes are selected based on the low extent of uncertainty. The PR curves ofall compared models can be found in the Appendix.
