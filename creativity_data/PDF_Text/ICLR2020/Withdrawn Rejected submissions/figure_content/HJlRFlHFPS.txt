Figure 1:	Two groups of structurally-equivalent sentences. In each group, the first sentence is origi-nal sentence from Wikipedia, and the sentences below it were generated by the process of repeatedBERT substitution. Some sets of corresponding Words-that is, words that share the same structuralfunction-are highlighted in the same color.
Figure 2:	An illustration of triplet-loss calculation. Pairs of words are represented by the differencebetween their transformation f, which is identical for all words. The pairs of words in the anchor andpositive sentences are lexically different, but structurally similar. The negative example presentedhere is especially challenging, as it is lexically similar, but structurally different.

Figure 4: Results of the few shot parsing setupNumber of training examplestion to create a large number of sentences which are structurally similar, but semantically different.
