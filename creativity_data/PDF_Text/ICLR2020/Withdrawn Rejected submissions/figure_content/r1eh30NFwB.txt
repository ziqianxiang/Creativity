Figure 1: Overview of our proposed method, which combines a simple VAE with a normalizing flowmodel in the pixel space. The model training is split into two phases, please refer to Section 3.4 formore details.
Figure 2: Samples from models trained on CIFAR-10.
Figure 3: Samples from models trained on CelebA.
Figure 4: Example of how the Glow layer modifies VAE samples. Left column: samples from theunderlying VAE. Right columns: decoder samples after being passed through the Glow layer.
Figure 5: Interpolation between randomly sampled points in the VAE latent space, demonstratingthat our model learns a useful compact representation.
