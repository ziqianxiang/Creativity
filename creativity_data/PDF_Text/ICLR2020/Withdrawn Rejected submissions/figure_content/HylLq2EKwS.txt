Figure 1: Illustration of our proposed CF-SFLframework for collaborative filtering.
Figure 2: Unrolling the recurrent CF-SFL framework into an iterative learning process with multipletime steps T.
Figure 3:	Performance (NDCG@100) boosting on the validation sets.
Figure 4:	The blue curve summarizes NDCG@100 and red curves report the computational cost for modelinference in each epoch. In each sub-figure, we vary the time steps from 0 to 12 (T=0 is the base recommender).
Figure 5: An example of the our fused function working scheme. The user behavior xi and the recommendeditems ai share the same lookup table B. [-0.04, 0.08] is the fused input for the given example. This methodworks efficient if xi and ai are sparse.
