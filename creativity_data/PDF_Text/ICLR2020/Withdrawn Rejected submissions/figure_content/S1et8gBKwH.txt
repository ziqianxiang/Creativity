Figure 1: Training procedure for CVAE. Green trapezoids represent the encoding and decodingneural networks that calculate the parameters of the corresponding distributions. Blue rectanglesrepresent the sampling of latent variables according to the corresponding reparameterization tricks.
Figure 2: Results for the experiments trained on the regular angle dataset. Median error with respectto the percentage of labelled data, each experiment is averaged over three runs and the correspondingstandard deviation bars are shown. Each of the four plots corresponds to the results obtained bytraining models based on different amounts of rendered images per object instance.
