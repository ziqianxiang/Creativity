Figure 1: An indiscernible observation toy example: (a) 4 out L dictionary elements di (atoms). (b) Digit“3” and “8” can be represented by combining only two atoms in the dictionary (2-sparse representations). (c)Atoms with their left-halves occluded di. (d) An occluded digit “3” or “8” admits more than one 2-sparserepresentation, for example, they can be expressed as the sum of occluded atoms d1 and d2, or d3 and d4.
Figure 2: Experimental results on synthetic dataset using our “simultaneous” (red thick solid line) comparedto various “sequential” methods. Obtained test accuracy (mean ± s.e.m computed over 10 realizations) asa function of the percentage of missing entries for separation of classes d = 0.0, 0.2 and levels of sparsityK = 4, 32. Statistical significance for the Simul-MS difference is shown (p < 0.05).
Figure 4: Testing accuracy in the grid search for hyper-parameter tuning: λι and λ2 were chosen throughcrossvalidation by maximizing the testing accuracy in all datasets with different levels of missing entries:25%, 50% and 75%.
