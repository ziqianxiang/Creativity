Figure 1: The overall architecture. The feed-forward logic of the Classifier C, the Generator G andthe Discriminator D are marked with different colours.
Figure 2: Samples generated by the proposed models trained on the MNIST (top panels), Fashion-MNIST (middle panels) and CIFAR-10 (bottom panels) datasets. In the left panels, the Gaussianmixture contains K = 10 Gaussians, and each row contains images sampled from a different Gaus-sian. In the right panels, each row shows the linear interpolation result from one Gaussian to another.
Figure 3: Linear interpolation over 3 Gaussians on the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and Oxford-102dataset. Each row and each column contains linear interpolation performed between 2 Gaussians.
Figure 4: Inception score and FID score over training epochs.
