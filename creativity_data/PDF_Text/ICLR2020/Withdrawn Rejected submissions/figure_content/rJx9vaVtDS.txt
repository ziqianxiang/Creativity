Figure 1: Comparison of DRGAN and GANITE highlighting the key difference between the two dif-ferent problems they address (dose-response estimation vs. standard treatment-response estimation).
Figure 2: Overview of our model for the setting with two treatments (Wf corresponds to the factualtreatment and wcf to the counterfactual treatment). The generator is used to generate an output foreach dosage level in each DDW, these outcomes together with the factual outcome, yf, are used tocreate the set of dosage-outcome pairs, y, which is passed directly to the treatment discriminator.
