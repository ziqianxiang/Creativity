Figure 2: Experiments on training DCNNs and other structured neural networks on CIFAR-10.
Figure 3: Comparison of DCNNs and ACDC netWorks on tWo different tasks. Figure 3(a) shoWsthe evolution of the training loss on a regression task With synthetic data. Figure 3(b) shoWs the testaccuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
Figure 4: Figure 4(a): network siZe vs. accuracy comPared on Dense networks, DCNNs (ouraPProach), DTNNs (our aPProach), neural networks based on ToePlitZ matrices and neural net-works based on Low Rank-based matrices. DCNNs outPerforms alternatives structured aPProaches.
Figure 5: This figure shows the state-of-the-art neural network architecture, initially proposed byAbu-El-Haija et al. (2016b) and later improved by Miech et al. (2017), used in our experiment.
