Figure 1: Joint Parameterizations for cost-augmented inference network Fφ and test-time inferencenetwork Aψ .
Figure 2: Training trajectories with different numbers of I steps. The three curves in each settingcorrespond to different random seeds. (a) cost-augmented loss after I steps; (b) margin-rescaledloss after I steps; (c) gradient norm of energy function after E steps; (d) gradient norm of test-timeinference network after I steps. Tu & Gimpel (2018) use one I step after each E step.
Figure 3: Training trajectories with different settings. The three curves for each setting correspond todifferent random seeds. Tu & Gimpel (2018) use truncation and CE during training.
