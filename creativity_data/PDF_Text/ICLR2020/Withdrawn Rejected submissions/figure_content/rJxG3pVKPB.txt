Figure 1: Overall architecture of our method, wave2wave, consisting RNN encoder and decoder withcontext vector and sliding window representation. Input and output time-series data are toy exampleswhere the input is generated by combining sine waves with random magnitudes and periods. Theoutput is the version of the input flipped horizontally.
