Figure 1: CNN-Cert certified accuracy against perturbation size for models trained normally and withseveral robust training methods including Bounded, IBP and our method, Double Margin. Results areshown for different values of train . (a) shows results on MNIST and (b) on CIFAR. Refer to Table 2for additional baselines including MMR and TRADES.
Figure 2: A visual illustration of Double Margin’s sensitivity quantification. s is propagated as s =2 |W| (σ(Z + S) — σ(Z — s)). V is propagated as V = 2 |W| (σ(Z + V) — σ(Z — v)) + 1 ∣W∣∣σ(z +S + v) + σ (Z — s — v) — 2σ (z)|.
Figure 3: Visualizing the bounds on the ReLU function of different certification methods. Bounds areillustrated for unstable ReLUs where the input bounds l, u satisfy l < 0 and u > 0. Bounds for twocases are illustrated: 1) -l > u and 2) -l < u. The linear upper bounds of the ReLU function areshown in blue, and the lower bounds shown in orange.
