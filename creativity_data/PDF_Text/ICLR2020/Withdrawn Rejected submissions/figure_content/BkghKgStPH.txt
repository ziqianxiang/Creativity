Figure 1: The illustration presents the training regime used for continuous learning over two phaseswith the SHDL framework composed of the handcrafted frontend, unsupervised midsection, andsupervised backend. In phase-0, the network learns an initial set of 15 classes (green connections).
Figure 2: The illustration presents plots for new knowledge and retention for both near and farexperiments. The new knowledge plots show the rapid learning of new classes during the secondphase as compared to the baseline. The retention plots for the classes learned during the first phaseshows retention with only transient interference. Orange curve denoted the phase-1 plots while theblue curve represents the phase-0 plots. The dotted black curve represents the sigmoid fit to curvesfor both phases. The x axis of the graphs represents the number of iterations. The performancemeasure at each iteration is obtained by averaging the performance measures over 10 batches of 16items each.
Figure 3: The illustration presents the performance of the proposed SHDL framework against SOTAEWC and ICARL frameworks- Slope gained, Area gained, Performance gained (old (phase-0), new(phase-1)).
