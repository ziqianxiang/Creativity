Figure 1: Per-pixel reconstruction error (MSE) vs. number of measurements. Vertical bars indicate95% confidence intervals. BM3D-AMP frequently fails to converge for fewer than 4000 measure-ments on x-ray images, as denoted by error values far above the vertical axis.
Figure 2: Reconstruction results on x-ray images for m = 2000 measurements (of n = 65536 pixels)and MNIST for m = 75 measurements (of n = 784 pixels). From top to bottom row: originalimage, reconstructions by our algorithm, then reconstructions by baselines BM3D-AMP, TVAL3,and Lasso. For x-ray images the number of measurements obtained are 3% the number of pixels(i.e. mn = .03), for which BM3D-AMP often fails to converge.
Figure 3: Per-pixel reconstruction error (MSE) vs. number of measurements. Vertical bars indi-cate 95% confidence intervals. Unfortunately an RGB version of TVAL3 does not currently exist,although related TV algorithms such as FTVd perform similar denoising tasks (Wang et al., 2008).

Figure 8:	Reconstruction results on x-ray images for m = 4000, 8000 measurements respectively (ofn = 65536 pixels). From top to bottom row: original image, reconstructions by our algorithm, thenreconstructions by baselines BM3D-AMP, TVAL3, and Lasso.
Figure 9: Reconstruction results on retinopathy images for m = 500, 1000 measurements respec-tively (of n = 49152 pixels). From top to bottom row: original image, reconstructions by our algo-rithm, then reconstructions by baselines BM3D-AMP and Lasso.
Figure 10: Reconstruction results on retinopathy images for m = 2000 measurements (of n = 49152pixels). From top to bottom row: original image, reconstructions by our algorithm, then recon-structions by baselines BM3D-AMP and Lasso. In this case the number of measurements is muchsmaller than the number of pixels (roughly 4% ratio), for which BM3D-AMP fails to converge, asdemonstrated by erroneous green and purple pixels. We recommend viewing in color.
