Figure 1: Pre-activation distributions of one layer in ResNet-18. (a) Evolution at different epochs.
Figure 2: Comparison with other methods: EPBC (Cavigelli et al. (2019)) and GF (Gudovskiy et al.
Figure 3: Tradeoff between rate and accuracy for different values of Î» (ranged between 0 and 0.3)in (a) ResNet-18 and (b) MobileNetV2. In ResNet-18 the activations are quantized to 5 bits, inMobileNet we show results for activation quantized to 6 and 8 bits.
