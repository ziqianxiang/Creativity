Figure 1: Explicit representation of visual class measured in the three networks during training, asmeasured by top-5 precision. The corresponding cross-entropy loss is shown in Appendix B, Fig. 5.
Figure 2: Left: Precision for each visual class during training in the most informative layer ofthe network - the top layer for CORnet and AlexNet, and the penultimate layer for DeepCluster.
Figure 3: Relationship between infant age of acquisition and asymptote of machine performance foreach visual class in the most informative layer of each network. The colours show different semanticgroupings.
Figure 4: Top-5 precision as a function of training epochs of the top decoding layer for DeepCluster.
Figure 5:	Cross-entropy loss during training for each of the three networks, illustrating the changein explicit representation of visual classes.
Figure 6:	The unsupervised network, DeepCluster, learned more slowly than the supervised net-works (Fig. 5). To test if the layers with the strongest explicit object representation changed over alonger period of extended learning, we trained the convolutional layers to 70 epochs.
