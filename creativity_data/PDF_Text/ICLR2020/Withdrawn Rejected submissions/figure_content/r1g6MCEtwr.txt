Figure 1:	Significance of depth: The TNR@TPR95 is computed by constructing detectors which make use of allthe gram matrices but consider only one residual or dense block at a time. ResNet32 has 4 residual blocks andDenseNet3 has 3 dense blocks.
Figure 2:	The importance of higher order gram matrices: The TNR@TPR95 is computed by constructingdetectors which make use of only one of the gram matrices but consider all layers.
Figure 3: The Schematic Diagram demonstrating the proposed algorithmTotal deviation (A) is computed by summing across thedeviations of all the layers. However, since the scale ofdeviations of each layer are different, We normalize bydividing it with EP(J ［加］,the expected deviation at layer δj,computed using the Validation Data.
