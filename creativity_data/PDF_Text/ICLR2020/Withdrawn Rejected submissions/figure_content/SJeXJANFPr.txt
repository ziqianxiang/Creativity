Figure 1: Sample images from the modified multiDigitMNIST dataset (Sun, 2019). Only even digitsare assigned to tleft while tright contains odd numbers. The same combination of digits in an imagedoes not appear in multiple dataset splits.
Figure 2: Cosine distribution between taskgradients Î¦(tleft, tright) during training. Reg-ularization methods implicitly orthogonalizetask gradients.
Figure 3: Evaluation of models with differenthyper-parameters and random seeds. The fi-nal validation accuracy is plotted against thestandard deviation of gradient cosines fromthe first training epoch.
Figure 4: Cosine distribution between corre-lated segmentation tasks. Even though thegradients are in a highly dimensional spacethey point in similar directions throughouttraining. CosReg successfully regularizeseven in this circumstance.
Figure 5: Moving standard deviation of cos (tleft, tright) throughout training on MultiDigitMNIST.
