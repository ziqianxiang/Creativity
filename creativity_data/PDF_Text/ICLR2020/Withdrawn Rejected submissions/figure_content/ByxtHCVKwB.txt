Figure 1: New paradigm for combining OR and ML to solve the TSPThe proposed new paradigm for combining OR and ML to solve the TSP is outlined in Fig. 1.
Figure 2: The decision process ofan example actionIn Fig. 2, sub-figure (a) is the starting state Ï€ = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8). To determine an action, weat first decide a city a1 and delete the edge between a1 and its previous city b1. Without loss ofgenerality, suppose a1 = 4, then b1 = 3 and edge (3, 4) is deleted, resulting in a temporary statusshown in sub-figure (b) (for the sake of clarity, drawn as a line which starts from a1 and ends at b1).
Figure 3: Procedure of the Monte Carlo tree search5Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2020Once no improving action is found within the small neighborhood, we close the basic 2-opt localsearch, and switch to an enlarged neighborhood which consists of the actions with k > 2. Thismethod is a generalization of the variable neighborhood search method (Mladenovic & Hansen,1997), which has been successfully applied to many combinatorial optimization problems.
