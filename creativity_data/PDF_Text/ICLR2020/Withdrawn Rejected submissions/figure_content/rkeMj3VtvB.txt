Figure 1: Overview of the proposed model architecture with task adapters. Each parallelogramdenotes a 2-dimensional channel (time and frequency). Arrow with square ending denote gatingvariables that control which subset of the channels contribute to the input of the layer above.
Figure 2: Accuracy vs. cost for the multi-task learning scenario.
Figure 3: Accuracy vs. cost for the transfer learning scenario.
Figure 4: Gate values - Cost measure: Number of parameters (a) and (c); FLOPs (b) and (d). Crossesrepresent closed gates corresponding to unused channels. Within each sub-figure, the Lagrangemultiplier Î» increases going top-to-bottom, allowing more gates to stay open.
