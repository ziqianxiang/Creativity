Figure 1: Overview of the SimulS2S framework. “Simul” and “Non-Simul” in the figure repre-sent simultaneous translation and full-sentence translation respectively. The curriculum learningmechanism is not shown in the figure.
Figure 2: Different curriculum mechanisms to switch k from Kmax to a desired K (e.g., 3). IdeallyKmax should be +∞. We just consider Kmax = 30 in this work, which can cover the length of mostspeech sequence in terms of segments.
