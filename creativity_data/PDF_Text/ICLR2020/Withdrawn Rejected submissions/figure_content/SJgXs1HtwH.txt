Figure 1: Approach Overview. The source codes are parsed, vectorized and fed into the proposedTreeCaps network for the program classification task.
Figure 2: Tree Vectorization, which generates the AST from the source code and vectorizes it usingan embedding generation technique.
Figure 3: Variable-to-Static Routing, which routes a variable set of capsules to generate a static setof capsules.
Figure 4: Dynamic Routing between the Primary Static Capsules and the Code Capsules.
