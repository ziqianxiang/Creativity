Figure 1: Illustration of count-min sketch for a stream of letters AB-CAACD. The hash codes for each letter for 4 different hash functions isshown on the left and the accumulated counts for each of the letter in thestream is shown on the rightDuring inference, wewant to know the fre-quency of a particular el-ement say a1. We sim-ply go to all the cellswhere a1 is mappedto. Each cell gives andover-estimated value ofthe original frequency ofa1 . To reduce the off-set of estimation, the al-gorithm proposes to takethe minimum of all theestimates as the approxi-mate frequency, i.e., napprox(a1) = min(C[1, H1(i)], C[2, H2(i),  , C[logK, Hlog K]).
Figure 2: Schematic diagram of MACH. Both the in-put and the label vector are independently hashed Rtimes (label vector is hashed from K to B , K beingnumber of classes and B being number of buckets ineach of the R hash tables). Small models are thentrained in parallel.
Figure 3: Reconstruction Error (MSE) comparison between 1) vanilla mean estimator (plotted inmagenta) and 2) proposed square-root estimator (plotted in green); for various configurations of K,Band V. The value ofK varies as 10000, 100000, 1000000 for the 1st, 2nd and 3rd rows respectively.
