Figure 1: Controlling misclassification caused by output randomization4.2 Finite difference gradient errorTo verify the function d(p) satisfies the second condition, that it introduces error that prevents a finitedifference based black box attack, we show the effect of the output randomization on the gradientaccessible to the adversary.
Figure 2: Carlini & Wagner (17) white box attack versus output randomization. Top row showsuntargeted attacks, bottom row shows targeted attacks.
Figure 3: ZOO (18) black box attack versus output randomization. Top row shows untargeted attacks,bottom row shows targeted attacks. Compare this figure with the white box attack results in Figure 2.
Figure 4: L2 norm of difference betWeen the true finite difference gradient calculated by ZOO on theundefended model and the finite difference gradient calculated on the defended model With increasingvariance. As expected the error is significantly higher for noise With larger variance.
