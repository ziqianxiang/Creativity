Figure 1: An illustration of the Bi-Sent2vec training process. A word from a sentence pair ischosen as a target and the algorithm learns to predict it using the rest of the sentence(monolingualtraining component) and the translation of the sentence(cross-lingual component).
Figure 2: Effect of corpus size on cross-lingual word/sentence retrieval performance.
Figure 3: Effect of corpus size on monolingual word quality. We use SimLex-999, WS-353, andFR-RG datasets for measuring monolingual word embedding quality.
