Figure 1: Colored cones correspond to a given label from the classifier on the simplex.
Figure 2: Pipeline of the introduced algorithms.
Figure 3: Figure 3a: Bivariate synthetic samples normally distributed and designed for binaryclassification. Extreme observations are based on a standardisation of the observations in the inputspace (refer to the Supplementary for details about the standardisation). Figure 3b: Bivariate outputsof the encoder φ on the dataset visualised in Figure 3a. Figure 3c Input space where extremeobservations are based on ||Z|| where Z is the output of 夕.
Figure 4: Illutration of the direction Θ(V) obtained with bivariate samples V generated from alogistic model with different coefficients of dependence from no dependence Figure 4a (δ = 0.9) tohigh dependence Figure 4c (δ = 0.1) through low dependence Figure 4b (δ = 0.5). Non extremesamples are in gray, extreme samples are in black and directions Θ(V) (extreme samples projectedon the sup norm sphere) in red. Note that not all extremes are shown since the plot was truncated fora better visualization. However all projections on the sphere are shown.
Figure 5:	Evolution of the prediction of Orthrus on the whole test set (a) and on the extreme test set(b). Colors (black and white) represent predicted labels for each sample (λ XteSt) with λ being thedilation factor (Y-axis).
Figure 6:	Evolution of the prediction of Orthrus on the whole test set (a) and on the extreme testset (b). Colors represent predicted labels for each sample (λ XteSt) with λ being the dilatation factor(Y-axis).
Figure 7:	Illutration of the affect score on the Amazon dataset (Figure 7a) and on the Yelp dataset(Figure 7b dataset). The blue (respectively orange) violin plot represents the maximum affect score ofsentences in the extreme (respectively non extreme) samples. The green (respectively red) violin plotrepresents the minimum affect score of sentences in the extreme (respectively non extreme) samples.
