Figure 1: I3D network (figure from Carreira & Zisserman (2017)) and C-LSTM network (right).
Figure 2: Best displayed in Adobe Reader where the figures can be played as videos. I3D (left)and C-LSTM (right) results for validation sequences from Something-something. The three columnsshow, from left to right, the original input, the Grad-CAM result, and the input as perturbed by thetemporal freeze mask. The third column also visualizes when the mask is on (red) or off (green), withthe current frame highlighted. OS: original score (softmax output) for the guessed class, FS: freezescore, RS: reverse score and CS: score for the ground truth class when there was a misclassification.
Figure 3: The figures can be displayed as videos in Adobe Reader. Same structure as Fig. 2.
