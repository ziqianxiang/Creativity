Figure 1: The few-shot meta-learning problem is modelled using a hierarchical model that learns aprior p(wi; θ) using a few data points si(jt) = {(xi(jt),yi(jt))} to infer si(jv) = {(xi(jv), yi(jv))}. Shadednodes denote observed variables, while white nodes denote hidden variables.
Figure 2: (Leftmost and middle graphs) SImBa and MAML are compared in a regression problemwhen training is based on multi-modal data - half of the tasks are generated from sinusoidal func-tions, and the other half are from linear functions. The shaded area is the prediction made by SImBa± 2× standard deviation. (Right) Reliability chart of various meta-learning methods averaged over1000 tasks.
