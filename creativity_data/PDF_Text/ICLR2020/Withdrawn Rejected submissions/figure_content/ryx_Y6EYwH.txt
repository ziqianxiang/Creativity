Figure 1: Differentially private estimation of the survival function: Followup time is on the X-axisand the probability of survival is on the Y-axis. The black line is the original function estimate, thegreen line is the differentially private estimate with = 2, and the orange line is the differentiallyprivate estimate with = 1. We observe that our method provides good utility while protecting anindividualâ€™s privacy. Small sample sized datasets fare worse compared to larger datasets.
Figure 2: Extending differentially private estimation to competing risk cumulative incidence (cumu-lative incidence is the opposite of survival function, so the plots go upward). Black is the original,unperturbed estimate. Green is with = 2 and orange is with = 1. We can see that our methoddoes a good job of estimating competing risk cumulative incidence while providing strong privacyguarantees.
