Figure 1: Overview of SA-RNN. ht-1 is the hidden state at timestep t - 1. Prior to computing ht,the update coordinator decides which hidden dimensions will be updated according to xt and itsprevious update decisions. According to the decision in this figure, for example, hidden dimension 1is updated while hidden dimension 2 remains unchanged.
Figure 2: Sample skipping patterns from compared methods for the Seizures task with 50-dimensional state representations. Black squares indicate update while white squares indicate skip.
Figure 3: Observing the effect of skip percent and Î» on accuracy. Accuracy and skip percent contrastone another, resulting in a trade-off.
Figure 4: Raw update patterns. Each column is a state representation. White boxes indicate Skip,darker boxes indicate the degree to which a neuron is updated with darker being more updated. Ablack box indicates that a neuron is fully-updated.
