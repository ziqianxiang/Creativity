Figure 1: Overview of the proposed FTA framework, which is composed of two stages.
Figure 2: Performance comparison of TAT to direct fine-tuning on the mini-ImageNet dataset usingthe ResNet-12 backbone. Accuracies on the test set at different training epochs are plotted.
Figure 3: Schematic illustration of different feature transformations by TAT in the 5-way 1-shot (a)and 5-way 5-shot (b) settings. Circles of different colors represent the features of different classes.
