Figure 1: From the original graph, we generate a series of graphs, which are weighted by param-eters that gauge the influence strengths, (optionally) sparsified, and eventually combined to form avariable power graph.
Figure 2: Our proposed framework can improve both clean and adversarial (10% attack byADW3 (Bojchevski & Gunnemann, 2019)) accuracy for semi-supervised learning benchmarks.
Figure 3: Comparison for SBM dataset. Shaded area indicates standard deviation over 10 runs.
Figure 4: Accuracy of first 100 frequency components of VPN (red) and adjacency matrix (blue).
Figure 5: Benign and adversarial accu-racy as power order increases. Dahsedlines correspond to vanilla GCN.
Figure 6:	Robustness merit accuracyproposed-method - accuracyvanilla GCN reported in percentage un-der ADW3 attack. The error bar indicates standard deviation over 20 independent simulations.
Figure 7:	Accuracy of first 500 frequency components for VPN (red) and adjacency matrix (blue).
Figure 8: Accuracy of the leading frequency components in adversarial testing. We use>Φ二,LkΦ> i:kX as reconstructed nodal features for testing, where k is 10 for Citeseer and 5 for Coraand Pubmed. Error bar indicates standard deviation over 10 runs.
