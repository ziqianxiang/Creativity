Figure 1:  The overall structure of ZSAR composed of Artifact Pattern Extraction and Artifact Re-duction Network (ARN). Note that we treat the original input image as the output of “0ᵗʰ” iteration.
Figure 2: An input image and examples of the two clusters after K-means is applied to the patches.
Figure 3: Artifact Reduction Network (ARN) architecture. Note that n and s of each layer stand forthe number of kernels and strides, respectively.
Figure 4:  (b) Mean and (c) standard deviation vs.  iteration number for the red and blue regions inCT image (a).
Figure 5: Artifact reduction in cardiac CT images.  Quantitative comparisons for the largest homo-geneous areas inside the marked regions can be found in Table 1.
Figure 6: Comparison using MRI test images under (a) ideal and both (b) and (c) non-ideal scenarios.
Figure 7: Artifact reduction in cardiac CT images.  Quantitative comparisons for the largest homo-geneous areas inside the marked regions can be found in Table 4.
Figure 8:  Comparison using MRI test images.  Quantitative comparisons for the largest homoge-neous areas inside the marked regions can be found in Table 5.
