Figure 1: Image processing has been used to generate im-ages that look good for human, but not machines. In thiswork we study the problem of making processed imagesmore recognizable by machines.
Figure 2: Left: RA (Recognition-Aware) processing. In addition to the image processing loss, we add a recog-nition loss using a fixed recognition model R, for the processing model P to optimize. Right: RA with trans-former. “Recognition Loss” stands for the dashed box in the left figure. A Transformer T is introduced betweenthe output of P and input of R, to optimize recognition loss. We cut the gradient from recognition loss flowingto P , such that P only optimizes the image processing loss and the image quality is guaranteed not affected.
Figure 3: Examples where outputs of RA processing models can be correctly classified but those from plainprocessing models cannot. PSNR/SSIM/class prediction is shown below each output image. Slight differencesbetween images from plain processing and RA processing models could be noticed when zoomed in.
Figure 4: Examples where output images from RA processing models can be correctly classified but thosefrom plain processing models cannot. PSNR/SSIM/class prediction is shown below each output image. Slightdifferences between images from plain processing and RA processing models (especially with large λs) couldbe noticed when zoomed in.
