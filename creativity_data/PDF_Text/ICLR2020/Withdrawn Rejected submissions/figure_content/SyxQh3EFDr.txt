Figure 1: Sorted predicted probabilities (denoted as y) from three different training paradigms eval-uated on CIFAR-100 dataset using PreAct ResNet-18. The red bar indicates the probability of theground-truth (denoted as yg), the green bars are the probabilities of classes in the same parental cat-egory as the ground-truth (denoted as yG∖{g}), and blue bars are the probabilities of the rest classes(denoted as yκ∖G, see Sec. 3 for detailed notation definition). Notice the “staircase shape” in (C)showing the significant difference between yg and ryG∖{g}, and then between ryG∖{g} and yκ∖G,which confirms HCOT well captures the label hierarchy.
Figure 2: Embeddings from 20 coarse classes of CIFAR-100 test images. The embedding of eachsample is from the penultimate layer and projected to two dimensions (by t-SNE) for visualization.
Figure 3: Examples of segmentation results in PASCAL-Context. Notice the main objects (bird,horses, building) in each image are well-segmented in (d) and visually much closer to the groundtruth in (b). We believe that HCOT retains the latent label hierarchies so the segmentation is clearerand without much irrelevant semantics.
