Figure 1: An illustrative comparison of all five priors for a simple 2D input VAE. The latent di-mension is two and the priors are parameterized using (μ, Σ, V), as indicated by the vertical rows.
Figure 2:	Best viewed in color (color-coded). The leftmost plots show the test data (denoted Truedata) and the plots on the right show reconstructed test data using different values for σ . Upper row:Results from the VAE model with bias nodes, Lower row: Result from the VAE model without biasnodes (in total 12 parameters). The presented MSE reconstruction errors are estimated using cross-validation, repeated 10 times.
Figure 3:	The leftmost plot shows the test data (denoted True data), and the plots to the rightshow reconstructed test data using VAE models with five different priors. All models were im-plemented without any bias nodes. The presented MSE reconstruction errors are estimated usingcross-validation, repeated 10 times.
Figure 4: This figure shows the priors and posteriors of latent variable of all five models. Lowerleft shows the distribution of the data. The top row contains all priors that have been used forthe models, and the second row shows the marginal distribution q(z) of the models encoder aftertraining.
Figure 5: Left figure shows distributions of SSIM (higher is better) for each method on x-axis.
