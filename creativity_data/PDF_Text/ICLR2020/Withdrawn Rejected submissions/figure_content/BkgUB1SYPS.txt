Figure 1: The diagram about a bidirectional adaptive RNN. a) is a single direction adaptive RNN,b) is a schematic diagram of bidirectional RNN.
Figure 2: Results on the short-range (first row) and long-range (second row) dependencies tasks.
Figure 3: Visualization of contextual similarity between all words pairs in a single sentence. For thefirst row, we set the hidden layer units to be 256, with layers from 1 to 3. For the second row, we setthe number of layers to 1, and the hidden layer units (256, 512 and 1024, respectively). The lighteryellow-colored areas indicate the higher contextual similarity.
