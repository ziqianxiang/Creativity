Figure 1: z(t) with Z(t) = -G(z(t)). (Left) L(x,u) = xu. All points satisfy G(Z)T(Z - z?) = 0so kz(t) - z?k does not decrease and z(t) forms a cycle. (Right) L(x, u) = 0.2x2 +xu. The dashedline denotes where G(Z)T(Z - Z?) = 0, but it is visually clear that Z? = 0 is the only cluster point.
Figure 2: Plot of kzk - z? k2 vs. iteration count for simGD-OS (left) and SSSGD-A (right) withαk = 1/kp and βk = 1/kq. We use L0 of (2) and Gaussian random noise. The shaded regiondenotes ± standard error. For simGD-OS, we see that neither q = 0 nor q = p leads to convergence.
Figure 3: Samples of generated MNIST and CIFAR-10 images at the end of the training periods ofanchored Adam.
Figure 4: FID score vs. iteration on MNIST (left) and CIFAR-10 (right). Optimism rate ofβ = 1 andanchor rate of γ = 1 was used. The MNIST setup benefits from optimism but not from anchoring,while the CIFAR-10 setup benefits from optimism but not from anchoring.
