Figure 1: The original image is shown in the first column, the adversarial image in the secondcolumn, and image reconstructed using IHT is shown in the third column.
Figure 2: Reconstruction quality of images using IHT and BP. The first column shoWs randomlyselected original images from the test set, While the second and fifth column shoW the adversarialimages. Reconstructions using IHT are labeled IHT-Rec and using BP are labeled BP-Rec. We shoWreconstructions in columns three, four, six, and seven.
Figure 3: Reconstruction quality of images using BP. The first columns shoWs the original images,While the adversarial images are shoWn in the second and fourth column. The reconstructions areshoWn in columns three and five.
Figure 4: Comparison of images reconstructed using Algorithm 3 (With Constraint) with imagesreconstructed using Ds without the additional constraint (No Constraint).
Figure 5: Reconstruction quality of images using DS. The first column shows the original images,while the second columns shows adversarial images and the third columns shows reconstructionsusing Algorithm 3 respectively.
