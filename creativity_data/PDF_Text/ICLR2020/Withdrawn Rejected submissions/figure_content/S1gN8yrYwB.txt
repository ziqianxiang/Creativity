Figure 1: Comparison of learning curves of our approach to other state-of-the-art RL algorithms.
Figure 2: Design study on hyperparameter α in eq.16 to manually restrict the maximum possiblenumber of fictitious data samples. The performance curves are shown for three values, α = 1,α = 0.8, and α = 0.6. The results show that finding the optimal composition of the dataset for apolicy gradient estimate is non-trivial.
