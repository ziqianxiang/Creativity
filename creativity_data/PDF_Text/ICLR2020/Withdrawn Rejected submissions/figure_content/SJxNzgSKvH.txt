Figure 2: Training and test error (ResNet44, CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, WRN-28-10). Comparingvanilla training, HNM-samples selection (hard negative sampling), and MMS (our) selectionCIFAR10. For the CIFAR10 dataset, sampling with the MMS scheme obtained significantly lowererror compared to the baseline and the HNM-samples throughout the entire training progress (>25% - 30% on average). The test results are depicted in Figure 2b. Furthermore, the use of MMSprovides a slight improvement of 0.1% in the final test accuracy as well as a clear indication of afaster generalization compared to the baseline and the HNM schemes.

Figure 5: Training and test accuracy (ResNet44, CIFAR10 and WRN-28-10, CIFAR100). Com-paring vanilla training, HNM-samples selection (hard negative mining), and MMS (our) selectionmethod using a faster regime. We plot the regular regime baseline (dotted) for perspective. TheMMS selection method achieves final test accuracy at a reduces number of training steps.
