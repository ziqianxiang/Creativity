Figure 1: Distribution of pairwise distances between different kinds of atom type after training aEuclidean distance matrix WGAN-GP (Sec. 3) on the C7O2H10 isomer subset of QM9.
Figure 2: Number of unique molecular structures in terms of their topology for roughly 4000 validgenerated samples and whether they could be found in the training set (blue), the test set (orange),or had a new topology altogether (green).
Figure 3: Unique generated conformations up to a maximal heavy atom distance cutoff of dcutoff =0.6 A after assignment and superposition. We distinguish the categories of known conformationsin the considered subset of the QM9 database (blue), new conformations for contained molecularstructures (orange), and distinct conformations for molecular structures that are not contained.
Figure 4: Total energies of structures that were relaxed with the semi-empirical method implementedby MOPAC, in particular for molecules contained in the considered QM9 subset (blue), structuresthat correspond to new conformations for contained molecules (orange), and unique conformationsthat belong to new molecules.
Figure 5: Sampled structures with the Euclidean distance matrix WGAN. Top row A to D are gener-ated samples, bottom row A’ toD’ are closest matches from the QM9 database. Generated moleculesA and B could be matched with A and B' up to a maximum atom distance of 0.6 A. Generatedmolecules C and D are new molecular structures with their closest matches C’ and D’, respectively.
