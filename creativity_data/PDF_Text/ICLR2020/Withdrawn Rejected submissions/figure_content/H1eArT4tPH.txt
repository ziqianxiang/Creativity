Figure 1: An illustration of Thm. 1. The activations of the network in (a) are completely differentfrom those of the network in (b), in which all skip connections bypassing layer k = 2 are removed.
Figure 2: The variance of the squared norm in log scale of the per layer Jacobian as a function of α(held constant for all the layers) obtained from the simulated results of 200 independent runs, for (a)ResNet with m = 2 and n = 40, and (b) DenseNet with n = 40. The x-axis represents the depthof the network, and y-axis the variance as computed from 200 runs. The dashed lines representour theoretical predictions for both architectures, and full lines represent the empirical results. Allnetworks were initialized using Gaussian distributions.
Figure 3: Activations norm per layer, as obtained from simulated results of 5000 independent runs.
Figure 4: A Dolan-More profile, based on the accuracy obtained for the UCI experiments. The x-axisis the threshold (T). Note that since for accuracy scores, higher is better, whereas typical Dolan-Moreplots show cost, the axis is ordered in reverse. The y-axis depicts, for a given architecture out of thenine, the ratio of datasets in which the obtained accuracy is above the threshold τ times the maximalaccuracy obtained by any architecture .
