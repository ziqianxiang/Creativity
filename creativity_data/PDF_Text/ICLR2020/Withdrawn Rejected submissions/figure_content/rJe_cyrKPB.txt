Figure 1: Sampling temperature’s effect on accuracy profiles. Left: Here we evaluate how thesampling temperature impacts the accuracy of the GroSS decompostion at four configurations, whichspan the configuration space. We see that the accuracy deficit at α = 4 remains relatively constantacross the configurations, therefore providing the most balanced search space of temperatures tested.
