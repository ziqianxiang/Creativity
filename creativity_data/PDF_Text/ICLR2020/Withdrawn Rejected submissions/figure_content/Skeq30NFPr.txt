Figure 4: An illustration of the experiments in Table 2We measure the distances between the initializations and the global minima obtained from differentmirrors and different initializations, in different Bregman divergences. Table 1, and Table 2 showsome examples among different mirrors and different initializations, respectively. Fig. 5 shows the8Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2020distances between a particular initial point and all the final points obtained from different initializa-tions and different mirrors (the distances are often orders of magnitude different, so we show themin logarithmic scale). The global minimum achieved by any mirror from any initialization is theclosest in the correct Bregman divergence, among all mirrors, among all initializations, and amongboth. This trend is very consistent among all our experiments, which can be found in SupplementaryMaterial B.
Figure 5: Distances between a particular initial point and all the final points obtained by both dif-ferent initializations and different mirrors. The smallest distance, among all initializations and allmirrors, corresponds exactly to the final point obtained from that initial point by SGD. This trend isobserved consistently for all other mirror descents and all initializations (see the results in Tables 8and 9 in the appendix).
Figure 6: Histogram of the absolute value of the final weights in the network for different SMDalgorithm with different potentials. Note that each of the four histograms corresponds to an 11 × 106-dimensional weight vector that perfectly interpolates the data. Even though the weights remain quitesmall, the histograms are drastically different. 'ι-SMD induces sparsity on the weights, as expected.

Figure 10: An illustration of the experimental results. For each initialization w0 , we ran differentSMD algorithms until convergence to a point on the set W (zero training error). We then measuredall the pairwise distances from different w∞ to different w0 , in different Bregman divergences. Theclosest point (among all initializations and all mirrors) to any particular initialization w0 in Bregmandivergence with potential ψ(∙) = ∣∣ ∙ kq is exactly the point obtained by running SMD with potentialk ∙ kq from wo.

Note that each ofthe fourhistograms corresponds to an 11 × 106-dimensional weight vector that perfectly interpolates thedata. Even though the weights remain quite small, the histograms are drastically different. '1-SMDinduces sparsity on the weights, as expected. SGD does not seem to change the distribution of theweights significantly. '3-SMD starts to reduce the sparsity, and '10 shifts the distribution of theweights significantly, so much so that almost all the weights are non-zero.
