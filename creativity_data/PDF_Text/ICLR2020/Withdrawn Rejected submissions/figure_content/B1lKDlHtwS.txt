Figure 1: Back-to-back regression identifies the subset of factors Eii = 1 in X that influence someobservations Y by 1) regressing from Y to X to obtain X, and 2) returning the diagonal of theregression coefficients from X to X.
Figure 2: Synthetic experiments. Average AUC (top) and Feature Importance ∆R (bottom) whenvarying experimental conditions individually. Higher is better. B2B compares favorably in all cases.
Figure 3: Ninety subjects each readapproximately 2,700 words while theirbrain activity was recorded with MEG.
Figure 4: Multiple models (color-coded) are compared ontheir ability to reliably predict single-trial MEG signalsevoked by words. Left. Average improvement of corre-lation coefficient ∆R for each of the four features (rows).
Figure 5:	Synthetic experiments. Distribution (over conditions) of AUC (top) and Feature Importance∆R (bottom) metrics between our method (y-axis) and the baselines (x-axis). Each dot is a distinctsynthetic experiment. Dots below the diagonal indicates that B2B outperform the tested model.
Figure 6:	Wall-clock run-time for our method B2B and for the baselines. Each dot is a distinctsynthetic experiment. B2B runs much faster than cross-decomposition baselines.
Figure 7: Comparison of ∆R when the models are tested on four variables (top) and when the modelsare tested on an these four variables as well as another 10 word-embedding features (bottom). Theseresults illustrate that, unlike Regularized CCA, B2B remains robust even when the number of testedfactors increases.
