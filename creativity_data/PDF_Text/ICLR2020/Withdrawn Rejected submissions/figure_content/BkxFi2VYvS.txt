Figure 1: The process of generating annotations for unlabeled image.
Figure 2: The architecture of the proposed segmentation network. “NB”: non-bottleneck unit. “B”:bottleneck unit. “T”: transition layer. The number of output channels for each block are markedinside parentheses.
Figure 3: Proposed core units. (a) initial block. (b) non-bottleneck unit. (c) bottleneck unit. “C”:the number of channels from input. “gr”: growth rate, which is set to 32 in all our bottleneck unit.
Figure 4: Sample results on the Cityscapes validation set using half of training data. From leftto right: (a) image (b) ground truth (c) segmentation results without semi-supervised learning (d)segmentation results with semi-supervised learningthe accuracy. Since Taux at 0.9 gives the best results, we use the same value in the followingexperiments.
