For the One Billion Word, we used a two-layer LSTMs with 2048 hidden states and sam-pled softmax. The global experiment settings in the released public code Rdspring1 was adoptedin this study. For both vanilla Adam and AdaX, the LSTMs were trained using for 5 epochs, withlearning rate decaying to 1e-8 linearly. Similarly, the weight decay for AdaX was set to 0. Note thatthe regular SGD is not suitable in this task, so it is not included in the comparison.

(c),(d) Training and testing results of AdamW and AdaX-W with different ’sof Adam’s second moment. We verified their claim by testing AdamW with different values of∈ {1e - 8, 1e - 5, 1e - 3} on the CIFAR-10 dataset. We found that larger values of , since ithelped to stabilize very small second moment, did improve AdamW’s performance by around 0.35percent accuracy on CIFAR-10. However, AdaX-W’s performance was not affected by differentchoices of as shown in Figure 4d, which again proved our claim that a long term memory designwas more stable than the exponential moving average in Adam.
