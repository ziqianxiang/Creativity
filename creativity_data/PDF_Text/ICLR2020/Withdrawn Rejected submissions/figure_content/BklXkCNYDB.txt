Figure 1: Statistics of the training graphs. Left: node counts and adjacency matrix bandwidths, horizontalaxis is log-scaled. Middle: proportion of graphs whose bandwidths can be reduced below the given thresholdB . Right: ratios between node count and adjacency matrix bandwidth after applying bandwidth reduction.
