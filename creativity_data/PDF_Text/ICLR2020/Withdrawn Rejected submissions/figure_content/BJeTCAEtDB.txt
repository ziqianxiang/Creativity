Figure 1: Vector quantization in 2D case. (a) A pair of correlated channels on a scatter plot. Allvalues in a cell are mapped to the center of the cell; hence, small cells induce small quantizationnoise. Several bins are empty (red cells); (b) Decorrelation improves utilization since the cells aresmaller now; (c) Forcing equal bin size along all dimensions further improves utilization. Instead ofrestricting both channel dynamic range to be divided into same number of bins, we use uniform binsize along all dimensions. VLC allows to further compress the representation since the channels withsmaller dynamic range have are mapped mostly to a few most probable bins.
Figure 2: High-level flow diagram of the encoder-decoder chain. PCA and BN are folded into theconvolution weights (denoted by *), resulting in a single convolution (boxed in grey).
Figure 3: Rate-distortion curves for ResNet-18 and MobileNetV2 architectures with 8- (blue) and4-bit (red) weight quantization. Distortion is evaluated in terms of top-1 accuracy on ImageNet.
Figure 4: Ablation study of the proposed encoder on ResNet-18. Left: rate-distortion curve withdifferent encoder configurations. Theoretical rates are reported; top-1 accuracy is used as thedistortion measure. Right: theoretical memory rate in bits per value achieved for different levels ofPCA truncation for baseline and 0.5% lower than baseline top-1 accuracy.
Figure 5: Top-1 accuracy on ResNet18 ImageNet vs. power consumption of our hardware implemen-tation. Each point represents a different quantization rate.
