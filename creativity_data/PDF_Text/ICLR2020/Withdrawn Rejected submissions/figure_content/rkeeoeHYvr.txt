Figure 1: Overview of AdvCodec. Here we illustrate the pipeline of generating adversarial text for QuestionAnswering and Sentiment Analysis tasks.
Figure 2: The tree decoder. Each node in the depen-dency tree is a LSTM cell. Black lines refer to thedependencies between parent and child nodes. Redarrows refer to the directions of decoding. Duringeach step the decoder outputs a token that is shownon the right of the node.
