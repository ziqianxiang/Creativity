Figure 1: Corpus based Amharic Sentiment Lexicon Building FrameworkThe algorithm and the seeds in figure 1 are briefly described as follows. To generateAmharic Sentiment lexicon, we follow four major steps:1.	Prepare a set of seed lists which are strongly negatively and positivelypolarized Adjectives, Nouns and Verbs (Note: Amharic language contains fewadverbs (Passaro et al., 2015), adverbs are not taken as seed word). We willselect at least seven most polarized seed words for each of aforementionedpart-of-speech classes (Yimam, 2000). Selection of seed words is the mostcritical that affects the performance of bootstrapping algorithm (Waegel,2003). Most authors choose the most frequently occurring words in the corpusas seed list. This is assumed to ensure the greatest amount of contextualinformation to learn from, however, we are not sure about the quality of thecontexts. We adapt and follow seed selection guidelines of Turney & Littman(2003). After we tried seed selection based on Turney & Littman (2003), weupdate the original seed words. Sample summary of seeds are presented inTable 1.
