Figure 1: Graphical models describe expert demonstrations and diverse-quality demonstrations.
Figure 2: Performance averaged over 5 trials in terms of the mean and standard error. Demonstrationsare generated by 10 demonstrators using (a) Gaussian and (b) TSD noisy policies. Horizontal dottedlines indicate performance of k “ 1, 3, 5, 7, 10 demonstrators. IS denotes importance sampling.

Figure 4: Performance of InfoGAIL with difffer-ent contexts z for the robosuite reaching task.
Figure 5: An example of trajectory generated by VILD’s policy in the robosuite reaching task. Thegoal of the agent is to control the robot’s end-effector to reach the red object. The value of rewardfunction (for performance evaluation) is inverse proportion to the distance between the end-effectorand the red object.

Figure 10: Performance averaged over 5 trials of InfoGAIL with different values of context z forthe benchmark tasks. For each trial, the performance of each context is computed using 10 testtrajectories.
