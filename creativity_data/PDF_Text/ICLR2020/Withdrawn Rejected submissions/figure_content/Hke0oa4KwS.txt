Figure 1: Figure 1(a) Scatter plot to indicate how predictive U1 is compared to the loss. For smallvalues of U1 , the loss is small with high probability. Figure 1(b): the probability correct (green)or Top5 (blue) given the value of U1 . Figure 1(c): visualization of the images in the upper left ofFigure 1(a). The confident images which were labelled incorrectly turned out to be mislabelled orambiguous.
