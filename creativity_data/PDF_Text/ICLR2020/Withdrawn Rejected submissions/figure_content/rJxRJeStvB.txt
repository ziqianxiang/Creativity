Figure 1: Illustration of overall pipeline of our methodEnviron men一AUCt-On3.2	Inference of Q-function using new structure2vecIn this section, we show how Q(st , at) can be precisely and transeferably inferred using a two-stepstructure2vec inference method (For theoretical justifications on hierarchical variational inference,see Ranganath et al. (2015)). We here assume that we are given (Tt , EtTT ) and inferred {pij } so thatCorollary 1 can be applied. For brevity, we illustrate the inference procedure for the special casewhen task completion time is deterministic (Appendix G illustrates how we can combine randomsampling to inference procedure to deal with task completion times as a random variable).

This library provides metaheuristics such as Greedy Descent, Guided Local Search,Simulated Annealing, Tabu Search. We compare our algorithm’s result with the heuristic with thebest result for each experiment. We consider cases with 3, 5, 7, 10 machines and 50, 75, 100 jobs.
