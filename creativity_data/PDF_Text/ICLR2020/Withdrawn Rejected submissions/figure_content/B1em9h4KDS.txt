Figure 1: Block diagram of the proposed adversarial imputation method. h represents the blendingfunction of (1), and L is the adversarial loss function of (2).
Figure 2: Comparison of FID scores on CIFAR-10 dataset for (a) uniform and (b) rectangularmissingness. Lower FID score is better. In many cases, variance values are very small and onlyobservable by magnifying the figures.

Figure 4:	Evaluation using synthesized data: (a) samples from the underlying distribution, (b) samplesfrom the conditional underlying distribution, (c-f) samples from the conditional distribution generateby GI, MisGAN, GAIN, and DAE.
Figure 5: Simulation results for measuring average missing rate given different beta distributionparameters.
Figure 6: Comparison of FID scores achieved with (GI W/ Atten.) and without (GI W/O Atten.)self-attention layers on CIFAR-10 dataset and rectangular missingness. Lower FID score is better.
Figure 7: Comparison of classification accuracies achieved with different ensemble size (N ).
Figure 8: Comparison of generating samples from a Gaussian distribution (a) samples from theoriginal distribution, (b) samples generated using GAIN imputers with different significance of theMSE term (controlled by Î»).
