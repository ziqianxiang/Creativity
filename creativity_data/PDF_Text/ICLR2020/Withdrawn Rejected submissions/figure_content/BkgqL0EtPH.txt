Figure 4: ECG data at different levels of the hierarchy. From top to bottom, a full patient record, asegment, and a frame.
Figure 5: Diagram detailing the training and evaluation pipeline for the representation learning task.
Figure 6: An analysis of the specific clusters resulting from the PCA features of 100 dimensionsvisualized with a t-SNE. 40,000 example frames were randomly sampled from the test data.
Figure 7: t-SNE plot of embeddings produced by different frame-level encoders. Colors representthe three basic labels. Each plot is computed using the same 20,000 frame examples encoded usingeach method and then having a t-SNE applied.
Figure 8: Reconstructions using the AE and PCA100. Two samples are shown, one for each column.
