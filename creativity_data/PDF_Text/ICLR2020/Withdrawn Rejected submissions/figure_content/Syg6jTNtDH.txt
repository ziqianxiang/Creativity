Figure 1: The computational graph when the center word is ‘is’ and the context words are ‘he’and the numeral ‘190’. We look up the embedding vectors of non-numerical words directly fromthe embedding matrices and use the weighted average of prototype embeddings as the numeralembedding. Negative sampling is not shown in the figure.
Figure 2: Histograms of numerals and learned prototypes that range from 0 to 1013. The horizontalaxis represents the numeral quantity and the vertical axis represents the number of occurrences,‘500’ means the number of prototypes, ‘soft’ means soft-EM.
