Figure 2: YELP - due to space limit, we only show 100 epochs.
Figure 3: RT - due to space limit, we only show 100 epochs.
Figure 4: IMDB - due to space limit, we only show 100 epochs in this and the figures below.
Figure 5: 20NewsFigure 6: MNIST5.2 Results and AnalysisFigures 2-7 show the test accuracy, precision and recall in each epoch of each method. The usualfirst-order exponential weighted moving average smoothing with weight 0.7 is applied to the figures.
