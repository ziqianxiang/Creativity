Figure 1: Generation orders given by easy-first and least2most coordinate selection. We groupthe orders into five clusters and visualize cluster centers with normalized positions (x-axis) overnormalized steps (y-axis). We use greedy search with L iterations on the development set.
Figure 2: Average difference in energy ↑ between sequences generated by selecting positionsuniformly at random versus by different algorithms, over the course of decoding.
Figure 3:	Evolution of the energy of the sequence J over the course of decoding by different positionselection algorithms.
