Figure 1: Analysis of the proposed bound as a function network depth. In (a) we show the squaredgradient norm as a function of the layers of the model. In (b) we report the the generalization boundas a function of λ for different deep net depth levels using the MNIST dataset.
Figure 2: In (a): average mean and STD of model weights as a function of depth level. Top row isfor MNIST, bottom row is for Fashion-MNIST. In (b): ECE and MCE metrics for Softmax, MC-Dropout and BNN models using MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR10 (lower is better).
Figure 3: Analysis of the proposed bound as a function network depth. We report the the gen-eralization bound as a function of λ for different deep net depth levels using the Fashion-MNISTdataset.
