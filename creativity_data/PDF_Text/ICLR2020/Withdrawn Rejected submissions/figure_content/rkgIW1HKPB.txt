Figure 1: The proposed random distance prediction (RDP) framework. Specifically, a weight-sharedtwo-branch neural network φ first projects xi and xj onto a new space, in which we aim to min-imise the random distance prediction loss Lrdp , i.e., the difference between the learned distancehφ(xi; Θ), φ(xj ; Θ)i and a predefined distance hη(xi), η(xj)i (η denotes an existing random map-ping). Laux is an auxiliary loss that is optionally applied to one network branch to learn comple-mentary information w.r.t. Lrdp . The lower right figure presents a 2-D t-SNE (Hinton & Roweis,2003) visualisation of the features learned by RDP on a small toy dataset optdigits with 10 classes.
