Figure 1: Function approximations of a 2 layer neural network with changing training and testingdomains. (First row) Testing domain input shifted by the scalar Î± = [0, -0.5, 0.5] from left to rightrespectively. (Second row) Similar configuration as the first row, but with an additional zero meannormalization on the input data. (Third row) Function approximations of a nonlinear, piecewiselinear and linear function (left to right). (Fourth row) The training set domain is either smaller,equal, or larger than the test domain. Best viewed in color.
Figure 2: Illustration of the relationship between dataset distributions pi to learned induced distribu-tion f (pi) to associated expected loss L(f (pi)). Noted at the bottom of the spaces are the assumedunderlying metrics of the space.
Figure 3: (a) Sentiment classification accuracy versus FD on the Amazon review dataset. Eachpoint corresponds to a train and test set pair. Two independent runs are displayed with differentGloVe embeddings used to compute FD scores. The Pearson correlation is -0.78. (b) Scatter plotof the relation between SDRi and FD scores on the speech separation task. The Pearson correlationbetween all SDRi and FD points is -0.61, while the average correlation given a fixed test set is -0.82.
Figure 4: (a) SDR improvement scores for multiple training and test set configurations. (b) PairwiseFD scores between training and test sets. The matching scatter plot and correlations are reported inFig. 3b.
