Figure 1: Relative improvement of adding data augmentation and explicit regularization to thebaseline models, (accuracy - baseline)/accuracy * 100. The baseline accuracy is shown on the left.
Figure 2: Fraction of the baseline performance when the amount of available training data is reduced,accuracy/baseline * 100. The models trained Wit explicit regularization present a significant dropin performance as compared to the models trained with only data augmentation. The differencesbecome larger as the amount of training data decreases.
Figure 3: Fraction of the original performance when the depth of the All-CNN architecture isincreased or reduced in 3 layers. In the explicitly regularized models, the change of architectureimplies a dramatic drop in the performance, while the models trained without explicit regularizationpresent only slight variations with respect to the original architecture.
