Figure 1: Overview. (a) Exemplary expression. (b) Leading powers of 1/(x + 1) at 0 and ∞. (c)Parse tree of 1/(x + 1). (d) Production rule sequence, the preorder traversal of production rules in theparse tree. (e) Architecture of the model to predict the next production rule from the partial sequenceconditioned on desired leading powers. (f) Using (e) to guide MCTS.
Figure 2: Extrapolation errors of symbolic re-gression methods in holdout set M [f] = 5.
Figure 3: Plot of force field expressionsfound by each method. Grey area is theregion to compute interpolation error ∆gint.
Figure 4: Visualizing metrics for conditional production rule generating NN and LHNC (8) oneach condition within ∣PX→0 [f]| ≤ 9 and ∣PX→∞ [f]| ≤ 9. Conditions with M [f] ≤ 4 are insidethe red boundary and points with 0 value are left blank.
