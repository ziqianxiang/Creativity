Figure 1: Comparison of learning curves for ERM with SGD (blue) and DRO with our SGD withhardness weighted sampling (red). The models are trained on an imbalanced MNIST dataset (only1% of the digits 3 kept in the training datatset) and evaluated on the original MNIST testing dataset.
Figure 2: Comparison of learning curves at testing (top panels) and at training (bottom panels) forERM with SGD (blue) and DRO with our SGD with hardness weighted sampling for different valuesof β on MNIST (β = 0.1, β = 1, β = 10, β = 100). The models are trained on an imbalancedMNIST dataset (only 1% of the digits 3 kept in the training datatset) and evaluated on the originalMNIST testing dataset.
