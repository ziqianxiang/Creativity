Figure 3: NMI (left) and Purity (right) performance of VarPSOM, with standard error, over Î² valueson MNIST test set.
Figure 4: Reconstructions of MNIST / Fashion MNIST data from SOM cells in the 8x8 grid learnedby VarPSOM, illustrating the topological neighbourhood structure induced by our method, whichaids interpretability.
Figure 5: Illustration of 3 example patient trajectories between the beginning of the time series andICU dispatch, in the 2D SOM grid of VarTPSOM. The heatmap shows the enrichment of cells forthe current APACHE physiology score. We observe qualitative differences in the trajectories thedying and the healthy patients.

Figure S2:	Heat-maps of enrichment in mortality risk in the next 24 hours as well as the currentdynamic APACHE score, superimposed on the discrete 2D grid learned by VarTPSOM.
Figure S3:	Randomly sampled VarTPSOM trajectories, from patients expired at the end of the ICUstay, as well as healthily dispatched patients. Superimposed is a heatmap which displays the clusterenrichment in the current APACHE score, from this model run. We observe that trajectories of dyingpatients are often in different locations of the map as healthy patients, in particular in those regionsenriched for high APACHE scores, which corresponds with clinical intuition.
