Figure 1:	Expected function value error versus iteration when applied to two different data distribu-tions. Training used φd = fd. Inferences used δ = 0.01 and EMA(0.1).
Figure 2:	Expected relative function value error versus iteration when applied to two different dis-tributions. Training used φd = fd. Inferences used δ = 0.01, and GS(0.1) in (a) and EMA(0.75) in(b).
Figure 3: Expected function value error versus iteration when applied to two different data distribu-tions. Training used φd = fd. Inferences used δ = 0.01 and GS(0.1).
