Figure 1: Cluster Curriculum. From magenta color to black color, the centrality of data points reduces.
Figure 2: Schematic illustration of active set for clustercurriculum. Here →o| = ∣→i| = ∣→2∣ = 100. The cardinal-ity |A| of the active set A is 200. When -→X2 is taken fortraining, we need to randomly sample another 100 (i.e.

For each dimension, we sample 70,000 data points fromN(0, I). The scales of y-axis and x-axis are normalized by 10,000 and χα1, respectively.

Figure 6: FID curves of cluster-curriculum learning for ProGAN on the cat dataset and CelebA facedataset. The centrality and the FID share the x-axis due to that they have the same order of datapoints. The same colors of the y-axis labels and the curves denote the figurative correspondence.
