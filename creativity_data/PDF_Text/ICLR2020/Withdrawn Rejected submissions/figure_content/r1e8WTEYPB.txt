Figure 1: Example of captions generated using softmax (top), sparsemax (middle) and TVmaxattention (bottom). Shading denotes the attention weight, with white for zero attention. The darkerthe green is, the higher the attention weight is. The full sequences are presented in Appendix C.
Figure 2: Diagram of the caption generation network.
Figure 3: Example of captions generated using softmax (top), sparsemax (middle) and TVmaxattention (bottom). Shading denotes the attention weight, with white for zero attention. The darkerthe green is, the higher the attention weight is. The full sequences are presented in Appendix C.
Figure 4: Example generated captions using softmax attention (top), sparsemax attention (middle)and TVmax attention (bottom). The captions are “A bowl of fruit and a bowl of fruit”, “A bowl offruit and oranges on a table” and “A bowl of oranges and a banana on a table”.
Figure 5: Example generated captions using softmax attention (top), sparsemax attention (middle)and TVmax attention (bottom). The captions are “A soccer player is running to the base”, “A soccerplayer is running to the field” and “A group of people playing soccer on a field”.
