Figure 1: Reconstruction errors for various encoder/decoder models of varying complexity. Left:Fully connected networks with different depths trained on Fashion-MNIST. Middle: Convolutionnetworks with increasing depth/# of spatial scales trained on Cifar100. Right: Averaged AE resultsfrom residual networks with varying number of residual blocks and block depth trained on SVHN,Cifar10, Cifar100 and CelebA. In all plots, once the encoder/decoder complexity is sufficiently high,the reconstruction errors begin to increase.
Figure 2: Histogram of σz values as VAE encoder/decoder network depth is varied. There are 2, 4and 5 convolution layers in each spatial scale from left to right. As depth increases, the reconstruc-tion error grows and more σz values are near 1, indicative of impending posterior collapse.
