Figure 2: Error in estimated dynamics as SISLtrains on a varied number of trajectories from asystem of six coupled Lorenz attractors.
Figure 3: (a): Test performance of optimized models on various trajectories. Error bars on SIDrepresent the standard deviation of performance of the 10 trained models. (b): Predicted accelerationalong axis x, y and z in the body frame for one of the harder test set trajectories. Larger versions ofthese plots, including rotational accelerations, can be found in Appendix A.3.
