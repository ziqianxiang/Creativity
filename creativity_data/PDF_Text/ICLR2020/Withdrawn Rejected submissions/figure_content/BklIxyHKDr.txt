Figure 1: Left: training samples. We observe that test accuracy improves as S2 (C) increases(middle) and that fewer clean training samples are needed to achieve an accuracy of 90% (right).
Figure 2: UCI Results. Error plots against amount of noise applied to the labels of Dnoisy. Dcleancontains 5% of the data. Each column is a different corruption and each row is for a different dataset.
Figure 3: Fashion MNIST. Each column is a different corruption method. We see that the k-NNapproach performs competitively. More results are in the Appendix.
Figure 4: CIFAR10. Each column is a different corruption method. We see that our k-NN methodperforms competitively or outperforms on the uniform and flip noise types but performs worse forthe hard flip noise type. More results are in the Appendix.
Figure 5: SVHN. We see that the k-NN method performs competitively on the uniform and flipnoise types but performs worse for the hard flip noise type. More results in the Appendix.
Figure 6: Performance across different values of k. Here we show that on a UCI dataset, theperformance of Algorithm 1 is stable when varying its hyperparameter k . Note that the y-axis hasbeen zoomed in to better see the differences between the curves.
