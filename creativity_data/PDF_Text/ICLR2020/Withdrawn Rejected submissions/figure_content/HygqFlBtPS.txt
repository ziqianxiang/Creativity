Figure 1: The feasible sets (blue regions/lines) given by the bounded ReLU constraints (Eq. O),convex hull (Convij) and the relaxation (Fast-Lin) discussed in this paper (specific choice for Eq. C)for j âˆˆ Ii. The red lines and dots are the intersections between the boundaries of the convex feasiblesets and the ReLU constraints.
Figure 2: Illustration of the data distribution and the decision boundary of the network. In this case,b = 0.3, e = 0.2, xo = [0.1,0.42]T.
