Figure 2: Empirical Distribution of Likelihoods. The above figure shows the histogram of log-likelihoods for FashionMNIST (train, test), MNIST (test), and NotMNIST (test) for the (a) Glow,(b) PixelCNN, and (c) VAE.
Figure 3: Challenging Cases: CIFAR-10 vs CIFAR-100,(c) Bootstrap Dist. (M = 200)CelebA vs CIFARâ€™s.
Figure 4: Natural Image OOD Detection for Glow. The above plots show the fraction of M -sizedbatches rejected for three Glow models trained on SVHN, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet. The OODdistribution data sets are these three training sets as well as CIFAR-100.
