Specifically,we first describe the training pipeline of the default policy. We then illustrate how the default policyis connected with MCTS algorithm to perform simulation.

Table 5: Comparison between WU-UCT and three TreeP variants on 12 Atari games. Averageepisode return (± standard deviation) over 10 runs are reported. The best average scores amonglisted algorithms are highlighted in boldface. Hyper-parameter rVL refers to the virtual loss addedbefore each simulation starts, and nV L similarly denotes the number of virtual visit counts addedbefore each SimUlation starts.__________________________________________________________Environment	WU-UCT	TreeP (rvL = nvL = 1)	TreeP (rVL = nVL = 2)	TreeP (rVL = nVL = 3)Alien	5938±1839	4850±357	4935±60	5000±0Boxing	100±0	99±1	99±0	99±1BreakoUt	408±21	379±43	265±50	463±60Freeway	32±0	32±0	32±0	32±0Gravitar	5060±568	3500±707	4105±463	4950±141MsPacman	19804±2232	13160±462	12991±851	8640±438RoadRUnner	46720±1359	29800±282	28550±459	29400±494Qbert	13992±5596	17055±353	13425±194	9075±53SpaceInvaders	3393±292	2305±176	3210±127	3020±42Tennis	4±1	1±0	1±0	1±0TimePilot	55130±12474	52500±707	49800±212	32400±1697Zaxxon	39085±6838	24300±2828	24600±424	37550±1096inates other factors (e.g. different language) that may bias the result.
