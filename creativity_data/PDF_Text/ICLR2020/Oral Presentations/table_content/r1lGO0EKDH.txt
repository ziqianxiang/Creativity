Table 1: Statistics of datasets used in our experiments.
Table 2: Summary of results in terms of mean classification accuracy and CPU time for transduc-tive tasks, on Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed datasets — DW, N2V, and GZoom denote DeepWalk,node2vec, and GraphZoom, respectively; l means the graph coarsening level; GZoom_F+MILE rep-resents the best performance achieved when adding GraphZoom fusion kernel into MILE.
Table 3: Summary of results in terms of micro-averaged F1 score and CPU time for inductivetasks, on PPI and Reddit datasets — The baselines are GraphSAGE with four different aggregationfunctions. GZoom and GSAGE denote GraphZoom and GraphSAGE, respectively; l means thegraph coarsening level.
Table 4: Number of nodes at different GraphZoom coarsening levels. GZoom-0 means GraphZoomwith 0 coarsening level (i.e., without coarsening), GZoom-1 means GraphZoom with 1 coarseninglevel and so forth. ”—” means number of nodes is less than 50.
