Table 1: Sampling and averaging schemes for FedAvg. St 〜U (N, K) means St is a Size-Ksubset uniformly sampled without replacement from [N ]. St 〜 W (N, K, P) means St containsK elements that are iid sampled with replacement from [N] with probabilities {pk }. In the latterscheme, St is not a set.

From our theory, when the total steps T is sufficiently large, the required numberof communication rounds to achieve a certain precision isTe/E ≈O (EG2 + EG2 + P^ ― Lr + κG2! ,which is s a function of E that first decreases and then increases. This implies that the optimal localstep E* exists. What's more, the ITJE evaluated at E* isNX	p2kσ2+LΓ +κG2k=1which implies that FedAvg needs more communication rounds to tackle with severer heterogeneity.
