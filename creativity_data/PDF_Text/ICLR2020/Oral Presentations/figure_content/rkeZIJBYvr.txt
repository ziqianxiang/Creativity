Figure 1: Concept. (a) To handle task imbalance, class imbalance and out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks, weintroduce task-specific balancing variables γτ, ωτ, and zτ. (b) With those variables, we learn to balance betweenthe meta-knowledge θ and task-specific update to handle imbalances and distributional shift.
Figure 2: Graphical model.
Figure 3: Inference Network. The proposed dataset encoder captures the instance-wise and class-wise statisticshierarchically, from which we infer three different balancing variables.
