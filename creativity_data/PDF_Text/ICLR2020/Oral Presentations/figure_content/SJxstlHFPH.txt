Figure 1: DrKIT answers multi-hop questions by iteratively mapping an input set of entities X (The GratefulDead, Bob Dylan) to an output set of entities Y (Dylan & the Dead, American beauty, ...) which are related toany input entity by some relation R (album by).
Figure 2: Runtime on a single K80 GPUwhen using ragged representations for im-plementing sparse-matrix vector product, vsthe default sparse-matrix times dense vectorproduct available in TensorFlow. |E | > 105leads to OOM for the latter.
Figure 3: Hits @1 vs Queries/sec during inference on (Left) MetaQA and (Middle) WikiData tasks, measuredon a single CPU server with 6 cores. MSR: Multi-step Retriever model from Das et al. (2019a) (we only showQ/sec). (Right) Effect of varying number of nearest neighbors K during MIPS.
Figure 4: Left: F1 scores on Shared Entity and Shared Relation negatives. The negative examplesare for the Query : (Neil Herron, occupation, ?). Right: Macro-avg accuracy on the Levy et al. (2017)relation extraction dataset. We split the results based on frequency of the relations in our WikiDatatraining data. DrKIT-all spans refers to a variant of our model which selects from all spans in thecorpus, instead of only entity-linked mentions.
