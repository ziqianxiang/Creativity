Figure 1: Game value (expected authentication accuracy) for the Gaussian case. (a) A comparison betweenempirical and theoretical game value for different d values (m “ 1, k “ 10). Solid lines describe the theoreticalgame values whereas the * markers describe the empirical accuracy when learning with the GIM model. (b)Theoretical game value as a function of δ, ρ (see Corollary 4.3) for d “ 100. (c) Empirical accuracy ofan optimal authenticator against two attacks: the theoretically optimal attack G* from Theorem 4.2 and amaximum likelihood (ML) attack (See Sec. F.4) for the Gaussian case. It can be seen that the ML attack isinferior in that it results in better accuracy for the authenticator, as predicted by our theoretical results.
Figure 2: Images generated by the GIM attacker based on one leaked image. In each row, the leftmost imageis the real leaked image, and the rest of the images are an attack sample generated by the GIM attacker. (a)Voxceleb2 dataset. (b) Omniglot dataset.
Figure 3: An illustration of the game described in the main text. An authenticator receives a sampleof n images and needs to decide whether these were generated by a known source, or by an adversarythat had access to leaked images. In order to decide, the authenticator is supplied with a sample ofk images from the real source.

Figure 6: The difference in game value (expected authentication accuracy of the optimal authenticator) be-tween the ML attacker and the optimal attacker for different values of the observations’ dimension d, as afunction of the parameters P “ m, δ “ m. Namely: maxD{V(D, Gml)} — maxD{V(D, G*)}. (a) Differ-ence in game value for d “ 10. (b) Difference in game value for d “ 100. (c) Difference in game value ford“ 1000.
