Figure 1: A toy game. Here P (h1) = C, h2, h3 are the nodes for player 1 and h4, h5 are the-⅛∙nodes for player 2. At episode t, dt and dt are sampled from the posterior distribution, as shownas ct, Ct,u 1(∙∣dt) and U 1(∙∣dt). Then σ1 and σ2 can be calculated by CFR. Finally We use theseparameters on the graph to calculate the interaction strategies with Eq. (5).
