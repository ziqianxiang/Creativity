Figure 1: Different convex relaxations introduced. For each plot, the black line shows the output of a ReLUactivation unit for any input value between li[j] and ui[j] and the green shaded area shows the convex relax-ation introduced. Naive relaxation (a) is the loosest relaxation. Linear bounds relaxation (b) is tighter and isintroduced in Weng et al. (2018). Finally, Planet relaxation (c) is the tightest linear relaxation among the threeconsidered (Ehlers, 2017). Among them, (a) and (b) have closed form solutions which allow fast computationswhile (c) requires an iterative procedure to obtain an optimal solution.
Figure 2: Illustration of our proposed GNN framework. An all zeros embedding network mimicking theneural network is initialised. Embedding vectors are updated via several rounds of forward backward passesusing updating Eqs. (3)-(7). We obtain the final branching decision by calling a score function gs over allembedding vectors of the potential branching decision nodes.

Figure 4:	Red line represents the intercept of the convex relaxation. It is treated as a measure of the shadedgreen area.
Figure 5:	Depending on the value of li[j] and ui[j] , relaxed activation function can take three forms. The leftfigure shows the case where li[j] and ui[j] are of different signs. In this case, for any input value between li[j]and ui[j], the maximum output achievable is indicated by the red line. The middle figure shows the case whereboth li[j] and ui[j] are no greater than zero. In this case, the activation function completely blocks all inputinformation by outputting zero for any input value. The right figure shows the case where li[j] and ui[j] aregreater or equal to zero. In this case, the activation function allows complete information passing by outputtinga value equal to the input value.
