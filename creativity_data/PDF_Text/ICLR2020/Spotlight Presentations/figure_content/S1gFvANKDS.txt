Figure 1:	Empirical verification of predicted asymptotics. (a) The mean deviation of the NTK fromits initial value for a variety of widths and activation functions. The fit (dashed) matches well withthe predicted O(n-1) asymptotics. (b-c) Comparison between the empirical evolution (solid) and theO(n-1) predicted evolution (dashed) for the network function and the kernel. All experiments wereperformed on two-class MNIST, computing a single randomly-chosen component of Θ or f. SeeAppendix A for additional experimental details.
Figure 2:	Feynman diagram examples. (a) The Feynman diagram of Eθ [f (x)f (x0)]. (b)-(c) TheFeynman diagrams of Eθ [f(x1)f(x2)f(x3)f(x4)]; additional, equivalent diagrams are not shown.
Figure 3: Feynman diagrams for Eθ [Θ(x, x0)] with one hidden layer. The dashed vertical linerepresents vertices forced by contracted derivatives.
Figure 4: Feynman diagrams for Eθ [f (x)f (x0)] with 2 hidden layers. Notice that the U, V edges inthe Feynman diagram map to single edges in the double-line diagram, while the W edge maps to adouble edge.

Figure 6: Double-line graphs describing the expectation value of the NTK, Eθ [Θ], for a deeplinear network with two hidden layers. Crossed edges mark the edges that are forced by contractedderivatives. The derivative can act on either U, V , or W1, and therefore there are three diagrams.

Figure 8: A prototypical diagram corresponding to Eθ Tr B2weight distribution leads to correlation functions where the associated cluster graph, GC , containsubgraphs with at least three connected vertices. By Lemma 7 and Conjecture 1 these correlationfunctions vanish at infinite width. For example Eθ [Tr (AB)] = O(1/n). There is a single exceptionto this, as can be easily seen in figure 8, Eθ Tr(B2) is O(1). Thus most moments of the Hessianare equal to moments of A in expectation.13Eθ [Tr (H m)] = { Eθ [TT(Am)] + Eθ [Tr — ,I = 2 + O(I/n .	(78)What’s more, we can relate moments of Ato those of the kernel, as both are built out of two logitderivatives. Explicitly,Tr(Am ) = Tr((MΘ)m ),(79)and so the moments of the Hessian are also related to those of the kernel.14E [T (Hm	)] = Eθ[Tr((MΘ)m )]	,m	6=2	+ O(1/ )	(80)Eθ [Tr(H	)] =	ɪ Eθ [Tr ((M⑼2)]	+Eθ [Tr (B2)]	,m	= 2	+ O(I/n) ∙	(80)Here, we have defined,M(Xa,Xb) = δab' '(χα2ya)	： (Xa,Va) ∈ Dtr ∙	(81)∂f2For the case of MSE loss, we can go even further. In that case, M(xa, xb) = δab and B decays tozero during training. We thus have,Initially:	Eθ ◎ (Hm)] = { Eθ [Tr(Θl+ Eθ [Ir (B2)] ,m = 2 + O(1/n)(82)
Figure 9: (a) The mean difference between the top eigenvalues of the NTK and the Hessian atinitializations for a two hidden layer ReLU network of varying width match well with the predictedO(n-1) behavior. The mean is taken over 100 instances per width on two-class MNIST with 10images per class. (b) The top 10 eigenvalues of both the Hessian and the NTK for a two-layer ReLUnetwork of width 2048 trained on a three-class subset of MNIST. The top eigenvalues match welland show aspects of the repeated Nclass structure predicted at large width. The eigenvalues of H arecomputed using the lanczos algorithm.
Figure 10: Relation between the spectrum of the Hessian and NTK. (a) The first 4 moments of Hand Θ for two hidden layer ReLU networks. At initialization the first third and fourth moments arenumerically similar, while the relative difference of the second moment is O(1). After training allmoments are numerically close. (b) The root mean square eigenvalue of the B matrix shows goodagreement with the predicted 1∕√n fall off for single hidden layer ReLU networks. Experimentswere performed on ReLU networks trained on two-class MNIST with 100 images per class. Momentsof the NTK were computed exactly, while moments of the Hessian and B were computed by randomlysampling 1000 vectors and using Hutchinson’s trick.
