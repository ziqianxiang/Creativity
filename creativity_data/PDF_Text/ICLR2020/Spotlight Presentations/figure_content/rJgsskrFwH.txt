Figure 3: Selected Kinetics continuations from a set of 128 videos and 16 samples which showcase a variety ofnatural, video-specific phenomena our model learns to generate. We used our large spatiotemporal subscalingmodel and prime generation with 5 frames (0-4) to include the first two frames in subscale order (0, 4). Samplesare generated with temperature of 0.9. The examples depict frames 0, 5, 10 and 15.
Figure 4: Samples (showing every 5th frame horizontally) illustrating occlusion effects on BAIRRobot Pushing. Models without temporal subscaling (rows 3-4) fail on occlusions, whereas themodel with temporal subscaling (row 2) correctly maintains objects from the ground truth video(row 1). Notice the green ball deformation on rows 2 and 3 and the hallucinated green ball on theright edge of row 3, which are caused by missing temporal dependencies across the duration ofocclusion.
