Figure 1: Ridge regression bias-variance tradeoff. Left: γ = p/n = 0.2; right: γ = 2. The datamatrix X has iid Gaussian entries. The coefficient β has distribution β 〜 N(0,Ip∕p), while thenoise ε 〜N(0,Ip).

Figure 3: Primal orthogonal sketching with n = 500, γ = 5, λ = 1.5, α = 3, σ = 1. Left:MSE of primal sketching normalized by the MSE of ridge regression. The error bar is the standarddeviation over 10 repetitions. Right: Bias and variance of primal sketching normalized by the biasand variance of ridge regression, respectively.
Figure 4: Left: Ratio of optimal MSE of marginal regression to that of optimally tuned ridge regres-sion, for three values of Y = p/n, as a function of the SNR ɑ2∕σ2. Right: Gaussian dual sketchwhen there is no noise. γ = 0.4, α= 1, λ = 1 (both for original and sketching). Standard errorover 50 experiments.
Figure 5: Simulation for ridge regression. We take n = 1000, λ = 0.3. Also, X has iid N (0, 1)entries, βi 〜俶 N(0, α2∕p), ε,〜血 N(0, σ2), with ɑ = 3,σ = 1. The standard deviations are over50 repetitions. The theoretical lines are plotted according to Theorem 2.2. The MSE is normalizedby the norm of β .

Figure 7: Left: we generate a training set (n = 1000, p = 700, γ = 0.7, α = σ = 1) and a test set(ntest = 500) from the same distribution. We split the training set into K = 5 equally sized foldsand do cross-validation. The blue error bars plot the mean and standard error of the K test errors.
Figure 8: Comparing different ways of doing cross-validation. We take n = 500, p = 550, α = 20,σ = 1, K = 5. As for train-test validation, we take 80% of samples to be training set and the rest20% be test set. The error bars are the mean and standard deviation over 20 repetitions.

Figure 11: Dual orthogonal sketching with γ = 1.5, λ = 1, α = 3, σ = 1. Left: MSE of dualsketching normalized by the MSE of ridge regression. The standard deviation is over 50 repetitions.

Figure 13: Primal and dual sketch at optimal λ. We take γ = 0.7 and let ξ range between 0.001 and1, where for primal sketch ξ = r/n while for dual sketch ξ = d/p.
