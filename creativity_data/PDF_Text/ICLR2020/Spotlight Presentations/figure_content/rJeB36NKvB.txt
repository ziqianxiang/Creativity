Figure 1: Sample predictions for salient regions for input images (left), and a slightly croppedversion (right). Cropping results in a shift in position rightward of features relative to the centre. Itis notable that this has a significant impact on output and decision of regions deemed salient despiteno explicit position encoding and a modest change to position in the input.
