Figure 1: Number of trees and expressions for different numbers of operators and leaves. p1 and p2correspond to the number of unary and binary operators respectively, and L to the number of possible leaves.
Figure 2: Distribution of input and output lengths for different integration datasets. The FWD generatorproduces short problems with long solutions. Conversely, the BWD generator creates long problems, with shortsolutions. The IBP approach stands in the middle, and generates short problems with short solutions.
