Figure 1: Example programs that illustrate limitations of existing approaches inculding both rule-based static analyzers and neural-based bug predictors.
Figure 2: Code repair as graph transformation. Each step the source code graph is edited via one ofthe operator module until STOP is triggered by controller.
