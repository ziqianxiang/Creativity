Figure 1: An example with H = 3. For this example, We have r(s5) = 1 and r(s) = 0 for all otherstates s. The unique state s5 which satisfies r(s) = 1 is marked as dash in the figure. The inducedQ* function is marked on the edges.
Figure 2: An example with H = 3.
Figure 3: An example with H = 3. Here We define a new MDP by changing r(s5) from its originalvalue 1/3 to 1. This also affects the value of V (s2) and V (s0).
