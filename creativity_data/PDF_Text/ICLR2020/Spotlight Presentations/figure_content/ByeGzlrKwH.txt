Figure 1: Eigenvalue distribution of the covariance matricesNext, We plot the eigenvalues of K(')in Figure 2 for layer c2, c7, c12 and 116. We again observe arapid decrease of the eigenvalues. These results justify our theoretical assumptions.
Figure 2: Singular-value distribution of the weight matrices(d) l16Intrinsic dimensionality Here, we calculate the intrinsic dimensionalities of the VGG-19 net-work. For that purpose, we set a threshold parameter ν ∈ {10-1 , 10-2, 10-3} and compute32Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2020Table 3: The effective ranks rm` and s` in each layer for each threshold ν. “In/Out” indicates thechannel sizes of the input and output.
