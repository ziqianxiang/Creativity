Figure 1: Illustration of the proposed approach (best viewed in color), partially-connected DARTS(PC-DARTS). As an example, we investigate how information is propagated to node #3, i.e., j = 3.
Figure 2: Cells found on CIFAR10 and ImageNet. Searching on ImageNet makes the normal cellmore complex (deeper), although the reduction cell is very similar to that found on CIFAR10.
Figure 3: Search cost and accuracy com-parison between our approach with differentsampling rates, namely, 1/1, 1/2, 1/4 and1/8, among which 1/4 makes a nice tradeoffbetween accuracy and efficiency.
