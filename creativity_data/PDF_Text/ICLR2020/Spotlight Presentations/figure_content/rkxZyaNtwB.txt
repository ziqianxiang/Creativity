Figure 1: Reconstruction of the Lena test image from a sample contaminated with Poisson noise. Left to right:(a) the contaminated sample; (b) CMP reconstruction; (c) RMD reconstruction; and (d) Poisson likelihoodloss at each iteration. The RMD process provides a sharper definition of image features relative to the CMPalgorithm (which is the second-best).
