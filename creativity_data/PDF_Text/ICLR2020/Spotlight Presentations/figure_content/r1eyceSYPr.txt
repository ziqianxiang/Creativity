Figure 1: An illustration of the couplingprocess. {ξt} and {ηt} start from thesame value, and have the same marginaldistribution Mt at each step. The twochains are correlated in such a way thatthe event ξt = ηt-1 occurs with a posi-tive probability for each t. After a ran-dom time τ (τ = 5 in the illustration),{ξt} meets {ηt-1} and they stay identi-cal afterwards.
Figure 2: Left: exact log-likelihood values in each iteration. The shaded bands stand for the 2.5%and 97.5% quantiles across 100 runs, and the three trajectories in darker colors are sample learningcurves in one run. Middle: average stopping time τ for UCD in each iteration. Right: averagenumber of rejected samples in the coupling algorithm for UCD.
