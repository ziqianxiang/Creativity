Figure 1: The perception of realness depends on various aspects. (a) Human-perceived flawless.
Figure 2: Left: real data sampled from the mixture of 9 Gaussian distributions. Right: samplesgenerated by Std-GAN, WGAN-GP, LSGAN, HingeGAN and RealnessGAN.
Figure 3: First row: the results of RealnessGAN when fixing kg = k0 = 1 and increasing thenumber of outcomes. Second row: the results of RealnessGAN when kG is properly increased.
Figure 4: Training curves of different methods in terms of FID and SWD on both CelebA andCIFAR10, where the raise of curves in the later stage indicate mode collapse. Best viewed in color.
Figure 5: Training FID curves of Realness-GAN with and without feature re-sampling.
Figure 6: Samples generated by RealnessGAN trained with the ideal objective (equation 18). Top-row: samples when DKL(A1 kA0) = 11.05. Bottom-row: samples when DKL(A1 kA0) = 33.88.
Figure 7: Training curves of RealnessGANon CelebA using objective2 (equation 19)and objective3 (equation 20).
Figure 8: Images sampled from RealnessGAN, respectively trained on CIFAR10 (top), CelebA (mid-dle) and FFHQ (bottom).
