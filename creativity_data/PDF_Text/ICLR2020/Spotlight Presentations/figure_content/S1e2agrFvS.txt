Figure 1: An illustration of the geometric aggregation scheme. A1-A2 The original graph is mappedto a latent continuous space. B1-B2 The structural neighborhood. All adjacent nodes lie in a smallregion around a center node in B1 for visualization. In B2, the neighborhood in the graph contains alladjacent nodes in graph; the neighborhood in the latent space contains the nodes within the dashedcircle whose radius is ρ. The relational operator τ is illustrated by a colorful 3 × 3 grid where eachunit is corresponding to a geometric relationship to the red target node. C Bi-level aggregation on thestructural neighborhood. Dashed and solid arrows denote the low-level and high-level aggregation,respectively. Blue and green arrows denote the aggregation on the neighborhood in the graph andthe latent space, respectively.
Figure 2: An illustration to distinguish non-isomorphic graphs by proposed structural neighborhood.
Figure 3: (a) Running time comparison. GCN, GAT, and Geom-GCN both run 500 epochs, and yaxis is the log seconds. GCN is the fastest, and GAT and Geom-GCN are on the same level. (b)A visualization for the feature representations of Cora obtained from Geom-GCN-P in a 2-D space.
