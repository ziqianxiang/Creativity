Table 1: Results on SHREC’17 (3D shapes). DeepSphere achieves similar performance at a muchlower cost, suggesting that anisotropic filters are an unnecessary price to pay.
Table 2: Results on the classification of partial convergence maps.
Table 3: Results on climate event segmentation: mean accuracy (over TC, AR, BG) and meanaverage precision (over TC and AR). DeepSphere achieves state-of-the-art performance.
Table 4: Prediction results on data from weather stations. Structure always improves performance.
Table 5: Official metrics from the SHREC’17 object retrieval competition.
Table 6: Results on climate event segmentation: accuracy. Tropical cyclones (TC) and atmosphericrivers (AR) are the two positive classes, against the background (BG). Mudigonda et al. (2017) isnot directly comparable as they don’t use the same input feature maps. Note that a non-weightedcross-entropy loss is not optimal for the accuracy metric.
Table 7: Results on climate event segmentation: average precision. Tropical cyclones (TC) andatmospheric rivers (AR) are the two positive classes. Note that a weighted cross-entropy loss is notoptimal for the average precision metric.
Table 8: Results on climate event segmentation: size and speed.
