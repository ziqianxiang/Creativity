Table 1: Quantitative comparison of different networks in terms of SPC and MAE across differentimage types.
Table 2: Quantitative comparison on the PASCAL-S dataset in terms of SPC and MAE with varying(a) number of layers and (b) kernel sizes. Note that (a) the kernel size is fixed to 3 Ã— 3 but differentnumbers of layers are used in the PosENet. (b) Number of layers is fixed to one but we use differentkernel sizes in the PosENet.
Table 3: Performance of VGG on natural images with a varying extent of the reach of differentfeed-forward blocks.
Table 4: Quantitative comparison subject to padding in the convolution layers used in PosENet andVGG (w/o and with zero padding) on natural images.
Table 5: VGG models with and w/o zero-padding for (a) SOD and (b) semantic segmentation.
Table 6: Comparison of VGG models pretrained for classification, SOD, and semantic segmentation.
