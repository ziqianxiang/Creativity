Table 1: Correlation between word & phrase importance attribution and linear model coefficients &SST-2 human annotations, achieved by baselines and our explanation algorithms.
Table 2: Correlation between averaged word & phrase importance attribution and linear modelcoefficients and human annotations over all 2210 test instances in SST-2 dataset. The relative per-formance is similar to the case without score averaging as shown in Table 1.
Table 3: Phrase-level classification patterns extracted from models. We show the results of SCD andSOC respectively for the SST-2 and the TACRED dataset.
