Table 1: Translation rules (§3) converting tensor operations into operations on NNGP andNTK kernels. Here the input tensor X is assumed to have shape |X | × H × W × C (dataset size,height, width, number of channels), and the full NNGP and NT kernels K and T are considered tobe of shape (|X| × H X W)×2 (in practice shapes of ∣X∣×2 X H X W and ∣X∣×2 are also possible,depending on which optimizations in §3.2 are applicable). Notation details. The Tr, GlobalAvgPool,and GlobalSumPool ops are assumed to act on all spatial axes (with sizes H and W in this example),producing a ∣X∣×2-kernel. Similarly, the AvgPool and SumPool ops is assumed to act on all spatialaxes as well, applying the specified strides s, pooling window sizes p and padding strategy p tothe respective axes pairs in K and T (acting as 4D pooling with replicated parameters of the 2Dversion). T and T are defined identically to Lee et al. (2019) as T (Σ) = E [φ(u)φ(u)T] , T (Σ)=E [φ0(u)φ0(u)T] , u 〜 N (0, Σ). These expressions can be evaluated in closed form for manynonlinearities, and preserve the shape of the kernel. The A op is defined similarly to Novak et al.
