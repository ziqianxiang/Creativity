Table 1: Comparison between CLEVRER and other visual reasoning benchmarks on images and videos.
Table 2: Question-answering accuracy of visual reasoning baselines on CLEVRER. All models are trained onthe full training set. The IEP (V) model and TbD-net (V) use 1000 programs to train the program generator.
Table 3: Quantitative results of NS-DR on CLEVRER. We evaluate our model on all four question types. Wealso study a variation of our model NS-DR (NE) with “no events” but only motion traces from the dynamicspredictor. Our question parser is trained with 1000 programs.
