Table 1: Summary of our proposed reliability metrics. For evaluation during training, whichmeasures reliability over the course of training an algorithm, the inputs to the metrics are theperformance curves of an algorithm, evaluated at regular intervals during a single training run (or ona set of training runs). For evaluation after learning, which measures reliability of an already-trained policy, the inputs to the metrics are the performance scores of a set of rollouts of that fixedpolicy. *IQR: inter-quartile range. *CVaR: conditional value at risk.
