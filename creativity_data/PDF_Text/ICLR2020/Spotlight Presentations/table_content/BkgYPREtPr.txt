Table 1: Testing results of predicting the dynamics of the spring-chain system by methodsbased on fixed p0 , q0 (i.e., not optimizing p0 , q0 as parameters). The error is defined as thediscrepancy between the (noisy) ground truth and the predictions at each time step averagedover the first 200 time steps, where the discrepancy is measured by the L2 distance betweenthe true and predicted positions of the 20 masses in the chain, both of which consideredas 20-dimensional vectors. The mean and standard deviation are computed based on 32testing samples, each starting from a random configuration of the chain.
Table 2: Testing results of predicting the dynamics of the spring-chain system by methodsthat optimize on p0 and q0 starting from their observed (noisy) values using L-BFGS-B, asexplained in the text. The definition of the errors is the same as in the above table.
Table 3: Prediction error results for the three-body system with time-step ∆t = 1. The lastrow corresponds to numerically solving the correct underlying equations using the leapfrogintegrator with time-step ∆t = 1. The other rows correspond to the different learning-basedmethods, same as in the spring-chain experiments.
