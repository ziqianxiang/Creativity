Table 2: Length measurements of limb segments used to construct the virtual rodent model from 7female Long-Evans rats. Measurements were performed using calipers either over the skin or overdissected bones (*). Thoracic and sacral refer to vertebral segments. L and R refer to the left andright sides of the animal’s body.
Table 3: Links to representative visualizations of neural dynamics and behavior19Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2020A.8 Perturbation resultsckun cNumber of NeuronsFigure 12: Causal manipulations reveal distinct roles for core and policy layers in the productionof behavior. (A) Two-tap accuracy during the inactivation of units modulated by idiosyncratic be-haviors within the two-tap sequence. Core inactivation has a weaker negative effect on trial successthan policy inactivation for several levels of inactivation. (B) Representative example of a failedtrial during inactivation of the final policy layer in a model that performs a spinning jump during thetwo-tap sequence. The model is incapable of producing the spinning jump behavior while inacti-vated. (C) Representative example of a failed trial during core inactivation in a model that performsa spinning jump during the two-tap sequence. The model is still able to perform the spinning jumpbehavior, but misses the orb. (D) Proportion of attempts at stimulation that successfully elicited spinbehavior during the two-tap task. The efficacy of this activation was more reliable in layers closerto the motor output. (E) Representative example of a single trial in which an extra spin occurs afterpolicy 2 activation.
