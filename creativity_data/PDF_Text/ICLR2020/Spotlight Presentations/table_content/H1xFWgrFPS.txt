Table 1: The Frechet Inception Distance (FID) score, measuring the quality of the generated explanations forthe three prediction tasks. Lower FID corresponds to better image quality. Top (bottom) row corresponds thetop (bottom) 10% of the decision interval.
Table 2: Identity preServing performance on three prediction taSkS.
Table 3: Confounding metric for biased detection. For target label “Smiling” and “Not-Smiling”, the explana-tions are generated using condition f(x) + δ > 0.9 and f(x) + δ < 0.1 respectively. The Male and Femalevalues quantifies the fraction of the generated explanations classifier as male or female, respectively by oracleclassifier fGender. The overall value quantifies the fraction of the generated explanations who have differentgender as compared to the query image. A small overall value shows least bias.
Table 4: Our model results for six prediction tasks on CelebA dataset. FID (Frechet InceptionDistance) score measures the quality of the generated explanations. Lower FID is better. LSC(Latent Space Closeness) quantifies the fraction of the population where generated explanation isnearest to the query image than any other generated explanation in embedding space. FVA (Faceverification accuracy) measures percentage of the times the query image and generated explanationhave same face identity as per model trained on VGGFace2. Higher LSC and FVA is better.
Table 5: Summarizing the results of human evaluation. The κ -statistics measure inter-rater agree-ment for qualitative classification of items into some mutually exclusive categories. One possibleinterpretation of κ as given in Viera et al. (2005) is < 0.0: Poor, 0.01 - 0.2: Slight, 0.21 - 0.40:Fair, 0.41 - 0.60: Moderate, 0.61 - 0.80: Substantial and 0.81 - 1.00: Almost perfect agreement.
Table 6: Our model with ablation on prediction task of young Vs old on CelebA dataset. FID (FrechetInception Distance) score measures the quality of the generated explanations. Lower FID is better.
