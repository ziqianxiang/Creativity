Table 1: Task completion rate. For each method, we iterate over all the programs in a testing set by randomlysampling ten initial environment states and running three models trained using different random seeds forthis method. The averaged task completion rates and their standard deviations are reported. Note that all theend-to-end learning models learning from natural language descriptions and programs suffer from a significantperformance drop when evaluated on the more complex testing set.
Table 2: Architectural details for end-to-end learning modelsE.5 Raw RGB InputTo verify if our framework can be extended to using high-dimensional raw state inputs (i.e. RGBimage) as inputs where a hand-crafted policy or perception module might not be easy to obtain, weperformed an additional experiment where the perception module and the policy are trained on rawRGB inputs instead of the symbolic state representation. The results suggest that our framework canutilize RGB inputs while maintaining similar performance (93.2% on the test set) and generalizationability (91.4% on the test-complex set).
