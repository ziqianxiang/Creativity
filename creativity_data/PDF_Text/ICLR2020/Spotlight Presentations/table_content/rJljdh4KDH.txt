Table 1: The evaluation results of different loCation models on the validation and test dataset.
Table 2: Comparing performances in different POI groups. We classify all 1,191 POI types into threegroups based on the radius r of their root types, where their renormalized Ripley’s K curve (SeeFigure 1d) reach 3.0: 1) Clustered (r ≤ 100m): POI types with clustered distribution patterns; 2)Middle (100m V r V 200m): POI types with unclear distribution patterns; 3) Even (r2200m):POI types with even distribution patterns. The MRR of wrap and theory on those three groups areshown. The numbers in pq indicate the difference between the MRR of a baseline model and theMRR of theory with respect to a specific group. #POI refers to the total number of POIs belongingto each group. Root Types indicates the root categories of those POI types belong to each group.
Table 3: The evaluation results of different spatial context models on the validation and test dataset.
Table 4: Fine-grained image classification results on two datasets: BirdSnap: and NABirds:. Theclassification accuracy is calculated by combining image classification predictions P py | Iq withdifferent spatial priors Ppy | xq. The grid and theory model use 1 hidden ReLU layers of 512neurons. The evaluation results of the baseline models are from Table 1 of Mac Aodha et al. (2019).
