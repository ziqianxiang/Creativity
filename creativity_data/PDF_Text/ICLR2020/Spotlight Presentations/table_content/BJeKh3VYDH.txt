Table 1: Quantitative results for the different terms of our loss functions, first for our 2D ablation study and thenfor our 3D versions. The first three columns contain spatial, the next four temporal metrics. LN = ∣∣n - n∣∣2 isgiven as a measure of accuracy in terms of the size of the generated outputs (it is not part of the training).
Table 2:	Measurements averaged over 100 frames for a version of our network without temporal loss (“w/o”)and with our full temporal loss formulation (“with”). The left table shows the results for the error evaluation ofthe velocity and the acceleration, whereas in the right table one can see the variance of the density derivatives.
Table 3:	Point counts for the 3D examPles of our video. InPut counts together with outPut counts for Previouswork (P.W.) and our ProPosed network are shown. Factor columns contain increase in Point set size from in- tooutPut. As Previous work cannot handle flexible outPut counts, a fixed number of Points is generated Per Patch,leading to a huge number of redundant Points. However, our network flexibly adaPts the outPut size and leads toa significantly smaller number of generated Points that cover the object or volume more evenly.
