Table 1: Classification accuracy on 6 datasets. The result in bold indicates the best reportedclassification accuracy. The top half of the table compares results with various graph kernel approacheswhile bottom half compares results with other state-of-the-art unsupervised graph representationlearning methods. ‘> 1 day’ represents that the computation exceeds 24 hours. ‘OMR’ is out ofmemory error.
Table 2: Results of semi-supervised experiments on QM9 dataset. The result in bold indicates the bestperformance. The top half of the table shows the mean absolute error (MAE) of the supervised model.
