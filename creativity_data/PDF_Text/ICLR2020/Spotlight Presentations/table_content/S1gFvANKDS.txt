Table 1: Examples of bounds on correlation functions obtained from Conjecture 1. The 3 right-most columns list numerical results for fully-connected networks with 3 hidden layers and withlinear, ReLU, and tanh activations. The values listed in these columns are the fitted exponents fornetworks with the corresponding activations. The entries marked with an asterisk are those for whichthe predicted bound is not tight. The numerical results are obtained by computing the correlationfunctions for networks with widths 27, 28, . . . , 213, each averaged over 1,000 initializations, andfitting the exponent. Inputs are chosen to be random vectors of dimension 4.
Table 2: Examples of bounds on correlation functions obtained from Conjecture 1. The experimentalsetup is the same as in Table 1, but the model parameters are sampled uniformly from {Â±1} insteadof from a Gaussian distribution. We find good agreement with the theoretical predictoins, and inmany cases the bound is tight.
Table 3: Bounds on variances obtained from Lemma 6, where the predicted exponent is 2sC,compared with empirical results. The predicted exponent is 2sC, and the 3 right-most columns listthe empirical exponents. The experimental setup is the same as that of Table 1.
