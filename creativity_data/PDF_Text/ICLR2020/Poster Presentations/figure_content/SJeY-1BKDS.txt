Figure 5: The top 12 bases learned from all 16 × 16 patches of Barbara, both with (b) and without(a) noise. The noisy image is produced by adding Gaussian noise to the clean image, resulting in asignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 5.87. We observed a similar effect when using an 8 × 8 patch size.
Figure 6: The top 12 bases learned from all 8 × 8 × 3 color patches of the clean and noisy image,respectively. Here, the SNR of the noisy image is 6.56.

Figure 10: All 8 X 8 X 3 = 192 bases learned from 100, 000 random 8 X 8 colored patchessampled from the CIFAR-10 data-set. (a) Learned Bases from clean CIFAR-10; (b) Learned Basesfrom CIFAR-10 with Gaussian noise, SNR = 6.23; (c) Learned Bases from CIFAR-10 with 20%of Gaussian outliers; (d) Learned Bases from CIFAR-10 with 50% of sparse corruptions. For alllearned bases, the resulting atoms are sorted according to the '1 -norm of their coefficients in thesparse code.
