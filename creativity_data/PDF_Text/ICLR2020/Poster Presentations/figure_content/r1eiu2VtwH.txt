Figure 1: The single ODT inside the NODE layer. The splitting features and the splitting thresholdsare shared across all the internal nodes of the same depth. The output is a sum of leaf responsesscaled by the choice weights.
Figure 2: The NODE architecture, consisting of densely connected NODE layers. Each layer con-tains several trees whose outputs are concatenated and serve as input for the subsequent layer. Thefinal prediction is obtained by averaging the outputs of all trees from all the layers.
Figure 3: NODE on UCI Higgs dataset: Left-Top: individual feature importance distributions forboth original and learned features. Left-Bottom: mean absolute contribution of individual trees tothe final response. Right: responses dependence on feature importances. See details in the text.
