Figure 1: The full KG-A2C architecture. Solid lines represent computation flow along which thegradient can be back-propagated.
Figure 2: An overall example of the knowledge graph building and subsequent action decodingprocess for a given state in Zork1, illustrating the use of interactive objects and the graph mask.
Figure 3: Ablation results on Zork1, averaged across 5 independent runs.
Figure 4: Learning curves for KGA2C-full. Shaded regions indicate standard deviations.
Figure 5: A map of the world of Zork1 with some initial rewards annotated. The blue arrow indicatesa connection between the left and right maps, corresponding to the overworld and the dungeon.
