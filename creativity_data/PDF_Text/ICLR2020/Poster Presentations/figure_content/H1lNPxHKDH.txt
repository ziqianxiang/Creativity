Figure 1: Radon transform. (a) Illustration of the Radon transform in equation (14) in dimension d = 2. Thered line of points x satisfying w>x = b defines the domain of the integral over f (x), where w determines theline orientation (angle relative to the coordinate axes) and b determines its offset from the origin. (b) Illustrationof the support of the Radon transform for f (x) = δ(x - (-1, -1)) (red), f (x) = δ(x - (1, 0)) (green), andf(x) = δ(x - (0, 1)) (blue). If a function f is a superposition of such δ functions, then R{f} is the sum of thecurves in (b); this is typically referred to as a “sinogram”. Furthermore, the dual Radon transform in equation(15) integrates any function φ(w, b) over all curves like one of the three in (b).
