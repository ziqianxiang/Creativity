Figure 1: Chemical and social (with degree) benchmark results are shown together with publishedresults (when available). For each of them, we report validation and test accuracies of the evaluatedmodels, together with published results if available.
Figure 2: We give a visual representation of the evaluation framework. We apply an external kout -fold CV to get an estimate of the generalization performance of a model, and we use an hold-outtechnique (bottom-left) to select the best hyper-parametres. For completeness, we show that it is alsopossible to apply an inner kinn-fold CV (implementing a complete Nested Cross Validation), whichobviously amounts to multiplying the computational costs of model selection by a factor kinn .
