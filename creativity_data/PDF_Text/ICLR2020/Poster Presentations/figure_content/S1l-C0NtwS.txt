Figure 1: PCA visualization of English and Spanish embeddings learnt by unsupervised joint train-ing as in Lample et al. (2018b). As shown by plots (a) and (b), most words are shared in the initialembedding space but not well-aligned, hence the oversharing problem. Plots (b) and (c) shows thatthe vocabulary reallocation step effectively mitigates oversharing while the alignment refinementstep further improves the poorly aligned embeddings by projecting them into a close neighborhood.
Figure 2: (a)(b): Results on MT of Align, Joint and our framework for the first 20 trainingepochs. Results after 20 epochs have similar patterns. (c): BLEU scores for the MT task. Resultsevaluated on the WMT’14 English-French and WMT’16 German-English. All training settings arethe same for each language pair except the embedding initialization. Note that we are not trying tooutperform state-of-the-art methods (Song et al., 2019) but rather to observe improvements affordedby embedding initialization. * Results reported by LamPle et al. (2018b). Our results are obtainedusing the official code released by the author. + Duong et al. (2016) is a supervised method that Weinclude for analysis purpose only and is not directly comparable to other results in this table.
