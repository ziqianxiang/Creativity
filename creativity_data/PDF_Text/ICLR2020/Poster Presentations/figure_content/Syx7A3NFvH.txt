Figure 1: Forward propagations of NeurComm enabled MARL, illustrated in a queueing system. (a)Single-step forward propagations inside agent i. Different colored boxes and arrows show differentoutputs and functions, respectively. Solid and dashed arrows indicate actor and critic propagations,respectively. (b) Multi-step forward propagations for updating the belief of agent i.
Figure 2: ATSC scenarios for NMARL. (a) Synthetic traffic grid, with major and minor traffic flowsshown in solid and dotted arrows. (b) Simulated time-variant traffic flows within the traffic grid. (c)Monaco traffic network, with traffic flow collections shown in colored arrows.
Figure 3: Sensitivity and ablation study of spatial discount factor (top) and NeurComm (bottom). Thebest learning curves are in bold.
Figure 4: Training performance comparison after tuned spatial discount factors.
Figure 5: Execution performance comparison among top policies in ATSC scenarios, measured asaverage queue length and average intersection delay over time.
Figure 6: Headway and velocity profiles of the first and last vehicles of the platoon, controlled by topcommunicative and non-communicative policies in execution.
Figure 7: Possible signal phases at each intersection.
Figure 8: Screenshots of traffic distribution in the grid. Each row is a non-communicative MARLcontroller and each column is a simulation step. The traffic condition along each lane is visualized asa line segment, with the color indicating the queue length or congestion level (grey: 0% traffic, green:25% traffic, yellow: 50% traffic, orange: 70% traffic, red: 90% traffic, intermediate traffic conditionis shown as the interpolated color), while the thickness indicating the intersection delay (the thickerthe longer waiting time at intersection).
