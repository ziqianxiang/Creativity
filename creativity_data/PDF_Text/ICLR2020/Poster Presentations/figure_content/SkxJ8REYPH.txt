Figure 1: Illustration of one outeriteration in the slow momentumframework for m = 3 workers.
Figure 2: Validation curves for various tasks using SGP as the base algorithm. We fix α = 1, τ = 12for these three plots. Shaded areas in (a) and (b) show the min-max values across all worker nodes.
Figure 3: The effects of τ in SlowMo. We use SGP as the base algorithm. For ImageNet weplot validation accuracy (higher is better), and for WMT’16 En-De we plot validation NLL (loweris better). Increasing τ amortizes communication cost over more iterations, so the average time periteration decreases. We hypothesize that moderate values of τ have a regularizing effect, improvingloss and accuracy, and when τ is too large performance is degraded because workers’ local modelsdrift too far apart.
