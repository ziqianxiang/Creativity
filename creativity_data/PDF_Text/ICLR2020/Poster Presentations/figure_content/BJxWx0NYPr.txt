Figure 1: Detailed graph structures provide important guidance in determining node attention.
Figure 2: Structural fingerprint for a given node i, denoted by Fi = (Vi , wi), where Vi is the set ofnodes in this local receptive field and wi is the contributing weights of the nodes.
Figure 3: Weights wi of a toy structural fingerprint. Left: the local subgraph/fingerprint; middle:visualization of the weights; right: contours of the weights. Gaussian decay and RWR(randomwalk with restart) decay leads to different weight contours, the latter more adaptively adjusting theweights to structural details of the local graph.
