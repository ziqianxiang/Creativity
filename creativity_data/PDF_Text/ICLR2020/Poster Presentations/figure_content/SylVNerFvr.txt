Figure 1: (a) Commutative diagram for equivariance. (b) Local equivariance enables generalization to verbreplacement in SCAN. (c) Local equivariance does not enable generalization to conjunction replacement inSCAN.
Figure 2: Architecture of our fully-equivariant seq2seq model. Variables shaded in gray are mappings G → RK,implemented as |G| × K matrices. Encoder and decoder meet at ho := hLx.
Figure 3:	The grammar used to generate commands in the SCAN domain. Indexing notation is used to allowinfixing: read D [i] as “the i-th element directly dominated by category D”. Image borrowed from Lake &Baroni (2018).
Figure 4:	The SCAN translation mapping. Double brackets denote the interpretation function translating SCAN’scommand (input language) into the action (output) language (which are denoted by upper-case strings. Imageborrowed from Lake & Baroni (2018).
