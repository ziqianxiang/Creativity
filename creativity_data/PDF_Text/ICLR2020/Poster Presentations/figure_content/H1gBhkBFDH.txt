Figure 1: In G-CNNs feature maps are lifted to the high-dimensional domain of the group Gin which features are disentangled with respect to pose/transformation parameters. G-convolutionkernels then learn to recognize high-level features in terms of patterns of relative transformations,described by the group structure. This is conceptually illustrated for the detection of faces, which inthe SE(2) case are considered as a pattern of lines in relative positions and orientations, or in theR2 o R+ case as blobs/circles in relative positions and scales.
Figure 2: The Log-map allows us tomap elements from curved manifoldssuch as the 2-sphere to a flat Euclideantangent space. For Lie groups the Log-map is analytic, globally defined, andit provides us with a flexible tool to de-fine group convolution kernels via B-splines. In our Lie group context the2-sphere is treated as a quotient groupSO(3)/SO(2). Technical details aregiven in Sec. 3 and App. B.
Figure 3: Left: The sum of all B-spline basis functions add up to one, illustrating partition of unityon the 2D rotation group SO(2) (row 1), SCaling/dilation group (R+, ∙) (row 2), and the sphere S2treated as the quotient group SO(3)/SO(2), with B-spline centers indicated with green dots (row3-5). Right: A random B-SPline on SO(2) (row 1) and (R+, ∙) (row 2) and reconstruction of a colortexture on the sphere S2 at several sCales (row 3-5) to illustrate multi-sCale properties.
Figure 4: A B-Spline on R2(row 1), sampled on a grid(row 2), and a B-spline onthe sphere (row 3). Fromleft to right: a localized ker-nel, scaled kernel by increas-ing sx and sh , atrous kernel,deformable kernel. A greencircle is drawn around each B-spline center with radius 2 sxor 2 sh to indicate the individ-ual basis functions.
