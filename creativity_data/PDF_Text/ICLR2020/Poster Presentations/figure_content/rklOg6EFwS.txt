Figure 1: The distinctive influence of misclassified examples (S-) versus correctly classified ones(S+) on the robustness of adversarial training. We test the white-box robustness of different strategieson either subset of examples: (a) using them directly for training (“not perturb”); (b) using weak attack(FGSM) in the inner maximization; and (c) using “regularized CE” loss in the outer minimization.
Figure 2: The comprehensive ablation experiments of MART. In each plot, the dashed blue linerepresents the original MART method.
