Figure 1: Left: Classification error for our method and DAGMM as a function of percentage ofthe anomalous examples in the training set (on the KDDCUP99 dataset). Our method consistentlyoutperforms the baseline. Right: Classification error as a function of the number of transforma-tions (on the KDDRev dataset). The error and instability decrease as a function of the number oftransformations. For both, lower is better.
Figure 2: Plots of the number of auxiliary tasks vs. the anomaly detection accuracy (measured byF1 ) a) Arrhythmia b) Thyroid c) KDDRev d) KDDCup99 Accuracy often increases with the numberof tasks, although the rate diminishes with the number of tasks.
