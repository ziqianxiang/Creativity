Figure 1: Overview of the fused static/dynamic graph representation.
Figure 2: Two examples where syntactically different but semantically equivalent source code iscompiled to the same assembly. Corresponding sections of source/assembly are colored the same.
Figure 4: Evaluation of the branch-prediction task (lower is better).
Figure 5: Evaluation of the prefetching task (higher is better).
