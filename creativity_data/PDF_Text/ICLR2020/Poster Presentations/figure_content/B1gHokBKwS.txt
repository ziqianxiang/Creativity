Figure 1: Average reward vs. number of episodes for MUJoCo locomotion tasks. In each condition,We perform 5 runs with different random seeds. Shaded areas represent 1 standard deviation. Thegrey horizontal line indicates the prescribed threshold at which the task is considered ‘solved’.
Figure 2: Average reward vs. wall-clock time for MuJoCo locomotion tasks. In each condition, Weperform 5 runs with different random seeds. Shaded areas represent 1 standard deviation. The greyhorizontal line indicates the prescribed threshold at which the task is considered ‘solved,. Measure-ments are performed on Intel Xeon E7-8890 v3 processors and Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Ti GPUs.
Figure 3: Manifold learning accuracy. We plotT P= kVxf(xt) - PJq(χt,θt)(Vχf (xt))k2. Inorder to estimate the gradient, we use GradEstwith a high number of directions.
