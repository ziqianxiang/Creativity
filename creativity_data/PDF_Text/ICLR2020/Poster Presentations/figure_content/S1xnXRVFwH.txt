Figure 1: Performance of winning ticket initializations for LSTM models trained on Wikitext-2.
Figure 2: Winning ticket initialization performance for Transformer Base models trained on machine translation.
Figure 3: Winning ticket initialization performance for Transformer Big models trained on machine translation.
Figure 4:	Winning ticket performance on classic control games. Each curve plots the mean ± standard deviationof three independent iterative pruning processes for each game.
Figure 5:	Reward curves of WTs (blue) and RTs (red) on Atari. Shaded error bars represent mean ± standarddeviation across runs and the gray curve represents performance of the unpruned network.
Figure 6:	Ablation studies of several classic control games on the effects of late rewinding and iterative pruning.
Figure 7:	Ablation studies of several pixel control games on the effects of iterative pruning. Shaded error barsrepresent mean ± standard deviation across runs and the gray curve represents performance of the unprunednetwork. “lr” means late-resetting.
