Figure 1: The average losses for Inc-v3, Inc-v4, IncRes-v2 and Res-101 at each scale size. Theresults are averaged over 1000 images.
Figure 2: Attack success rates (%) of NI-FGSM and MI-FGSM on various number of itera-tions. The adversarial examples are crafted on Inc-v3 model against (a) Inc-v3 model, (b) Inc-v4model and (c) IncRes-v2 model.
