Figure 1: Comparisons between ReLU neural networks and linear neural networks in terms of localelasticity. In the left column, the red points form one class and the blue points form the other class.
Figure 2: An illustration of linear regression and neural networks updated via SGD. The predictionof x0 changes a lot after an SGD update on X in the linear case, though x0 is far away from x. Incontrast, the change in the prediction at x0 is rather small in the neural networks case.

Figure 4: More simulations of the local elasticity.
Figure 5: Simulations in real data. We show specific examples for a tabby cat, a tiger cat and awarplane.
Figure 6: Simulations showing local elasticity with mini-batch SGD.
