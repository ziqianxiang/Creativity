Figure 1: (Left) Input image from Cityscapes dataset (CordtS et al., 2016), With selected regions by our methodto be labeled. (Right) Retrieved ground truth annotation for the selected regions. Our method focuses on smallobjects and under-represented classes, such as bicycles, pedestrians and poles. Best viewed in color.
Figure 2: The query network π is trained during several episodes e with MDP transitions {(st, at, rt+1, st+1)}.
Figure 4: Performance of several methods with increasing active learning budget, expressed as the number of128×128 pixel regions labeled and the % of additional labeled data. All methods have been pretrained withGTAV and a small subset of their target datasets. Budget indicates additional number of regions labeled (and thepercentage of unlabeled data used). The dashed line represents the 96% of the total performance achieved bythe segmentation network with fully-supervised training (having access to all labels). We report the mean andstandard deviation of 5 runs.
