Figure 1: Illustration of the RBS transformation for k = 3. For a better understanding on the RBStransformation, we paint the split image blocks with different colors.
Figure 2: Ablation studies for RLFATP and RLFATT to investigate the impact of Robust LocalFeature Learning (RLFL) and Robust Local Feature Transfer (RLFT).
Figure 3: Salience maps of the four models on sampled images. For each group of images, we havethe original image, and the salience maps of the four models sequentially.
Figure 4: More Salience maps of the four models. For each group of images, we have the originalimage, and the salience maps of the four models sequentially.
