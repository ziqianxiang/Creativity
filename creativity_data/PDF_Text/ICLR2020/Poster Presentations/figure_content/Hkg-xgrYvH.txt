Figure 1: (a) The generative and inference processes of the empirical Bayes model are depicted insolid and dashed arrows respectively, where the meta-parameters are denoted by dashed circles dueto the point estimates. A comparison between MAML (6) and our method (SIB) (10) is shown in (b)and (c). MAML is an inductive method since, for a task t, it first constructs the variational posterior(with parameter θK) as a function of the support set dlt, and then test on the unlabeled xt; while SIBuses a better variational posterior as a function of both dlt and xt : it starts from an initialization θt0 (dlt)generated using dlt , and then yields θtK by running K synthetic gradient steps on xt .
Figure 2: The computation graph to compute the negative ELBO, where the input and output of thesynthetic gradient module are highlighted in red. The detach() is used to stop the back-propagationdown to the feature network. Note that We do not include every computation for simplicity.
