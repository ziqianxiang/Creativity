Figure 1: Objects from the T-LESSdataset and the corresponding orienta-tion uncertainty predicted by the modeltrained on the newly proposed Binghamloss, which is capable of capturing rota-tional symmetries.
Figure 2: Densities of the Bingham distribution represented for different dimensionality. For thecircular case (a), the density is shown as a function of unit vectors on the plane. For the sphericalcase (b), it is shown as a heatmap on a 3d unit sphere. For the 4d case (c), which is of our particularinterest, we visualize the mode of the Bingham in terms of the coordinate system orientation repre-sented by the corresponding quaternion. Then, we draw samples from the distribution and visualizeeach sample as a potential coordinate arrow endpoint for each axis (i.e. each sample drawn fromthe Bingham distribution is represented by three points in the plot). This representation allows us tosimultaneously represent the orientation and the corresponding uncertainty.
Figure 3: The proposed orientation uncertainty estimation pipeline predicts the parameters of aBingham distribution for representing uncertain unit quaternions. Backpropagation through an in-terpolator and use of a lookup table allows for avoiding evaluations of the computationally expensiveBingham normalization constant.
