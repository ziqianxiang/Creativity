Figure 1: With DeFINE, Transformer-XL learns input (embedding) and output (classification) rep-resentations in low n-dimensional space rather than high m-dimensional space, thus reducing pa-rameters significantly while having a minimal impact on the performance.

Here, N is thetotal number of layers, nl and kl are the input and output dimensions of l-th layer, gl is the numberof groups in l-th layer, and g is the fixed number of groups in group linear transforms.
