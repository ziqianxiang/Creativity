Figure 1: Illustration of the SPACE model. SPACE consists of a foreground module and a background module.
Figure 2: Qualitative comparison between SPACE , SPAIR, SPAIR-P, IODINE and GENESIS for the 3D-Room dataset.
Figure 3: Qualitative comparison between SPACE , SPAIR, IODINE and GENESIS for Space Invaders, AirRaid, and River Raid.
Figure 4: Qualitative demonstration of SPACE trained jointly on a selection of 10 Atari games. We show 6games with complex background here.
Figure 5: Quantitative performance comparison between SPACE , SPAIR, IODINE and GENESIS in termsof batch-processing time during training, training convergence and converged pixel MSE. Convergence plotsshowing pixel-MSE were computed on a held-out set during training.
