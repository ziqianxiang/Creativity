Figure 1: CIFAR10 plots (a) showing the information plane, as well as β vs (b) I(X; Z) and I(Y ; Z),and (c) accuracy, all on the training set with 20% label noise. The arrows point to empirically-observedphase transitions. The vertical lines correspond to phase transitions found with Alg. 1.
Figure 2: (a) I(Y; Z*) vs. β for a categorical dataset with |X| = |Y| = |Z| = 3, where Z* is givenby p*β(z|x), and the vertical lines are the experimentally discovered phase transition points β0 and βf.
Figure 3: (a) Path of Alg. 1 starting with β = 1, where the maximum likelihood model fθ is usingthe same encoder architecture as in the CEB model. This stairstep path shows that Alg. 1 is able toignore very large regions of β, while quickly and precisely finding the phase transition points. Alsoplotted is an accumulation of G[p*β(z∖x)] vs. β by running Alg. 1 with varying starting β (blue dots).

Figure 5:	p(y|x) for the categorical dataset in Fig. 2 and Fig. 6. The value in ith row and jth columndenotes p(y = j |x = i). p(x) is uniform.
Figure 6:	(a) I(Y ; Z) vs. β for the dataset given in Fig. 5. The phase transitions are marked withvertical dashed line, with β0 = 2.065571 and βC = 5.623333. (b)-(e) Optimal pβ(z∣x) for fourvalues of β, i.e. (b) β = 2.060, (c) β = 2.070, (d) β = 5.620 (e) β = 5.625 (their β values are alsomarked in (a)), where each marker denotes p(z|x = i) for a given i ∈ {0, 1, 2}.
