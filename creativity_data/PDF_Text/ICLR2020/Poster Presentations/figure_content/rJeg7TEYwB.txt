Figure 1: Illustration of the same pGST applied to different graph datasets. Notice that for the socialnetwork (a) most of GST branches are pruned, suggesting that most information is captured by localinteractions.
Figure 2: Scattering pattern associated with a pGST with J = 3 and L = 3. The dashed linesrepresent the pruned branches. The example of a graph signal and the GFTs of x and the filter banksare included as well. Note that the third filter j = 3 at ` = 1 generates no output, i.e. z(3) = 0, andhence is pruned.
