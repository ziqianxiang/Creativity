Figure 1: FID of simple particle generators with various learning rates. The horizontal axis showsthe ratio γ∕γo between the actual learning rate Y and the theoretical learning rate γo suggested byTheorem 1 and Proposition 1. The vertical axis shows the FID after 100,000 SGD iterations.
Figure 2: Illustration of inf-convolutions and their convex conjugates in R. Top row: Generally,inf-convolutions inherit the regularity of their parent functions. In this example, J1(x) = |x| is1-Lipschitz but not smooth, while J2(x) = x2/2 is 1-smooth but not Lipschitz. The inf-convolutionJi ㊉ J2 is the well-known HUber function, which is both I-LiPschitz and 1-smooth. Bottom row:Convex conjugates of the functions in the top row. The conjugate of J ㊉ J2 is given as the sum ofconjugates J?(Z) = χ{∣z∣ ≤ 1} and J?(Z) = z2∕2.
