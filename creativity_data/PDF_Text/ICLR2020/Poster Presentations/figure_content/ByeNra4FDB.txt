Figure 1: Test loss of VQ-VAE (left) and RND (middle) on original image and blurred image(K “ 28) of CIFAR-10 data. RND assigns higher confidence to blurred image and OOD datathroughout the training process (right).

Figure 3: Left: Performance of SVD-RND (proposed) for different K1 in CIFAR-10 : (SVHN,LSUN, TinyImageNet) domains. Each filled region is the 95% confidence interval of the detector.
Figure 4: Left: Novelty detection performance (TNR at 95% TPR) of SVD-RND and RND onreduced CIFAR-10 training data. SVD-RND is robust to reduced training data while RND’s detectionperformance decreases. Middle: Top-9 anomalous CIFAR-10 test samples detected by SVD-RND.
Figure 5:	Sample visualization on the best performing parameters of SVD-RND, DCT-RND, andGB-RND. (a): original CIFAR-10 sample. (b), (c): sample after SVD-RND. (d), (e): sample afterDCT-RND. (f), (g): sample after GB-RND.
Figure 6:	Extended version of Figure 3 (left). When we discard small nonzero eigenvalues for theblurred images, SVD-RND fails to discriminate between original and blurred images.
