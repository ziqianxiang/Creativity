Figure 1: A sparse scattering network is composed of a scattering transform S followed by anoptional linear operator L that reduces its dimensionality. A sparse code approximation of scatteringcoefficients is computed in a dictionary D . The dictionary D and the classifier are jointly learnedby minimizing the classification loss with stochastic gradient descent.
Figure 2: A generalized ISTC network computes a positive `1 sparse code in a dictionary D byusing an auxiliary matrix W. Each layer applies Id - WtD together with a ReLU and a bias λn tocompute αn from αn-1 in (6). The original ISTC algorithm corresponds to W = D.
Figure 3: Two variants of the image classification architecture: one where the input for the classifieris the sparse code α, and the other where the reconstruction Dα is the input for the classifier.
Figure 4: Value of L(αn) = 2 ∣∣Dαn - βk2 + λ* ∣∣ɑnkι versus the number of iterations n, for ISTCwith W = D, ISTA and FISTA on the left, and for ISTC with W 6= D, ISTA and FISTA on theright.
