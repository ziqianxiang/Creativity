Figure 1: Left: The proposed real-to-binary block. The diagram shows how spatial attention mapscomputed from a teacher real-valued network are matched with the ones computed from the binarynetwork. Supervision is injected at the end of each binary block. See also section 4.2. Right: Theproposed data-driven channel re-scaling approach. The left-hand side branch corresponds to thestandard binary convolution module. The right-hand side branch corresponds to the proposed gatingfunction that computes the channel-scaling factors from the output of the batch normalization. Thefactor r controls the compression ratio on the gating function, and H, W and C indicate the twospatial and the channel dimensions of the activation tensors. See also section 4.3.
