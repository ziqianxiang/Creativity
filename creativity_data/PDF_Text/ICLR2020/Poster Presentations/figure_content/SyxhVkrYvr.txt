Figure 1: Example of under-sensitive behaviour in Natural Language Inference, where deletingpremise words increases model confidence. This problem was identified by Feng et al. (2018); ouraim is to formally verify whether or not any such reductions exist, over the combinatorially largespace of possibilities.
Figure 2: Under-sensitivity: This figure maps dataset percentiles against the proportion of wordsone can delete before DAM prediction confidence decreases, where reduced samples are found usingbeam search.
