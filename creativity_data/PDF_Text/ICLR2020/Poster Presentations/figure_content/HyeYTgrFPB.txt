Figure 1: Comparison of the accuracies over the 15 languages of the XNLI datasets.
Figure 2: The sparsity structure of the learned representations for the languages covered in themultilingual QVEC-CCA evaluation as a function of the frequency of word forms. Plots also includethe frequency-binned average norms of the dense input embeddings. The orange curve indicates thenorms of the embeddings per frequency bins, the blue are for the number of nonzero coefficients perword forms.
