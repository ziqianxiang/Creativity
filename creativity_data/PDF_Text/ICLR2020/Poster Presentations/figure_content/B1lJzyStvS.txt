Figure 1: Aggregate energy signal and people(d) Location data for two people(top-down view)s indoor location datato new homes (Kelly & Knottenbelt, 2015; Bonfigli et al., 2018). This is because two appliances ofthe same type (e.g. coffee machine) in different homes are often manufactured by different brands,and thus have different power signatures.
Figure 2: Model architecture. The model learns to encode energy sig-nals into event vectors while learning to predict the concurrent locationdata. The location predictor Le is conditioned on the energy eventzt,cat , and Lg is conditioned on context features. The decoder D takesevent vectors and learns to reconstruct the original energy signal.
Figure 3: Total energysignal (top) and locationinformation (bottom) asseen by the modelLocation predictors We try to predict the location data conditioned on the appliance event, i.e.
