Figure 1: Subgraph visualization on two examples from NELL995’s test data. Each task has tenthousands of nodes and edges. The big yellow represents a given head and the big red represents apredicted tail. Color indicates attention gained along T -step reasoning. Yellow means more attentionduring early steps while red means more attention at the end. Grey means less attention.
