Figure 1: Number of relative synaptic operations during backpropagation for different error scalingfactors α as a function of the epoch. Numbers are based on activation values of the equivalent integeractivation ANN. Test performance with error is given for each α. (a) MNIST. (b) CIFAR10.
Figure 2: Number of relative synaptic operations during backpropagation in each layer (connectionsin direction of backpropagation) for different epochs. Numbers are based on activation values of theequivalent integer activation ANN. (a) MNIST with α = 100. (b) CIFAR10 with α = 500.
