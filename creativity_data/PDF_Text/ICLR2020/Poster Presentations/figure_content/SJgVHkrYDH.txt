Figure 1: An example of open-domain multi-hop question from HotpotQA. Paragraph 2 is unlikelyto be retrieved using TF-IDF retrievers due to little lexical overlap to the given question.
Figure 2: Overview of our framework.
Figure 3: Reasoning examples by our model (twoparagraphs connected by a dotted line) and Re-rank(the bottom two paragraphs). Highlighted text de-notes a bridge entity, and blue-underlined text rep-resents hyperlinks.
Figure 4: Reasoning examples by our re-triever (the bottom paragraph) and our reader(two paragraphs connected by a dotted line).
Figure 5: Robustness to the increase of F. We compare the F1 scores of our model, our modelwithout a beam search and Re-rank with different number of F .
