Figure 1: From left to right are the comparisons of various methods in terms of gradient variance,number of sequence rollouts, training Generalization score, and validation Generalization score.
Figure 2: Main and pseudo trajectories for image captioning.
Figure 3: Comparison of different gradient estimators for image captioning task. “RF” denotes REINFORCEand “SC” denotes Self-Critic. Upper (lower) row: models using a regular softmax (binary-tree softmax).
Figure 4: Adaptiveness of MC rollouts with BT-ARSM/ARS-K.
