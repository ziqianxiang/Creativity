Figure 1: A selection of images from the ImageNet dataset and the compression ratesachieved on the dataset by PNG, WebP, FLIF, Bit-Swap and the HiLLoC codec (withResNet VAE) presented in this work.
Figure 2: Visualizing the process of pushing images and latents from a VAE to the vec-torized ANS stack with Craystack. The ANS stack head is shaped such that images andlatents can be pushed and popped in parallel, without reshaping. Beneath the shaped top ofthe stack is the flat message stream output by ANS.
Figure 3: Graphical models representing the generative and inference models with HiLLoCand Bit-Swap, both using a 3 layer latent hierarchy. The dashed lines indicate dependenceon the fixed observation.
Figure 4: Runtime of vectorized vs. serial ANS implementations. Times were computed ona desktop with 6 CPU cores and a GTX 1060 GPU.
