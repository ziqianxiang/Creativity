Figure 1: A food web example showing two disconnected components - the boreal forest (Stenseth et al.,1997) and the antarctic fauna (Bates et al., 2015). The positional node embedding of the lynx and the orca canbe different while their structural representation must be the same (due to the isomorphism).

Figure 3: (Best in color) Food web graph of Figure 1 with node colors that map a two dimensionalrepresentation from a 1-WL GNN (GIN - (Xu et al., 2018)) into the [0, 255] interval of blue and redintensity of RGB colors respectively. GIN is used a representative of structural representation ofnodes. Structurally isomorphic nodes, obtain the same representation and are hence end up beingvisualised with the same color. Consequently, itis clear why structural node representations are usedfor node and graph classification, but not for link prediction.
Figure 4: (Best in color) Food web graph of Figure 1 with node colors that map the values of thetwo leading (SVD) eigenvectors over the undirected graph into the [0, 255] interval of blue and redintensity of RGB colors, respectively. SVD (run until convergence) is used as a representative ofpositional node embedding methods. The graph is made undirected, otherwise the left and righteigenvectors will be different and harder to represent visually. Note that nodes which are a part ofthe same connected component, obtain embeddings which are close in latent space, visually shownas similar colors. Consequently, it is clear that positional node embeddings can be used for linkprediction and clustering.
