Figure 1: Comparison of top-performing models from all model families across a comparable pa-rameter domain of 1.5M - 5M parameters. Performance visualized using the localization (left) andrepair (right) accuracy Pareto fronts w.r.t. both training time (top) and number of training samplesseen (bottom), both log-scaled, where an epoch is ca. 2M samples. In all cases, our proposed modelssubstantially outperform GGNNs from early in the training process.
Figure 2: Comparison of smaller (1.5-5M parameter) and larger (5-20M parameter, identified with‘++’) variants of each model family. Localization and repair accuracy Pareto-front w.r.t. time.
Figure 3: Comparing impact of graph representation on GGNNs and RNN Sandwich models. Lo-calization and repair accuracy Pareto-front w.r.t time. Note: y-axis cropped to simplify comparison.
Figure 4: Comparison of RNN sandwiches with a single RNN vs. those with RNNs around everymessage-passing block (‘Multi’). Localization and repair accuracy Pareto-front w.r.t. time.
