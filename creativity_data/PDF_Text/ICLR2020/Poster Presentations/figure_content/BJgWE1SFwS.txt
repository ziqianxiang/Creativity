Figure 2: Preference for a over b for different attributes (coordinates of each pixel) of the thirdalternative c. Lighter shades indicate higher preference for a. Models were trained on 20000 choicesets. In Fig. (i), the points cA , cS and cC show examples of, respectively, attraction, similarity andcompromise effects with respect to a.
