Figure 1: Flowchart for probabilistic connection inference. We have two nodes a and β from a fullyconnected neural network. The connection of α and β is expressed as ηα,β + ηα,β,y. The importanceof the connection is inferred by testing whether the three way interaction ηα,β,y is zero or not.
Figure 2: Flowchart for probabilistic connection inference for convolutional layers. Without lossgenerality, we use same notation of α and β to denote two channels from a convolutional neuralnetwork. The connection between α and β is corresponding to the convolutional operator ht1,,tm+t1+1(shown as one slice with the red border). The importance of this connection is inferred by testingwhether the three way interaction ηα,β,y is zero or not.
Figure 3: The heatmap showing the PLR test result of the 784 × 300 connections between the inputlayer and the first FC layer in Lenet-300-100. Each pixel represents a p-value of the correspondingpair. The brighter color representing a smaller p-value. The width and height of the heatmapcorrespond to the input dimension (784) and the size (300) of the first FC layer.
