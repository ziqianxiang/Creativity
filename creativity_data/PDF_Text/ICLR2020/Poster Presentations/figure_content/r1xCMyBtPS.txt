Figure 1: t-SNE (Maaten & Hinton, 2008) visualization of the embedding space of multilingualBERT for English-German word pairs (left: pre-alignment, right: post-alignment). Each point is adifferent instance of the word in the Europarl corpus. This figure suggests that BERT begins alreadysomewhat aligned out-of-the-box but becomes much more aligned after our proposed procedure.
Figure 2: XNLI zero-shot versus word re-trieval accuracy for base BERT, where eachpoint is a language paired with English.
Figure 3: Contextual word retrieval accuracy plottedagainst difference in frequency rank between sourceand target. The accuracy of base BERT plummets forlarger differences, suggesting that its alignment de-pends on word pairs having similar usage statistics.
