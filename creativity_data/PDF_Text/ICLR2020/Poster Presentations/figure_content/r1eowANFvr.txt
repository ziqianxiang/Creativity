Figure 1: Left: how to search the network architecture when given a new task? Middle: two Sim-ple solutions that are inefficient or not optimal. Right: we propose T-NAS method to get a meta-architecture, which is able to adapt to different tasks easily and quickly.
Figure 2: Architecture (θnormal, θreduce) searched with Auto-MAML (left), meta-arChiteCturet t(θnormal,θreduce) searched With T-NAS (middle), and the transferred architecture (θnnormal, θrteduce)for the specific task T (right). The experiments are conducted in 5-way, 5-shot setting of Mini-Imagenet.

Figure 3: Architecture searched with Auto-MAML in 5-way 1-shot setting of Mini-imagenet.
Figure 5: Meta-architecture matrix (θnormal , θreduce) searched with T-NAS and three task-specificarchitecture matrices (θni ormal, θrieduce). The search experiments are conducted in 5-way, 5-shotsetting of Mini-Imagenet dataset.
