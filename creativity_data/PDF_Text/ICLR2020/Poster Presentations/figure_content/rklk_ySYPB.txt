Figure 1: Visualization of the 12-ball contained in the union resp. the convex hull of theunion of 11 - and l∞-balls in R3. First column: co-centric 11 -ball (blue) and l∞-ball (black).
Figure 2: Comparison of the minimal l2-norm over Rd\C (6) (blue), Rd \ U1,∞ (5) (red) andits naive lower bound (4) (green). We fix e∞ = 1 and show the results varying e 1 ∈(1 ,d), ford = 784 and d = 3072. We plot the value (or a lower bound in case of (4)) of the minimalIlx∣∣2, depending on e 1, given by the different approaches (first and third plots). The redcurves are almost completely hidden by the green ones, as they mostly overlap, but can beseen for small values of ∣∣x∣∣1. Moreover, we report (second and fourth plots) the ratios ofthe minimal ∣∣X∣∣2 for Rd \ conv(B 1 ∪ B∞) and Rd \ (B 1 ∪ B∞). The values provided by (6)are much larger than those of (5).
Figure 3: We show, for each dataset, the evolution of the test error (red), upper bound (UB)on the robust test error wrt l1 (black), l2 (cyan) and l∞ (blue) during training. Moreover, wereport in green the upper bounds on the test error when the attacker is allowed to exploit theunion of the three lp-balls. The statistics on the robustness are computed at epoch 1, 2, 5, 10and then every 10 epochs on 1000 points with the method of Wong & Kolter (2018), usingthe models trained with MMR-Universal.
