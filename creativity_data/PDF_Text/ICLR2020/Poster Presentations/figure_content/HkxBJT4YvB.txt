Figure 1: Belief net structure for randomized controlled trials and observational studies. Here,Y 0 (Y 1) is the outcome of applying T = treatment#0 (#1) to the individual represented by X.
Figure 2: An example observational dataset.
Figure 3: Underlying factors of X ; Γ (Υ) arefactors that partially determine only T (Y ) but notthe other random variable; and ∆ are confounders;Selection bias is induced by factors Γ and ∆.
Figure 4:	Visualization of slicing the learned weights matrix in the first layer of the representationnetwork (number of neurons: K) for identifying Γ (best viewed in color).
Figure 5:	Radar charts that visualize the capability of DR-CFR in identifying the underlying factorsΓ, ∆, and Υ. Each vertex on the polygons is identified with the factors’ dimension sequence(mr Jmδ_mY) of the associated synthetic dataset. The polygons, radii are scaled between 0:0.09and quantify the average weights of the first slice (in dotted magenta) and the second slice (in cyan).
Figure 6: Radar charts for visualizing the PEHE performance results on the synthetic datasets. Trainingsample size on the left chart is 2,500 and on the right chart is 10,000. Each vertex on the polygons isidentified With the factors' dimension sequence (mr.m∆.mγ) of the associated group of datasets.
