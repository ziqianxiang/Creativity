Figure 1: Illustrationwhere u is a random Gaussian vector and e > 0 is a very small smoothing parame-ter. This is a standard zeroth order oracle for estimating directional derivative and basedon this we can apply many different zeroth order optimization algorithms to minimize g .
Figure 2: Example of Sign-OPT targeted attack. L2 distortions and queries used are shown aboveand below the images. First two rows: Example comparison of Sign-OPT attack and OPT attack.
Figure 3: Median L2 distortion vs Queries. First two: Comparison of Sign-OPT and SVM-OPTattack for MNIST and CIFAR-10. Third: Performance of Sign-OPT for different values of Q.
Figure 4: Untargeted attack: Median distortion vs Queries for different datasets.
Figure 5: (a) Targeted Attack: Median distortion vs Queries of different attacks on MNIST andCIFAR-10. (b) Comparing Sign-OPT and ZO-SignSGD with and without single query oracle (SQO).
Figure 6: Success Rate vs Queries for CIFAR-10 (L2 norm-based attack). First two and last twodepict untargeted and targeted attacks respectively. Success rate threshold is at the top of each plot.
Figure 7: Comparison with HopSkipJumpAttack for CIFAR and MNIST: Median distortion vsQueries. (U) represents untargeted attack and (T) represents targeted attack.
