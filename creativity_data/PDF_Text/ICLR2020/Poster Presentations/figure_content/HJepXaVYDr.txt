Figure 3: Comparison oftesting AUC on Cat&Dog, CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and STL10, For CIFAR10and STL10 dataset, We randomly partition the 10 classes into two labels (i.e., randomly select 5classes as positive label and other 5 classes as negative label). For CIFAR100 dataset, we randomlypartition the 100 classes into two labels (i.e., randomly select 50 classes as positive label and other 50classes as negative label).
