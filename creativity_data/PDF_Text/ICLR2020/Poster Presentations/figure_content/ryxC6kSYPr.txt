Figure 1: Mass-spring-damper. Imitation loss and model lossat each iteration of the training process. Top row: imitationloss. Bottom row: model loss given by kvecA - vecAj k22, whereAj is the learned model at iteration j , and A is the correct model.
Figure 2: Mass-spring-damper. Closed-loop trajectories usingthe expert and learned controllers. Trajectories only shown forx1 (position), but x2 (velocity) can be inferred. Expert controllersshown with solid lines, and learned controller shown with dottedlines. The hard state constraints are shown in the red regions.
Figure 3: Platoon Model. nv vehicles in 1 degreeof freedom where y is longitudinal displacement.
Figure 4: Vehicle platooning. Imitation loss and costfunction loss at each iteration of the training process.
Figure 5: Vehicle platooning. Closed loop simulation and prediction error for all horizonlengths. Top row: closed loop simulation where each shaded region is the safe separation dis-tance for each vehicle. Bottom row: prediction error given by x[tï¼št+N] - Xt, where X is the statetrajectory predicted by the MPC at time t.
