Figure 1:	Performance of mutual information estimation approaches on Gaussian (top row) andCubic (bottom row). Left two columns are ICPC and INWJ , next three columns are ISMILE withτ = 1.0, 5.0, ∞ and the right column is IGM with flow models.
Figure 2:	Bias / Variance / MSE of various estimators on Cubic (right). We display more results forGaussian in Appendix B.
Figure 3:	Three settings in the self-consistency experiments.
Figure 4: Evaluation of I(X; Y)/I(X; , X). X is an image and Y contains the top t rows ofX.
Figure 5: Evaluation of I([X, X];[Y, h(Y)])∕I(X, Y), where the ideal value is 1.
Figure 6: Evaluation of I([Xι, X2]; [Yl, Y2])∕I(X, Y), where the ideal value is 2.
Figure 7: Bias / Variance / MSE of various estimators. on Gaussian (top) and Cubic (down).
