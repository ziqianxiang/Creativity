Figure 1: Detected contours (black) in the original frame, resulting cropped frame after normaliza-tion, and corresponding optical flow frame.
Figure 2: Full Two-Stream CNN architecture.
Figure 3: Relevance heatmaps of the CNN. High relevance is shown in dark red color, while lightred stands for low relevance. Left: example of a temporal heatmap over a single frame (true pos-itive, optical flow in grayscale, relevance heatmap overlaid in red). Middle: averages of temporalheatmaps split by class; negatives before and after correction. Right: average of spatial heatmapsover all samples.
Figure 4: Distribution of relevance on the flow frames of the averaged sample.
Figure S5: Distribution of points along the tail after running the tail-fitting procedure.
Figure S6: Overview over the whole project pipeline.
Figure S7: Data augmentation procedure.
Figure S8: Averaged saliency maps, analogous to Figure 3.
Figure S9: Averaged heatmaps from Guided BackProp, analogous to Figure 3.
