Figure 1: Graphical structures of R-SSM. Diamonds represent deterministic states and circles repre-sent random variables. To be concise, the dependencies on the graph G and exogenous inputs U1:Tare not shown. (b) is the result of collapsing all deterministic states in (a) and writing Zt = (ztg , Zt).
Figure 2:	An example from the toy dataset (N = 36, T = 80).
Figure 3:	Selected rollouts from the trained model. Black dots represent the starting points.
Figure 4:	Visual illustration of a GNF. Multiple GNFs can be stacked together to achieve moreexpressive transformation.
