Figure 1: Latent traversals (each column corresponds to a different latent variable being varied)on Shapes3D for the β-TCVAE model with best validation MIG (top) and for the semi-supervisedβ-TCVAE model with best validation loss (bottom), both using only 1000 labeled examples forvalidation and/or supervision. Both models appear to be visually well disentangled.
Figure 2: Rank correlation of validation metrics and test metrics on dSprites. Validation metricsare computed on different types of labels. Legend: (A)=BetaVAE Score, (B)=FactorVAE Score,(C)=MIG, (D)=DCI Disentanglement, (E)=Modularity, (F)=SAP.
Figure 3: (left) Median across the draws of the labeled data set of the DCI Disentanglement test scoreon SmallNORB after validation with 100 and 1000 labeled examples. U/S were validated with theMIG. (center) Increasing the supervised regularization strength makes the matrix of pairwise mutualinformation I(z, r(x)) closer to diagonal (avgMI = kI (z, r(x)) - diag(I (z, r(x)))k2F). (right)Probability of each method being the best on a random downstream task. Legend: 0=S2 /S-β-TCVAE,1=S2∕S-β-VAE, 2=S2/S-DIP-VAE-I, 3=S2/S-FactorVAE, 4=U/S/-TCVAE, 5=U∕S-β-VAE, 6=U/S-DIP-VAE-I, 7=U/S-FactorVAE. For the U/S methods we sample the validationmetric uniformly.

Legend: 0=S2/S-β-TCVAE, 1=S2/S-β-VAE,2=S2∕S-DIP-VAE-L 3=S2/S-FactorVAE, 4=U∕S-β-TCVAE, 5=U∕S-β-VAE, 6=U∕S-DIP-VAE-L7=U/S-FactorVAE. Overall, it seem more beneficial to incorporate supervision during training ratherthan using it only for validation. Having more labels available increases the gap.
