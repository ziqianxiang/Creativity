Figure 2: Information-limited vs full-information certificates for ImageNet for `2perturbations. The dashed line representsequal certificates and every point below thedashed line has a stronger certificate fromthe full information verification setting. Werun the comparison on 50 randomly selectedexamples from the validation set. Each bluedot in Figure 2 corresponds to one test point,with its x coordinate representing the radiusfor full information certificate (from Algo-rithm 1) and y coordinate the information-limited certificate (which is equivalent to thecertification procedure of Cohen et al., 2019).
