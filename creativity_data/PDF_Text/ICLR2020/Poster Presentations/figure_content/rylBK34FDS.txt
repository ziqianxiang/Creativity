Figure 1: Comparing the `1 and the Hoyer regularizer of a 2-D vector. Their contoursare shown in the left 2 subplots (darker color corresponds to a lower value). The right 2subplots compare their negative gradients.
Figure 2: Minimization path of Hoyer-Square regularizer during gradient descent, withW âˆˆ R20 initialized as i.i.d. N(0, 1). The figure shows the path of each element wi duringthe minimization, with the black dash line showing the induced trimming threshold.
Figure 3: Comparisons of accuracy-#FLOPs tradeoff on ImageNet and CIFAR-10, black dash linesmark the Pareto frontiers. The exact data for the points are listed in Appendix C.3.
Figure 4: Histogram of nonzero weight elements of each layer in the LeNet-300-100model. From top to bottom corresponds to layer FC1, FC2, FC3 respectively. The originalpretrained model is shown in column 1, column 2 shows the model achieved after HSregularization, column 3 shows the final model after pruning and finetuning.
Figure 5: Histogram of nonzero weight elements of each layer in the LeNet-5 model. Fromtop to bottom corresponds to layer CONV1, CONV2, FC1, FC2 respectively. The originalpretrained model is shown in column 1, column 2 shows the model achieved after HSregularization, column 3 shows the final model after pruning and finetuning.
