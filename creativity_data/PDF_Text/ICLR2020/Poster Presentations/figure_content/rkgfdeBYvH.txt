Figure 1: Experiments on synthetiC dataset (From left to right) (a)Rate of ConvergenCe of 2-layernetwork for different aCtivations when n = 10 (b) Rate of ConvergenCe of 2-layer network for differentaCtivations when n = 50 (C) Eigenvalues of the G-matrix at initialization for different aCtivationswhen n = 10 (d) Eigenvalues of the G-matrix at initialization for different aCtivations when n = 50of preproCessed images (desCribed in SeCtion 2) in Figure 2(a). It shows that the assumptions holdfor CIFAR10, with Î´ at least 0.1. Figure 2(b) has the plot of the Cumulative sums of eigenvalues,normalized to the range [0, 1], of the data CovarianCe matrix. This figure shows that the intrinsiCdimension of data is muCh larger than O (log n), where n denotes the number of samples.
