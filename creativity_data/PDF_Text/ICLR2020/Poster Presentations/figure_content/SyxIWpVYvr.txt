Figure 1: Likelihoods from a Glow model trained on CIFAR10. Qualitatively similar results areobtained for other generative models and data sets (see also results in Choi et al., 2018; Nalisnicket al., 2019a).
Figure 2: Log-likelihoods from a Glow model trained on CIFAR10. Qualitatively similar results areobtained for a PixelCNN++ model and when training with FashionMNIST.
Figure 3: Pooled-image log-likelihoods obtained from a Glow model trained on CIFAR10. Qualita-tively similar results are obtained for a PixelCNN++ model.
Figure 4: Normalized compressed lengths using a PNG compressor with respect to likelihoods ofa PixelCNN++ model trained on CIFAR10 (for visualization purposes we here employ a sample of200 images per data set). Similar results are obtained for a Glow model and other compressors.
