Figure 1: Illustration of the ensemble perspective. Arrow means operators. The structure of twoconvolutions joined by a channel-wise operation is mathematically equivalent to the ensemble ofmultiple atomic blocks, according to Eq. (2). Colored rectangles represent tensors, with numbersinside indicating their channel numbers; The shaded path on the right is one example of atomicblock.
Figure 2: FLOPs change of the supernet during the searching and training for AtomNAS-C. Thecrossed-out region corresponds to the saved computation compared to training the supernet withoutthe dynamic shrinkage. The region in yellow corresponds to the extra cost compared with trainingthe final model from scratch, the cost of which is the region below the red dashed line.
Figure 3: (Left) The searchable block of the supernet. fo and fι are fixed to 1 X 1 pointwiseconvolutions; g here is a mix of three convolutions with kernel sizes of 3 × 3, 5 × 5 and 7 × 7.
Figure 4: FLOPs versus accuracy on ImageNet. * means methods use extra techniques like SWishactivation and Squeeze-and-Excitation module.
Figure 5: The architecture of AtomNAS-C. Blue, orange, cyan blocks denote atomic blocks withkernel size 3, 5 and 7 respectively; the heights of these blocks are proportional to their expand ratios.
Figure 6: Ratio of different types of atomic blocks in all 21 searchable blocks. The text aboveeach pie tells the total number of atomic blocks of the corresponding block in the original supernet.
