Figure 1: Illustration of decision bound-ary, margin, and shortest successful per-turbation on application of an adversar-ial perturbation.
Figure 2: A 1-D example on how margin is affected by decreasing the loss at different locations.
Figure 3: Visualization of loss landscape in the input space for MMA and PGD trained models.
Figure 4: Margin distributions during training, under the CIFAR10-'2 case. Each blue histogramrepresents the margin value distribution of MMA-3.0, and the orange represents PGD-2.5.
