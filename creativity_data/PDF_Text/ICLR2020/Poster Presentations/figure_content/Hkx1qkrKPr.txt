Figure 1: Performance of Multi-layer GCNs on Cora. We implement 4-layer GCN w and w/oDropEdge (in orange), 8-layer GCN w and w/o DropEdge (in blue)2. GCN-4 gets stuck in theover-fitting issue attaining low training error but high validation error; the training of GCN-8 failsto converge satisfactorily due to over-smoothing. By applying DropEdge, both GCN-4 and GCN-8work well for both training and validation.
Figure 3: Analysis on over-smoothing. Smaller distance means more serious over-smoothing.
Figure 5: The illustration of four backbones. GCL indicates graph convolutional layer.
Figure 6: The validation loss on different backbones w and w/o DropEdge. GCN-n denotes PlainGCNof depth n; similar denotation follows for other backbones.
