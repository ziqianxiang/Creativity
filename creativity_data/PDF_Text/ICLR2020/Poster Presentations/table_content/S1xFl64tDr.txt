Table 1: Classification error rates and reconstruction errors measured on different variants of ResNetand CIFAR-10. Additional layers are introduced due to the GAN structure, but are not trained overadversarial loss. Our results show that the revised DNNs have almost the same utility performance asthe original ones, but with greater reconstruction loss.
Table 2: Classification error rates and reconstruction errors on a variety of DNNs and datasets. Wecompared the results with noisy DNNs with different noise levels. Complex-Valued DNNs havesignificantly better accuracy performance and higher reconstruction errors than noisy DNNs over allnoise levels.
Table 3: Failure rate of reconstructed images identification. We have five human annotators torecognize the object in mixed groups of images. The results show that most fail to recognize thereconstruction from the revised DNNs.
Table 4: Average error (absolute Figure 3: The error rates in inferring hidden properties onvalue) of the estimated rotation an- CelebA (a)/(b) and CIFAR-100 (c)/(d).
Table 5: The classification error rates, error rates in inferring hidden properties by k-NN, andprocessing speed. We found that while introducing little computational overhead, our methoddiminishes the adversaryâ€™s power in inferring hidden properties.
