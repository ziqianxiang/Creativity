On the cleared land nutrients leach out of thesoil, however, and the land becomes too poor to support agriculture. New land is then cleared by burningand the process starts again. Since most farming in the tropics uses this method, forests in this region willeventually be permanently eradicated.

Unfor-tunately, this method can predict only that an earthquake will fall somewhere within a range of two anda half points on the Richter scale. Thus, since a difference of two and a half points can be the differencebetween a marginally perceptible shaking and a quake that causes considerable damage, the new methodis unlikely to be useful.

This claim is not mere proverbial wisdom but a factverified by statistics. In a recently concluded survey, only one-third of the respondents who claimed tohave achieved financial success reported that they were happy.

Proponents have claimed astronomically high odds against obtaining a match by chance alone.

We can see, though, that the predictedwarming is occurring already. In the middle of last winter, we had a month of springlike weather in ourarea, and this fall, because of unusually mild temperatures, the leaves on our town’ s trees were threeweeks late in turning color.

Whether or not it presents psychological, moral or socialdangers, or triggers enduring infantile fears, if a monster is physically dangerous then it is threatening. Infact, even a physically benign monster is horrific if it inspires revulsion.

Virtues are by definition praiseworthy, whiCh is why no one Considers resentmentvirtuous, even though it is in fact a kind of faithfulness - faithfulness to hatreds or animosities.

This material came either from spent fuelrods or from the plant’ s core. Spent fuel rods never contain significant quantities of tellurium isotopes.

Over the years, as the trees matured, they attracted a variety of bird species and greatly increasedthe summer bird population in the area. As expected, the birds ate many mosquitoes. However, theplanting of the fruit trees had the very opposite of its intended effect.

Therefore, no government has the right toredistribute resources via taxation. Anyone who wants can help others voluntarily. Edward: Governmentsdo have that right, insofar as they give people the freedom to leave and hence not to live under theirauthority.

It is futile for such a company to try to learn awhole new business. Ruth: Wrong. The Kelton Company was a major mining operation that went intobankruptcy. On emerging from bankruptcy, Kelton turned its mines into landfills and is presently a highlysuccessful waste-management concern.
Table 21:	The definition and an example of the logical reasoning type - TechniqueType: RoleDefinition: describe the individual role that a statement is playing in a larger argumentContext:The position that punishment should be proportional to how serious the offense is but that repeat offendersshould receive harsher punishments than first-time offenders is unsustainable. It implies that considera-tions as remote as what an offender did years ago are relevant to the seriousness of an offense. If suchremote considerations were relevant, almost every other consideration would be too. But this would makedetermining the seriousness of an offense so difficult that it would be impossible to apply the proportion-ality principle.
Table 22:	The definition and an example of the logical reasoning type - RoleType: Identify a FlawDefinition: identify a flaw in an argument’s reasoningContext:The tidal range at a particular location is the difference in height between high tide and low tide. Tidalstudies have shown that one of the greatest tidal ranges in the world is found in the Bay of Fundy andreaches more than seventeen meters. Since the only forces involved in inducing the tides are the sun’ s andmoon’ s gravity, the magnitudes of tidal ranges also must be explained entirely by gravitational forces.

Therefore, the thieves must have gained access to themuseum from below ground level.

Now,as part of a plan to efficiently increase the farms‘ total production, it plans to drill down to an aquifercontaining warm, slightly salty water that will be used to raise fish in ponds. The water from the pondswill later be used to supplement piped-in irrigation water for PhishCo‘s vegetable fields, and the pondsand accompanying vegetation should help reduce the heat in the area of the farms.
