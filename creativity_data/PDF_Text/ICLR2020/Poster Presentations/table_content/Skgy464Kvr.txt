Table 1: Success Rate / Undetected Rate of white-box targeted and untargeted attacks on the MNISTdataset. In the table, St /Rt is shown for targeted attacks and Su /Ru is presented for untargetedattacks. A smaller success rate and undetected rate means a stronger defense model. Full results forFashionMNIST and SVHN can be seen in Table 5 in the Appendix.
Table 2: Error Rate/Undetected Rate on the Corrupted MNIST dataset. A smaller error rate andundetected rate means a better defense model.
Table 3: Success rate and the worst case undetected rate of white-box targeted and untargetedreconstructive attacks. St/Rt is shown for targeted attacks and Su /Ru is presented for untargetedattacks. The worst case undetected rate is reported via tuning the hyperparameter β in Eqn 1 andEqn 2. The best defense models are shown in bold (smaller success rate and undetected rate is better).
Table 4: Error rate of each model when the input are clean test images in each dataset.
Table 5: Success rate and undetected rate of white-box targeted and untargeted attacks. In the table,St/Rt is shown for targeted attacks and Su/Ru is presented for untargeted attacks.
Table 6: Success rate and the worst case undetected rate of white-box targeted and untargetedreconstructive attacks. Below St /Rt is shown for targeted attacks and Su/Ru is presented foruntargeted attacks.
Table 7: Success rate and undetected rate of black-box targeted and untargeted attacks. In the table,St/Rt is shown for targeted attacks and Su/Ru is presented for untargeted attacks.
