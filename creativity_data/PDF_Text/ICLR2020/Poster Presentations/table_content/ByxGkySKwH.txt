Table 1: Worst-case performance of different OOD methods in neighborhoods around uniform noisepoints certified by CCU. We report the clean test error (TE) on the in-distribution (GAN and MCD useVGG). The success rate (SR) is the fraction of adversarial noise points for which the confidence/scoreinside the ball is higher than the median of the in-distributionâ€™s confidence/score. The AUC quantifiesdetection of adversarial noise versus in-distribution. All values in %.
Table 2: AUC (in- versus out-distribution detection based on confidence/score) in percent fordifferent OOD methods and datasets (higher is better). OE and CCU have the best OOD performance.
Table 3: Lowest confidence that CCU attains on the test set (in percent) as well as total number oftest points on which confidence is lower than our imposed bound of M.
Table 4: OOD detection performance (AUC in percent) for ACET (trained around tiny images) andACET2 (trained around uniform noise).
Table 5: OOD detection performance (test error, AUC and success rate in percent) for ACET (trainedaround tiny images) and ACET2 (trained around uniform noise).
Table 6: AUPR (in- versus out-distribution detection based on confidence/score) in percent fordifferent OOD methods and datasets (higher is better). OE and CCU have the best OOD performance.
