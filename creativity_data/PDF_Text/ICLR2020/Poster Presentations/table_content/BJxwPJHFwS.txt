Table 1: Clean accuracies and computed bounds for 1-position perturbation. Bounds include upperbounds (obtained by an enumeration based method), certified lower bounds by IBP and our methodrespectively. We also report the gap between upper bounds and our lower bounds (represented as thepercentage of lower bounds relative to upper bounds). We compute bounds for each possible optionof perturbed positions and report the minimum (“Min”) and average (“Avg”) among them.
Table 2: Bounds by IBP and our method for 2-position perturbation constrained by `2 -norm.
Table 3: Comparison of certified lower bounds and computation time (sec) by different methods.
Table 4: Average importance scores of the most/least important words identified from 100 examplesrespectively on SST by different methods. For the most important words identified, larger importantscores are better, and vice versa. Additionally, we show most/least important words identified from10 examples on the Yelp dataset. Boldfaced words are considered to have strong sentiment polarities,and they should appear as most important words rather than least important ones.
