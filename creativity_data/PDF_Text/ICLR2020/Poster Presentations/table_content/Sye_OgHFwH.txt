Table 1: Our attacks are highly successful on ResNet50 (R50), DenseNet121 (D121) and VGG19.
Table 2: Comparison against defense models. Misclassification rate after passing different adver-sarial examples through the defense models (higher means the attack is stronger). All attacks areperformed on ResNet50 with whitebox attack. The highest attack success rate is in bold. We alsoreport the user preference scores from AMT for each attack (last column).
Table 3: Summary of the difference in our work compared to previous work. Unlike previous attackmethods, our attacks are unbounded, semantically motivated, realistic, highly successful, and scalesto more complex datasets and other ML tasks. They are also robust against tested defenses.
Table 4: User Study. User preference score and Lp norm of perturbation for different attacks. cAdvand tAdv are imperceptible for humans (score close to 0.5) even with very big Lp norm perturbation.
Table 5: Class wise Lp norm and user preference breakdown. Users are biased and pick a few classesquite often (merganser, sandbar), and do not like a few classes (photocopier) over others.
