Table 1: Transductive learning task results for predicting future edges of nodes that have been ob-served in training data. All results are converted to percentage by multiplying by 100, and the stan-dard deviations computed over ten runs (in parenthesis). The best and second-best results in eachcolumn are highlighted in bold font and underlined. GraphSAGE is short for GraPhSAGE-LSTM.
Table 2: Inductive learning task results for predicting future edges of unseen nodes.
Table 4: Data statistics for the three datasets. Since we sample a proportion of unseen nodes, thepercentage of the edge statistics reported here are approximations.
