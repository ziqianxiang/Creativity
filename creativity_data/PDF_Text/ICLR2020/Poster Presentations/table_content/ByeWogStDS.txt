Table 1: Zero-shot transfer performance. The final return in the initial environment is shown, as wellas the average return over 25 rollouts in each new modified environment.
Table 2: Empirical evaluation of Lemma 1. In the middle and right columns, we evaluate the qualityof our assumption by computing the largest probability of a certain action under other skills (),and the action probability under the actual latent. We also report the cosine similarity between ourapproximate gradient and the exact gradient from Eq. 3. The mean and standard deviation of thesevalues are computed over the full batch collected at iteration 10.
