Table 1: Summary of types of gradient clipping considered in this paper. We consider binary classificationproblems involving a labelled example (x, y), parametrised scoring function sθ (x) with margin m(θ) =.
Table 2: Test set accuracy where the training labels are corrupted with probability ρ. We report the mean andstandard error over 3 trials. The highlighted cells are the best performing loss at a given ρ. “PHuber”here refers to our partial Huberisation from §4, which is equivalent to a variant of gradient clipping.
