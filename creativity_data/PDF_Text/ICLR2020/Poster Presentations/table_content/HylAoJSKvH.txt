Table 1: Summary of the new derived complexity results of SMTP and SMTP_IS. The complexitiesfor SMTP are under a generic sampling distribution D satisfying Assumption 3.1 while for SMTP_ISare under an arbitrary discrete sampling from a set of coordinate directions following Bibi et al.
Table 2: For each MuJoCo task, we report the average number of episodes required to achieve apredefined reward threshold. Results for our method is averaged over five random seeds, the rest iscopied from (Mania et al., 2018) (N/A means the method failed to reach the threshold. UNK meansthe results is unknown since they are not reported in the literature.)

In contrast to STP_IS, our method (SMTP) does notrequired sampling from directions in the canonical basis; hence, we use directions from standardNormal distribution in each iteration. For SMTP_IS, we follow a similar procedure as Bibi et al.
