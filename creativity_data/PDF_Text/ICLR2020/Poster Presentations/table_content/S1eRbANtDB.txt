Table 1: Table of average number of discontinuities for a piecewise constant loss function sampled from each distributionand learning task. Task ‘SC’ corresponds to interpolating between single and complete linkage, ‘AC‘ is interpolatingbetween average and complete linkage, and ‘metric‘ is interpolating between two base metrics. The column labeled“max n” is an upper bound on the size of each clustering instance.
