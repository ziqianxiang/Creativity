Table 1: Ablations of scope size and different instantiations of DK for image classification.
Table 2: Comparisons to strong baselines for image classification DKs perform comparably orsuperiorly to previous methods. Further combinations yield consistent gain, suggesting orthogonaland compatible working mechanisms.
Table 3: Ablations for object detection. Consistent results with image classification.
Table 4: Comparisons to strong baselines for object detection DKs perform fall short to De-formable Convolution, but combination still improves performance.
Table 5: Network architecture of our ResNet-50-DW comparing to the original ResNet-50Inside the brackets are the general shape of a residual block, including filter sizes and feature di-mensionalities. The number of stacked blocks on each stage is presented outside the brackets.
