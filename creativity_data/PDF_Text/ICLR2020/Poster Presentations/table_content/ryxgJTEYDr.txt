Table 1: HyperparametersE 2D Bandits EnvironmentE.0. 1 Observation SpaceThe 2D bandits task provides a 6-dimensional flat observation. The first two dimensions correspondto the (x, y) coordinates of the current position of the agent and the remaining four dimensionscorrespond to the (x, y) coordinates of the two randomly chosen points.
