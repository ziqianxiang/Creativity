It models different types of biologicalinteractions and produces biologically plausible synthetic gene expression data. Figure 6 showsthat GLAD performs favourably for structure recovery in terms of NMSE on the gene expressiondata. As the governing equations of the underlying distribution of the SynTReN are unknown, theseexperiments also emphasize the ability of GLAD to handle non-Gaussian data.
