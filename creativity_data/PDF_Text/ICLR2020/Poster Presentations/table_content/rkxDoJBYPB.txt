Table 1: Comparison of methods on the TensorFlow and Synthetic test sets. Results are averagesover test set graphs. Higher is better for % Improvement over BRKGA5K, and lower is better for %Gap from best known. Note: CP-SAT, an enumerative algorithm, is run for up to 24 hours only toestablish Provably global optima (if possible) for evaluation purposes.
Table 2: Parameters for the random graph models used to generate synthetic graphs.
Table 3: Average running times for all methods (time cost of running the algorithms, not to beconfused with solution quality).
Table 4: Performance of REGAL on peak memory with various subsets of actions.
