Table 1: Our compression results compared to the existing state of the art. Our method is ableto achieve higher compression than previous approaches in LeNet300-100, VGG-16, and ResNet-18/50, while maintaining comparable prediction accuracy. We have reported the models that havethe closest accuracy to the baselines. For the complete view of the trade-off refer to figs. 4a and 4b.
