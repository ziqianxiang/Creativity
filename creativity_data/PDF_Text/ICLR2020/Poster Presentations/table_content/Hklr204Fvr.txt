Table 1: Test Accuracy per dataset, model. P-ValUes are dataset-specific - in this case We use theWilcoxon test to compare our method to each of the others on the HCP dataset. We reported p-valuesfor HCP only, as the dataset Was large, and the performance improVement gaps Were not extremelyobVious. p-Value from one sided Wilcoxon rank sum test shoWs that FGL (3 layer) is better than othermodels on HCP dataset.
Table S1: Test Accuracy to study imperfect A: Reported numbers for each model are averaged overmultiple (3) runs.
