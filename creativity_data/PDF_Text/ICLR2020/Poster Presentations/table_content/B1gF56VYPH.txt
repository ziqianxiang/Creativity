Table 1: Stereoscopic view synthesis performance on the 400 KITTI2015 training images (left) andthe 500 CitySCaPeS validation images (right). lp: perceptual loss. â†‘J indicate the better performance.
Table 2: Depth metrics (Eigen et al., 2014) for KITTI2015. Models are trained with video (V),stereo (S), semi global matching (SMG) or GT depth (Supp). Top models in terms of a1 accuracyare highlighted. Simplified table, see appendix A.9 for the full version.
