Table 2: Experiment setup for online experiments. Nt0 is the number of observed samples at the firsttime-step and Nt1:k is the dataset size of all other time-steps. M refers to the number of samplesin the memory. We evaluated 5 different memory sizes for each experiment in Sec. 3 and 10 sizesfor experiments in Sec. 4, where the sizes are equally spaced in the given range. Ktrain and Ktermis the number of MC samples used for training and for estimating the Gaussian terms respectively.
