Table 4: Hyperparameters for BEARfor Cartesian actions, [-1, 1] rad/s for wrist rotation and [-255, 255] for finger velocity (for units seegripper specifications). The control rate at which the actions are executed is 20 Hz. Episodes areterminated if the wrist force exceeds 20 N on any axis, encouraging a gentle interaction of the robotwith its environment.
Table 5: Network parameters for multitask experiments. "->" indicates the network branching intoseparate "heads" for each task, which are selected based on the one-hot task vector. This architectureis similar to the design presented in (Riedmiller et al., 2018). Note that transitions are duplicated inreplay for each task (so that transitions are sampled independently for each task).
