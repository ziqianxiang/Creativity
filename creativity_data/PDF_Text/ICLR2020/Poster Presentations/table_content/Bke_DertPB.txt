During training, the best observed InceptionScore and FID were 8.13 and 18.49, while at the end of training the best final Inception Score and7Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2020FID were 8.01 and 15.42. To see that ALR indeed restricts the Lipschitz constant of the critic, wemonitored the gradient norms during training, which converged to ≈ 5 with λ = 100. This was
