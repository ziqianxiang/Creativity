Table 1: Classification accuracy (%) on the white-box adversarial examples crafted on the test set of CIFAR-10. The superscript tar indicatestargeted attacks, while un indicates untargeted attacks. The subscripts indicate the number of iteration steps when performing attacks. Theresults w.r.t the MMC loss are reported under the adaptive versions of different attacks. The notation ≤ 1 represents accuracy less than 1%.
Table 2: Experiments on CIFAR-10. Part I: Averaged l2 distortion of the white-box adversarial examples crafted by C&W with 1,000iteration steps. Part II: Classification accuracy (%) under the block-box SPSA attack. Part III: Classification accuracy (%) under generaltransformations. The standard deviation σ for the GaUssian noise is 0.05, the degree range is ±30° for random rotation.
Table 3: Accuracy (%) of MMC-10 underSPSA with different batch sizes.
Table 4: Experiments on CIFAR-100. Part I: Classification accuracy (%) on the clean test samples. Part II: Classification accuracy (%) underthe white-box PGD attacks and the block-box SPSA attack. The attacks are adaptive for MMC. Here the batch size for SPSA is 128. Part III:Averaged l2 distortion of the white-box adversarial examples crafted by C&W with 1,000 iteration steps and 9 binary search epochs.
Table 5: Classification accuracy (%) on the white-box adversarial examples crafted on the test set of CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. The resultsw.r.t the MMC loss are reported under the adaptive versions of different attacks. MMC can better exploit deep architectures, while SCE cannot.
