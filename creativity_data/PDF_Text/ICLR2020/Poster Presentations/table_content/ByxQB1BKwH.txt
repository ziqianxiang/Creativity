Table 1: (a) shows results comparing MXGNet model variants against WReN for the PGM dataset. (b)shows results comparing MXGNet model variants against ResNet models for the RAVEN dataset. Theobject-level representation has two variations which are (o1) CNN features and (o2) Spatial Attention features(Section 4.1).
Table 2: Generalisation performance comparing MXGNet model variants against WReN. ‘Diff.’ is thedifference between the test and the validation performances.
Table 3: All subsets ranked by the absolute value of their corresponding gating variables.
Table 4: Generalisation performance comparing MXGNet model variants against WReN. ‘Diff.’ is thedifference between the test and the validation performances.
