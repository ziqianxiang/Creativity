Table 1: Performance at test time with (maac+mpc) and without (maac) planning of the convergedpolicy using the MAAC objective.
Table 2: This table shows the time that different parts of MAAC need to train for one iteration after6000 time steps, averaged across 4 seeds. We also add the time needed for MBPO for one iterationhere for comparison.
