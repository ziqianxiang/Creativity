In each iteration of the experi-ment, We picked a random automorphism 夕：R3×3 → R3×3 and a random matrix Qo ∈ R3×3. Wefirst verified that the number of complex critical points of the perturbed quadratic distance functionhφ,Qo restricted to Mi is the expected number 39. After that, We computed the number of realcritical points and the number of local minima among them. Our results for 2000 iterations canbe found in Table 2 and Figure 3. Although this is a very rudimentary experiment in an extremelysimple setting, it provides clear evidence that the number of local minima of the perturbed distancefunction is generally not one.
