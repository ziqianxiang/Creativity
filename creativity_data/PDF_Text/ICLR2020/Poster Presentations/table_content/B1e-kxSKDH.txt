Table 1: Predictive performance of our approach, the baselines, and ablations (lower is better, bestunsupervised values are bold). STOVE outperforms all unsupervised baselines and is almost indis-tinguishable from the supervised model on the billiards task. The values are computed by summingthe prediction errors presented in Fig. 4 in the time interval t âˆˆ [9, 18], i.e., the first ten predictedtimesteps. In parentheses, standard deviations across multiple training runs are given.
