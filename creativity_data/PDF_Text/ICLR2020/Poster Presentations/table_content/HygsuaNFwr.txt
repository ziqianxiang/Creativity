Table 1: A summary of the balanced dataset, formed from MORPH II, AFAD, and UTK. An elementmn means that, out of m images in the original dataset, n images are sampled for the balanced dataset.
Table 2: Performance comparison on the MORPH II dataset: * means that the networks are pre-trained on IMDB-WIKI, and f the values are read from the reported CS curves or measured byexperiments. The best results are boldfaced, and the second best ones are underlined.
Table 3: Comparison of the proposed algorithm with MV on the balanced dataset. In MV and thesupervised algorithm, multi-chain hypotheses divide data by the genders and/or the ethnic groups.
Table 4: Cross-chain tests on the balanced dataset (MAEs). For example, in 6CH, when Africanmale references are used to estimate the ages of Asian females, the resultant MAE is 3.82.
Table 5: Performance comparison on the MORPH II dataset: * means that the networks are pre-trained on IMDB-WIKI, and f the values are read from the reported CS curves or measured byexperiments. The best results are boldfaced, and the second best ones are underlined.
Table 6: Performance comparison on FG-NET. The average performances over test ages withinranges [0, 69] and [15, 69] are reported, respectively.
Table 7: MAE and CS performances of the unsupervised algorithm (2CH) on the balanced dataset,according to the minimum percentage (κ) constraint during the regularized membership update. Theperformances are not very sensitive to κ. The best performances are achieved in the default mode,i.e. at K = 50%.	_____________________________________K (%)	10	20	30	40	50Figure 7: Distributions of training images in the unsupervised algorithm (2CH) at κ = 20%, 30%,and 40%. From Figures 5 and 7, we see that stronger age-dependent tendencies are observed, as κgets smaller.
Table 8: The performances of the proposed algorithm (1CH) on the balanced dataset according tothresholds T and Tage .
Table 9: The performances of the proposed algorithm (supervised) on the balanced dataset accordingto the number of references for each age class (M/N). In general, the performances get better withmore references. However, the performances are not very sensitive to M/N . They saturate whenM/N ≥ 5. Therefore, we set M/N = 5 in this work.
