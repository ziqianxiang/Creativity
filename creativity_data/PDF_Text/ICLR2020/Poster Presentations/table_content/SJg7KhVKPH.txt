Table 1: Aligned vs. mixed training on IWSLT De-En. We report valid BLEU for a uniformlysampled exit n 〜U([1..6]) at each token, a fixed exit n ∈ [1..6] for all tokens, as well as the averageBLEU over the fixed exits. As baseline we show six standard Transformer models with 1-6 blocks.
Table 2: Aligned training with different weights (ωn) on IWSLT De-En. For each model we reportBLEU on the dev set evaluated with a uniformly sampled exit n 〜U([1..6]) for each token and afixed exit n ∈ [1..6] throughout the sequence. The average corresponds to the average BLEU overthe fixed exits.
Table 3: Aligned training with different gradient scaling ratios Y : 1 on IWSLT’14 De-En. For eachmodel We report the BLEU4 score evaluated with a uniformly sampled exit n 〜 U([1..6]) for eachtoken and a fixed exit n ∈ [1..6]. The average corresponds to the average BLEU4 of all fixed exits.
Table 4: FLOPS of basic operations, key parameters and variables for the FLOPS estimation.
