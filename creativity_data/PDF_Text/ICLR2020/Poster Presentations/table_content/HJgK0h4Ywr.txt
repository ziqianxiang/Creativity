Table 1: Analysis of different metrics for disentanglement learning. L and K are the numbers oflatent variables and ground truth factors, respectively. Metrics marked with * are self-contained.
Table 2: Summary of datasets used in experiments.
Table 3: Model architectures for CelebA.
Table 4: Model architecture for dSprites.
Table 5: Unnormalized MISJED scores (#bins = 50, 10% data). z1, z2, z3 and z-1, z-2, z-3 denotethe top 3 and the bottom 3 latent variables sorted by the informativeness scores in descending order.
Table 6: Normalized RMIG scores (#bins=100) for some factors. Higher is better.
Table 7: Normalized JEMMIG scores (#bins=100) for some factors. Lower is better.
Table 8: Normalized RMIG scores (bins=100).
