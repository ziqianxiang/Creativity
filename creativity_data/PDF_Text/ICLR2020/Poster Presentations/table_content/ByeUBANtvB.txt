Table 1: Mean test accuracy of CNN over 5 runs trained with backpropagation, node perturbationand direct feedback alignment (DFA)(N0kland, 2016; Crafton et al., 2019).
Table 2: Mean loss (plus/minus standard error) on autoencoding MNIST task (left) and mean accu-racy on CIFAR10 task (right). Shaded cells indicate methods which do not use weight transport orexact gradient supervision. Best performance indicated in boldface. Implementation details of eachmethod is provided in the supplementary material.
