Table 1: Classification results for six benchmark datasets. Note that none of these deep methodscan outperform the traditional method WL on COLLAB. We believe the reason is the graphs inCOLLAB only have single-layer structures while deep models are too complex to capture them.
Table 2: Comparisons between different pooling techniques under the same framework.
Table 3: The prediction accuracy with different iterationnumber m.
Table 6: Statistics and properties of eight benchmark datasets.
Table 7: Comparison with the baseline which excludes pairwise energy.
Table 8: Comparison with different hierarchical network structures.
Table 9: Comparison with different pooling rates.
