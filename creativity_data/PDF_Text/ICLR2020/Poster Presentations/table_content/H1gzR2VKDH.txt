Table 1: Number of Subgoals. With a fixed samplingbudget, as the number of subgoals increases beyond 2,performance drops as the subgoal search is challenging.
Table 2: Max vs Mean. Suc-cess rates for minimizing meanvs. max cost across subsegments.
Table 3: Sample Quantity. Success usingvisual MPC with 200 vs. 1000 samples ateach CEM iteration. Using more samples isbetter, but HVF still outperforms standardvisual foresight by a wide margin.
Table 4: Planning Horizon. Compares success ratesusing visual MPC With planning horizon of 5,10,and 15.
Table 5: Latent vs Pixel `2 cost. Compares successrates using visual MPC With either the squared `2 pixeldistance or squared `2 distance in the latent space of theVAE. The latent space cost is notably Worse due to itproviding a Weak signal at close distances.
Table 6: TAP on Maze Environment. Compares suc-cess rates of TAP vs HVF on the maze environment.
