Table 1: Anneal importance sampling (AIS) results in RBM. The results are recorded on the testset according to the best validation performance and averaged over three runs. AdVIL outperformsNVIL consistently and significantly. See the standard deviations in Appendix E.5.
Table 2: AIS results in DBM. The results are recorded according to the best validation performanceand averaged by three runs. AdVIL achieves higher averaged AIS results on five out of eight datasetsand has a better overall performance than VCD. See the standard deviations in Appendix E.5.
