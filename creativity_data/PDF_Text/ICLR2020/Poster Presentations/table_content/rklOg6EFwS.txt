Table 1: Loss function comparison with existing work. The adversarial example X0 is generated by(10) for all defense methods except TRADES and MMA. The adversarial example in TRADES isgenerated by maximizing its regularization term (KL-divergence), and the adversarial example inMMA is generated by solving (10) with different perturbation limit (i.e., ).
