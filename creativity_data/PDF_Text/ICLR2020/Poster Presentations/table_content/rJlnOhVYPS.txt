Table 1: Experimental results of the proposed MMT and state-of-the-art methods on Market-1501 (Zheng et al., 2015), DukeMTMC-reID (Ristani et al., 2016), and MSMT17 (Wei et al., 2018)datasets, where MMT-Mt represents the result with Mt pseudo classes. Note that none of Mt valuesequals the actual number of identities but our method still outperforms all state-of-the-arts.
Table 2: Ablation studies of our proposed MMT on Duke-to-Market and Market-to-Duke tasks withMt of 500. Note that the actual numbers of identities are not equal to 500 for both datasets but ourMMT method still shows significant improvements.
