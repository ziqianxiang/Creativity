Table 1: Summary of datasets and tasks. Cramer’s V captures statistical correlation between y and s (0indicates no correlation and 1 indicates perfectly correlated).
Table 2: Accuracy of inference from representations (last FC layer). RAND is random guessingbased on majority class labels; BASE is inference from the uncensored representation; ADV fromthe representation censored with adversarial training; IT from the information-theoretically censoredrepresentation.
Table 3: Improving inference accuracy with de-censoring. δ is the increase from Table 2.
Table 4: Adversarial re-purposing. The values are differences between the accuracy of predictingsensitive attributes using a re-purposed model vs. a model trained from scratch.
Table 5: The effect of censoring on adversarial re-purposing for FaceScrub with γ = 0.5, 0.75, 1.0.
