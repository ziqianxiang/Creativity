Table 2: Parameters used to train the control network for each of the three datasets. Architecturerefers to number of units per layer. For example, the MNIST network possessed 1 input layer, 2hidden layers with 1200 units, and an output unit with 10 units.
Table 3: Parameters used during sleep. Input rate = Fmax, the maximum firing rate of input neurons,Sleep duration = length of sleep (number of images presented during sleep, Thresholds = neuronalfiring thresholds for each layer of neurons, Synaptic AMPA current = factor to scale the weights byduring sleep, Increase and Decrease factor = amount weights are modified on a STDP event.
