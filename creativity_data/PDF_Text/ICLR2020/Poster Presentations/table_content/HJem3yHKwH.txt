Table 1: Attack parameters5	ResultsIn this section, we present the results of our experiments highlighting the advantages of EMPIR mod-els.
Table 2: Unperturbed and adversarial accuracies of the baseline and EMPIR models across differentattacksthe EMPIR models exhibit substantially higher adversarial accuracies across all attacks for the threebenchmarks.
Table 3: BenchmarksB Robustness to attacks of varying strengthsTo further illustrate the benefits of EMPIR, we observed its robustness under attacks of varyingstrength. We specifically varied the value in the FGSM attack between 0.1 and 0.8 and the numberof attack iterations in the CW attack between 10 and 90, and measured the adversarial accuracies ofthe EMPIR model as well as the baseline FP model for the MNISTconv benchmark. Figure 5 clearlyillustrates that EMPIR exhibits higher adversarial accuracies across attacks of different strengths forboth FGSM and CW.
