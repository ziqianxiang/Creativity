Table 3: Test accuracy(%) of DenseNet on CIFAR10 With open-set noise.			Open-set Data	NPCL	Softmax	RoGCIFAR100	82.85	79.01	83.37ImageNet	87.95	86.88	87.05CIFAR100-ImageNet	84.28	81.58	84.35We further evaluate the performance of CL/NPCL on the Tiny-ImageNet dataset. We use theResNet18 netWork as the test-bed. For GCE loss, We employ the default hyper-parameter q = 0.7 inall cases. All the methods are performed five runs With seeds {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. The curve of mean testaccuracy (shaded in std) are provided in Figure 2. We can see that NPCL and CL obtain higher testaccuracy than generalized cross-entropy loss and stand cross-entropy loss on both cases. Note thatCL does not have parameters, it is much convenient to use.
