Table 1: CARLA-to-KITTI feature transfer. We train a3D detector module on top of the inferred 3D feature mapsM using KITTI 3D object box annotationspre-training is best, view regression pre-training is second, and learning from annotations aloneis worst. Note that depth in KITTI is acquired by a real LiDAR sensor, and therefore has lowerdensity and more artifacts than CARLA, yet our model generalizes across this distribution shift.
Table 2: Mean endpoint error of the 3D flow inegomotion-stabilized scenes. View-contrastive fea-tures lead to more accurate motion estimation. Erroris L1 in voxel units.
Table 3: Retrieval precision at different recall thresholds, in 2D and in 3D. P@K indicates precisionat the Kth rank. Contrastive learning outperforms regression learning by a substantial margin.
Table 4: Occupancy classification accuracy. Ac-curacy is nearly perfect in each region type.
