(2019) Which are not comParable to our results due to a different netWorkimPlementation, training Procedure, etc. For VAT, Mean Teacher, and MixMatch, We rePort resultsusing our reimPlementation, Which makes them directly comParable to ReMixMatchâ€™s scores.

Table 3: Ablation study. Error rates are rePorted on a single250-label sPlit from CIFAR-10.
