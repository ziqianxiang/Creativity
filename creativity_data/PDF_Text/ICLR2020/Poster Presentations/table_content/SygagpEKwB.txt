Table 1: Removing the ordering information significantly worsen the performances of the S2 /S oneach method. The standard deviation is between 3% and 5% and can be computed as，p(1 - p)∕120.

Table 3: Hyperparameters explored for the different disentanglement methods.
Table 4: Other fixed hyperparameters.
Table 5: Percentage of how often S2∕S improves upon U∕S on for each approach separately. Thestandard deviation is between 3% and 5% and can be computed as，p(1 - p)∕120.
Table 6: Percentage of how often S2/S improves upon U/S on the downstream performance. Thestandard deviation is between 3% and 4% and can be computed as，p(1 - p)∕160.
Table 7: Percentage of how often S2/S improves upon U/S for each method on a random disentan-glement score and data set with binned labels. The standard deviation is between 3% and 5% and canbe computed as，p(1 - p)∕120.
Table 8: Percentage of how often S2/S improves upon U/S for each method on a random disentan-glement score and data set with noisy labels. The standard deviation is between 3% and 5% and canbe computed as √p(1 — p)∕120.
Table 9: Percentage of how often S2/S improves upon U/S for each method on a random disentan-glement score and data set with partial labels (only two factors observed). The standard deviation isbetween 3% and 5% and can be computed as，p(1 - p)∕120.
