Table 1: Comparison of the test error at the convergence between the original and the adapted NASarchitectures on CIFAR-10/100 and Tiny-ImageNet-200. The entire networks are constructed andtrained following the experimental settings reported in Appendix A.3, which may slightly deviatefrom the original ones. The test errors (or the parameter sizes) of original and adapted architecturesare reported on the left and right hand-side of slash respectively.
Table 2: Comparison of the width and depth of popular NAS cells and their randomly variants of con-nections. The name of the popular NAS cell is followed by its width and depth, which is separatedby a comma. The width of a cell is conventionally computed by assuming that each intermediatenode shares the same width c. Notably, the width and depth of random variants are in ascending anddescending order respectively from C1 to C13. Moreover, the popular NAS architectures achieve thelargest width and nearly the smallest depth among all the variants.
Table 3: Comparison of the parameter size (MB) of popular NAS cells and their randomly variantsof operations. C0 denotes the original NAS cell and C1 to C10 denote the random variants. Notably,there is a gap of ã€œ30% between the parameter size of the smallest architecture and one of the largestarchitecture.
