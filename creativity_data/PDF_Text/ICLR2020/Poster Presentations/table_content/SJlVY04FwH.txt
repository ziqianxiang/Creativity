Table 1: Comparisons between Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel updates. The second and third columns showwhen exactly an algorithm converges, with Jacobi or GS updates. The last column shows whether theconvergence region of Jacobi updates is contained in the GS convergence region.
Table 2: Optimal convergence rates. In the second column, β* denotes a specific parameter thatdepends on σ1 and σn (see equation 4.2). In the third column, the linear rates are for large κ. Theoptimal parameters for both Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel EG algorithms are the same. α denotes the stepsize (α1 = α2 = α), and β1 and β2 are hyper-parameters for EG and OGD, as given in §2.
