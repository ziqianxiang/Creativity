Table 1: Exploration performance of the proposed model, Active Neural SLAM (ANS) and baselines. Thebaselines are adated from [1] Savva et al. (2019), [2] Mirowski et al. (2017) and [3] Chen et al. (2019).
Table 2: Results of the ablation experiments on the Gibson environment.
Table 3: Performance of the proposed model, Active Neural SLAM (ANS) and all the baselines on theExploration task. ‘ANS - Task Transfer’ refers to the ANS model transferred to the PointGoal task after trainingon the Exploration task.
