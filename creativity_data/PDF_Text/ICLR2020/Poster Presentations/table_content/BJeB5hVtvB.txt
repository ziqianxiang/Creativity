Table 1: Test Accuracy, ECE and NLL of DBLE and baselines under 4 scenarios.
Table 2: Ablation study on CIFAR-100 and Tiny-ImageNet5.4	Algorithm Analysis and Ablation StudyDBLE alleviates the NLL overfitting problem. NLL overfitting problem of vanilla training hasbeen observed in (GUo et al., 2017) - after annealing the learning rate, as the test accuracy goes up,the model overfits to NLL score (test NLL starts to increase instead of decreasing or maintaining flat).
