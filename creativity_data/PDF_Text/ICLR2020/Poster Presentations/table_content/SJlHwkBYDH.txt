Table 1: Attack success rates (%) of adversarial attacks against seven models under single-model setting. The adversarial examples are crafted on Inc-v3, Inc-v4, IncRes-v2, and Res-101respectively. * indicates the white-box attacks.
Table 2: Attack success rates (%) of adversarial attacks against seven models under multi-model setting. * indicates the white-box models being attacked.
Table 3: Attack success rates (%) of adversarial attacks against the advanced defense methods.
Table 4: Attack success rates (%) of adversarial attacks against the models. The adversarialexamples are crafted on Inc-v3 using FGSM, I-FGSM, PGD, C&W, NI-FGSM, and SI-NI-FGSM.
