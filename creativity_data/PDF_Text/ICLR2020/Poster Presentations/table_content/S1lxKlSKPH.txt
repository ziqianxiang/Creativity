Table 1: Best FID scores for unconditional image generation on CIFAR-10 and CelebA.
Table 2: Comparison of our technique with state-of-the-art GAN models including SNGAN (Miy-ato & Koyama, 2018), SAGAN (Zhang et al., 2019) and BigGAN (Brock et al., 2018) for classconditional image generation on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet in terms of FID. BigGAN? is the Big-GAN implementation of Kurach et al. (2019). CR-BigGAN? has the exactly same architecture asBigGAN? and is trained with the same settings. The only difference is CR-BigGAN? adds consis-tency regularization.
Table 3: FID scores on CIFAR-10 for different types of image aUgmentation. GaUssian noise is theworst, and random shift and flip is the best, consistent with general consensUs on the best way toperform image optimization on CIFAR-10 (ZagorUyko & Komodakis, 2016).
