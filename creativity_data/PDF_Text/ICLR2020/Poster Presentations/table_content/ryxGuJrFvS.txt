Table 1: Average and worst-group accuracies for each training method. Both ERM and DRO modelsperform poorly on the worst-case group in the absence of regularization (top). With strong regu-larization (middle, bottom), DRO achieves high worst-group performance, significantly improvingfrom ERM. Cells are colored by accuracy, from low (red) to medium (white) to high (blue) accuracy.
Table 2: Average and worst-group test accuracies with and without group adjustments. Group ad-justments improve worst-group accuracy, though average accuracy drops for Waterbirds.
Table 3: Comparison of ERM, upweighting (UW), and group DRO models, with binomial standarddeviation in parenthesis. For each objective, we grid search over `2 penalty strength, number ofepochs, and group adjustments and report on the model with highest validation accuracy. Thesenumbers differ from the previous tables because of the larger grid search.
