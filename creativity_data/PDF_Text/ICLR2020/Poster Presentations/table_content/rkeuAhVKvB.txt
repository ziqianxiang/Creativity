Table 1: Statistics of the six KG datasets. PME (tr) means the proportion of multi-edge triples intrain; PME (va) means the proportion of multi-edge triples in validation; AL (va) means the averagelength of shortest paths connecting each head-tail pair in validation.
Table 2: Comparison results on the FB15K-237 and WN18RR datasets. Results of Q] are takenfrom (Nguyen et al., 2018),$] from (DettmerS et al., 2018), [^] from (Shen et al., 2018), [♦] from(Sun et al., 2018), [4] from (Das et al., 2018), and [z] from (Lacroix et al., 2018). Some collectedresults only have a metric score while some including ours take the form of “mean (std)”.
Table 3: Our standard hyperparameter settings we use for each dataset plus their one-epoch trainingtime. For experimental analysis, we only adjust one hyperparameter and keep the remaining fixedas the standard setting. For NELL995, the one-epoch training time means the average time cost ofthe 12 single-query-relation tasks.
