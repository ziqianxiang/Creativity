Table 1: Relative improvement metric, RI =100 × (Accm - Accr)/Accr (in %), where Accmand Accr are the accuracies of the search methodand random sampling baseline, respectively.
Table 2: Hyperparameters for different NAS methods. “S” denotes search stage and “A” denotesaugmentation stage. For learning rates, a J b means cosine annealing from a to b.
