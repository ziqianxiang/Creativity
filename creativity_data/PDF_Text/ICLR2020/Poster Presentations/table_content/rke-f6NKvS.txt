Table 1: The success rates of achieving thegoals for VINS and BC in the setting with-out any environment interactions. A randompolicy has about 5% success rate at Pick andPush.
Table 2: Ablation study of components of VINS in the setting without environment interactions.
Table 3: Ablation study of components of VINS in the setting without environment interactions. Wereported the average performance of 10 runs (with different random seeds) and the empirical standarderror of the estimator of the average performance. The success rate of BC w/ data augmentation isconsistently worse than BC w/o data augmentation. )E Additional ExperimentsWe have some additional experiments to evaluate VINS, which are (a) BC with data augmentation (b)VINS with oracle without negative sampling, which are explained below. The results are summarizedin Table 3.
Table 4: The success rates of achieving the goals for VINS and BC in the setting without anyenvironment interactions. We reported the average performance of 10 runs (with different seeds) andthe empirical standard error of the esitmator of the average performance. VINS outperforms BC inall tested environments.
