Table 1: Dataset statistics and results. SIMP datasets contain simple operators (“八，∨, -" for BOOLand “+, -” for Poly) while the rest contain all operators (i.e. “八，∨,-,㊉，⇒” for BOOL and “+,-,•" for Poly).㊉ is the Xor operator. The number in the dataset name is the maximum tree size ofthe parsed expressions within that dataset. L refers to a “larger” number of 10 variables. H refers tothe entropy of equivalence classes.
Table 2: Non semantically equivalent first nearest-neighbors from BOOL8. A checkmark indicatesthat the method correctly results in the nearest neighbor being from the same equivalence class.
