Table 1: For each case we generate 100 sparse graphs with 39 nodes and data matrices sampled (with n samples)from distributions with those underlying graphs. DeepGraph outperforms other methods in terms of AP, AUC,and precision at 5% (the approximate true sparsity). In terms of precision and AUC DeepGraph has betterperformance in all cases except n > p.

The data come from a cancer genome atlas from 2360 subjects for Various types ofcancer. We used the first 50 genes from Honorio et al. (2012, Appendix C.2) of commonly regulatedgenes in cancer. We eValuated on two groups of subjects, one with breast inVasiVe carcinoma (BRCA)consisting of 590 subjects and the other colon adenocarcinoma (CODA) consisting of 174 subjects.

For both control and autism patientswe use time series from 35 random subjects to estimate edges and corresponding precision matrices.
