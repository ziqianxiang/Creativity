Table 1: Test set error (bits/char) on Penn Treebank dataset for mLSTM compared with past work.
Table 2: Text8 dataset test set error in bits/char. Architectures labelled with small used a highlyrestrictive hidden dimensionality (512 for LSTM, 450 for LSTM)Table 1, where it can be seen that mLSTM achieved 1.35 bits/char test set error, compared with 1.38bits/char for an unregularized LSTM (Cooijmans et al., 2016).
Table 3: Raw wikipedia dataset validation error in bits/char. Results labelled with * use the errorsignal to update the hidden state, and architectures labelled with (dynamic) use gradient descentbased fitting to recent sequences to perform this adjustment.
Table 4: European parliament test error in bits/char for LSTM and mLSTM on English only, Spanishonly, and mixed English-Spanish.
