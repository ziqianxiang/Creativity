Figure 1: Basic structure of SGD accompanied with NDF. Blue part refers to SGD training processand yellow part is NDF.
Figure 2: Test accuracy curves of different data filtration strategies on IMDB sentiment classificationdataset. The x-axis records the number of effective training instances.
Figure 3: Data filtration ratio during training LSTM with NDF-REINFORCE and NDF-ActorCriticpolicies.
Figure 4: Sampled pictures from C-MNIST dataset. Each row represents a corrupted fold in trainingset, with the percentage of flipped pixels growing from 0% (top row) to 90% (bottom row).
