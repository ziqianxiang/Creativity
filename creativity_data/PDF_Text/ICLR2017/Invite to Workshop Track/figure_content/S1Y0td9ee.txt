Figure 1: Image of an H-hierarchical decomposition (in particular the egnn explained in § 4.2).
Figure 2: Pictorial representation of the H-hierarchical decomposition of a graph taken from theIMDB-BINARY dataset (see § 4.1) together with its compressed version.
Figure 3: domain-compressionof stratum Si (line 8). Algorithm 3 allows us to compute the domain compressed version of Eq. 3which can be obtained by replacing: X with XComp = C0X, Ri,π with RiC,oπmp = CiRi,πDi-1 andHi with HiComp. Willing to recover the original encodings Hi we just need to employ the decom-pression matrix Di on the compressed encodings HiComp, indeed Hi = DiHiComp.
