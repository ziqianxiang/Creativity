Figure 1: Illustration of atomic morphing types. (a) One convolutional layer is morphed into twoconvolutional layers; (b) TYPE-I and TYPE-II atomic morphing types.
Figure 2: Example modules and morphing processes. (a) Modules (A)-(C) are simple morphable,while (D) is not; (b) a morphing process for module (C), while for module (D), We are not able tofind such a process.
Figure 3: Detailed architectures of the ResNet module and the morph_1c1 module.
Figure 4: Sample modules adopted in the proposed experiments. (a) and (b) are the graph abstrac-tions of modules illustrated in Fig. 3(a) and (b).
Figure 5: Comparison results of ResNet and morphed networks on the CIFAR10 and CIFAR100datasets.
Figure 6: Evaluation errors on the ImageNet dataset.
