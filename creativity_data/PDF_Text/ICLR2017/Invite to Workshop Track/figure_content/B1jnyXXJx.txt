Figure 1: Architecture for BABI Test3.4.2	BABILoss on BABI Pathfinding Task: GRUAccuracy on BABI Pathfinding Task: GRULoss on BABI Pathfinding Task: LSTMAccuracy on BABI Pathfinding Task: LSTMEpochWe selected the path-finding problem of the BABI dataset due to it being the most difficult task.
Figure 2: Non-CPN Optimization PathsFigure 3: CPN Optimization PathsEach algorithm performed better when coupled with CPN than without, the loss was computed usingthe monkey saddle equation above. All the losses for both CPN and Non-CPN are available in Table2. CPN allowed the optimization algorithms to escape the saddle point quickly even though thegradient near the starting point of the optimization was near zero.
