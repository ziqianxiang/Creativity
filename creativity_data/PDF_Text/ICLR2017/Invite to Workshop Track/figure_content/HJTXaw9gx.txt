Figure 1: From left to right: the first figure shows the mean absolute error E1 , the second figureshows the mean absolute PDE error E2 and the third figure shows the loss Lθ as defined in algorithm4.1 over all the data. The horizontal axis represents the iteration number.
Figure 2: From left to right: the first figure shows the mean absolute error E1, the second figureshows the mean absolute PDE error E2 and the third figure shows the loss Lθ as defined in algorithm4.1 over all the data. The horizontal axis denotes iteration number.
Figure 3: From left to right: the first figure shows the mean absolute error E1, the second figureshows the mean absolute PDE error E2 and the third figure shows the loss Lθ as defined in algorithm4.1 over all the data.
Figure 4: From left to right: contours for experiment one, experiment two and experiment three. Asone can appreciate, the contours grow according to the specified dynamical model.
Figure 5: Contours obtained from the LevelSet Toolbox in Matlab.
Figure 6: From left to right: the first figure shows the mean absolute error E1, the second figureshows the mean absolute PDE error E2 and the third figure shows the loss Lθ as defined in algorithm4.1 over all the data.
Figure 7: The first column shows the first side view perpendicular with respect to the x-z plane. Thesecond column shows the second side view perpendicular with respect to the y-z plane. Finally, thethird column shows the top view which is perpendicular with respect to the x-y plane.
