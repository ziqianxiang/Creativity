Table 1: The training and test accuracy (in percentage) of various models on the CIFAR10 dataset.
Table 2: The top-1 and top-5 accuracy (in percentage) of the Inception v3 model on the ImageNetdataset. We compare the training and test accuracy with various regularization turned on and off,for both true labels and random labels. The original reported top-5 accuracy of the Alexnet onILSVRC 2012 is also listed for reference. The numbers in parentheses are the best test accuracyduring training, as a reference for potential performance gain of early stopping.
Table 3: Generalizing with kernels. The test error associated with solving the kernel equation (3) onsmall benchmarks. Note that changing the preprocessing can significantly change the resulting testerror.
