Table 1: Comparison to prior work. We report average health at the end of an episode for scenariosD1 and D2, and average frags at the end of an episode for scenarios D3 and D4.
Table 2: Generalization across environments.
Table 3: Generalization across goals. Each group of three columns corresponds to a training regime,each row corresponds to a test-time goal. The results in the first row indicate that the approachperforms well on the main task even without knowing the goal at training time. The results in theother rows indicate that goal-agnostic training supports generalization across goals at test time.
