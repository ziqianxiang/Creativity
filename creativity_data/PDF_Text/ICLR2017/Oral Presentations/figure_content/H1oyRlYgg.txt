Figure 1: A Conceptual Sketch of Flat and Sharp Minima. The Y-axis indicates value of the lossfunction and the X-axis the variables (parameters)2.2	Numerical ExperimentsIn this section, we present numerical results to support the observations made above. To this end,we make use of the visualization technique employed by (Goodfellow et al., 2014b) and a proposedheuristic metric of sharpness (Equation (4)). We consider 6 multi-class classification network con-figurations for our experiments; they are described in Table 1. The details about the data sets andnetwork configurations are presented in Appendices A and B respectively. As is common for suchproblems, we use the mean cross entropy loss as the objective function f.

Figure 3: Parametric Plots - Linear (Left vertical axis corresponds to cross-entropy loss, f, andright vertical axis corresponds to classification accuracy; solid line indicates training data set anddashed line indicated testing data set); α = 0 corresponds to the SB minimizer and α = 1 to the LBminimizer.
Figure 4: Testing Accuracy and Sharpness v/s Batch Size. The X-axis corresponds to the batch sizeused for training the network for 100 epochs, left Y-axis corresponds to the testing accuracy at thefinal iterate and right Y-axis corresponds to the sharpness of that iterate. We report sharpness fortwo values of e: 10-3 and 5 ∙ 10-4.
Figure 5: Warm-starting experiments. The upper figures report the testing accuracy of the SBmethod (blue line) and the testing accuracy of the warm started (piggybacked) LB method (red line),as a function of the number of epochs of the SB method. The lower figures plot the sharpness mea-sure (4) for the solutions obtained by the piggybacked LB method v/s the number of warm-startingepochs of the SB method.
