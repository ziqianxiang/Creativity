Figure 2: Left: Communication success as a function of training iterations, we see that informedsenders converge faster than agnostic ones. Right: Spectrum of an example symbol usage matrix:the first few dimensions do capture only partial variance, suggesting that the usage of more symbolsby the informed sender is not just due to synonymy.
Figure 3: t-SNE plots of object fc vectors color-coded by majority symbols assigned to them byinformed sender. Object class names shown for a random subset. Left: configuration of 4th row ofTable 1. Right: 2nd row of Table 2.
