Table 1: Overall results. The best test/validation accuracy during the retraining process is reported.
Table 2: VGG-16 on CIFAR-10 and the pruned model. The last two columns show the number offeature maps and the reduced percentage of FLOP from the pruned model.
Table 3: The reduction of FLop and wall-clock time for inference.
