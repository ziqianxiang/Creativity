Table 1: Network parameters. C7x7x32s2 = convolutional layer with 7x7 kernel, stride 2 and numberof output planes 32. MP = MaxPooling. Each convolutional and fully connected layer is followedby a ReLU, except for the last output layer.
Table 2: Parameters for different maps.
Table 3: Curriculum design for FlatMap. Note that enemy uses RocketLauncher except forClass 0 (Pistol).
Table 4: Avg/Max frags of each AIs in the internal tournament (150 episodes of 10 minutes each).
Table 5: Performance evaluation (in terms of frags) on two standard scenarios FlatMap andCIGTrack1 over 300 episodes. Our bot performs better with post-training rules.
Table 6: Top 3 teams in ViZDoom AI Competition, Track 1. Our bot attended 11 out of 12 games,won 10 of them and won the champion by a large margin. For design details, see Arnold [Lample &Chaplot (2016)] and CLYDE [Ratcliffe et al. (2017)].
