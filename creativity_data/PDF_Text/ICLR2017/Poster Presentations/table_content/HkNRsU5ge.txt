Table 1: Results on the MNIST and Temporal-MNIST datasets. MFlops indicates the number of oper-ations done by each network. For the Original Network, the number of Flops is considered when usingboth (Dense / Sparse) matrix operations. The “Class Error” column shows the classification error onthe training / test set respectively. The “Energy” is an estimate of the average energy that would be usedby arithmetic operations per sample, if the network were implemented with all integer values. This isbased on the estimates of Horowitz (2014). Again, for the Original Network, the figure is based on thenumbers for dense/sparse matrix operations.
