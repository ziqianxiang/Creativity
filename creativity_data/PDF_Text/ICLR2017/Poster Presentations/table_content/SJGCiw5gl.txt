Table 1: Spearman’s rank correlation of criteria vs. oracle for convolutional feature maps of VGG-16and AlexNet fine-tuned on Birds-200 and Flowers-102 datasets, and AlexNet trained on ImageNet.
Table 2: Actual speed up of networks pruned by Taylor criterion for various hardware setup. Allmeasurements were performed with PyTorch with cuDNN v5.1.0, except R3DCNN which wasimplemented in C++ with cuDNN v4.0.4). Results for ImageNet dataset are reported as top-5accuracy on validation set. Results on AlexNet / Flowers-102 are reported for pruning with 1000updates between iterations and no fine-tuning after pruning.
