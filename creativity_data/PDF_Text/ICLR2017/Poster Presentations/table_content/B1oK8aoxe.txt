Table 1: Parameters of algorithms for downstream tasks, measured in number of time-steps of thelow level controlB	Results for Gather with Benchmark settingsTo fairly compare our methods to previous work on the downstream Gather environment, we reporthere our results in the exact settings used in Duan et al. (2016): maximum path length of 500 andbatch-size of 50k. Our SNN hierarchical approach outperforms state-of-the-art intrinsic motivationresults like VIME (Houthooft et al., 2016).
