Table 1: a) Error of different models on the World Model Task. b) Generalization of an EntNettrained up to T = 20. All errors range from 0 to 1.
Table 2: Results on bAbI Tasks with 10k training samples.
Table 3: On the left, the network’s final “world model” after reading the story on the right. First andsecond nearest neighbors from each memory slot are shown, along with their cosine distance.
Table 4: Accuracy on CBT test set. Single-pass models encode the document before seeing thequery, multi-pass models have access to the query at read time.
Table 5: Error rates on bAbI Tasks with inputs are encoded using BoW. “Tied” refers to the casewhere key vectors are tied with entity embeddings.
Table 6: Results on bAbI Tasks with 1k samples.
