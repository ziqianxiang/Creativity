Table 1: Translation performance using the expert training dictionary, English into Italian.
Table 2: Translation performance using the expert training dictionary, Italian into English.
Table 3: Translation precision @1 from English to Italian using the expert training dictionary. Weachieve 69% precision on test cases selected from the 5k most common English words in the ukWaC,Wikipedia and BNC corpora. The precision falls for less common words.

Table 5: Translation performance, using the Europarl corpus as a phrase dictionary.
Table 6: “Translation” precision @1, when seeking to retrieve the true translation of an Englishsentence from a bag of 200k Italian sentences, or vice versa, averaged over 5k samples. We firstobtain bilingual word vectors, using either the word dictionary provided by Dinu, or by constructinga phrase dictionary from Europarl. We set ns = 12800 in the inverted softmax.
Table 7: “Translation” precision @5, when seeking to retrieve the true translation of an Englishsentence from a bag of 200k Italian sentences, or vice versa, averaged over 5k samples. We firstobtain bilingual word vectors, using either the word dictionary provided by Dinu, orby constructinga phrase dictionary from Europarl. We set ns = 12800 in the inverted softmax.
Table 8: “Translation” precision @10, when seeking to retrieve the true translation of an Englishsentence from a bag of 200k Italian sentences, or vice versa, averaged over 5k samples. We firstobtain bilingual word vectors, using either the word dictionary provided by Dinu, orby constructinga phrase dictionary from Europarl. We set ns = 12800 in the inverted softmax.
