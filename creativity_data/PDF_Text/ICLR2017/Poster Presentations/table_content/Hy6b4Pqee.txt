Table 1: Inference methods for a probabilistic decoder on binarized MNIST. The Edward PPL is aconvenient research platform, making it easy to both develop and experiment with many algorithms.
Table 2: hmc benchmark for large-scale logistic regression. Edward (GPU) is significantly fasterthan other systems. In addition, Edward has no overhead: it is as fast as handwritten TensorFlow.
