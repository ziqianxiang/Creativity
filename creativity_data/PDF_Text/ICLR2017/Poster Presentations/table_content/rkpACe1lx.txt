Table 1: Bits-per-character on the Penn Treebank test set.
Table 2: Bits-per-character on the enwik8 test set.
Table 3: Log-Loss of IAM Online DB validation set.
Table 4: Single model results on WMT Enâ†’Fr (newstest2014)The results are reported in Table 4, which shows that the HyperLSTM cell improves the performanceof the existing GNMT model, achieving state-of-the-art single model results for this dataset. In ad-dition, we demonstrate the applicability of hypernetworks to large-scale models used in productionsystems.
