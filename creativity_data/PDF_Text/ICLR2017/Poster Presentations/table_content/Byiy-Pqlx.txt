Table A.1: Parameter grid for grid search. LANTM(-s) means LANTM with invnorm or SoftMax;similarly for SLANTM(-s). RAM(/tape) means the ram and hybrid ram/tape models. Initialization:both initialization options set the forget gate of the LSTMs to 1. The number 1 in the init columnmeans initialization of all other parameters uniformly from [-1, 1]. The symbol * in init columnmeans initialization of all linear layers were done using the torch default, which initializes weightsuniformly from (-κ, κ), where κ is (input size)-1/2. For models with memory, this means that theLSTM input to hidden layer is initialized approximately from [-0.07, 0.07] (other than forget gate).
Table B.2: Comparison between scores of model with action interpolation and without action in-terpolation. Numbers represent the accuracy percentages on the fine/coarse evaluations on the out-of-sample 2× tasks. The S and L columns resp. indicate small and large sample training regimes.
