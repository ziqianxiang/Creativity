As wecan see, R-HSMM provides much better results on even small segments, dramatically outperformsHSMM variants and CRF-AE. Also note that, the sine function depicts short term dependencies, whileGaussian process has long dependency that determined by the kernel bandwidth. This demonstratesthe ability of R-HSMM in capturing the long or short term dependencies.
