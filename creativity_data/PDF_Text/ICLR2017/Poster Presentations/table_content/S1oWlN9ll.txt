Table 1: Test error rates (%) for feedforward neural network models.
Table 2: Test error rates (%) on SVHN, for CNNs with different numbers of filters. Number inbrackets is the difference between the errors of the binarized scheme and the full-precision network.
Table 3: Testing cross-entropy values of LSTM.
Table 4: Testing cross-entropy on War and Peace, for LSTMs with different time steps (T S). Differ-ence between cross-entropies of binarized scheme and full-precision network is shown in brackets.
