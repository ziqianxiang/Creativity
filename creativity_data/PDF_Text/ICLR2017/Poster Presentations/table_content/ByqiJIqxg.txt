Table 1: Average percentage accuracy of prediction for activity recognition on 19 different individ-uals. The best results among the Baseline, the EM algorithm, RNN and Transfer Learning algorithmare highlighted in bold font. ↑(or J) indicates that Transfer Learning has significantly better (orworse) accuracy than the the best algorithm among the baseline, EM and RNN under the Wilcoxonsigned rank test with p-value < 0.05.
Table 2: Average percentage accuracy of prediction for flow direction prediction for 9 differentdomains. The best results among the Baseline, the EM algorithm, RNN and the Transfer Learningalgorithm are highlighted in bold font. ↑(or J) indicates that transfer learning has significantly better(or worse) accuracy than the best technique among the baseline algorithm, EM and RNN underWilcoxon signed rank test with pvalue < 0.05.
