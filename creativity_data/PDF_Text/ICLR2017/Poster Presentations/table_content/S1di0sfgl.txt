Table 1: BPConthe Penn Treebank test set (left) and Hutter Prize WikiPedia test set (right). (*) Thismodel is a variant of the HM-LSTM that does not discretize the boundary detector states. (f) Thesemodels are imPlemented by the authors to evaluate the Performance using layer normalization (Baet al., 2016) with the additional output module. @) This method uses test error signals for predictingthe next characters, which makes it not comParable to other methods that do not.
