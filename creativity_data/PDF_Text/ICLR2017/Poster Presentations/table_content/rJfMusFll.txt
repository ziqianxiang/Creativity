Table 1: The results on the Mechanical Turk experiments using the restaurant dataset. The first two columnsare the mean labels of all responses before and after applying BPG on the bots initialised via maximum like-lihood. The last two columns are the p-values using a paired t-test and a paired Wilcoxon signed rank test.
Table 2: Some qualitative results on the AMT experiment using restaurant data. In each cell, the text inblack/grey show the history of a conversation between the customer and a human agent. The dots . . . meanthat the part of the conversation history is hidden. The blue response is by the bot trained using maximumlikelihood (ML) alone. The red response is by the bot improved with BPG after ML. The numbers on the rightof the blue/red responses are the average scores each response received from 2-3 AMT workers.
