Table 1: Error rates (%) on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. All methods in the same group are trainedfor the same number of iterations. Results of our method are colored in blue, and the best result for eachnetwork/dataset pair are bolded. * indicates numbers which We take directly from Huang et al.(2016a).
Table 2: Top-1 error rates (%) on ImageNet validationset using ResNet-50 with varying number of cycles.
Table 3: Error rates ofa DenseNet-40 SnapshotEnsemble on CIFAR-100,varying M â€”the number ofmodels (cycles) used in theensemble.
