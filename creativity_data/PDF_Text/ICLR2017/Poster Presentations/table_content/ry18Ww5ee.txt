Table 1: Values of ni and ri for the brackets of HYPER-BAND when R = 81 and Î· = 3.
Table 2: The test error and duration columns show the average value plus/minus the standard deviationacross 50 trials. Duration is measured in minutes and indicates how long it took each method toevaluate the grid of 610 hyperparameters used in Krueger et al. (2015). The ratio column shows theratio of the duration for Hyperband over that for CVST with associated standard deviation.
Table 3: Hyperparameter space for the LeNet application of Section 3.2. Note that the number ofkernels in Layer-1 is upper bounded by the number of kernels in Layer-2.
Table 4: Hyperparameters and associated ranges for the three-layer convolutional network.
