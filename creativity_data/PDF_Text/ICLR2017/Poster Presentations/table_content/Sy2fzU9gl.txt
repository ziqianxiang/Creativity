Table 1: Details of model architectures used in the paper. The models were trained using eitheradagrad (Duchi et al., 2011) or adam (Kingma & Ba, 2014) optimisers.
Table 2: Linear classifier classification accuracy for predicting the ground truth values for each datagenerative factor from different latent representations. Each factor could take a variable number ofpossible values: 3 for id, 6 for scale, 40 for rotation and 32 for position X or Y. Best performingmodel results in each column are printed in bold.
