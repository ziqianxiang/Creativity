This approach is novel andhas three key features. First, by learning a transformation of a simple distribution rather than thedistribution itself, we are able to avoid explicitly computing an intractable normalizing constant forthe ME distribution. Second, by combining stochastic optimization with the augmented Lagrangianmethod, we can fit the model efficiently, allowing us to evaluate the ME density of any point simplyand accurately. Third, critically, this construction allows us to trivially sample iid from a ME dis-tribution, extending the utility and efficiency of the ME framework more generally. Also, accuracyequivalent to the classic Gibbs approach is in itself a contribution (owing to these other features).
