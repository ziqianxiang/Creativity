Table 1: Comparison of four agent architectures over five maze configurations, including random and staticgoals. AUC (Area under learning curve), Score, and % Human are averaged over the best 5 hyperparameters.
Table 2: Comparison of five navigation agent architectures over five maze configurations with random andstatic goals, including agents performing reward prediction Nav A3C*+R and Nav A3C+RD2, where rewardprediction is implemented following (Jaderberg et al., 2017). We report the AUC (Area under learning curve),averaged over the best 5 hyperparameters.
Table 3: Asymptotic performance analysis of two agents in the Random Goal 2 maze, comparing training for120M Labyrinth frames vs. 240M frames.
