Table 1: The irreducible representations of the roto-reflection group D4. This group is generated by90-degree rotations r and mirror reflections m, and has 5 irreps labelled A1, A2, B1, B2, E. Left:decomposition of π0 (eq. 1) in the space F0 of 3 × 3 filters with one channel. This representationturns out to have type (3, 0, 1, 1, 2), meaning there are three copies of A1, one copy of B1, onecopy of B2, and two copies of the 2D irrep E (A2 does not appear). Right: the representationmatrices of each irrep, for each element of the group D4. The reader may verify that these are validrepresentations, and that the characters (traces) are orthogonal.
Table 2: Comparison of results of steerable CNNs vs. previous state of the art methods. A plus (+)indicates modest data augmentation (shifts and flips). Width for steerable CNNs is reported as a pairof numbers, one for the input / output layer of a ResNet block, and one for the intermediate layer.
