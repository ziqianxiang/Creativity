Figure 1: Model architectures: “Char NN” denotes character-level neural networks, “Word NN”denotes word-level neural networks, “Char Emb” and “Word Emb” refer to character embeddingsand word embeddings respectively.
Figure 2: Results on transfer learning. Cross-domain transfer: Figures 2(a), 2(d), and 2(e). Cross-applicationtransfer: Figures 2(f), 2(g), and 2(h). Cross-lingual transfer: Figures 2(i) and 2(j). Transfer across domains andapplications: Figure 2(b). Transfer across domains, applications, and languages: Figure 2(c).
