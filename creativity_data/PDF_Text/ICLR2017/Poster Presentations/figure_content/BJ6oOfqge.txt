Figure 1: Structure of the training pass in our methods. Top: Î -model. Bottom: temporal en-sembling. Labels yi are available only for the labeled inputs, and the associated cross-entropy losscomponent is evaluated only for those.
Figure 2: Percentage of correct SVHN classifications as a function of training epoch when a part ofthe labels is randomized. With standard supervised training (left) the classification accuracy sufferswhen even a small portion of the labels give disinformation, and the situation worsens quickly asthe portion of randomized labels increases to 50% or more. On the other hand, temporal ensembling(right) shows almost perfect resistance to disinformation when half of the labels are random, andretains over ninety percent classification accuracy even when 80% of the labels are random.
