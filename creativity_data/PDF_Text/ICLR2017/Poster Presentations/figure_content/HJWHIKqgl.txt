Figure 4: MNIST digits from various models. Part d shows six runs of the minibatch discriminationmodel of Salimans et al. (2016), trained without labels — the same model that, with labels, generatedFigure 3b. (The third row is the closest We got the model to generating digits without any labels.)ReferencesV.
