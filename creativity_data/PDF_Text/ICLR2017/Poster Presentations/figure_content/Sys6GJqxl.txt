Figure 1: The CDF of the minimal transferable RMSD from VGG-16 to ResNet-152 using FG (a)and FGS (b). The green line labels the median minimal transferable RMSD, while the red line labelsthe minimal transferable RMSD to reach 90% percentage.
Figure 2: The example image to study the decision boundary. Its ID in ILSVRC 2012 validation setis 49443, and its ground truth label is “anemone fish.”ResNet-152GoogLeNet-15 -10 -5 0	5 10 15 2βU10550αlβFigure 3: Decision regions of different models. We pick the same two directions for all plots: one isthe gradient direction of VGG-16 (x-axis), and the other is a random orthogonal direction (y-axis).

Figure 4: The decision boundary to sep-arate the region within which all pointsare classified as the ground truth label(encircled by each closed curve) fromothers. The plane is the same one de-scribed in Figure 3. The origin ofthe coordinate plane corresponds to theoriginal image. The units of both axisesare 1 pixel values.
Figure 5: The decision boundary to separate theregion within which all points are classified as thetarget label (encircled by each closed curve) fromothers. The plane is spanned by the targeted ad-versarial direction and a random orthogonal di-rection. The targeted adversarial direction is com-puted as the difference between the original imagein Figure 2 and the adversarial image generated bythe optimization-based approach for an ensemble.
