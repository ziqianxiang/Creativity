Figure 1: Four examples of trees and their corresponding shift (S) and reduce (R) sequences. Ineach of the examples, there are 4 input words (4 leaf nodes), so 7 operations (4 S, 3 R) are neededto construct a valid tree. The nodes are labeled with the timesteps in which they are introduced tothe trees t âˆˆ {1,..., 7}. A shift operation introduces a leaf node, whereas a reduce operationintroduces a non-leaf node by combining two previously introduced nodes. We can see that differentS-R sequences lead to different tree structures.
Figure 2: Examples of tree structures learned by our model which show that the model discoverssimple concepts such as noun phrases and verb phrases.
