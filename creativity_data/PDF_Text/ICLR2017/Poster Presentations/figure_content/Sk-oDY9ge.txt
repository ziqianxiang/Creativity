Figure 1: Our model is composed of 3 networks, one basic and two auxiliary networks: (a) a basicdiscriminative network with optional reconstruction path (dashed arrow), (b) a network that predictsthe input fat layer parameters, and (c) a network that predicts the reconstruction fat layer parameters(if any). First layer in the ”prediction networks” (b, c) represents embedding (Emb.). Each MLPblock may contain any number of hidden layers. We and WdT represent the parameters of the fathidden layer and the fat reconstruction layer of the basic network (a), respectively. These parametersare predicted by auxiliary networks (b) and (c) - also called parameter prediction networks - toreduce the number of free parameters of (a).
