Figure 1: EBGAN architecture with an auto-encoder discriminator.
Figure 2: (Zooming in on pdf file is recommended.) Histogram of the inception scores from thegrid search. The x-axis carries the inception score I and y-axis informs the portion of the models(in percentage) falling into certain bins. Left (a): general comparison of EBGANs against GANs;Middle (b): EBGANs and GANs both constrained by nLayer[GD]<=4; Right (c): EBGANs andGANs both constrained by nLayer[GD]<=3.
Figure 3: (Zooming in on pdf file is recommended.) Histogram of the inception scores groupedby different optimization combinations, drawn from optimD, optimG and lr (See text).

Figure 9: Generation from the EBGAN auto-encoder model trained with different m settings. Fromtop to bottom, m is set to 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 32 respectively. The rest setting is nLayerG=5,nLayerD=2, sizeG=1600, sizeD=1024, dropoutD=0, optimD=ADAM, optimG=ADAM,lr=0.001.
Figure 10: Generation from the EBGAN-LN model. The displayed generations are obtained byan identical experimental setting described in appendix D, with different random seeds. As wementioned before, we used the unpadded version of the MNIST dataset (size 28×28) in the EBGAN-LN experiments.
