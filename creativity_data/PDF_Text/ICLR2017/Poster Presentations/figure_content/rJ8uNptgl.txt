Figure 2: Accuracy versus average codeword length per network parameter after network quanti-zation, Huffman coding and fine-tuning for LeNet and 32-layer ResNet when Hessian is computedwith 50,000 or 1,000 samples and when the square roots of the second moment estimates of gradientsare used instead of Hessian as an alternative.
Figure 3: Accuracy versus average codeword length per network parameter after network quanti-zation, Huffman coding and fine-tuning for 32-layer ResNet when uniform quantization with non-weighted mean and uniform quantization with Hessian-weighted mean are used.
