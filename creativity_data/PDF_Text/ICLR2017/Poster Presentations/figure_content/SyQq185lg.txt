Figure 1: Distribution of the characters covered by the n-grams of the word piece models. Wetrain Latent Sequence Decompositions (LSD) and MaXimum EXtension (MaXEXt) models with n ∈{2, 3, 4, 5} sized word piece vocabulary and measure the distribution of the characters covered bythe word pieces. The bars with the solid fill represents the LSD models, and the bars with the starhatch fill represents the MaXEXt models. Both the LSD and MaXEXt models prefer to use n ≥ 2sized word pieces to cover the majority of the characters. The MaXEXt models prefers longer wordpieces to cover characters compared to the LSD models.
