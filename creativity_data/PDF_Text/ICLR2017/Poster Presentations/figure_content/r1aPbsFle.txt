Figure 1: Subspace distance between LT and W for different experiment conditions for the validation ex-periments. Results are averaged over 10 independent runs. These results validate our theory under practicalconditions.
Figure 2: Progress of validation perplexities during training for the 4 different models for two (small (200) andlarge (1500)) network sizes.
