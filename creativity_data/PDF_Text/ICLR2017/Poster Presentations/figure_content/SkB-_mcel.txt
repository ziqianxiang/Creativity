Figure 1: Schematic sketch of a three layer neural network trained with backpropagation based onobjective (2). Vθ refers to the gradient w.r.t. θ.
Figure 2: Hidden activation distributions for a simple one-layer classification network with sigmoidactivation functions and five hidden nodes trained with the standard objective (1) (left) and objec-tive (2) that includes the domain discrepancy minimization (right). The approach of this paper wasused as domain regularizer. Dark gray: activations of the source domain, light gray: activations ofthe target domain.
Figure 3: Sensitivity of classification accuracy w. r. t. different parameters of CMD (left) and MMD(right) on the Amazon reviews dataset. The horizontal axes show parameter values and the verticalaxes show accuracy ratio values. Each line represents accuracy ratio values for one specific task. Theratio values are computed w. r. t. the default accuracy for CMD (upper left), w. r. t. the best obtainableaccuracy for MMD (upper right) and w. r. t. the non domain regularized network accuracies (lowerleft and lower right).
