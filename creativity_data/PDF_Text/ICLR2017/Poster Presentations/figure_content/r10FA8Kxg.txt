Figure 1: Accuracy of student models with differ-ent architectures trained to mimic the CIFAR10ensemble. The average performance of the fivebest models of each hyperparameter-optimizationexperiment is shown, together with dashed linesindicating the accuracy of the best and the fifthbest model from each setting. The short horizontallines at 10M parameters are the accuracy of mod-els trained without compression on the original 0/1hard targets.
