Figure 1: True energy functions and samples from synthetic distributions. Green dots in the sampleplots indicate the mean of each Gaussian component.
Figure 2: Learned energies and samples from baseline models whose discriminator cannot retaindensity information at the optimal. In the sample plots, blue dots indicate generated samples, andred dots indicate real ones.
Figure 3: Learned energies and samples from proposed models whose discriminator can retain den-sity information at the optimal. Blue dots are generated samples, and red dots are real ones.
