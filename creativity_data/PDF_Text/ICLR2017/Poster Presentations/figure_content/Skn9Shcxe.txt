Figure 1: Illustrating our usage of blocks andstages in Highway and Residual networks.
Figure 2: (a) A single neural network layerthat directly computes the desired represen-tation. (b) The unrolled iterative estimationstage (e.g. from a Residual network) stretchesthe computation over three layers by first pro-viding a noisy estimate of that representation,but then iteratively refines it over the next tolayers. (c) A classic group of three layerscan also distribute the computation, but theywould produce a new representation at eachlayer. The iterative estimation stage in (b) canbe seen as a middle ground between a singleclassic neural network layer, (a), and multipleclassic layers, (c).
Figure 3: Experimental corroboration of Equation 1. The average estimation error - an empiricalestimate of the LHS in Equation 1 - for each block of each stage (x-axis). It stays close to zeroin all stages of a 50-layer ResNet trained on the ILSVRC-2015 dataset. The standard deviation ofthe estimation error decreases as depth increases in each stage (left to right), indicating iterativerefinement of the representations.
