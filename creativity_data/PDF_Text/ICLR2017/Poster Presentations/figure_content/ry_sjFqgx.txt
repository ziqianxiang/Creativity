Figure 1: Syntax of TChar language for character level language modeling. Program semantics aregiven in the appendix.
Figure 2: Illustration of a probabilistic model built on an input sequence 0a1a2b1b20 using pro-gram p. (Left) The dataset of samples specified by the input and the result of executing program pon each sample. (Top Right) The result of executing program f1 on a subset of samples selected byprogram p and the corresponding probability distribution Pf1 . (Bottom Right) The result of execut-ing empty program f2 and it’s corresponding unconditioned probability distribution Pf2. We use thenotation ε to describe an empty sequence.
Figure 3: TChar language small-step semantics. Each rule is of the type: TChar × States →TChar × S tates.
