Figure 1: High-level architectures of our proposed models: the NSE Query Gating model (a) andthe NSE Adaptive Computation model (b). The query memory of the former is gated to the next stepby the write module whereas the query memory in the latter is updated and passed to the next stepwithout gating and the write module is trained to halt the hypothesis-test loop. r: read, c: composeand w: write module.
Figure 2: Visualization of query regression process in the NSE query gating model. On the top,input document along with the correct answer is shown. The top-3 attended words throughout thehypothesis-testing loop are highlighted. On the bottom, we visualize the states of the memory keyztq and the query gate gtq . The hypothesis-testing steps t ranging from 1 to 6 are only shown due tothe space limitation. The gating value near one is to ignore a new query update while the memorykey value closer to zero indicates a new query update position.
Figure 3: Visualization of query regression process in the NSE adaptive computation model. On thetop, input document along with the correct answer is shown. The top-3 attended words throughoutthe hypothesis-testing loop are highlighted. On the bottom, we visualize the states of the memorykey ztq and the termination head. The memory key value closer to zero indicates a new query updateposition and the termination score closer to one is to halt the hypothesis testing loop.
