Figure 1: Snapshot of the unrolled model at timestep i with K = 3 tiers. As a simplification onlyone RNN and up-sampling ratio r = 4 is used for all tiers.
Figure 2: Examples from the datasets compared to samples from our models. In the first 3 rows, 2seconds of audio are shown. In the bottom 3 rows, 100 milliseconds of audio are shown. Rows 1and 4 are ground truth from which one can see how the datasets look different and have complexstructure in low resolution which the frame-level component of the SampleRNN is designed tocapture. Samples also to some extent mimic the same global structure. At the same time, zoomed-insamples of our model shows that it can perfectly resemble the high resolution structure present inthe data as well.
