Figure 1: Best viewed in color. (a) Convolutional arithmetic circuit architecture analyzed in thispaper (see description in sec. 3). (b) Shallow network with global pooling in its single hidden layer.
Figure 2: Sample of images from our synthetic classification benchmark. Each image displays arandom blob with holes, whose morphological closure and left-right symmetry about its center aremeasured. TWo classification tasks are defined - one for closedness and one for symmetry. In eachtask, the objective is to distinguish between blobs whose respective property (closedness/symmetry)is high, and ones for Which it is loW. The tasks differ in nature - closedness requires modelingcorrelations betWeen neighboring pixels, Whereas symmetry requires modeling correlations betWeenpixels and their reflections.
Figure 3: Results of applying a deep convolutional arithmetic circuit to closedness and symmetryclassification tasks. TWo pooling geometries were evaluated - square, which supports modeling Cor-relations between neighboring input regions, and mirror, which puts focus on correlations betweenregions that are symmetric w.r.t. one another. Each pooling geometry outperforms the other on thetask for which its correlations are important, demonstrating how prior knowledge regarding a taskat hand may be used to tailor the inductive bias through proper pooling design.
Figure 4: Results of applying deep convolutional rectifier networks to closedness and symmetryclassification tasks. The same trends observed with the deep convolutional arithmetic circuit (fig. 3)are apparent here.
