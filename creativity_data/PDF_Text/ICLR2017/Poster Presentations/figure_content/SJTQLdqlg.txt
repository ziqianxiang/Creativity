Figure 1: The operation of the memory module on a query q with correct value v ; see text for details.
Figure 2: The GNMT model with added memory module. On each decoding step t, the result ofthe attention at is used to query the memory. The resulting value is combined with the output of thefinal LSTM layer to produce the predicted logits yt. See text for further details.
Figure 3: Extended Neural GPU with memory module. Memory query is read from the position onebelow the current output logit, and the embedded memory value is put at the same position of theoutput tape p. The network learns to use these values to produce the output in the next step.
