Figure 1: Overview of the Dynamic Coattention Network.
Figure 2: Coattention encoder. The affinity matrix L is not shown here. We instead directly showthe normalized attention weights AD and AQ.
Figure 3: Dynamic Decoder. Blue denotes the variables and functions related to estimating the startposition whereas red denotes the variables and functions related to estimating the end position.
Figure 4: Highway Maxout Network. Dottedlines denote highway connections.
Figure 5: Examples of the start and end conditional distributions produced by the dynamic decoder.
Figure 6: Performance of the DCN for various lengths of documents, questions, and answers. Theblue dot indicates the mean F1 at given length. The vertical bar represents the standard deviation ofF1s at a given length.
Figure 7: Performance of the DCN across ques-tion types. The height of each bar represents themean F1 for the given question type. The lowernumber denotes how many instances in the dev set8are of the corresponding question type.
