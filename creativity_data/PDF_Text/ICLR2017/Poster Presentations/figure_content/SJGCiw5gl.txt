Figure 12: Comparison of our iterative pruning with pruning by regularizationTable 3 contains a layer-by-layer listing of Spearmanâ€™s rank correlation of several criteria with theranking of oracle-abs. In this more detailed comparison, we see the Taylor criterion shows highercorrelation for all individual layers. For several methods including Taylor, the worst correlationsare observed for the middle of the network, layers 5-10. We also evaluate several techniques fornormalization of the raw criteria values for comparison across layers. The table shows the bestperformance is obtained by `2 normalization, hence we select it for our method.
