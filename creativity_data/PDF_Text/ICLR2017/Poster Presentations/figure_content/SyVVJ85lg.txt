Figure 1: Overview of the Paleo modeling approach. Paleo decomposes execution time intocomputation time and communication time, which can be derived from various factors implicitlyspecified by network architectures and hardware configurations.
Figure 2: (a) The execution time of a node in the computation graph consists of the time for fetchinginput, computing results, and writing results to memory. (b) An example of a sequential computationgraph segment. (c) An example of a parallel computation graph segment.
Figure 3: Comparison of Paleo projected speedups for various networks under different scalingstrategies and communication schemes. (a-b) weak scaling. (c-d) strong scaling.
