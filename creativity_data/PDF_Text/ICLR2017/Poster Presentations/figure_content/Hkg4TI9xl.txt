Figure 1: A neural network classifying a diamond image with an auxiliary decoder and an abnormal-ity module. Circles are neurons, either having a GELU or sigmoid activation. The blurred diamondreconstruction precedes subtraction and elementwise squaring. The probability vector is the soft-max probability vector. Blue layers train on in-distribution data, and red layers train on both in- andout-of-distribution examples.
