Figure 1: Example training and validation curves for an unnoised model and model regularizedusing the bigram Kneser-Ney noising scheme.
Figure 2: Perplexity with noising on Penn Tree-bank while varying the value of γ0 . Using dis-counting to scale γ0 (yielding γAD) maintainsgains for a range of values of noising probabil-ity, which is not true for the unscaled case.
Figure 3: Mean KL-divergence over validationset between softmax distributions of noised andunnoised models and lower order distributions.
