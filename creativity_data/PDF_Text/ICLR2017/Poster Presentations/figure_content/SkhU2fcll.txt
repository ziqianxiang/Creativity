Figure 1: Illustrative example with two tasks corresponding to two neural networks in homogeneous(single output) and heterogeneous (different output dimension) cases. Weight layers grouped bysolid rectangles are tied across networks. Weight layers grouped by dashed rectangles are softlyshared across networks with our method. Ungrouped weights are independent.
Figure 2: Homogeneous MTL: digit recognition on MNIST dataset. Each digit provides a task.
Figure 3: Heterogeneous MTL: Age and Gender recognition in AdienceFace dataset.
