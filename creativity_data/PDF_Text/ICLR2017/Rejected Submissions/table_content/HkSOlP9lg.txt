Table 1: Color denoising. Denoisingperformance on the 68 images for Ïƒ =25 after 8-bit quantization. Resultsfor RTF-5 (Schmidt et al., 2016) andCBM3D (Dabov et al., 2007b) adoptedfrom Schmidt et al. (2016). In paren-thesis are results for the full 100 testimages.
Table 2: Denoising performance on gray-scale images from BSD-300 test set. Shown are meanPSNR values for different noise values. Number outside of parenthesis correspond to test perfor-mance on the 68 test images from Roth & Black (2005), and numbers in parenthesis correspondto performance on all 100 test images from BSD-300. 68 image performance for KSVD (Elad &Aharon, 2006), FoE (Roth & Black, 2005), BM3D (Dabov et al., 2007a), LSSC (Mairal et al., 2009),EPLL (Zoran & Weiss, 2011), and opt-MRF (Chen et al., 2013) adopted from Chen et al. (2013).
Table 3: Image super-resolution performance on RGB images from BSD-300 test set. Mean andstandard deviation (of the mean) of Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural SimilarityIndex (SSIM) Wan (2004). Standard deviation of the mean was estimated from 10.000 boostrapsamples. Test protocol and images taken from Huang et al. (2015). Only the three best performingmethods from Huang et al. (2015) were chosen for comparison: SRCNN Dong et al. (2014), A+Timofte et al. (2015), SelfExSR Huang et al. (2015). Best mean values in bold.
