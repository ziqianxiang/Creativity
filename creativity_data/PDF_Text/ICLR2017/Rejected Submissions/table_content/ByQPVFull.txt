There are a few baseline models fallinginto the same paradigm that we can compare with. One is the SVM+ method (Pechyony & Vapnik,2011) and the other one is the standard model (i.e., the ResNet-18). We simply refer to ResNet-18by baseline ifno confusion occurs. In the experiments, we implement the SVM+ using the code pro-vided by Pechyony & Vapnik (2011) with default parameter settings and linear kernel. We followthe scheme as described in Lapin et al. (2014) to train the SVM+ model. More concretely, we trainmultiple one-versus-rest SVM+ models upon the deep features extracted from both the entire imagesand the foreground regions (used as the privileged information). We use the averaged pooling over10 crops on the feature maps before the FC layer as the deep feature for training SVM+. It is worthnoting that all of these models (including SVM+ and GoCNN) use a linear classifier and thus havethe same number of parameters, or more concretely, GoCNN does not require more parameters thanSVM+ and the vanilla ResNet.
