Table 2: The details of ETH datasetStatistic	set01	set02	set03Positive images	999	446	354Negative images	0	5	0Annotated windows	8466	3472	2225In order to evaluate the generalization performance of our proposed method, we train our proposedmethod on the INRIA dataset, and then apply the trained model to the ETH dataset. The performanceevaluation is the same as that on the INRIA dataset. The average time to process an image usingour model (FRCNN+BN) is about 0.4 seconds, while the average time of the Fast R-CNN is about0.5 seconds. We compare our model with other methods, such as ConvNet Sermanet et al. (2013),JointDeep Ouyang & Wang (2013), FRCNN Girshick (2015), SDN Luo et al. (2014), TA-CNN Tianet al. (2015), VJ Viola & Jones (2004), HOG Dalal & Triggs (2005), ACF Dollar et al. (2014),VeryFast Rodrigo et al. (2012). The comparison results are shown in Figure 5, from which we cansee that our method outperforms VJ, HOG, VeryFast, ACF, ConvNet, FRCNN and JointDeep butunderperforms SDN, SpatialPooling and TA-CNN methods.
