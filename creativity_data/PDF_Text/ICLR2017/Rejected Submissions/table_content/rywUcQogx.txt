Table 1: Example images for Flickr30k (top) and IAPR TC-12 (bottom)is annotated with five different textual descriptions. The train-validation-test split for Flickr30kis 28000-1000-1000. In terms of evaluation setup, we follow the related work and report resultson two different evaluation protocols. Protocol pooled pools the five available captions into one"concatenated" text, meaning that only one but richer text annotation remains per image. This isdone for all three sets. Protocol 5 captions pools only the captions of the train set and keeps fiveseparate annotations for validation and test set. The IAPR TC-12 dataset contains 20000 naturalimages where only one - but compared to FliCkr30k more detailed - caption is available for eachimage. As no predefined train-validation-test split is provided, we randomly select 2000 images fortesting, 1000 for validation and keep the rest for training. Yan & Mikolajczyk (2015) also use 2000images for testing, but did not explicitly mention hold out images for validation. Table 1 shows anexample image along with its corresponding captions or caption for either dataset.
