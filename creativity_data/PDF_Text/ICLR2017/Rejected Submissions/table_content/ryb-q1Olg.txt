Table 1: Results are the mean of 100 instances for each simulated data sets. Data sets M1 and A1-A3 were multiplicative and additive bicluster, respectively. The numbers denote average consensusscores with the true biclusters together with their standard deviations in parentheses. The best resultsare printed bold and the second best in italics (“better” means significantly better according to botha paired t-test and a McNemar test of correct elements in biclusters).
Table 2: Results on the (A) breast cancer, (B) multiPle tissue samPles, (C) diffuse large-B-celllymPhoma (DLBCL) data sets measured by the consensus score. An “nc” entry means that themethod did not converge for this data set. The best results are in bold and the second best in italics(“better” means significantly better according to a McNemar test of correct samPles in clusters).
