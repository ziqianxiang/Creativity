Table 1: Glimpses per image vs Classification Accuracy of ARCGLIMPSES ACCURACY1	58.2%2	65.0%4	80.8%6	89.25%8	92.08%(a) ARC is very unsure of similarity at the beginning. But at 5th glimpse (4th column), the attentiongoes over the region where there are strokes in the first image and no strokes in the second oneresulting in dropping of the score.
Table 2: Performance of ARC vs conventional methods on the verification task. All values areaccuracies on the test set. For Wide ResNets, suffixes specify the depth and width. For example,(d=60, w=4) means that it is a ResNet that 60 is layers deep with each residual block having a widthmultiplier of 4.
