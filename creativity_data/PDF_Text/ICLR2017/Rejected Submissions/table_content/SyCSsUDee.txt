Table 1: Error rate (%) on the test set using the model with the best performance on the validationset. Numbers on the first row of each sub-table are the number of randomly chosen per-class train-ing examples. The average performance and the standard deviation of three different random-splitdatasets (except for the case using the entire training set in the last column) are described in this table(error rate on each random set is summarized in Appendix (A3)). Performance of three previous ap-proaches (with gray background; previous-1, 2, 3 are feed-forward model Figure 2(a), joint learningmodel with recon-one Figure 2(b), joint learning model with recon-all Figure 2(b), respectively) andthe proposed methods (proposed-1, 2, 3 are baseline Figure 1(b), random perturbation Figure 1(c),semantic perturbation Figure 1(c), respectively) is summarized.
