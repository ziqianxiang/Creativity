Table 1: Sparsity in percentage of the Morlet Filter-Bank in Fourier for different signal sizes andrealistic parameters (J = 9, Q = 16).
Table 2: Time (in sec.) needed to compute the filter-bank given the signal size with standard param-eters J = 5, Q = 16 growing linearly with the input size on 1 CPU @1.4GHz.
