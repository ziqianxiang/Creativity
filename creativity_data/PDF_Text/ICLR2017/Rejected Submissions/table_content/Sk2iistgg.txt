Table 1: Performance comparison on missing data completion on Oil Flow Dataset: Row 1 shows the amountof missing data and subsequent rows show the mean and standard deviation of the error in recovered datamatrix over 50 runs on 100 samples of oil flow dataset by: (1) The mean method (also the initialization ofother methods) where the missing entries are replaced by the mean of the known values of the correspondingattributes, (2) 1-nearest neighbor method in which missing entries are filled by the values of the nearest point,(3) PPCA Tipping & Bishop (1999), (4) PKPCA of Sanguinetti & Lawrence (2006), (5)RKPCA Nguyen & Dela Torre (2009) and our method.
Table 2: 3D reconstruction errors for linear and non-linear dimensionality regularization with ground truthcamera poses. Column 1 and 4 gives gives error for TNH while column (2-3) and (5-6) gives the correspondingerror for proposed method with different width of RBF kernel. Row 5 reports the mean error over 4 sequences.
Table 3: Robust dimensionality reduction accuracy by KPCA versus our closed-form solution on the full oilflow dataset. Columns from left to right represent: (1) standard deviation of the noise in training samples (2-3)Error in the estimated low-dimensional kernel matrix by (2) KPCA and (3) our closed-form solution, (4-5)Nearest neighbor classification error of test data using (4) KPCA and (5) our closed-form solution respectively.
Table 4: 3D reconstruction errors for linear and non-linear dimensionality regularization with noisy camerapose initialization from rigid factorization and refined in alternation with shape. The format is same as Table 2.
Table 5: 3D reconstruction errors for different NRSfM approaches and our TNH Algorithm given ground truthcamera projection matrices. Results for all the methods (except TNH) are taken from Dai et al. (2014).
