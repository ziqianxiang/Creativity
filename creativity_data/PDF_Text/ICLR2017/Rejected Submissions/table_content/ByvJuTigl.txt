Table 1: Drone task: test performance of different methods with 4000 training samples6.3	Results: Optimization of End-to-End PerformanceHallway task: While HFs excel with very few data, E2E-HFs surpass them if more than 2000 train-ing samples are available (see gray and yellow lines in Fig. 5a). For the mean squared error metric,the best method is the E2E-HF with a mean squared error objective (yellow line). However, if wecare about a different metric, e.g. accuracy of estimating the discrete state, the methods rank differ-ently (see Fig. 5b). The best method for the previous metric (yellow line) is outperformed by HFs(gray line) and even more so by E2E-HFs that are optimized for accuracy (teal line). For yet anothermetric, i.e. accuracy of predicting future observations, HFs outperform both other approaches butare equal to E2E-HFs optimized for predicting future observations (see Fig. 5c).
