Table 1: Conversion rates on all three tasks with 100 steps of SGD. Note that satisfying the constraintshas no negative affect on accuracy and often has a positive affect.
Table 2: An example for which enforcing the constraints improves accuracy. Red indicates errors.
Table 3: An example for which enforcing the constraints improves accuracy. Red indicates errors.
Table 4: An example for which enforcing the constraints degrades accuracy. Errors in red.
Table 5: A shift-reduce example for which the method successfully enforces constraints. The initialoutput has only nine shifts, but there are ten tokens in the input. Enforcing the constraint not onlycorrects the number of shifts to ten, but changes the implied tree structure to the correct tree.
