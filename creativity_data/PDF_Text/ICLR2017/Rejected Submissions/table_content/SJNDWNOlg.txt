Table 1: Comparison between different combi-nations of feature aggregation and normaliza-tion methods.
Table 2: Comparison between different imageresizing strategies. The numbers in the parenthe-ses denote the sizes in which the maximum mAPsare achieved.
Table 3: Multi-scale representation: comparison between different methods. “overlap” denotes whetherthe regions in each level (see Figure 1) have some overlapping areas. “s2”,“s3” mean that overlap occurs inlevel 2 or 3. “weighing” means if the features from each level are added using same weight or different weight.
Table 4: The impact of PCA and whitening. “PCA on self” and “PCA on Paris” mean that the correspondingfeatures are post-processed by the PCA and whitening matrices learned on the Oxford5k and Paris6k datasets,respectively. The numbers in the parentheses indicate the dimensionality of features used for obtaining thecorresponding results.
Table 5: Comparison with state-of-the-art methods. “single” means multi-scale features from single layer(Conv5_4) are used. "single, compression” uses the same features but compresses them to get the best perfor-mances. “layer ensemble” combines the similarity score from layer conv5_4 and fc6-conv. The dimensionalityof the combined feature is set to 1024 for compactness considerations. All our methods use PCA and whitening.
