Table 1: Data set statistics after data cleaning and splitting. From left to right: data set name, typeof modeled interaction, number of instances n, test split size, instance dimensionality d, mediannumber of non-zero components c, and median density c/d.
Table 2: Experimental setup and baseline scores. From left to right: data set name, network archi-tecture and optimizer, evaluation measure name, random score SR, and baseline score S0 .
Table 3: Comparison ofBE with the considered alternatives. Score ratios Si/S0 for different combi-nations of data set and compression ratio m/d. Best results are highlighted in bold, up to statisticalsignificance (Mann-Whitney U, p > 0.05).
Table 4: Co-occurrence statistics and average score increase of CBE over BE. From left to right:data set name, input percent of co-occurrent pairs, input average co-occurrence ratio of co-occurrentpairs, output percent of co-occurrent pairs, output average co-occurrence ratio of co-occurrent pairs,and average score increases of CBE over BE (%, calculated using 100(Sj - Si)/S0 and averagingover all m/d points). Co-occurrence values for PTB and YC inputs correspond to consideringtraining sequences, not isolated sequence elements.
Table 5: Comparison of CBE versus the results in Table 3. Score ratios Si/S0 for different combi-nations of data set and compression ratio m/d. Best results are highlighted in bold, up to statisticalsignificance (Mann-Whitney-U, p > 0.05).
