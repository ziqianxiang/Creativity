Table 1: Accuracy of encoders with position features (words + pos) and without (words) in terms ofBLEU and perplexity (PPL) on IWSLTâ€™14 German to English translation; results include unknownword replacement. Deep Convolutional 6/3 is the only multi-layer configuration, more layers for theLSTMs did not improve accuracy on this dataset.
Table 2: Accuracy on three WMT tasks, including results published in previous work. For deepconvolutional encoders, we include the number of layers in CNN-a and CNN-c, respectively.
Table 3: Generation speed in source words per second on a single CPU core.
