Table 3: Comparison against prior methods on the abstracts data.
Table 4: Performance comparison for the semantic similarity (SICK dataset) and paraphrase detection (MSRparaphrase corpus) tasks. In each table the first section shows some best performing supervised methods in theliterature. The second section shows models relevant to the skip-thought model. The third section shows ourmodels.
