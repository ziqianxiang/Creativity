Table 1: Results for image search and annotation on the Places audio caption data (214k trainingpairs, 1k testing pairs). Recall is shown for the top 1, 5, and 10 hits. The model we use in thispaper is compared against the meanpool variant of the model architecture presented in Harwathet al. (2016). For both training and testing, the captions were truncated/zero-padded to 10 seconds.

Table 3: Top 50 clusters with k = 500 sorted by increasing variance. Legend: |Cc | is acousticcluster size, |Ci | is associated image cluster size, Pur. is acoustic cluster purity, σ2 is acousticcluster variance, and Cov. is acoustic cluster coverage. A dash (-) indicates a cluster whose majoritylabel is silence.
