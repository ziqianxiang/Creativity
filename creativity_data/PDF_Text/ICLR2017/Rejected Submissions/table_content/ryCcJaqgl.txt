The experimental results demonstrate that such a hybrid framework canindeed utilize complementary information extracted by CNN and LSTM to enhance the predictionperformance. Moreover, such architecture is generic and extendible in that additional exogenoustime series can be fed to TreNet, so as to boost the performance and investigate the effect of differentdata sources on the trend evolving.

Another line of research is to explore equipping TreNet with multi-task learning. This ismotivated by the observation that if we decompose the trend forecasting problem into classificationand regression respectively for the slope and duration, we can utilize the correlation between slope13Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2017and duration to boost the prediction performance. In addition, there could be alternative frameworksto combine the outputs of CNN and LSTM and our work opens the door for applying hybrid neuralnetworks for trend analysis in time series.
