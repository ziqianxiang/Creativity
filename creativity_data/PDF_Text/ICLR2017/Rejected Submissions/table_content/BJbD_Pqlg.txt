Table 1: Prediction accuracy. Percent of linearly explained variability (R2), absolute value of Spear-man rank-order correlation coefficient (SROCC), and the root mean squared error of the linearprediction (RMSE) are presented for each prediction model. Note the measurement scale of thethreshold data being predicted (Eq. 1). (*) Thresholds linearized through a logistic transform be-fore prediction (see Larson & Chandler, 2010), possibly increasing but not decreasing measuredpredictive strength. (**) Average of four similar alternatives.
Table 2: Accuracy of perceptual sensitivity prediction and task-trained ImageNet center-crop top-1validation accuracy for different DNN models (following Table 1 from which third row is repro-duced; used scale: 100%). The quality of prediction for ResNet-152 improves dramatically if onlythe first tens of layers are considered (see Figure 5b).
Table 3: Accuracy of perceptual sensitivity prediction for baseline models (see Section 8.2; usedscale: 100%).
Table 4: Accuracy of perceptual sensitivity prediction during CaffeNet model standard training (usedscale: 100%). Last row reproduced from Table 2.
Table 5: Robustness of perceptual sensitivity prediction for varying prediction parameters for modelVGG-19. First three rows reproduced from Table 1. Measurements for the lower noise range of-60:-40 dB were omitted by mistake.
Table 6: Background context for Shape. Shown is the Spearmann correlation coefficient (SROCC)of perceptual data vs. model-based MI prediction across shapes (i.e. considering all shapes ratherthan only Easy vs. Hard; note that the original robust finding the superiority of the Easy shape).
