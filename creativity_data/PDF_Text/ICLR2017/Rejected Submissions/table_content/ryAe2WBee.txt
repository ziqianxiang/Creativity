To fit bothSEM models, we take the number of epochs be 30 and the mini-batch size be 200—i.e., T = 30 andm = 200 in Algorithm 1—and because c is small, we fit the full label distributions. The classificationperformances of our SEM algorithms and the baseline methods are shown in Table 2. SEM or SEM-Koutperform the alternative algorithms in most cases.

It is clear thatSEM-K with a small set of negative labels obtains better performance than both REmbed and SLEEC.
