Table 1: Some statistics of the WorldCup2014 dataset.
Table 2: Results of joint learning with path queries and conjunction queries on WorldCup2014.
Table 3: Sample atomic triplets.
Table 4: Statistics of the WorldCup2014 dataset.
Table 5: Templates of questions. In the table, (player), (club), (position) are placeholders of namedentities with associated type. (COUntry_1) is a placeholder for a country name while (COUntryN) is aplaceholder for the adjectival form of a country.
Table 6: (Composed) relations and sample questions in path queries.
Table 7: Conjunctive queries and sample questions.
Table 8: Evaluation of embeddings. We evaluate the embeddings by feeding the correct entities andrelations from a path or conjunctive query to an embedding model and using its scoring function toretrieve the answers from the embedded knowledge base.
