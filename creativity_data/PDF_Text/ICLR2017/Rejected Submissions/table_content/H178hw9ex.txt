Table 1: Examples of function spaces closed under various non-Abelian multi-parameter groups, asderived in (Hel-Or & Teo, 1998). They can readily be used as a frame for CNNs by the procedurewe derive here.
Table 2: Results on Cifar10 with moderate data-augmentation (crops/flips) with the recently intro-duced pre-activation Residual network and Densenet with the standard pixel-basis, a steerable framebasis designed for natural images and the naive steerable xpyq frame from table 3 that does not takenatural image statistics into account. The natural image statistics based frame outperforms the pixel-basis consistently, while the naive frame consinstently performs about 1% worse than the baseline,highlighting the benefit of a frame suitable for the type of input data.
Table 3: Results on the Cambridge Hand-Gesture Recognition dataset, to illustrate the effectivenessof pose regularization provided by the Dynamic Steerable Frame Network. Adding the DSFN mod-ule to the convLSTM drastically improves performance. Increasing the capacity of the baseline totwo layers, does not make up for the difference in performance, while adding the STN to the convL-STM decreases performance significantly, as the STN does not manage to learn meaningful globaltransformations that do not remove the class-specific information content. This is further substan-tiated by an increased performance when removing the ability to shear and translate the input fromthe STN. The DSFN outperforms all other approaches while only adding 2k free parameters to thebaseline.
