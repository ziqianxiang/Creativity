Table 4: Reults of decomposing convolutional layers of VGG-16.					Compressed convolutional layers	2nd	2nd-4th	2nd-6th	2nd-8th	2nd-10thIncrease in top-5 error (%)	0.37	1.64	2.79	4.13	6.42Acceleration rate of entire network	1.08 ×	1.22×	1.41×	1.68×	2.15×following cases. While kw was set to DO /2, DO/4, DO /8, and DO/16 for the first and secondlayers, kw was fixed to DO for the third layer. The kx was set to 4. This is plotted with a red linein Figure 3. In this way, the memory compression rate and acceleration rate noticeably improved.
