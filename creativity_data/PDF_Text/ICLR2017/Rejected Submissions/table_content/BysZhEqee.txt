Table 1: Characteristics of datasets used in evaluation.
Table 2: The classification accuracy on different datasets. “ORIG” represents the results obtainedin the original data space. ‘PDA’ represents the PCA deep architecture. ‘MDA’ represents the MFAdeep architecture. The best reslut is highlighted with boldface.
Table 3: The structures on 5 data sets. “None” represents without second layer in MDA. “Twice”means the second layer’s nodes are as twice as the input layer. “Quadruple” represents the secondlayer’s nodes are as quadruple as the input layer. “Octuple” represents the second layer’s nodes areas octuple as the input layer.
