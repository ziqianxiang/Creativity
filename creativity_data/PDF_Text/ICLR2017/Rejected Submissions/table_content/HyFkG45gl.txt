Finally,the question type is used to determine which value from the table to output from the solver. Thisdata flow is shown in Figure 6.
Table 3: Accuracies shown are on the test set of word problems for the system. The classifier is fedthe extracted questions as identified by the labeler. The combined RNN system accuracy is basedon the final output of the system having the same dynamical system parameters and question type asthe generated output for a word problem.
Table 4: The chosen RNN network for the labeler has one layer of ten units with a learning rateof 0.1. The notation x/y/z means x for overall accuracy, y for label accuracy, and z for questionaccuracy, where accuracy is given as a proportion of correct predictions over total predictions. Allresults shown use TensorFlow’s Adam Optimizer and LSTM cell.
Table 5: The chosen network for the labeler has one layer of 1,000 units. The values shown areaccuracies given as a proportion of the number of correctly predicted classifications over total clas-sifications. All results use TensorFlow’s Gradient Descent Optimizer and LSTM cell.
