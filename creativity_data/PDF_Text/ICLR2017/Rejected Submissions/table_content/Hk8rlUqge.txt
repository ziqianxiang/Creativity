Table 1: Evaluation of test log-likelihood. All models are trained and tested on MNIST. α is a coefficient ofregularization term in JMVAE-kl (Equation 4): left, marginal log-likelihood; right, conditional log-likelihood.
Table 2: Evaluation of log-likelihood. Models are trained and tested on CelebA. We trained JMVAE-kl and setα = 0.1: left, marginal log-likelihood; right, conditional log-likelihood (with the multiple lower bound).
Table 3: Evaluation of test log-likelihood. All models are trained on the MNIST dataset: left, marginal log-likelihood; right, conditional log-likelihood.
