Figure 1: The abstract computational graph of a Binary ARC comparing two images. The controllerwhich is an RNN primes the whole process. The two images are alternatively and repeatedly at-tended to, depicted by the carousel below. At each time-step the glimpse taken from the image isbased on the attention parameters Ωt which is calculated using the previous state of RNN ht-ι byprojecting it with Wg. The glimpse obtained Gt and the previous state ht-1 together used to updatethe state of controller to ht. The vertical dotted lines demarcate the time-steps.
Figure 2: Attention windows over time when comparing the two Omniglot characters. The top rowhas the first image and the bottom row has the second. Each column represents a glimpse step. (a)Comparing two dissimilar characters and (b) Comparing two similar characters.
Figure 3: Attention windows over time and instantaneous predictions from independent binary clas-sifiers. The first glimpse is omitted as it covers the whole image. In the graph: x-axis - glimpsenumber, y-axis - similarity score. The red line is the decision threshold, above which the images areconsidered to be similar. Both of the cases above are examples of a dissimilar pair.
