Figure 1:	Examples from the NYDMV FAQ section. There are 8 top-level categories, 47 sub-categories, and 537 questions (388 unique questions; many questions fall into multiple categories).
Figure 2:	Examples of questions from two different categories. These questions ask for the similarproblem even if they are in different classes. Their answers also contain similar information.
Figure 3: The input figure with hand written digit 0 is shown in (a). Figure (b) is the visualizationof projection matrix W. Different rows represent different groups of W in Eq. 9. For each group,we only show the first 15 (out of 50) bases. The red numbers on the left side of (b) are the indexof different groups(10 groups in total). Figure (c) is the projection matrix visualization from a basicautoencoders.
Figure 4:	The hidden activations h respect to the input image in Fig. 3(a). The red numbers corre-sponds to the index in Fig. 3(b). These activations come from 10 different groups. The group sizehere is 50.
Figure 5:	Framework used in our model. We add extra encoding layer in CNNs. Sentence rep-resentation after convolutional layer is denoted as z, and W is the projection matrix (functions asdictionary) in Eq. 9. Hidden group sparse representation for question sentence is denoted as h.
