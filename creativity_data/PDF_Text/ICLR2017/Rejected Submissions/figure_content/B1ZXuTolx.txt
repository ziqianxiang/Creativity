Figure 1:	Outputs for different activation functions of the modifed DAE with an over-completerepresentation when the inputs are Gaussian distributed.
Figure 2:	Outputs for different activation functions of the modified DAE with an over-completerepresentation when the inputs are a mixture of Gaussian distributions.
Figure 3: Energy ||x - X∣∣2 landscapes for different AE algorithmsfollowed by a nonlinearity can be advantageous. The means of and covariances of the mixturecomponents areμιΣ1=-221-0.95),μ2 = - -2 ) , μ1 = ( -2-0195 ) , ς2 = ς3 = ( 0195; and0.951,(6)respectively, and the mixing weights are p1 = 0.5, and p2 = p3 = 0.25.
