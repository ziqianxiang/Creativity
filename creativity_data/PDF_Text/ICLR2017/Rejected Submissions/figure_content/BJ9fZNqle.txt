Figure 1: The horizontal axis corresponds to z1, which is a univariate Gaussian variable. The verticalaxis corresponds to z2 , which is a piecewise constant variable. The PDF for each variable is shownalong each axis, and their joint distribution is illustrated in grey color.
Figure 2: Probabilities for different responses related to time and events: left) probabilities for givinga one-word response with one of the weekdays (monday, tuesday, . . . , sunday) conditioned on thecontext utterance “when do you want to meet this weekend?”, right) probabilities forgiving a one-word response with one of several event-related nouns (school, class, . . . , wedding) on the contextutterance “where are you going tomorrow?”. The probabilities have been normalized in log-spaceby the number of words in the response including end-of-utterance tokens. For G-VHRED andH-VHRED, the probabilities were estimated using the variational lower-bound over 10 samples.
