Figure 2: Results of a test example 69e1f777e41bf67d5a22b7c69ae76f0ae873cf43.story from the CNN dataset.
Figure 3: An example of graph reachability result, given a query “10 → 17” (Answer: Yes). The redcircles highlight the nodes/edges which have the highest attention in each step. The corresponding terminationprobability and prediction results are shown in the table. The model terminates at step 10.
Figure 4: An example of graph reachability result, given a query “4 → 9” (Answer: No). The numbers nextto the underline bars indicate the rank of the attention scores. The corresponding termination probability andprediction results are shown in the table.
Figure 5: The termination step distribution of a ReasoNet (Tmax = 5) in the CNN dataset.
Figure 6:	Termination step distribution of ReasoNets in the graph reachability dataset, where Tmax isset to 15 and 25 in the small graph and large graph dataset, respectively.
Figure 7:	The correlation between BFS steps and ReasoNet termination steps in the graph reachabilitydataset, where Tmax is set to 15 and 25 in the small graph and large graph dataset, respectively, andBFS-Step= -1 denotes unreachable cases. The value indicates the number of instances in each case.
