Figure 1: Architectures of the proposed GoCNN used in the training (top) and testing (bottom)phase. The two groups are colored by blue (foreground) and purple (background) respecively. FCrepresents the fully connected layer.
Figure 2: Activation maps of foreground feature maps (GoCNN-Fg), background feature maps(GoCNN-Bg) and all feature maps (GoCNN-Full) produced by our proposed GoCNN on ImageNetvalidation set. The bottom row shows the activation maps produced by the baseline model.
