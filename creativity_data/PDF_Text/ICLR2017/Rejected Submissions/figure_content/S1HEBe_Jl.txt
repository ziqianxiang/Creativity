Figure 1: Alice, Bob, and Eve, with a symmetric cryptosystem.
Figure 2: Evolution of Bob’s and Eve’s reconstruction errors during training. Lines represent themean error across a minibatch size of 4096.
Figure 3: Final reconstruction errors of Bob and of the most effective retrained Eve, for the four-teen initially successful runs, of twenty. An ideal result would be a dot in the upper-left corner,representing no Bob reconstruction error and 8 bits of Eve reconstruction error.
