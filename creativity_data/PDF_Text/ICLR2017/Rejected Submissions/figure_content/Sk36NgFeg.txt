Figure 1: Baseline comparison for downsampled input (DS-D): DFAE on MNIST (resp. CIFAR100grayscale, CIFAR100 color) with 800 hidden units (resp. 1100, 3100 hidden units).
Figure 2: Downsampled (DS-D) MNIST and CIFAR100 images reconstruction by DFAE. The toprow shows the original image. Each row shows the downsampled input that was used during training,followed by reconstruction images by the bilinear algorithm and DFAEs.

The MNIST database consistsof 28 x 28 handwritten digits and has a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000examples. Therefore each class has 6000 examples. The CIFAR100 dataset consists of 32 x 32color images of 100 classes. Some examples of classes are: flowers, large natural outdoor scenes,insects, people, vehicles etc. Each class has 600 examples. The training set consists of 50,000images and the test set consists of 10,000 images. We trained DFAEs on the MNIST and CIFAR100dataset (in grayscale and color). We normalized the datasets so that the pixel values are between 0and 1 and additionally, zero-centered them. This step corresponds to local brightness and contrastnormalization. Aside from this, we do no other preprocessing such as patch extraction or whitening.
Figure 6: Color reconstruction examples and errors rates of 1-layer DFAElearnt by the network. Indeed, we observe in Figure 3 that for MNIST, as the downsampling factorincreases, the global structure in the features2 also increases: when the input was downsampledby a factor of two (resp. four, seven), it was forced to learn stroke like features (resp. full/partialdigits, superimposed digits). A curiously similar result was observed by Vincent et al. Vincent et al.
