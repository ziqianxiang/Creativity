Figure 1: Partitiong of continous variable Z1 based on its histogram.
Figure 2: Heterogeneous time-series symbolization along with word embedding (WdE), sharedcharacter-wise embedding (SCE), and independent character-wise embedding (ICE).
Figure 3: Empirical Probability Density of an counitous variable Z is shown along with the corre-sponding independent character-wise embeddings. The vairable has 4 symbols which are initiazed tomaintain the ordered information. During training, and after each gradient update, the representationsare sorted to enforce the ordered constraint.
