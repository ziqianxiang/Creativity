Figure 1: Comparison of DCCA and the prosed differentiable CCA layer. DCCA optimizes thecorrelation of the two different views and is therefore the topmost part of the network. In contrast,our CCA layer establishes gradient flow over the CCA computation. This allows us to use theprojection output of CCA as input for subsequent components in a multi-view network (e.g., aretrieval objective such as cosine distance).
Figure 2: Comparison of the TNO and CCAL-cos2 based on the total amount of canonical correla-tion (sum over singular values d) as well as the cosine distance between corresponding samples.
