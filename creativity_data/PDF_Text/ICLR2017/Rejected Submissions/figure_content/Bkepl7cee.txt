Figure 1: Effects of parameters a, b and c: The saturation point decreases when a increases, itsaturates faster when b decreases, and the slope of the linear part increases when c increases.
Figure 2: TOP-1 error rate progression (in %) of ResNet18, NiN, Overfeat and All-CNN on ImageNet2012 validation set. NiN and ResNet18 (top row) used training regime #1, while All-CNN andOverfeat (bottom row) used training regime #2 (see Table 2). PELU has the lowest error rates for allnetworks. Regime #1 shows a greater performance gap between ELU and PELU than regime #2.
