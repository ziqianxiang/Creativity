Figure 1: Five variants of our LSTM-A framework (better viewed in color).
Figure 2: Visualization of prediction changes w.r.t. the additional attribute inputs. The attributes are predictedby MIL method in (Fang et al., 2015) and the output sentences are generated by LSTM and LSTM-A3.
Figure 3:	Sentence examples generated by our five LSTM-A architectures and one ground truth sentence.
Figure 4:	Attributes and sentences generation results on COCO. The attributes are predicted by MIL methodin (Fang et al., 2015) and the output sentences are generated by 1) LSTM, 2) CaptionBot2, 3) our LSTM-A3,and 4) Ground Truth: randomly selected three ground truth sentences.
