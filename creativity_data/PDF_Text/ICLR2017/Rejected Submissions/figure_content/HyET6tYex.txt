Figure 1: Search times of randomly selected words from two ensembles is compared with thecurve fBC in Bakhtin & Correll (2012) that is estimated from the decision times in an experimentconducted on humans. It is evident that more observations have yet to be made in identifying theunderlying principles of the algorithms that are increasingly part of our life.
Figure 2: Empirical histograms for the halting time fluctuations τ,N,QR,E when N = 150, =10-10 for various choices of ensembles E. This figure shows four normalized histograms, one eachfor E = BE, GOE, GUE and QUE. It is clear that the fluctuations follow a universal law.
Figure 3: Empirical histograms for the halting time fluctuations τ,N,CG,E when N = 500, =10-10 for various choices of ensembles E. (a) The scaling M = N + 2[√NC demonstrating thepresence of universality. This plot shows three histograms, one each for E = LUE, LOE and PBE.
Figure 4: Universality across different distributions: We choose D 〜 Gaussian(0,1), D 〜uniformon (-(3/2)1/3, (3/2)1/3) and D 〜Bernoulli ±1∕√2 with equal probability.
Figure 5: Universality in the halting time for deep learning cost functions. MNIST digit inputsand independent Gaussian noise inputs give rise to the same halting time fluctuations, as well as aconvnet with a different stopping condition.
Figure 6:	(a) Norm of the gradient varies from 5 to 0.01 for the spin glass. (b) Averages ofconsecutive costs on MNIST that varies from 0.6 to 0.005.
