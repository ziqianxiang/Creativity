Figure 1: The BONN Architecture. Arrows correspond to dependencies, dashed arrows correspondto sampled values. Note that when σt = 1 the model observes yt and compute a new option (in thisexample we have σ3 = 1 and σ6 = 1 ), and that when σt = 0 (everywhere else in this example) themodel doesn’t use yt and keeps the same option.

Figure 3: (a) (b) Examples of trajectories generated by the agent. Each point corresponds to aposition where the agent decides to acquire yt and generates a new option. (c) Trajectories generatedwith the D-BONN model where K = 9.
