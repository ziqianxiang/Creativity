Figure 1: The main components in dynamic chunk reader model (from bottom to top) are bi-GRUencoders for passage and question, a word-by-word attention bi-GRU for passage, dynamic chunkrepresentations that are transformed from pooled dynamic chunks of hidden states, the questionattention on every chunk representation and final answer chunk prediction.
Figure 2:	(a) Variations of DCR performance on ground truth answer length (up to 10) in the devel-opment set. The curve with diamond knots also shows the percentage of answers for each length inthe development set. (b) Performance comparisons for different question head word.
Figure 3:	Development set performance comparisons for different types of “what” questions (con-sidering the types with more than 20 examples in the development set).
