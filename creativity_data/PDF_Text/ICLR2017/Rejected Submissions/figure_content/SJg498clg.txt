Figure 1: Illustration of Neural Graph Machine: the training objective ensures the neural net to makeaccurate node-level predictions and biases the hidden representations of neighbouring nodes to besimilar. [Left: feedforward NNs, Right: RNNs]be thought of as a non-linear version of the label propagation objective, and a graph-regularizedversion of the neural network training objective.
Figure 2: Illustration of how we can construct inputs to the neural network using the adjacencymatrix.
