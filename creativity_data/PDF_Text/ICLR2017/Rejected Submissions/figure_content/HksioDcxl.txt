Figure 1: As shown on the left, previous recommendation models learn static stationary embeddingsfor users and movies to predict ratings. As shown on the right, we can also capture temporal effectspresent in the data. We have both user and movie embeddings follow a Markov chain, and use thesedynamic embeddings (along with stationary ones not shown) to predict both ratings and text reviews.
Figure 2: Joint Review-Rating Recurrent Recommender Networks: We use recurrent networks tocapture the temporal evolution of user and movies states. The recurrent networks depend on theratings of a user (and movie) in previous time steps. We combine these dynamic states with classicstationary states. We directly use all of these states to predict ratings, and use them within an LSTMto model review text.

Figure 4: RRN is able to capture the overall trend of data. (a) show the average ratings of all movieson IMDb over time. In (b) we see the predicted ratings are consistent with this trend.
