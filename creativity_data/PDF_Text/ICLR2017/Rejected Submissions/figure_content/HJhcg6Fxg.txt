Figure 1: The Binary PV-DBOW model. Modifications to the original PV-DBOW model are high-lighted.
Figure 2:	The Real-Binary PV-DBOW model. Modifications to the original PV-DBOW model arehighlighted.
Figure 3:	The Binary PV-DM model.
Figure 4: Precision-recall curves for the 20 Newsgroups and RCV1 datasets. Cosine similarity wasused with real-valued representations and the Hamming distance with binary codes. For compar-ison we also included semantic hashing results reported by Salakhutdinov & Hinton (2009, Fig-ures 6 & 7).
Figure 5: Precision-recall curves for the baseline Binary PV-DBOW models and a Binary PV-DBOW model trained on an unrelated text corpus. Results are reported for 128-bit codes.
Figure 6: Information retrieval results for binary and real-valued codes learned by the Real-BinaryPV-DBOW model with bigrams. Results are reported for 28-bit binary codes and 300d real-valuedcodes. A 300d PV-DBOW model is included for reference.
Figure 7: t-SNE visualization of binary paragraph vector codes; the Hamming distance was used tocalculate code similarity.
