Figure 1: A random walk over a graph is split into three subsequences (s1, s2, s3). The middlesequence is input into the encoder and the decoders attempt to reconstruct the previous and nextsub-sequence. The unattached arrows are connected to the encoder output to condition the decoder.
Figure 2: Two structurally dissimilar subgraphs can be considered functionally similar if they alwaysappear in the same neighborhood. For instance, subgraphs “C-C-C” and “G-H-G” are structurallydifferent since they are composed of different types of nodes but they seem to be serving the samefunction of connecting the same kind of regions together. If these patterns appear frequently inthe dataset, the encoder-decoder model will learn very similar representations for the random walksequences corresponding to the two subgraphs.
