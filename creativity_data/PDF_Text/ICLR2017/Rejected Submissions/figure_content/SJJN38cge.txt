Figure 1: Conventional and Distributed Transfer Learning. The blue blocks (Conv) represent convo-lutional layers in the original domain, the red blocks (Softmax) show fine-tuned layers for the targetdomain and the green block corresponds to the basic probability assignment (BPA) respectively.
Figure 2: Examples of MNIST, CIFAR and SVHN Datasetsof datasets with close data distributions or number of classes. We select MNIST & SVHN andCIFAR-10 & CIFAR-100 as original-target domains and report the transfer learning results in formof train-test errors. In the second experiment, we apply transfer learning for pairs of datasets withfar data/class setups which are MNIST & CIFAR-10 and SVHN & CIFAR-100. In this experiment,we arrange the datasets to examine the effect of dissimilar distributions rather than overfitting.
