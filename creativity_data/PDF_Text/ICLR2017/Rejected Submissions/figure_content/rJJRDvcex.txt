Figure 1:	Basic Architecture:Given the input image, local features are cal-culated by the CNN module (A).
Figure 2:	Basic Modules for Clas-sification: CNN module is definedin a same way as ResNet (He et al.,2016b). L-RNN module is definedas a cascade of bidirectional spatialRNNs.
Figure 3: CNNs & Spatial RNNsSpatial RNNs can be re-expressed as a two-step process, CNNs (Local features) + Recurrence.
Figure 4: FCN-32s (above the blue dash line) and FCN-8s with L-RNN modules.
Figure 5: Qualitative Results. First column: input image. Second column: prediction fromZheng et al. (2015). Third column: prediction from the our networks. Fourth column: CRF post-processing. Fifth column: ground-truth annotation.

Figure 7: Complete FCNs used extensively in the paperIn FCN-32s, output feature maps of spatial size 12 X 12 is directly up-sampled by 32 times.
