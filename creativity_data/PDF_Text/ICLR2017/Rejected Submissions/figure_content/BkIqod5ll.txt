Figure 1: Visualization of the graph convolution size 5 . For a given node, the convolution is applied on thenode and its 4 closest neighbors selected by the random walk. As the right figure demonstrates, the random walkcan expand further into the graph to higher degree neighbors. The convolution weights are shared according tothe neighbors’ closeness to the nodes and applied globally on all nodes.
Figure 2: Visualization of a row of Q(k) on the graph generated over the 2-D grid at a node near the center,when connecting each node to its 8 adjacent neighbors. For k = 1, most of the weight is on the node, withsmaller weights on the first order neighbors. This corresponds to a standard 3 × 3 convolution. As k increasesthe number of active neighbors also increases, providing greater weight to neighbors farther away, while stillkeeping the local information.
Figure 3: Left: Visualization of the correlation matrix between the first 100 molecular descriptors (features) inthe DPP4 Merck molecular activity challenge training set. The proposed method utilizes the correlation structurebetween the features. Right: Convergence of R2 for the different methods on the test set. The graph convolutionmakes the convergence steadier by reducing the number of parameters.
