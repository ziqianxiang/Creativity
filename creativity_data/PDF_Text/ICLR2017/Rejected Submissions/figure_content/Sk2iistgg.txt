Figure 1: Non-linear dimensionality regularizer forNRSfM. The top part of the figure explains the ill-posedinverse problem of recovering the causal factors (1);projection matrices Ri and 3D structures Si , from 2Dimage observations (2) Wi ’s, by minimizing the imagereprojection error f(W, R, S) = Pi kWi - RiSik2.
Figure 2: Non-linear dimensionality regular-isation improves NRSfM performance com-pared to its linear counterpart. Figure showsthe ground truth 3D structures in red wire-frameoverlaid with the structures estimated using: (a)proposed non-linear dimensionality regularizershown in blue dots and (b) corresponding lin-ear dimensionality regularizer (TNH) shown inblack crosses, for sample frames of CMU mo-cap sequence. Red circles represent the 3D pointsfor which the projections were known whereassquares annotated missing 2D observations. Seetext and Table 2 for details.
Figure 3: Performance comparison between KPCA and our Robust closed-form solution with dimensionalityregularization on oil flow dataset with additive Gaussian noise of standard deviation σ. Plots show the normal-ized kernel matrix errors with different rank of the model. Kernel PCA results are shown in dotted line withdiamond while ours are with solid line with a star. Bar-plot show the worst and the best errors obtained by ourmethod for a single rank of recovered kernel matrix.
