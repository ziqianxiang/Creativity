Figure 1: Illustration of the proposed GCRN model forspatio-temporal prediction of graph-structured data. Thetechnique combines at the same time CNN on graphs andRNN. RNN can be easily exchanged with LSTM or GRUnetworks.
Figure 2: Illustration of the neigh-borhood on an 8-nearest-neighborgrid graph. Isotropic spectral filtersof support K have access to nodes atmost at K - 1 hops.
Figure 3: Cross-entropy on validation set: Left: performance of graph CNN with various filtersupport K. Right: performance w.r.t. graph construction.
Figure 4: Qualitative results for moving MNIST, and rotating and moving MNIST. First rowis the input sequence, second the ground truth, and third and fourth are the predictions of theLSTM+CNN(5 Ã— 5) and LSTM+GCNN(knn = 8, K = 7).
