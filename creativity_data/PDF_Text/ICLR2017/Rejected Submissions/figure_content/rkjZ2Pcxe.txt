Figure 1: Neural Programmer, a neural network with built-in arithmetic and logic operations. Atevery time step, the controller selectes an operation and a data segment. Figure reproduced withpermission from Neelakantan et al. (2016).
Figure 2: Noise Vs. No Noise in our experiment with 5 columns. The models trained with noisegeneralizes almost always better.
Figure 3: One timestep of the NRAM architecture with R = 4 registers and a memory tape. m1,m2 and m3 are example operations built-in to the model. The operations can read and write frommemory. At every time step, the LSTM controller softly selects the operation and its inputs. Figurereproduced with permission from Kurach et al. (2016).
