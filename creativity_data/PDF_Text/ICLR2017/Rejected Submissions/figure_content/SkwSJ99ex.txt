Figure 1: Time Decomposition for each layer. Non-tensor layers (e.g., dropout, ReLU, LRN, soft-max, pooling, etc) shown in red color while tensor layers (e.g., convolution, inner-product) shownin black color.
Figure 2: Streamline Merging: The GoogLeNet example and the running time is measured usingbvlc_googlenet model in Caffe on a Samsung Galaxy S5. Left panel: convolution (in green), LRN(in red), pooling (in red). Right Panel: single convolution layer. The three layers in the left panelare merged and regenerated as a convolution layer (i.e., rebirth layer) in the right panel.
Figure 3: Branch Merging: The GoogLeNet example and the running time is measured usingbvlc_googlenet model in Caffe on a Samsung Galaxy S5. Left panel: four branches in parallel,convolution layer, convolution + convolution, convolution + convolution, convolution + pooling.
Figure 4: An illustration of GoogleNet-Merge's structure in details.
