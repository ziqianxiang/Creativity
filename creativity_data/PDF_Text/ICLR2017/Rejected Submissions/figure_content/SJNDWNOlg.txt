Figure 1: An illustration of multi-scale representation of an image. The whole image is divided into 3levels from the coarsest (level 1) to the finest (level 3). At each level, the image is divided into different numberof equal-sized regions.
Figure 2: Performance comparison between different layers. This experiment is conducted using the freeinput image size.
Figure 3: The number of principal component reserved VS mAP. We show the results of full and croppedquery using the PCA and whitening matrix learned from the Oxford5k itself and Paris6k, denoted as “full-self”,“full-paris” and “crop-self”, “crop-paris”.
