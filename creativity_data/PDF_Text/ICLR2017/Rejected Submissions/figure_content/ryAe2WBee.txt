Figure 1: The P@1 performance of SEM and SEM-K as a function of β, in comparison to theperformances of SLEEC and REmbed on the (a) Eurlex-des and (b)Wiki10K datasets.
Figure 2: Running time of SEM-K under varying β .
Figure 3: The effect of the latent space dimensionality r on BMLPL, REmbed, SLEEC, SEM andSEM-K in terms of MiF1 and P@1 on the Delicious dataset.
Figure 4: Effect of varying the training data size, as a fraction of the combined test and training data,on five multi-label learning methods in terms of P@1 and MiF1 on the Mediamill dataset.
Figure 5: Performance of the proposed SEM method (with r = 45, ρ = 0.1) on the Delicious dataset,a) objective function value to minimum and b) prediction result in terms of P@1, where x-axisrepresents the number of passes to the dataset.
