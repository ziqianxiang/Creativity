Figure 1: An example of our grounding method. The left image displays a grid defining the allowedstart and end coordinates for the bounding box proposals. The bottom spectrogram displays severalaudio region proposals drawn as the families of stacked red line segments. The image on the rightand spectrogram on the top display the final output of the grounding algorithm. The top spectrogramalso displays the time-aligned text transcript of the caption, so as to demonstrate which words werecaptured by the groundings. In this example, the top 3 groundings have been kept, with the colorsindicating the audio segment which is grounded to each bounding box.

Figure 3: The 9 most central image crops from several image clusters, along with the majority-votelabel of their most associated acoustic pattern clusterTable 3: Top 50 clusters with k = 500 sorted by increasing variance. Legend: |Cc | is acousticcluster size, |Ci | is associated image cluster size, Pur. is acoustic cluster purity, Ïƒ2 is acousticcluster variance, and Cov. is acoustic cluster coverage. A dash (-) indicates a cluster whose majoritylabel is silence.
