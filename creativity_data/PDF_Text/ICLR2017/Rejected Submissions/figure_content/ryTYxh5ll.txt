Figure 2: Content2Vec architecture combines content-specific modules with residual vector to pro-duce embedding vector for each product, then uses these vectors to compute similarities betweenproducts.
Figure 3: An example of using the content-specific modules to create embedded representations oftwo products with images, text and CF signal.
Figure 4: Pairwise Residual Unitsimc2v(ai, bj)wmσ(simm (ai, bj))(5)Σm∈M odalitiesUnder this notation, the residual-based architecture denoted as Content2Vec-res minimizes LNSwith the similarity function defined in eq. 6.
Figure 5: The two types of Pairwise Residual Units. By comparison with the first version thatoutputs a scalar, the second one outputs a vector that goes directly into the final prediction layermodel where we discretize the text and image-specific similarity scores and create explicit featureconjunctions between them and Content2Vec-embedpairs - a model where we use a similar techniquewith Paiwise Residual Unit, in this case modeling the residual of the linear similarity directly as avector in the pair embedding layer, as shown in Figure 5. In Section 5.2 we show that two modelshave as expected better performance than the linear model and that the pair embedding is slightlybetter.
