Figure 1:	Output of Algorithm RANDADV (averaged over good images). The results are for two networks: a)Network-in-Network and b) VGG. The perturbation parameter p is varied from {1, 5, 10, 100}.
Figure 2:	Fraction of images where Algorithm RANDADV succeeds in finding at least one critical pixel. Againwe only start with only good images.
Figure 3: Experiments in Figures 1 and 2 for the high-resolution ImageNet1000 dataset. The results areagain for good images from a set of 1000 randomly selected images. We use a slightly modified version ofAlgorithm RANDADV that perturbs a set of 50 pixels.
