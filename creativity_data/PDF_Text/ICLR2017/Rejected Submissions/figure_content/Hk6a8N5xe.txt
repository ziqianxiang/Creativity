Figure 1: The shallow and deep versions of the Classifier architecture for extractive summarization.
Figure 2: Selector architecture for extractive summarization. The shallow and deep versions are identicalexcept for the fact that the simple vector representation for summary representation in the shallow version isreplaced with a gated recurrent unit in the deep version.
Figure 3: Visualization of Deep Classifier output on a representative document. Each row is a sentence inthe document, while the shading-color intensity in the first column is proportional to its probability of being inthe summary, as estimated by the scoring function. In the columns are the normalized scores from each of theabstract features in Eqn. (1) as well as the final prediction probability (last column). Sentence 2 is estimated tobe the most salient, while the longest one, sentence 4, is considered the most content-rich, and not surprisingly,the first sentence the most novel. The third sentence gets the best position based score.
