Figure 1: The process flow of the proposed method.
Figure 2: The œÅ for SimLex using different paraphrase sets. The corpus is enwiki9. The vector-space dimension is set to 300. The context window size is set to 8. 25 negative samples are used inlearning.
Figure 3: The scores of the benchmarks using different vector-space dimensions. For WS353,SimLex, RW and men, We report 100 * P (SPearman's rank correlation). For word analogical rea-soning, we report the percentage of the correct answers. The context window size is set to 8. Thenumber of negative samples is set to 25.
Figure 4: The scores of the benchmarks using different context window sizes. For WS353, SimLex,RW and men, We report 100 * P (SPearman's rank correlation). For word analogical reasoning, Wereport the percentage of the correct answers. We use 100-dimension vectors. The number of negativesamples is set to 25.
Figure 5: The scores of the benchmarks using different numbers of negative samples. For WS353,SimLex, RW and men, We report 100 * P (SPearman's rank correlation). For word analogical rea-soning, we report the percentage of the correct answers. We use 100-dimension vectors. The contextwindow size is set to 8.
Figure 6: The comparison of using the proposed function described in section 2.3, f (x) = 0 (equiv-alent to CBOW) and f (x) = 1 (no drop-out) as the control function. They are compared underdifferent corpora in varying size. The green bar (the left) indicates the scores of the proposed func-tion; the blue bar (the middle) indicates the scores of f(x) = 0; the pink bar (the right) indicates thescores of f (x) = 1. We report 100 * P for SimLex and MEN, the percentage of correct answers forSEM and SYN. The vector-space dimension is set to 300. The context window size is set to 8. 25negative samples are used in learning.
