Figure 1: Trees of life for fish species. The first three trees are constructed by our methods, and thefourth tree is the ground truth using WordNet. The hierarchy of MST and MDS coincides with thatof the WordNet.
Figure 2: Constructed tree of life for families of species by different networks. Species of the fivefamilies are in different colors. ResNet and VGG can correctly cluster the species but AlexNet doesnot. Build by MST based method.
Figure 3: A constructed tree of life for 11canine species. Closer species show shorterdistance. Build by MDS based method.
Figure 4: A constructed small tree of life fordifferent families of species. We not onlycorrectly cluster each family of species, butalso present correct hierarchy of the specieswithin each family. Build by MDS basedmethod.
Figure 5: A constructed vehicle tree. Our result looks more reasonable than that of the WordNet.
Figure 6: Constructing tree of life containing some species not in training set (marked by pink point).
