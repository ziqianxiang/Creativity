Figure 1:	Result for artificial data with dependent groups. Figures (left to right): one of the groundtruths; 1D subspace pair recovered by our method; 1D subspace pair recovered by CCA. Our methodrecovers the dependency between views in the 5th dimension despite mirroring and scale differences;CCA fails to do so. Table: means and standard deviations of the correspondence measure (10); ourmethod outperforms CCA and LPCCA, recovering the dependency in all artificial data sets.
Figure 2:	Mean precision-mean recalls curves from different real data on the test sets. Top row:view 1 as the ground truth; bottom row: subspace from view 1 as the ground truth. We can seecurves from our method are to the top and/or right of the curves from other methods in most parts ofall sub-figures, meaning our method achieves better precision and recall on average. Column 1-3:our method outperforms CCA and LPCCA; column 4: our method outperforms PCA.
Figure 3: Lissajous curves (a) and found subspaces from our method. (b) - (d) show We find thecorrect dependency: (b): perfect linear correlation shows the time dimension was found. (c): thenumber of “quick turns” (14 in total) in the smooth curves roughly matches that in the originalcurves. (d): projection weights, darker color means smaller magnitude; high magnitude of P(1) ’sfirst entry and the complementary pattern in P(2) suggest we capture the dependency correctly.
