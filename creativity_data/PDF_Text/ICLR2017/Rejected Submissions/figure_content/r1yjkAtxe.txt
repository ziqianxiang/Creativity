Figure 1: Left: Illustration of state aggregation and skills. Primitive actions (orange arrows) causetransitions between MDP states (black dots) while skills (red arrows) induce transitions betweenSAMDP states (blue circles). Right: Modeling approaches for analyzing trained policies.
Figure 2: State-action diagrams for a gridworld problem. a. MDP diagram: relate to individual statesand primitive actions. b. SMDP diagram: Edge colors represent different skills. c. AMDP diagram:clusters are formed using spatial aggregation in the original state. d. SAMDP diagram: clustersare found after transforming the state space. intra-cluster transitions (dashed arrows) can be usedto explain the skills, while inter-cluster transitions (big red arrows) loyally describe the governingpolicy.
Figure 3: SAMDP visualization for Breakout. Each MDP state is represented on the map by its twot-SNE coordinates and colored by its value estimate (low values in blue and high in red). SAMDPstates are visualized by their mean state (with frame pixels) at the mean t-SNE coordinate. An Edgebetween two SAMDP states represents a skill (bold side indicate terminal state), and the numbersabove the edges correspond to the inferred SAMDP policy.
