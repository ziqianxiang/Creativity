Figure 1: Obtained song units starting at 60 seconds (left), 255 seconds (middle) and 495 seconds(right). The spectrogram of the whale song (top), and the obtained state sequence (bottom) by theBlocked Gibbs sampler inference approach for the HDP-HMM. The silence (unit 1 and 5) lookswell separated from the whale signal. Whale up and down sweeps (unit 2), harmonics (unit 3 and 4)and broad sounds (unit 6) are also present. See fig 13 for bigger figures.
Figure 2: Obtained song units on 15 seconds of Carduelis chloris bird song. The spectrogram of thebird song (top), and the obtained state sequence (bottom) by the Blocked Gibbs sampler inferenceapproach for the HDP-HMM. Three song units persist in this sound. The silence looks well separatedfrom the bird signal. Furthermore, we can denote that song units fit well the song and similarity inspectrum persists for each song unit. See fig 14 for bigger figures.

Figure 8: Fringilla coelebs results. The first graph represents the labelled ground truth over 30swhere label 0 is always the ”none” label and the other labels are not the same from one graph to another. The second graph represents our model with the 76 classes. The last one is the spectrogram.
