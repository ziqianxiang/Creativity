Figure 1: Samples on MNIST using a Bernoulli likelihood in the transition operator, 8 walkbacksteps during training, and 13 walkback steps during sampling. On right. Diffusion process forsampling MNIST digits starting from bernoiulli noise. This shows how the variational walkbackiteratively generates images starting from a noise prior. For intermediate steps we display samplesand for the final step (right) we display the transition operatorâ€™s mean.
Figure 2: Variational Walkback Inpainting MNIST the left half of digits conditioned on the righthalf. The goal is to fill in the left half of an MNIST digit given an observed right half of an image(drawn from validation set).
