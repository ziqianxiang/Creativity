Figure 3:	Trained experts for MNIST digits. Left: Expert probabilities (white/black corresponds toμk (d) = 0/1). Right: Levels of expertise (blue/red corresponds to small/large values).
Figure 4:	Reconstruction of MNIST test examples using likelihood matching pursuit. Each columnvisualizes the composed Bernoulli templates during the sequential inference procedure (top down)for one sample. The bottom row are the original data points.
Figure 5: Dynamic supports for 5 MNIST experts. Left column: Expert probabilities. Remainingcolumns: Composed Bernoulli templates for 10 latent configurations. The cast opinion of the expertis shown in shades of red (White/red corresponds to μk (d) = 0/1).
Figure 6: Trained experts for Weizmann horses. Left: Expert probabilities (white/black correspondsto μk (d) = 0/1). Right: Levels of expertise (blue/red corresponds to small/large values).
Figure 7: Decomposition of the test examples from the Weizmann horse dataset. 1st column:Original data points. 2nd column: Reconstructions (shown are the composed Bernoulli templates).
Figure 8: Reconstructions of the test examples from the Caltech motorcycle dataset. Odd rows:Original data. Even rows: Reconstructions (shoWn are the composed Gaussian means).
