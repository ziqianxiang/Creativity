Figure 1: Left: Factor analysis model: hidden units (factors) h, visible units v, weight matrix W,noise e. Right: The outer product W hÏ„ of two sparse vectors results in a matrix with a bicluster.
Figure 2: Example of an IBD segment matching the Neandertal genome shared among multiplepopulations. The rows give all individuals that contain the IBD segment and columns consecutiveSNVs. Major alleles are shown in yellow, minor alleles of tagSNVs in violet, and minor alleles ofother SNVs in cyan. The row labeled model L indicates tagSNVs identified by RFN in violet. Therows Ancestor, Neandertal, and Denisova show bases of the respective genomes in violet if theymatch the minor allele of the tagSNVs (in yellow otherwise). For the Ancestor genome we used thereconstructed common ancestor sequence that was provided as part of the 1000 Genomes Projectdata.
