Figure 1: The CV-BiGAN Architecture. The two top levels correspond to the BiGAN model, while thethird level is added to model the distribution over the latent space given the input of the CV-BiGAN.
Figure 2: The MV-BiGAN additional components. In this example, we consider a case where onlyX1 is available (top level) and a second case where both X1 and X3 are available. The distributionP(z∣X1,X3) is encouraged to be "included"in P(z|X1) by the KL constraint. The aggregation of theviews is made by the φk functions that are learned conjointly with the rest of the model.
Figure 3: Results of the MV-BiGAN on sequences of 4 different views. The first column correspondsto the provided views, while the other columns correspond to outputs sampled by the MV-BiGAN.
Figure 4: MV-BiGAN without KL-constraint (i.e λ = 0).
Figure 5: MV-BiGAN with sequences of incoming views. Here, each view is a 28 × 28 matrix (valuesare between 0 and 1 with missing values replaced by 0.5).
