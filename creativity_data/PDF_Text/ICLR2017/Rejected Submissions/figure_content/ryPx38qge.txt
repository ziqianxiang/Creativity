Figure 1: Architecture of our deep network. Observe that no downsampling is performedNotably, the first layer F1 of this deep convolutional network is structured by its input, the scatteringrepresentation. The nature of this operator and the features selected by this supervised algorithmwill be discussed in the next sections.
