Figure 1: We raise three questions from application, methodology and technique perspectives re-spectively and provide our answers with a case study of the simplest chess game tic-tac-toe.
Figure 2: 18 different types of chessboard states and corresponding labels.
Figure 3: Class activation mapping results on our dataset.
Figure 4: Class activation mapping results after grid lines are added.
Figure 5: Class activation mapping results after piece appearance is changed.
Figure 6: Class activation mapping results on true positive samples at 500 iterations (left, 53.13%accuracy) and 1000 iterations (right, 100% accuracy).
Figure 7: We propose two quantitative evaluation protocols: (a) by selecting the most activatedpatch, we calculate how frequent the representation fire at the correct location; (b) we correlate therepresentation with an ideal activation map.
