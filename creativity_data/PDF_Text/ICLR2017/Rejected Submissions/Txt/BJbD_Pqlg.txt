Ab stract
Computer vision has made remarkable progress in recent years. Deep neural
network (DNN) models optimized to identify objects in images exhibit unprece-
dented task-trained accuracy and, remarkably, some generalization ability: new
visual problems can now be solved more easily based on previous learning. Bio-
logical vision (learned in life and through evolution) is also accurate and general-
purpose. Is it possible that these different learning regimes converge to similar
problem-dependent optimal computations? We therefore asked whether the hu-
man system-level computation of visual perception has DNN correlates and con-
sidered several anecdotal test cases. We found that perceptual sensitivity to image
changes has DNN mid-computation correlates, while sensitivity to segmentation,
crowding and shape has DNN end-computation correlates. Our results quantify
the applicability of using DNN computation to estimate perceptual loss, and are
consistent with the fascinating theoretical view that properties of human percep-
tion are a consequence of architecture-independent visual learning.
1	Quick expert summary
Considering the learned computation of ImageNet-trained DNNs, we find:
•	Large computation changes for perceptually salient image changes (Figure 1).
•	Gestalt: segmentation, crowding, and shape interactions in computation (Figure 2).
•	Contrast constancy: bandpass transduction in first layers is later corrected (Figure 3).
These properties are reminiscent of human perception, perhaps because learned general-purpose
classifiers (human and DNN) tend to converge.
2	Introduction
Deep neural networks (DNNs) are a class of computer learning algorithms that have become widely
used in recent years (LeCun et al., 2015). By training with millions of examples, such models
achieve unparalleled degrees of task-trained accuracy (Krizhevsky et al., 2012). This is not unprece-
dented on its own - steady progress has been made in computer vision for decades, and to some
degree current designs are just scaled versions of long-known principles (Lecun et al., 1998). In pre-
vious models, however, only the design is general-purpose, while learning is mostly specific to the
context of a trained task. Interestingly, for current DNNs trained to solve a large-scale image recog-
nition problem (Russakovsky et al., 2014), the learned computation is useful as a building block for
drastically different and untrained visual problems (Huh et al., 2016; Yosinski et al., 2014).
For example, orientation- and frequency-selective features (Gabor patches) can be considered
general-purpose visual computations. Such features are routinely discovered by DNNs (Krizhevsky
et al., 2012; Zeiler & Fergus, 2013), by other learning algorithms (Hinton & Salakhutdinov, 2006;

Lee et al., 2008; 2009; Olshausen & Field, 1997), and are extensively hard-coded in computer vision
(Jain & Farrokhnia, 1991). Furthermore, a similar computation is believed to underlie the spatial re-
sponse properties of visual neurons of diverse animal phyla (Carandini et al., 2005; DeAngelis et al.,
1995; Hubel & Wiesel, 1968; Seelig & Jayaraman, 2013), and is evident in human visual perception
(Campbell & Robson, 1968; Fogel & Sagi, 1989; Neri et al., 1999). This diversity culminates in sat-
isfying theoretical arguments as to why Gabor-like features are so useful in general-purpose vision
(Olshausen, 1996; Olshausen & Field, 1997).
As an extension, general-purpose computations are perhaps of universal use. For example, a dimen-
sionality reduction transformation that optimally preserves recognition-relevant information may
constitute an ideal computation for both DNN and animal. More formally, different learning algo-
rithms with different physical implementations may converge to the same computation when similar
(or sufficiently general) problems are solved near-optimally. Following this line of reasoning, DNN
models with good general-purpose computations may be computationally similar to biological vi-
sual systems, even more so than less accurate and less general biologically plausible simulations
(Kriegeskorte, 2015; Yamins & DiCarlo, 2016).
Related work seems to be consistent with computation convergence. First, different DNN training
regimes seem to converge to a similar learned computation (Li et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2014). Sec-
ond, image representation may be similar in trained DNN and in biological visual systems. That
is, when the same images are processed by DNN and by humans or monkeys, the final DNN com-
putation stages are strong predictors of human fMRI and monkey electrophysiology data collected
from visual areas V4 and IT (Cadieu et al., 2014; Khaligh-Razavi & Kriegeskorte, 2014; Yamins
et al., 2014). Furthermore, more accurate DNN models exhibit stronger predictive power (Cadieu
et al., 2014; Dubey & Agarwal, 2016; Yamins et al., 2014), and the final DNN computation stage is
even a strong predictor of human-perceived shape discrimination (Kubilius et al., 2016). However,
some caution is perhaps unavoidable, since measured similarity may be confounded with catego-
rization consistency, view-invariance resilience, or similarity in the inherent difficulty of the tasks
undergoing comparison. A complementary approach is to consider images that were produced by
optimizing trained DNN-based perceptual metrics (Gatys et al., 2015a;b; Johnson et al., 2016; Ledig
et al., 2016), which perhaps yields undeniable evidence of non-trivial computational similarity, al-
though a more objective approach may be warranted.
Here, we quantify the similarity between human visual perception, as measured by psychophys-
ical experiments, and individual computational stages (layers) in feed-forward DNNs trained on
a large-scale image recognition problem (ImageNet LSVRC). Comparison is achieved by feeding
the experimental image stimuli to the trained DNN and comparing a DNN metric (mean mutual
information or mean absolute change) to perceptual data. The use of reduced (simplified and typi-
cally non-natural) stimuli ensures identical inherent task difficulty across compared categories and
prevents confounding of categorization consistency with measured similarity. Perception, a system-
level computation, may be influenced less by the architectural discrepancy (biology vs. DNN) than
are neural recordings.
3	Correlate for image change sensitivity
From a perceptual perspective, an image change of fixed size has different saliency depending on im-
age context (Polat & Sagi, 1993). To investigate whether the computation in trained DNNs exhibits
similar contextual modulation, we used the Local Image Masking Database (Alam et al., 2014), in
which 1080 partially-overlapping images were subjected to different levels of the same random ad-
ditive noise perturbation, and for each image, a psychophysical experiment determined the threshold
noise level at which the added-noise image is discriminated from two noiseless copies at 75% (Fig-
ure 1a). Threshold is the objective function that is compared with an L1-distance correlate in the
DNN representation. The scale of measured threshold was:
20 ∙iogιo (std(nτoise)),	⑴
where std (noise) is the standard deviation of the additive noise, and T is the mean image pixel
value calculated over the region where the noise is added (i.e. image center).

The DNN correlate of perceptual threshold we used was the average L1 change in DNN computation
between added-noise images and the original, noiseless image. Formally,
LIn(I) = Iai (I + noise (n)) - ai (I)∣ ,	(2)
where ai (X) is the activation value of neuron i during the DNN feedforward pass for input image
X, and the inner average (denoted by bar) is taken over repetitions with random n-sized noise (noise
is introduced at random phase spectra in a fixed image location, an augmentation that follows the
between-image randomization described by Alam et al., 2014; the number of repetitions was 10 or
more). Unless otherwise specified, the final L1 prediction is Li1,n averaged across noise levels (-40
to 25 dB with 5-dB intervals) and computational neurons (first within and then across computa-
tional stages). Using L1 averaged across noise levels as a correlate for the noise level of perceptual
threshold is a simple approximation with minimal assumptions.
Results show that the L1 metric is correlated with the perceptual threshold for all tested DNN archi-
tectures (Figure 1b, 4a-c). In other words, higher values of the L1 metric (indicating larger changes
in DNN computation due to image perturbation, consistent with higher perturbation saliency) are

correlated with lower values of measured perceptual threshold (indicating that weaker noise levels
are detectable, i.e. higher saliency once more).
To quantify and compare predictive power, we considered the percent of linearly explained vari-
ability (R2). For all tested DNN architectures, the prediction explains about 60% of the perceptual
variability (Tables 1, 2; baselines at Tables 3-5), where inter-person similarity representing theoreti-
cal maximum is 84% (Alam et al., 2014). The DNN prediction is far more accurate than a prediction
based on simple image statistical properties (e.g. RMS contrast), and is on par with a detailed per-
ceptual model that relies on dozens of psychophysically collected parameters (Alam et al., 2014).
The Spearmann correlation coefficient is much higher compared with the perceptual model (with an
absolute SROCC value of about 0.79 compared with 0.70, Table 1), suggesting that the L1 metric
gets the order right but not the scale. We did not compare these results with models that fit the
experimental data (e.g. Alam et al., 2015; Liu & Allebach, 2016), since the L1 metric has no explicit
parameters. Also, different DNN architectures exhibited high similarity in their predictions (R2 of
about 0.9, e.g. Figure 4d).
Prediction can also be made from isolated computational stages, instead of across all stages as
before. This analysis shows that the predictive power peaks mid-computation across all tested image
scales (Figure 1c). This peak is consistent with use of middle DNN layers to optimize perceptual
metrics (Gatys et al., 2015a;b; Ledig et al., 2016), and is reminiscent of cases in which low- to
mid-level vision is the performance limiting computation in the detection of at-threshold stimuli
(Campbell & Robson, 1968; Del Cul et al., 2007).
Finally, considering the images for which the L1 -based prediction has a high error suggests a factor
which causes a systematic inconsistency with perception (Figures 1d, 6). This factor may be related
to the mean image luminance: by introducing noise perturbations according to the scale of Equation
1, a fixed noise size (in dB) corresponds to smaller pixel changes in dark compared with bright
images. (Using this scales reflects an assumption of multiplicative rather than additive conservation;
this assumption may be justified for the representation at the final but perhaps not the intermediate
computational stages considering the log-linear contrast response discussed in Section 5). Another
factor may the degree to which image content is identifiable.

4 Correlate for modulation of sensitivity by context
The previous analysis suggested gross computational similarity between human perception and
trained DNNs. Next, we aimed to extend the comparison to more interpretable properties of per-
ception by considering more highly controlled designs. To this end, we considered cases in which a
static background context modulates the difficulty of discriminating a foreground shape, despite no
spatial overlap of foreground and background. This permits interpretation by considering the cause
of the modulation.
We first consider segmentation, in which arrangement is better discriminated for arrays of consis-
tently oriented lines compared with inconsistently oriented lines (Figure 2a) (Pinchuk-Yacobi et al.,
2016). Crowding is considered next, where surround clutter that is similar to the discriminated
target leads to deteriorated discrimination performance (Figure 2b) (Livne & Sagi, 2007). Last to
be addressed is object superiority, in which a target line location is better discriminated when it
is in a shape-forming layout (Figure 2c) (Weisstein & Harris, 1974). In this case, clutter is con-
trolled by having the same fixed number of lines in context. To measure perceptual discrimination,
these works introduced performance-limiting manipulations such as location jittering, brief presen-
tation, and temporal masking. While different manipulations showed different measured values,
order-of-difficulty was typically preserved. Here we changed all the original performance-limiting
manipulations to location jittering (whole-shape or element-wise, see Section 8.4).
To quantify discrimination difficulty in DNNs, we measured the target-discriminative information of
isolated neurons (where performance is limited by location jittering noise), then averaged across all
neurons (first within and then across computational layer stages). Specifically, for each neuron, we
measured the reduction in categorization uncertainty due to observation, termed mutual information
(MI):
MI(Ai;C)=H(C)-H(C|Ai),	(3)
where H stands for entropy, and Ai is a random variable for the value of neuron i when the DNN
processes a random image from a category defined by the random variable C. For example, if a
neuron gives a value in the range of 100.0 to 200.0 when the DNN processes images from category
A, and 300.0 to 400.0 for category B, then the category is always known by observing the value, and
so mutual information is high (MI=1 bits). On the other extreme, if the neuron has no discriminative
task information, then MI=0 bits. To measure MI, we quantized activations into eight equal-amount
bins, and used 500 samples (repetitions having different location jittering noise) across categories.
The motivation for this correlate is the assumption that the perceptual order-of-difficulty reflects the
quantity of task-discriminative information in the representation.
Results show that, across hundreds of configurations (varying pattern element size, target location,
jitter magnitude, and DNN architecture; see Section 8.4), the qualitative order of difficulty in terms
of the DNN MI metric is consistent with the order of difficulty measured in human psychophysical
experiments, for the conditions addressing segmentation and crowding (Figures 2d, 7; for baseline
models see Figure 8). It is interesting to note that the increase in similarity develops gradually along
different layer types in the DNN computation (i.e. not just pooling layers), and is accompanied
by a gradual increase in the quantity of task-relevant information (Figure 2e-g). This indicates a
link between task relevance and computational similarity for the tested conditions. Note that unlike
the evident increase in isolated unit task information, the task information from all units combined
decreases by definition along any computational hierarchy. An intuition for this result is that the
total hidden information decreases, while more accessible per-unit information increases.
For shape formation, four out of six shapes consistently show order of difficulty like perception, and
two shapes consistently do no (caricature at Figure 2h; actual data at Figure 9).

5 Correlate for contrast sensitivity
A cornerstone of biological vision research is the use of sine gratings at different frequencies, ori-
entations, and contrasts (Campbell & Robson, 1968). Notable are results showing that the lowest
perceivable contrast in human perception depends on frequency. Specifically, high spatial frequen-
cies are attenuated by the optics of the eye, and low spatial frequencies are believed to be attenuated
due to processing inefficiencies (Watson & Ahumada, 2008), so that the lowest perceivable contrast
is found at intermediate frequencies. (To appreciate this yourself, examine Figure 3a). Thus, for
low-contrast gratings, the physical quantity of contrast is not perceived correctly: it is not preserved
across spatial frequencies. Interestingly, this is corrected for gratings of higher contrasts, for which
perceived contrast is more constant across spatial frequencies (Georgeson & Sullivan, 1975).
The DNN correlate we considered is the mean absolute change in DNN representation between a
gray image and sinusoidal gratings, at all combinations of spatial frequency and contrast. Formally,
for neurons in a given layer, we measured:

where ai (contrast, f requency) is the average activation value of neuron i to 250 sine images
(random orientation, random phase), ai (0, 0) is the response to a blank (gray) image, and Nneurons
is the number of neurons in the layer. This measure reflects the overall change in response vs. the
gray image.
Results show a bandpass response for low-contrast gratings (blue lines strongly modulated by fre-
quency, Figures 3, 10), and what appears to be a mostly constant response at high contrast for
end-computation layers (red lines appear more invariant to frequency), in accordance with percep-
tion.
We next aimed to compare these results with perception. Data from human experiments is generally
iso-output (i.e. for a pre-set output, such as 75% detection accuracy, the input is varied to find the
value which produce the preset output). However, the DNN measurements here are iso-input (i.e.
for a fixed input contrast the L1 is measured). As such, human data should be compared to the inter-
poalted inverse of DNN measurements. Specifically, for a set output value, the interpolated contrast
value which produce the output is found for every frequency (Figure 11). This analysis permits
quantifying the similarity of iso-output curves for human and DNN, measured here as the percent of
log-Contrast variability in human measurements which is explained by the DNN predictions. This
showed a high explained variability at the end computation stage (prob layer, R2 = 94%), but
importantly, a similarly high value at the first computational stage (Conv1_1 layer, R2 = 96%).
Intiutively, while the ”internal representation” variability in terms of L1 is small, the iso-output
number-of-input-contrast-cahnges variability is still high. For example. for the prob layer, about
the same L1 is measured for (Contrast=1,freq=75) and for (Contrast=0.18,freq=12).
An interesting, unexpected observation is that the logarithmically spaced contrast inputs are linearly
spaced at the end-computation layers. That is, the average change in DNN representation scales
logarithmically with the size of input change. This can be quantified by the correlation of output L1
with log Contrast input, which showed R2 = 98% (averaged across spatial frequencies) for prob,
while much lower values were observed for early and middle layers (up to layer fc7). The same
computation when scrambling the learned parameters of the model showed R2 = 60%. Because the
degree of log-linearity observed was extremely high, it may be an important emergent property of
the learned DNN computation, which may deserve further investigation. However, this property is
only reminiscent and not immediately consistent with the perceptual power-law scaling (Gottesman
et al., 1981).

6 Discussion
6.1	Human perception in computer vision
It may be tempting to believe that what we see is the result of a simple transformation of visual
input. Centuries of psychophysics have, however, revealed complex properties in perception, by
crafting stimuli that isolate different perceptual properties. In our study, we used the same stimuli to
investigate the learned properties of deep neural networks (DNNs), which are the leading computer
vision algorithms to date (LeCun et al., 2015).
The DNNs we used were trained in a supervised fashion to assign labels to input images. To some
degree, this task resembles the simple verbal explanations given to children by their parents. Since
human perception is obviously much richer than the simple external supervision provided, we were
not surprised to find that the best correlate for perceptual saliency of image changes is a part of the
DNN computation that is only supervised indirectly (i.e. the mid-computation stage). This similarity
is so strong, that even with no fine-tuning to human perception, the DNN metric is competitively
accurate, even compared with a direct model of perception.
This strong, quantifiable similarity to a gross aspect of perception may, however, reflect amix of sim-
ilarities and discrepancies in different perceptual properties. To address isolated perceptual effects,
we considered experiments that manipulate a spatial interaction, where the difficulty of discrimi-
nating a foreground target is modulated by a background context. Results showed modulation of
DNN target diagnostic, isolated unit information, consistent with the modulation found in percep-
tual discrimination. This was shown for contextual interactions reflecting grouping/segmentation
(Harris et al., 2015), crowding/clutter (Livne & Sagi, 2007; Pelli et al., 2004), and shape superiority
(Weisstein & Harris, 1974). DNN similarity to these groupings/gestalt phenomena appeared at the
end-computation stages.
No less interesting, are the cases in which there is no similarity. For example, perceptual effects
related to 3D (Erdogan & Jacobs, 2016) and symmetry (Pramod & Arun, 2016) do not appear to have
a strong correlate in the DNN computation. Indeed, it may be interesting to investigate the influence
of visual experience in these cases. And, equally important, similarity should be considered in terms
of specific perceptual properties rather than as a general statement.
6.2	Recurrent vs. feedforward connectivity
In the human hierarchy of visual processing areas, information is believed to be processed in a feed-
forward sweep, followed by recurrent processing loops (top-down and lateral) (Lamme & Roelf-
sema, 2000). Thus, for example, the early visual areas can perform deep computations. Since
mapping from visual areas to DNN computational layers is not simple, it will not be considered
here. (Note that ResNet connectivity is perhaps reminiscent of unrolled recurrent processing).
Interestingly, debate is ongoing about the degree to which visual perception is dependent on re-
current connectivity (Fabre-Thorpe et al., 1998; Hung et al., 2005): recurrent representations are
obviously richer, but feedforward computations converge much faster. An implicit question here
regarding the extent of feasible feed-forward representations is, perhaps: Can contour segmentation,
contextual influences, and complex shapes be learned? Based on the results reported here for feed-
forward DNNs, a feedforward representation may seem sufficient. However, the extent to which this
is true may be very limited. In this study we used small images with a small number of lines, while
effects such as contour integration seem to take place even in very large configurations (Field et al.,
1993). Such scaling seems more likely in a recurrent implementation. As such, a reasonable hy-
pothesis may be that the full extent of contextual influence is only realizable with recurrence, while
feedforward DNNs learn a limited version by converging towards a useful computation.
6.3	Implications and future work
6.3.1	Use in brain modeling
The use of DNNs in modeling of visual perception (or of biological visual systems in general) is
subject to a tradeoff between accuracy and biological plausibility. In terms of architecture, other
deep models better approximate our current understanding of the visual system (Riesenhuber &
8
Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2017
Poggio, 1999; Serre, 2014). However, the computation in trained DNN models is quite general-
purpose (Huh et al., 2016; Yosinski et al., 2014) and offers unparalleled accuracy in recognition tasks
(LeCun et al., 2015). Since visual computations are, to some degree, task- rather than architecture-
dependent, an accurate and general-purpose DNN model may better resemble biological processing
than less accurate biologically plausible ones (Kriegeskorte, 2015; Yamins & DiCarlo, 2016). We
support this view by considering a controlled condition in which similarity is not confounded with
task difficulty or categorization consistency.
6.3.2	Use in psychophysics
Our results imply that trained DNN models have good predictive value for outcomes of psychophys-
ical experiments, permitting a zero-cost first-order approximation. Note, however, that the scope of
such simulations may be limited, since learning (Sagi, 2011) and adaptation (Webster, 2011) were
not considered here.
Another fascinating option is the formation of hypotheses in terms of mathematically differentiable
trained-DNN constraints, whereby it is possible to efficiently solve for the visual stimuli that opti-
mally dissociate the hypotheses (see Gatys et al. 2015a;b; Mordvintsev et al. 2015 and note Goodfel-
low et al. 2014; Szegedy et al. 2013). The conclusions drawn from such stimuli can be independent
of the theoretical assumptions about the generating process (for example, creating new visual illu-
sions that can be seen regardless of how they were created).
6.3.3	Use in engineering (a perceptual loss metric)
As proposed previously (Dosovitskiy & Brox, 2016; Johnson et al., 2016; Ledig et al., 2016), the
saliency of small image changes can be estimated as the representational distance in trained DNNs.
Here, we quantified this approach by relying on data from a controlled psychophysical experiment
(Alam et al., 2014). We found the metric to be far superior to simple image statistical properties,
and on par with a detailed perceptual model (Alam et al., 2014). This metric can be useful in image
compression, whereby optimizing degradation across image sub-patches by comparing perceptual
loss may minimize visual artifacts and content loss.

8 Appendix: Experimental setup
8.1	DNN MODELS
To collect DNN computation snapshots, we used MATLAB with MatConvNet version 1.0-beta20
(Vedaldi & Lenc, 2015). All MATLAB code will be made available upon acceptance of this
manuscript. The pre-trained DNN models we have used are: CaffeNet (which is a variant of AlexNet
provided in Caffe, Jia et al., 2014), GoogLeNet (Szegedy et al., 2014), VGG-19 (Simonyan & Zis-
serman, 2014), and ResNet-152 (He et al., 2015). The models were trained on the same ImageNet
LSVRC. The CaffeNet model was trained using Caffe with the default ImageNet training parame-
ters (stopping at iteration 310, 000) and imported into MatConvNet. For the GoogLeNet model, we
used the imported pre-trained reference-Caffe implementation. For VGG-19 and ResNet-152, we
used the imported pre-trained original versions. In all experiments input image size was 224 × 224
or 227 × 227.
8.2	Baseline models
As baselines to compare with pre-trained DNN models, we consider: (a) a multiscale linear filter
bank of Gabor functions, (b) a steerable-pyramid linear filter bank (Simoncelli & Freeman, 1995),
(c) the VGG-19 model for which the learned parameters (weights) were randomly scrambled within
layer, and (d) the CaffeNet model at multiple time points during training. For the Gabor decom-
position, the following Gabor filters were used: all compositions of σ = {1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64}px,
λ = {1, 2}∙ σ, orientation= {0, π∕3, 2π∕3, π, 4π∕3,5∏∕3}, and phase= {0, ∏∕2}.
8.3	Image perturbation experiment
The noiseless images were obtained from Alam et al. (2014). In main text, ”image scale” refers to
percent coverage of DNN input. Since size of original images (149 × 149) is smaller than DNN
input of (224 × 224) or (227 × 227), the images were resized by a factor of 1.5 so that 100% image
scale covers approximately the entire DNN input area.
Human psychophysics and DNN experiments were done for nearly identical images. A slight dis-
crepancy relates to how the image is blended with the background in the special case where the
region where noise is added has no image surround at one or two side. In these sides (which depend
on the technical procedure with which images were obtained, see Alam et al., 2014), the surround
blending here was hard, while the original was smooth.
8.4	Background context experiment
8.4.1	S egmentation
The images used are based on the Texture Discrimination Task (Karni & Sagi, 1991). In the variant
considered here (Pinchuk-Yacobi et al., 2015), subjects were presented with a grid of lines, all of
which were horizontal, except two or three that were diagonal. Subjects discriminated whether the
arrangement of diagonal lines is horizontal or vertical, and this discrimination was found to be more
difficult when the central line is horizontal rather than diagonal (”Hard” vs. ”Easy” in Figure 2a).
To limit human performance in this task, two manipulations were applied: (a) the location of each
line in the pattern was jittered, and (b) a noise mask was presented briefly after the pattern. Here we
only retained (a).
A total of 90 configurations were tested, obtained by combinations of the following alternatives:
•	Three scales: line length of 9, 12.3, or 19.4 px (number of lines co-varied with line length,
see Figure 12).
•	Three levels of location jittering, defined as a multiple of line length: {1, 2,3}∙ 0.0625 ∙ l
px, where l is the length of a line in the pattern. Jittering was applied separately to each
line in the pattern.
•	Ten locations of diagonal lines: center, random, four locations of half-distance from center
to corners, four locations of half-distance from center to image borders.

For each configuration, the discriminated arrangement of diagonal lines was either horizontal or
vertical, and the central line was either horizontal or diagonal (i.e. hard or easy).

images used were white-on-black rather than black-on-white.
8.4.2	Crowding
The images used are motivated by the crowding effect (Livne & Sagi, 2007; Pelli et al., 2004).
A total of 90 configurations were tested, obtained by combinations of the following alternatives:
•	Three scales: font size of 15.1, 20.6, or 32.4 Px (see Figure 13).
•	Three levels of discriminated-letter location jittering, defined as a multiple of font size:
{1,2, 3}∙ 0.0625 ∙ l px, where l is font size. The jitter of surround letters (m, N, S, and T)
was fixed (i.e. the background was static).
•	Ten locations: center, random, four locations of half-distance from center to corners, four
locations of half-distance from center to image borders.
For each configuration, the discriminated letter was either A, B, C, D, E, or F, and the background
was either blank (easy) or composed of the letters M, N, S, and T (hard).

images used were white-on-black rather than black-on-white.
8.4.3 Shape
The images used are based on the object superiority effect by Weisstein & Harris (1974), where
discriminating a line location is easier when combined with surrounding lines a shape is formed.
A total of 90 configurations were tested, obtained by combinations of the following alternatives:
•	Three scales: discriminated-line length of 9, 15.1, or 22.7 px (see Figure 14).
•	Five levels of whole-pattern location jittering, defined as a multiple of discriminated-line
length: {1, 2, 5,10,15} ∙ 0.0625 •/ px, where l is the length of the discriminated line.

•	Six ”hard” background line layouts (patterns b-f of their Figure 2 and the additional pattern
f of their Figure 3 in Weisstein & Harris, 1974). The ”easy” layout was always the same
(pattern a).
For each configuration, the line whose location is discriminated had four possible locations (two
locations are shown in Figure 2c), and the surrounding background line layout could compose a
shape (easy) or not (hard).
