Ab stract
We propose the Gaussian attention model for content-based neural memory ac-
cess. With the proposed attention model, a neural network has the additional
degree of freedom to control the focus of its attention from a laser sharp attention
to a broad attention. It is applicable whenever we can assume that the distance
in the latent space reflects some notion of semantics. We use the proposed atten-
tion model as a scoring function for the embedding of a knowledge base into a
continuous vector space and then train a model that performs question answering
about the entities in the knowledge base. The proposed attention model can han-
dle both the propagation of uncertainty when following a series of relations and
also the conjunction of conditions in a natural way. On a dataset of soccer players
who participated in the FIFA World Cup 2014, we demonstrate that our model can
handle both path queries and conjunctive queries well.
1 Introduction
There is a growing interest in incorporating external memory into neural networks. For example,
memory networks (Weston et al., 2014; Sukhbaatar et al., 2015) are equipped with static memory
slots that are content or location addressable. Neural Turing machines (Graves et al., 2014) imple-
ment memory slots that can be read and written as in Turing machines (Turing, 1938) but through
differentiable attention mechanism.
Each memory slot in these models stores a vector corresponding to a continuous representation of
the memory content. In order to recall a piece of information stored in memory, attention is typically
employed. Attention mechanism introduced by Bahdanau et al. (2014) uses a network that outputs
a discrete probability mass over memory items. A memory read can be implemented as a weighted
sum of the memory vectors in which the weights are given by the attention network. Reading out a
single item can be realized as a special case in which the output of the attention network is peaked
at the desired item. The attention network may depend on the current context as well as the memory
item itself. The attention model is called location-based and content-based, if it depends on the
location in the memory and the stored memory vector, respectively.
Knowledge bases, such as WordNet and Freebase, can also be stored in memory either through an
explicit knowledge base embedding (Bordes et al., 2011; Nickel et al., 2011; Socher et al., 2013) or
through a feedforward network (Bordes et al., 2015).
When we embed entities from a knowledge base in a continuous vector space, if the capacity of
the embedding model is appropriately controlled, we expect semantically similar entities to be close
to each other, which will allow the model to generalize to unseen facts. However the notion of
proximity may strongly depend on the type of a relation. For example, Benjamin Franklin was an
engineer but also a politician. We would need different metrics to capture his proximity to other
engineers and politicians of his time.

Inner-product	GaUssian	GaUssian
Figure 1: Comparison of the conventional content-based attention model using inner product and
the proposed Gaussian attention model with the same mean but two different covariances.
In this paper, We propose a new attention model for content-based addressing. Our model scores
each item vitem in the memory by the (logarithm of) multivariate Gaussian likelihood as follows:
SCOre(Vitem) = log φ(Vitem lμconteχt, ςcontext )
=-2(Vitem - NcontexJEcontexKvitem ― μconteXt) + COnSt∙	(I)
where context denotes all the variables that the attention depends on. For example, “American
engineers in the 18th century” or “American politicians in the 18th century” would be two contexts
that include Benjamin Franklin but the two attentions would have very different shapes.
Compared to the (normalized) inner product used in previous work (Sukhbaatar et al., 2015; Graves
et al., 2014) for content-based addressing, the Gaussian model has the additional control of the
spread of the attention over items in the memory. As we show in Figure 1, we can view the conven-
tional inner-product-based attention and the proposed Gaussian attention as addressing by an affine
energy function and a quadratic energy function, respectively. By making the addressing mechanism
more complex, we may represent many entities in a relatively low dimensional embedding space.
Since knowledge bases are typically extremely sparse, it is more likely that we can afford to have a
more complex attention model than a large embedding dimension.
We apply the proposed Gaussian attention model to question answering based on knowledge bases.
At the high-level, the goal of the task is to learn the mapping from a question about objects in the
knowledge base in natural language to a probability distribution over the entities. We use the scoring
function (1) for both embedding the entities as vectors, and extracting the conditions mentioned in
the question and taking a conjunction of them to score each candidate answer to the question.
The ability to compactly represent a set of objects makes the Gaussian attention model well suited for
representing the uncertainty in a multiple-answer question (e.g., “who are the children of Abraham
Lincoln?”). Moreover, traversal over the knowledge graph (see Guu et al., 2015) can be naturally
handled by a series of Gaussian convolutions, which generalizes the addition of vectors. In fact, we
model each relation as a Gaussian with mean and variance parameters. Thus a traversal on a relation
corresponds to a translation in the mean and addition of the variances.
The proposed question answering model is able to handle not only the case where the answer to a
question is associated with an atomic fact, which is called simple Q&A (Bordes et al., 2015), but also
questions that require composition of relations (path queries in Guu et al. (2015)) and conjunction of
queries. An example flow of how our model deals with a question “Who plays forward for Borussia
Dortmund?” is shown in Figure 2 in Section 3.
This paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we describe how the Gaussian scoring function
(1) can be used to embed the entities in a knowledge base into a continuous vector space. We call
our model TransGaussian because of its similarity to the TransE model proposed by Bordes et al.
(2013). Then in Section 3, we describe our question answering model. In Section 4, we carry out
experiments on WorldCup2014 dataset we collected. The dataset is relatively small but it allows us
to evaluate not only simple questions but also path queries and conjunction of queries. The proposed
TransGaussian embedding with the question answering model achieves significantly higher accuracy
than the vanilla TransE embedding or TransE trained with compositional relations Guu et al. (2015)
combined with the same question answering model.

2	Knowledge Base embedding
In this section, we describe the proposed TransGaussian model based on the Gaussian attention
model (1). While it is possible to train a network that computes the embedding in a single pass
(Bordes et al., 2015) or over multiple passes (Li et al., 2015), it is more efficient to offload the
embedding as a separate step for question answering based on a large static knowledge base.
2.1	The TransGaussian model
Let E be the set of entities and R be the set of relations. A knowledge base is a collec-
tion of triplets (s, r, o), where we call s ∈ E, r ∈ R, and o ∈ E, the subject, the re-
lation, and the object of the triplet, respectively. Each triplet encodes a fact. For example,
(Albert-Einstein, has,profession, theoretical-physicist). All the triplets given
in a knowledge base are assumed to be true. However generally speaking a triplet may be true or
false. Thus knowledge base embedding aims at training a model that predict if a triplet is true or not
given some parameterization of the entities and relations (Bordes et al., 2011; 2013; Nickel et al.,
2011; Socher et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2014).
In this paper, we associate a vector vs ∈ Rd with each entity s ∈ E, and we associate each relation
r ∈ R with two parameters, δr ∈ Rd and a positive definite symmetric matrix Σr ∈ Rd+×+d.
Given subject s and relation r, we can compute the score of an object o to be in triplet (s, r, o) using
the Gaussian attention model as (1) with
SCore(S,r,o) = log Φ(Vo∣μconteχt, ∑context),	(2)
where μ°ontext = Vs + δr, ∑context = ∑r. Note that if ∑r is fixed to the identity matrix, We
are modeling the relation of subjeCt vs and objeCt vo as a translation δr , whiCh is equivalent to
the TransE model (Bordes et al., 2013). We allow the CovarianCe Σr to depend on the relation to
handle one-to-many relations (e.g., profession_has_person relation) and capture the shape of
the distribution of the set of objeCts that Can be in the triplet. We Call our model TransGaussian
because of its similarity to TransE (Bordes et al., 2013).
Parameterization For computational efficiency, we will restrict the covariance matrix Σr to be
diagonal in this paper. Furthermore, in order to ensure that Σr is strictly positive definite, we employ
the exponential linear unit (ELU, Clevert et al., 2015) and parameterize Σr as follows:
ELU(mr,1)+1+
ELU(mr,d)+1+
where mr,j (j = 1, . . . , d) are the unconstrained parameters that are optimized during training and
is a small positive value that ensure the positivity of the variance during numerical computation.
The ELU is defined as
ELU(x)
x,
exp (x) - 1,
x ≥ 0,
x < 0.
Ranking loss Suppose we have a set of triplets T = {(Si, ri, oi)}iN=1 from the knowledge base.
Let N(s, r) be the set of incorrect objects to be in the triplet (s, r, ∙).
Our objective function uses the ranking loss to measure the margin between the scores of true an-
swers and those of false answers and it can be written as follows:
min
{ve：eWE},_
{δr ,M r,yr-∈RR }
+ λ I Ekvek2 + £ (kδrk2 + kMrkF)1 ,	⑶
∖e∈E	r∈R	J
where, N = |T|, μ is the margin parameter and Mr denotes the diagonal matrix with m『,j, j =
1,... ,d on the diagonal; the function [•]+ is defined as [x]+ = max(0, x). Here, we treat an inverse
N X Et0〜N(s,r) [[μ - SCore(S,r,o) + SCore(S,r,t0)]+]
(s,r,o)∈T

relation as a separate relation and denote by TR = R∪ R-1 the set of all the relations including both
relations in R and their inverse relations; a relation r is the inverse relation of r if (s, r, o) implies
(o, r, S) and vice versa. Moreover, Et，〜N(s,r)denotes the expectation with respect to the uniform
distribution over the set of incorrect objects, which we approximate with 10 random samples in the
experiments. Finally, the last terms are `2 regularization terms for the embedding parameters.
2.2	Compositional relations
Guu et al. (2015) has recently shown that training TransE with compositional relations can make
it competitive to more complex models, although TransE is much simpler compared to for exam-
ple, neural tensor networks (NTN, Socher et al. (2013)) and TransH Wang et al. (2014). Here,
a compositional relation is a relation that is composed as a series of relations in R, for exam-
ple, grand_father_of can be composed as first applying the Parent_of relation and then the
father_of relation, which can be seen as a traversal over a path on the knowledge graph.
TransGaussian model can naturally handle and propagate the uncertainty over such a chain of
relations by convolving the Gaussian distributions along the path. That is, the score of an en-
tity o to be in the T-step relation r1∕r2/ •…/r with subject s, which We denote by the triplet
(s,r1∕r2∕ .…∕rτ, o), is given as
score(s,ri∕r2∕ …∕rτ,o) = log φ(vo ∣μcontext, ∑context),	(4)
with μcontext = Vs + PT=I δ兀, Σcontext = PT=I ∑rt, where the covariance associated with
each relation is parameterized in the same way as in the previous subsection.
Training with compositional relations
Let P = {(si,ri"ri2∕ .…∕r%,θi)} ] be a set of
randomly sampled paths from the knowledge graph. Here relation rik in a path can be a relation in
R or an inverse relation in R-1. With the scoring function (4), the generalized training objective
for compositional relations can be written identically to (3) except for replacing T with T ∪ P and
replacing N with N0 = |T ∪ P |.
3	Question answering
Given a set of question-answer pairs, in which the question is phrased in natural language and the an-
swer is an entity in the knowledge base, our goal is to train a model that learns the mapping from the
question to the correct entity. Our question answering model consists of three steps, entity recog-
nition, relation composition, and conjunction. We first identify a list of entities mentioned in the
question (which is assumed to be provided by an oracle in this paper). If the question is “Who plays
Forward for Borussia Dortmund?” then the list would be [Forward, Borussia-Dortmund].
The next step is to predict the path of relations on the knowledgegraph starting from each en-
tity in the list extracted in the first step. In the above example, this will be (smooth versions of)
/Forward/position_played_by/ and /Borussia_Dortmund/has_player/ predicted
as series of Gaussian convolutions. In general, we can have multiple relations appearing in each path.
Finally, we take a product of all the Gaussian attentions and renormalize it, which is equivalent to
Bayes’ rule with independent observations (paths) and a noninformative prior.
3.1	Entity recognition
We assume that there is an oracle that provides a list containing all the entities mentioned in the
question, because (1) a domain specific entity recognizer can be developed efficiently (Williams
et al., 2015) and (2) generally entity recognition is a challenging task and it is beyond the scope
of this paper to show whether there is any benefit in training our question answering model jointly
with a entity recognizer. We assume that the number of extracted entities can be different for each
question.
3.2	Relation composition
We train a long short-term memory (LSTM, Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997) network that emits
an output ht for each token in the input sequence. Then we compute the attention over the hidden
4

Figure 2: The input to the system is a question in natural language. TWo entities Forward and
Borussia-Dortmund are identified in the question and associated with point mass distributions
centered at the corresponding entity vectors. An LSTM encodes the input into a sequence of output
vectors of the same length. Then we take average of the output vectors weighted by attention pt,e for
each recognized entity e to predict the weight αr,e for relation r associated with entity e. We form
a Gaussian attention over the entities for each entity e by convolving the corresponding point mass
with the (pre-trained) Gaussian embeddings of the relations weighted by αr,e according to Eq. (6).
The final prediction is produced by taking the product and normalizing the Gaussian attentions.
states for each recognized entity e as
pt,e = softmax (f (ve, ht))	(t = 1, . . . ,T),
where ve is the vector associated with the entity e. We use a two-layer perceptron for f in our
experiments, which can be written as follows:
f (ve, ht) = uf>ReLU (W f,vve + Wf,hht + b1) + b2,
where Wf,v ∈RL×d, Wf,h ∈RL×H, b1 ∈ RL, uf ∈ RL, b2 ∈ R are parameters. Here ReLU(x) =
max(0, x) is the rectified linear unit. Finally, softmax denotes softmax over the T tokens.
Next, we use the weights pt,e to compute the weighted sum over the hidden states ht as
oe = XtT=1 pt,eht.	(5)
Then we compute the weights αr,e over all the relations as αr,e = ReLU wr>oe (∀r ∈ R ∪
R-1). Here the rectified linear unit is used to ensure the positivity of the weights. Note however
that the weights should not be normalized, because we may want to use the same relation more than
once in the same path. Making the weights positive also has the effect of making the attention sparse
and interpretable because there is no cancellation.
For each extracted entity e, we view the extracted entity and the answer of the question to be the
subject and the object in some triplet (e, p, o), respectively, where the path p is inferred from the
question as the weights αr,e as we described above. Accordingly, the score for each candidate
answer o can be expressed using (1) as:
Scoree(Vo) =Iog Φ(Vo∣μe,α,KB, ∑e,α,KB)	(6)
with μe,α,KB = Ve + Pr∈R α-eδr, ∑e,α,KB = Pr∈R 0/'/,Where Ve is the Vector associated
with entity e and TR = R∪ RT denotes the set of relations including the inverse relations.

3.3	Conjunction
Let E(q) be the set of entities recognized in the question q. The final step of our model is to take the
conjunction of the Gaussian attentions derived in the previous step. This step is simply carried out
by multiplying the Gaussian attentions as follows:
SCore(vo∣E(q),⑼=log ɪɪ。(©。^心,KB, Σe,α,KB)
e∈E (q)
=-2 X (Vo - μe,α,KB) £-,a,KB(Vo - μe,α,KB) + const.，	⑺
e∈E(q)
which is again a (logarithm of) Gaussian scoring function, where μe,α,κB and ∑e,α,κB are the mean
and the covariance of the Gaussian attention given in (6). Here Θ denotes all the parameters of the
question-answering model.
3.4	Training the question answering model
Suppose we have a knowledge base (E, R, T) and a trained TransGaussian model
({ve}e∈E ,{(δr, ∑r)}t∈r), Where TR is the set of all relations including the inverse rela-
tions. During training time, we assume the training set is a supervised question-answer pairs
{(qi, E(qi), ai) : i = 1, 2, . . . , m}. Here, qi is a question formulated in natural language, E(qi) ⊂ E
is a set of knowledge base entities that appears in the question, and ai ∈ E is the answer to the
question. For example, on a knowledge base of soccer players, a valid training sample could be
("Who plays forward for Borussia Dortmund?”, [Forward, Borussia-Dortmund], Marco_Reus).
Note that the answer to a question is not necessarily unique and we allow ai to be any of the true
answers in the knowledge base. During test time, our model is shown (qi, E(qi)) and the task is to
find ai. We denote the set of answers to qi by A(qi).
To train our question-answering model, we minimize the objective function
1m
一X( ， E,、[[μ -score(VaiIE (qi),θ) + score(VtOIE (qj θ)]+] + V X X |。") + λkθk2

i=1	(qi)	e∈E(qi) r∈RR
where Et，〜N@)is expectation with respect to a uniform distribution over of all incorrect answers to
qi, which we approximate with 10 random samples. We assume that the number of relations implied
in a question is small compared to the total number of relations in the knowledge base. Hence the
coefficients αr,e computed for each question qi are regularized by their `1 norms.
4	Experiments
As a demonstration of the proposed framework, we perform question and answering on a dataset
of soccer players. In this work, we consider two types of questions. A path query is a question
that contains only one named entity from the knowledge base and its answer can be found from
the knowledge graph by walking down a path consisting of a few relations. A conjunctive query
is a question that contains more than one entities and the answer is given as the conjunction of
all path queries starting from each entity. Furthermore, we experimented on a knowledge base
completion task with TransGaussian embeddings to test its capability of generalization to unseen
fact. Since knowledge base completion is not the main focus of this work, we include the results in
the Appendix.
4.1	WorldCup20 1 4 Dataset
We build a knowledge base of football players that participated in FIFA World Cup
2014 1. The original dataset consists of players’ information such as nationality, posi-
tions on the field and ages etc. We picked a few attributes and constructed 1127 en-
tities and 6 atomic relations. The entities include 736 players, 297 professional soc-
cer clubs, 51 countries, 39 numbers and 4 positions. And the six atomic relations are
1The original dataset can be found at https://datahub.io/dataset/fifa-world-cup-2014-all-players.

plays_in_club： PLAYER → CLUB,	plays_position: PLAYER → POSITION,
is-aged： PLAYER → NUMBER,	wears_number 2: PLAYER → NUMBER,
plays_for_country： PLAYER → COUNTRY,	is_in_country： CLUB → COUNTRY,
where PLAYER, CLUB, NUMBER, etc, denote the type of entities that can appear as the left or
right argument for each relation. Some relations share the same type as the right argument, e.g.,
plays_for_country and is_in_country.
Given the entities and relations, we transformed the dataset into a set of 3977 triplets. A list of
sample triplets can be found in the Appendix. Based on these triplets, we created two sets of question
answering tasks which we call path query and conjunctive query respectively. The answer of every
question is always an entity in the knowledge base and a question can involve one or two triplets.
The questions are generated as follows.
Path queries. Among the paths on the knowledge graph, there are some natural composition of
relations, e.g., plays_in_country (PLAYER → COUNTRY) can be decomposed as the com-
position of plays_in_club (PLAYER→ CLUB) and is_in.Country (CLUB → COUNTRY).
In addition to the atomic relations, we manually picked a few meaningful compositions of relations
and formed query templates, which takes the form “find e ∈ E, such that (s, p, e) is true”, where s
is the subject and p can be an atomic relation or a path of relations. To formulate a set of path-based
question-answer pairs, we manually created one or more question templates for every query tem-
plate (see Table 5) Then, for a particular instantiation of a query template with subject and object
entities, we randomly select a question template to generate a question given the subject; the object
entity becomes the answer of the question. See Table 6 for the list of composed relations, sample
questions, and answers. Note that all atomic relations in this dataset are many-to-one while these
composed relations can be one-to-many or many-to-many as well.
Conjunctive queries. To generate question-and-answer pairs of conjunctive queries, we first
picked three pairs of relations and used them to create query templates of the form “Find e ∈ E ,
such that both (s1, r1, e) and (s2, r2, e) are true.” (see Table 5). For a pair of relations r1 and r2, we
enumerated all pairs of entities s1, s2 that can be their subjects and formulated the corresponding
query in natural language using question templates as in the same way as path queries. See Table 7
for a list of sample questions and answers.
As a result, we created 8003 question-and-answer pairs of path queries and 2208 pairs of conjunctive
queries which are partitioned into train / validation / test subsets. We refer to Table 1 for more
statistics about the dataset. Templates for generating the questions are list in Table 5.
4.2	Experimental setup
To perform question and answering under our proposed framework, we first train the TransGaussian
model on WorldCup2014 dataset. In addition to the atomic triplets, we randomly sampled 50000
paths with length 1 or 2 from the knowledge graph and trained a TransGaussian model composi-
tionally as described in Set 2.2. An inverse relation is treated as a separate relation. Following
the naming convention from Guu et al. (2015), we denote this trained embedding by TransGaus-
sian (COMP). We found that the learned embedding possess some interesting properties. Some
dimensions of the embedding space dedicate to represent a particular relation. Players are clustered
by their attributes when entities’ embeddings are projected to the corresponding lower dimensional
subspaces. We elaborate and illustrate such properties in the Appendix.
Baseline methods We also trained a TransGaussian model only on the atomic triplets and denote
such a model by TransGaussian (SINGLE). Since no inverse relation was involved when Trans-
Gaussian (SINGLE) was trained, to use this embedding in question answering tasks, we represent
the inverse relations as follows： for each relation r with mean δr and variance Σr, we model its
inverse r-1 as a Gaussian attention with mean -δr and variance equal to Σr.
We also trained TransE models on WorldCup2014 dataset by using the code released by the authors
of Guu et al. (2015). Likewise, we use TransE (SINGLE) to denote the model trained with atomic
triplets only and use TransE (COMP) to denote the model trained with the union of triplets and
paths. Note that TransE can be considered as a special case of TransGaussian where the variance
matrix is the identity and hence, the scoring formula Eq. (7) is applicable to TransE as well.

Training configurations For all models, dimension of entity embeddings was set to 30. The hid-
den size of LSTM was set to 80. Word embeddings were trained jointly with the question answering
model and dimension of word embedding was set to 40. We employed Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2014)
as the optimizer. All parameters were tuned on the validation set. Under the same setting, we exper-
imented with two cases: first, we trained models for path queries and conjunctive queries separately;
Furthermore, we trained a single model that addresses both types queries. We present the results of
the latter case in the next subsection while the results of the former are included in the Appendix.
Evaluation metrics During test time, our model receives a question in natural language and a list
of knowledge base entities contained in the question. Then it predicts the mean and variance of a
Gaussian attention formulated in Eq. (7) which is expected to capture the distribution of all positive
answers. We rank all entities in the knowledge base by their scores under this Gaussian attention.
Next, for each entity which is a correct answer, we check its rank relative to all incorrect answers and
call this rank the filtered rank. For example, if a correct entity is ranked above all negative answers
except for one, it has filtered rank two. We compute this rank for all true answers and report mean
filtered rank and H@1 which is the percentage of true answers that have filtered rank 1.
4.3	Experimental results
We present the results of joint learning in Table 2. These results show that TransGaussian works
better than TransE in general. In fact, TransGaussian (COMP) achieved the best performance in
almost all aspects. Most notably, it achieved the highest H@1 rates on challenging questions such
as “where is the club that edin dzeko plays for?” (#11, composition of two relations) and “who are
the defenders on german national team?” (#14, conjunction of two queries).
The same table shows that TransGaussian benefits remarkably from compositional training. For
example, compositional training improved TransGaussian’s H@1 rate by near 60% in queries on
players from a given countries (#8) and queries on players who play a particular position (#9). It
also boosted TransGaussian's performance on all conjunctive quries (#13-#15) significantly.
To understand TransGaussian (COMP)’s weak performance on answering queries on the profes-
sional football club located in a given country (#10) and queries on professional football club that
has players from a particular country (#12), we tested its capability of modeling the composed re-
lation by feeding the correct relations and subjects during test time. It turns out that these two
relations were not modeled well by TransGaussian (COMP) embedding, which limits its perfor-
mance in question answering. (See Table 8 in the Appendix for quantitative evaluations.) The same
limit was found in the other three embeddings as well.
Note that all the models compared in Table 2 uses the proposed Gaussian attention model because
TransE is the special case of TransGaussian where the variance is fixed to one. Thus the main differ-
ences are whether the variance is learned and whether the embedding was trained compositionally.
Finally, we refer to Table 9 and 10 in the Appendix for experimental results of models trained on
path and conjunctive queries separately.

5	Related work
The work of Vilnis & McCallum (2014) is similar to our Gaussian attention model. They discuss
many advantages of the Gaussian embedding; for example, it is arguably a better way of handling
asymmetric relations and entailment. However the work was presented in the word2vec (Mikolov
et al., 2013)-style word embedding setting and the Gaussian embedding was used to capture the
diversity in the meaning of a word. Our Gaussian attention model extends their work to a more
general setting in which any memory item can be addressed through a concept represented as a
Gaussian distribution over the memory items.

Bordes et al. (2014; 2015) proposed a question-answering model that embeds both questions and
their answers to a common continuous vector space. Their method in Bordes et al. (2015) can
combine multiple knowledge bases and even generalize to a knowledge base that was not used
during training. However their method is limited to the simple question answering setting in which
the answer of each question associated with a triplet in the knowledge base. In contrast, our method
can handle both composition of relations and conjunction of conditions, which are both naturally
enabled by the proposed Gaussian attention model.
Neelakantan et al. (2015a) proposed a method that combines relations to deal with compositional
relations for knowledge base completion. Their key technical contribution is to use recurrent neural
networks (RNNs) to encode a chain of relations. When we restrict ourselves to path queries, question
answering can be seen as a sequence transduction task (Graves, 2012; Sutskever et al., 2014) in
which the input is text and the output is a series of relations. Ifwe use RNNs as a decoder, our model
would be able to handle non-commutative composition of relations, which the current weighted
convolution cannot handle well. Another interesting connection to our work is that they take the
maximum of the inner-product scores (see also Weston et al., 2013; Neelakantan et al., 2015b),
which are computed along multiple paths connecting a pair of entities. Representing a set as a
collection of vectors and taking the maximum over the inner-product scores is a natural way to
represent a set of memory items. The Gaussian attention model we propose in this paper, however,
has the advantage of differentiability and composability.
6	Conclusion
In this paper, we have proposed the Gaussian attention model which can be used in a variety of
contexts where we can assume that the distance between the memory items in the latent space is
compatible with some notion of semantics. We have shown that the proposed Gaussian scoring
function can be used for knowledge base embedding achieving competitive accuracy. We have also
shown that our embedding model can naturally propagate uncertainty when we compose relations
together. Our embedding model also benefits from compositional training proposed by Guu et al.
(2015). Furthermore, we have demonstrated the power of the Gaussian attention model in a chal-
lenging question answering problem which involves both composition of relations and conjunction
of queries. Future work includes experiments on natural question answering datasets and end-to-end
training including the entity extractor.

B TransGaussian embedding of WorldCup20 1 4
We trained our TransGaussian model on triplets and paths from WorldCup2014 dataset and illus-
trated the embeddings in Fig 3 and 4. Recall that we modeled every relation as a Gaussian with
diagonal covariance matrix. Fig 3 shows the learned variance parameters of different relations. Each
row corresponds to the variances of one relation. Columns are permuted to reveal the block struc-
ture. From this figure, we can see that every relation has a small variance in two or more dimensions.
This implies that the coordinates of the embedding space are partitioned into semantically coherent
clusters each of which represent a particular attribute of a player (or a football club). To verify this
further, We picked the two coordinates in which a relation (e.g. plays_position) has the least
variance and projected the embedding of all valid subjects and objects (e.g. players and positions)
of the relation to this 2 dimensional subspace. See Fig. 4. The relation between the subjects and the
objects are simply translation in the projection when the corresponding subspace is two dimensional
(e.g., plays-position relation in Fig. 4 (a)). The same is true for other relations that requires
larger dimension but it is more challenging to visualize in two dimensions. For relations that have
a large number of unique objects, we only plotted for the eight objects with the most subjects for
clarity of illustration.
Furthermore, in order to elucidate whether we are limited by the capacity of the TransGaussian
embedding or the ability to decode question expressed in natural language, we evaluated the test
question-answer pairs using the TransGaussian embedding composed according to the ground-truth
relations and entities. The results were evaluated with the same metrics as in Sec. 4.3. This es-
timation is conducted for TransE embeddings as well. See Table 8 for the results. Compared to
Table 2, the accuracy of TransGaussian (COMP) is higher on the atomic relations and path queries
but lower on conjunctive queries. This is natural because when the query is simple there is not
much room for the question-answering network to improve upon just combining the relations ac-
cording to the ground truth relations, whereas when the query is complex the network could com-
bine the embedding in a more creative way to overcome its limitation. In fact, the two queries
(#10 and #12) that TransGaussian (COMP) did not perform well in Table 2 pertain to a single re-
lation is_in_country-1 (#10) and a composition of two relations plays_for_country-1 /
plays_in_club (#12). The performance of the two queries were low even when the ground truth

C Knowledge base completion
Knowledge base completion has been a common task for testing knowledge base models on their
ability of generalizing to unseen facts. Here, we apply our TransGaussian model to a knowledge
completion task and show that it has competitive performance.
We tested on the subset of WordNet released by Guu et al. (2015). The atomic triplets in this dataset
was originally created by Socher et al. (2013) and Guu et al. (2015) added path queries that were
randomly sampled from the knowledge graph. We build our TransGaussian model by training on
these triplets and paths and tested our model on the same link prediction task as done by Socher
et al. (2013); Guu et al. (2015).
As done by Guu et al. (2015), we trained TransGaussian (SINGLE) with atomic triplets only and
trained TransGaussian (COMP) with the union of atomic triplets and paths. We did not incorporate
