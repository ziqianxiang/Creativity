Figure 1: Fraction of matched nodes for pairs of correlated graphs (with edge density 0.2) as afunction of the noise, see Section A.1 for details.
Figure 2: Fraction of matched nodes for pairs of correlated graphs (with edge density 0.2) as afunction of the noise, see Section A.1 for details.
Figure 3: Each line corresponds to a model trained at a given noise level and shows its accuracyacross all noise levels.
