Figure 2: Visualization of the Gauge Equivariant Mesh Convolution in two configurations, scalar to scalar andscalar to vector. The convolution operates in a gauge, so that vectors are expressed in coefficients in a basis andneighbours have polar coordinates, but can also be seen as a geometric convolution, a gauge-independent mapfrom an input signal on the mesh to a output signal on the mesh. The convolution is equivariant if this geometricconvolution does not depend on the intermediate chosen gauge, so if the diagram commutes.
Figure 3: Test errors for MNIST digit classifica-tion on embedded meshes. Different lines denotetrain geometries, x-axis shows test geometries. Re-gions are standard errors of the means over 6 runs.
