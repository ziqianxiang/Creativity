Figure 1: The visualization of logit responses after “temperature softmax” function. Each row represents twoexamples from CIFAR-10. The sampled images are shown in the 1st and the 4th columns. The 2nd and the5th columns summarize the scaled output from the normal teacher. The 3rd and the 6th columns represent thescaled output from the nasty teacher(a) tSNE of feature embeddings before fully-connected layer. The dimension of feature embeddings is 512.
Figure 2: Visualization of tSNEs for both normal and nasty ResNet18 on CIFAR-10. Each dot represents onedata point.
Figure 3: Ablation study w.r.t ω on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. The initials "T” and "S” in the legendrepresent teacher networks and student networks, respectively. The dash-line represents the accuracy that themodel is normally trained.
Figure 4:	Ablation study w.r.t temperature τs. The architecture of teacher networks are ResNet-18 for bothCIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 experiments. Each figure presents accuracy curves of student networks under theguidance of the nasty or normal ResNet-18 with various temperature τs.
Figure 5:	Ablation study with respect to various α (a) and different percentage of training samples (b). Bothexperiments are conducted under the supervision of either normal or nasty ResNet-18.
Figure 6:	Images generated by inverting a normal ResNet34 and a nasty ResNet34 trained on CIFAR-10 withDeepInversion. For each image, each column represents one category.
