Figure 1: Average Kendall's TaU (±std) (left) and the Jaccard index (±std) (right) calculated fromtrue and estimated influence on ALL, IS, and FID.
Figure 2: Average test ALL (a), IS (b), and FID (c) after the data cleansing. Larger values in (a)and (b), a smaller value in (c) indicate the better generative performance. Error bars and plots of toolarge or small values are omitted for better visibility. See Appendix C.3 for full results.
