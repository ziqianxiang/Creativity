Figure 1: The framework of MARS. During the sampling process: (a) starting from an arbitrary initial moleculex(0) in the molecular space X, (b) sampling a candidate molecule x0 ∈ X from the proposal distributionq(x0 | x(t-1)) at each step, and (c/d) the candidate x0 is either accepted or rejected according to the acceptancerate A(x(t-1), x0) ∈ [0, 1]. By repeating this process, we can generate a sequence of molecules {x(t)}t∞=0.
