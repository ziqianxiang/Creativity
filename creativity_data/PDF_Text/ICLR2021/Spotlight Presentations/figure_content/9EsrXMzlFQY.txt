Figure 1: Visual illustration of serial and parallel image recovery on a multicore system. (a) Serialprocessing uses only one core of the system for every iteration. (b) Synchronous parallel processinghas to wait for the slowest core to finish before starting the next iteration. (c) Asynchronous parallelprocessing can continuously iterate using all the cores without waiting. (d) Asynchronous parallelprocessing using the stochastic gradient leads to additional flexibility. (a), (b), and (c) use all thecorresponding measurements at every iteration, while (d) uses only a small random subset at a time.
Figure 2: Convergence of ASYNC-RED-BG for different numbers of accessible cores n。∈{2,4,6,8}. The left figure plots the average normalized distance to Zer(G) against the iterationnumber; the middle and right figures plot these values, as well as SNR, plotted against the actualruntime in seconds. The shaded areas represent the range of values attained over the test images.
Figure 3: Left: Evolution of the convergence accuracy of ASYNC-RED-SG as the minibatch sizeW increases. The average distance is plotted against the number of iterations with the shaded areasrepresenting the range of values attained over the test images. Middle & Right: Comparison ofconvergence speed between ASYNC-RED-BG/SG and other baselines. The right table summarizesthe total runtime and the speed-up compared with Gm-RED for all algorithms.
