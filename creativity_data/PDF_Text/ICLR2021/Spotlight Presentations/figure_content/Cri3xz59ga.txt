Figure 1: Scores g2(x) [empirical histogram vs. theory in solid lines] for x of Class C1 (red) or ClassC2 (blue) for Task 2 in a 2-task (k = 2) setting of isotropic Gaussian mixtures for: (top) classicalMTL-LSSVM with y ∈ {±1} and threshold ζ = 0; (bottom) proposed optimized MTL-LSSVMwith y? and estimated threshold Z; decision thresholds Z represented in dashed vertical lines; rednumbers are misclassification rates; task relatedness with β = 0 for orthogonal tasks, β > 0 forpositively correlated tasks, β < 0 for negatively correlated tasks; p = 100, [c11, c12, c21, c22] =[0.3, 0.4, 0.1, 0.2], γ = 12, λ = 10. Histograms drawn from 1 000 test samples of each class.
