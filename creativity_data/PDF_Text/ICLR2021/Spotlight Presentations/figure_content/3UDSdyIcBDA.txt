Figure 1: Phase diagram of the outcome of RMSprop on the counter example (1). Different marks representdifferent outcome: we label a data point as convergence if the distance between x and -1 is smaller than 0.01on average after 750000 iterations and as divergence otherwise. For each choice of β2 , there exists a counterexample, but for each counter example in which Adam diverges, there exists a larger β2 that can make Adamconverge. We fix βι = 0. Step size is set as ηt = 表.
Figure 2: Trajectories of RMSprop with large or small β2 on the loss surface. Two trajectories start from thesame initialization and are trained on the same dataset MNIST, but have very different behavior. We calculate thehyper-plane spanned by the starting point of two trajectories and their respective ending points, and then projecttwo trajectories onto this plane. The large-β2 -trajectory converges to minima, while the small-β2-trajectorydiverges. The difference between these two trajectories suggests a phase transition for β2 in (0.8, 0.99).
