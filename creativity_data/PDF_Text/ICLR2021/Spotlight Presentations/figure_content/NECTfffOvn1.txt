Figure 1: Results for Grover search over (a-c) n=6 or (d-f) n=10 qubits. (a) fidelity for tf = 75, and(d) fidelity for tf = 425. (b,e) fidelity at time tf for multiple tf values. (c,f) suggested schedules.
Figure 2:	Fidelity for various tf values for Grover search problems of size n0 larger than the n = 10,for which the network was trained. (a) n0 = 12, (b) n0 = 14, (c) n0 = 16. For n0 = 16, we alsopresent the result obtained by a network trained for solving n = 16.
Figure 3:	Fidelity for various tf values, over random 3SAT instances with m=3n clauses. Keepnote of the different time scale for each problem size, as larger problems require longer times toconverge. (a) n=8 qubits (b) n=11 qubits. For n = 11, we employ the test set of Chen et al. (2020)and directly compare with their MCTS method.
Figure 4: Fidelity for various tf values, for random n = 10 MAX-CUT instances.
Figure 5: Fidelity for various tf values, over random QUBO instances of size n=10. Keep note ofthe different time scale for each problem, as problems with different energy gaps require differenttimes to converge. The energy gaps are (a) g 〜10, (b) g 〜0.1We noticed that the process of creating samples of varying spectral gaps creates a mismatch in scalewith the training set problems. To compensate, we pre-process the inputs to the network models.
Figure 6: Model Results for Grover search over n=8 qubits. (a) fidelity for tf = 150. (b) fidelity formultiple tf . (c) suggested schedules for one specific instance.
Figure 7: Fidelity for various tf values for Grover search problems of size n0 larger than the n = 16for which the network was trained. (a) n0 = 17, (b) n0 = 18, (c) n0 = 19, (d) n0 = 20. Note thedifferent time scale for each problem size.
