Figure 1: Left: A child deforming a piece of plasticine into a thin pie using a rolling pin. Right: Thechallenging RollingPin scene in PlasticineLab. The agent needs to flatten the material by rollingthe pin back and forth, so that the plasticine deforms into the target shape.
Figure 2: Tasks and reference solutions of PlasticineLab. Certain tasks require multi-stage planning.

Figure 4: Rewards and their variances in each task w.r.t. the number of episodes spent on training.
Figure 5: Rewards w.r.t. the number of training episode on 6 environments. Their yield stresses are10, 20, 50, 100, 200, and 1000.
Figure 6: Rewards and variances in each configuration w.r.t. the number of episodes spent ontraining. We clamp the reward to be greater than 0 for a better illustration.
