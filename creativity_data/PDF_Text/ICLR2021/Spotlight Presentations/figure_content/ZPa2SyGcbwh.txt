Figure 1: Illustration of the algorithm using synthetic data. (a) GauSSian blob With clean label (η* (x)).
Figure 2: Illustration of different noise functions. (a) The original data: Gaussian blob with cleanlabels (by clean label, We refer to the prediction of the Bayes optimal classifier η* (x), not y).
