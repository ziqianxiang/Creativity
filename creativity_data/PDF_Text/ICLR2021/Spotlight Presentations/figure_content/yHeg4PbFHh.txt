Figure 1: Domain-specific language (DSL) of expressions considered in this paper.
Figure 2: Diagram outlining the Bustle approach. The bold arrows show the main feedback loop.
Figure 3: (Left) Benchmarks solved as a function of intermediate expressions considered. This metricmakes Bustle look somewhat better than it is, because it ignores slowdowns in wall-clock time, butit is still important to analyze. It is invariant to engineering considerations, providing an upper boundon how well we can do in wall-clock terms through speeding up the model. (Right) Benchmarkssolved over elapsed wall-clock time. Bustle still outperforms all baselines on our 38 new tasks, butnot by quite as much due to time spent on model inference.
Figure 4: Histograms of model predictions for expressions seen while solving benchmarks. (Left)for expressions that were sub-expressions of a solution, the majority received predictions close to 1,showing that the model can identify the correct expressions to prioritize during search. (Right) forexpressions that were not sub-expressions of a solution, predictions skewed close to 0.
