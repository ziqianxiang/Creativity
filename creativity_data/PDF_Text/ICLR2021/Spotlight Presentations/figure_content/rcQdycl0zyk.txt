Figure 1: Illustration of the PHM layer. It uses a sum of Kronecker products of matrices Ai and Si(i = 1, 2) to construct H in (3.2) (here n = 2, k = 6, d = 8). Best viewed in color.
Figure 2: PHM layers can learn to perform rotations in 3D real space and Hamilton products inquaternion space on artificial datasets.
Figure 3: Illustration of reconstructing H in (3.2) by reusing parameter matrices Bi (i = 1, 2)and Tj (j = 1, . . . , 4) in real-valued matrix multiplications, followed by more operations (heren = 2, k = 6, d = 8). Best viewed in color.
