Figure 1: Test accuracy evolution of ResNet-74 on CIFAR-100 under different schedules.
Figure 2: Loss landscape visualization after convergence of ResNet-74 on CIFAR-100 trained withdifferent precision schedules, where wider contours with larger intervals indicate a better local minimaand a lower generalization error as analyzed in (Li et al., 2018).
Figure 3: Static vs. Cyclic Precision Training(CPT), where CPT cyclically schedules the pre-cision of weights and activations during training.
