Figure 1: An example of a power grid with 4 substations, 2 generators, 2 loads, and 5 lines. Startingfrom the left, a bus assignment action at reconfigures the grid and then the next state st+1 isdetermined by exogenous event et+1, such as the change of power demands in loads. The diagonalline was experiencing overflow, but the action at is shown to revert the overflow. The power lossalso reduced from 15 to 13.
Figure 2: Overview of our model. The shared layer encodes xt , the actor layer outputs the desirabletopology gt given the current state st = [Ï„t, xt], and the critic layer outputs the afterstate value giventhe afterstate stgt = [gt, xt].
Figure 3: Training curves on 3 grids. Evaluation rollouts are performed every 1000 steps, and theshaded area represents the standard error.
Figure 4: Comparison of 4 rules.
Figure 5: Deviation from the initial grid. We measure L1 distance between the initial topology andthe current topology during rollout in 2 test scenarios for each grids.
Figure 6: Illustration of a part of IEEE-14 managed by our agent. Large circle refers to a substation,small circle with G or L refers to a generator or load, and dots in green or yellow on a substationrefers 2 busbars. The numbers beside lines are line usage ratio of current to line capacity and thedarker color of the line means large ratio.
