Figure 1: A set of conferrable adversarial examples used asa fingerprint to identify surrogate models.
Figure 2: (a) A summary of the relationship between transferability and conferrability as intersec-tions between the set of all adversarial examples per model type. (b) A representation of transferableand conferrable examples in the decision space, relative to the ground-truth provided by an oracle.
Figure 3: Results for the (a) conferrability scores, (b) non-evasiveness and (c-d) irremovability tomodel modification attacks. Figures (e,f) show results against model extraction attacks.
Figure 4: Fig. (a-d) show the robustness of our fingerprint against (adapted) model extraction attacks.
Figure 5: Fig. (a) shows conferrable examples generated with CEM on CIFAR-10 with = 0.025.
Figure 6: Confusion matrix for our CIFAR-10 fingerprint at = 0.025 with the initial label on thevertical axis and the target label on the horizontal axis. Depicted values are normalized and representpercentages.
Figure 7: A schematic illustration of the source model and the two types of models, the surrogateS and the reference model R, that a fingerprint verification should distinguish. ’Distill’ is anydistillation attack that results in a surrogate model with similar performance as the source model and’Classify’ returns the output of a model on a set of inputs.
