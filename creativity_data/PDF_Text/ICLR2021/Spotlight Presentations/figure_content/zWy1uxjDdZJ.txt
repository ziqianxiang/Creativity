Figure 1: (a) Illustration of the FGP algorithm. We begin in Ao (left). We see that activationconstraints, Ci and C2 are in the e-ball, thus We enqueue Ai and A2 (center). When searching Ai,we see that a decision boundary, CB, is within the -ball. The projection p onto CB is an adversarialexample; We return not_robust (right). (b) Illustration of the cases requiring FGP to return unknownWhen analyzing a boundary constraint, CB , found Within the e-ball about x. The true boundary isshoWn in solid blue; the infinite prolongation of the boundary We are projecting against is shoWn indotted blue. In each case the projection, p, lies outside of A, and is in fact not an adversarial example.
Figure 2: Cactus plots showing the time taken for each instance that is decided as either robust ornot_robust. The instances are ordered by increasing time-per-instance. Results are shown for thePGD adversarially-trained models for both the '2 norm (a) and the 'âˆž norm (b).
