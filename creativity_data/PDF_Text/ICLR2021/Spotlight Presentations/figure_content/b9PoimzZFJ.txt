Figure 1: Coloured MNIST training and test sets for evaluating generalisation under non-semanticmarginal shift and systematic shift, and anomaly detection. (a) Training set; (b) In-distributiongeneralisation set Tg, where the test set is coloured following the same scheme as for Tr ; (c)Systematic-shift generalisation set Ts, where we colour the test set with the biasing colours, but suchthat no digit is coloured with its own biasing colour; (d) Non-systematic-shift generalisation set Tn ,where the test is coloured with random colours that are different from any of the colours seen in thetraining set; and (e) Semantic anomaly detection set Ta, where we colour the held-out digits of thetest set randomly with the biasing colours.
Figure 2: (left) COCO-on-Colours; left block is the majority group, right block is the “unbiased”minority group; (right) COCO-on-Places.
