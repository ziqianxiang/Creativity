Figure 1: Experimental results in a 2D grid world. Fig. 1(a) presents the performance of the SMP andGPI w.r.t the worst case reward. Fig. 1(b) compares Algorithm 1 with two baselines, where we showthe worst case performance, relative to the upper bound, in a logarithmic scale. Fig. 1(c) visualizes theSFs of the policies in the set and Fig. 1(d) presents trajectories that were taken by different policies.
