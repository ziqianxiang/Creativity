Figure 1: MAC grid and diagram of the fluid model.
Figure 2: After training, our models are able to show correct wake flow dynamics for a wide range of different Reynolds numbers. (D = 30, k ~vk = 0.5). Streamlines indicate flow direction, linewidth indicates speed and colors represent the pressure field (blue: low pressure / yellow: high pressure).
Figure 3: Our models feature the Magnus effect and generalize to new fluid domains. Further examples are presented in appendix D and the video.
Figure 4: Long term stability of fluid simulations performed by the ~a-Net。
Figure 5: The frequency of vortex streets can be controlled using our differentiable fluid models.
Figure 6: U-Net architecture with fewer channels.
Figure 7: The left column shows Ω (in white) / ∂Ω (in black) and the right column shows ~vd for three examples of training domains. (Colors indicate the direction and magnitude of ~vd as depicted in Figure 9a).
Figure 8: Our models generalize to various domain geometries, although being trained only on simple shapes(see Figure 7).
Figure 9: a) shows legend for ~vd; b) shows Ω (in white) / ∂Ω (in black) for the benchmark problem; c) shows~vd for the benchmark problem. (Colors indicate the direction of ~vd as depicted in a).
Figure 10: Qualitative comparison of ~a-Net and ~v-Net in a folded pipe domain.
Figure 11: a) ablation study without resetting environments: validation curve shows large error spikes during training; b) error spike: the fluid model takes longer to perform a cold start and converges to a solution with high losses; c) original training with resetting environments: validation curve is stable.
