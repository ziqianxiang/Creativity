Figure 1: (a) A toy example of the supernet. We only search for the width for its one convolutionallayer with all 6 channels, (b) Examples of different weight sharing patterns. For the fixed weightsharing pattern, leftmost c channels are assigned for the sub-network of width c. For the locally freeweight sharing pattern, the offset of free zone is set to r = 1.
Figure 2: (a) Performance with different offset r of free channels for the 0.5 × -FLOPs MobileNetV2and VGGNet on CIFAR-IO dataset, (b) Ablations of min-min optimization with 0.5 ×-FLOPsMobileNetV2 on CIFAR-IO dataset.
