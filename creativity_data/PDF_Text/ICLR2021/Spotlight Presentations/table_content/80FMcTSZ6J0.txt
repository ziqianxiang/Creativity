Table 1: Test accuracy (mean±std in 5 runs) on CIFAR-10. The Open-Set noise is generated byrandomly replacing 40% images of CIFAR-10 with images from CIFAR-100. In Appendix C.1,Table 4 shows that SLN can improve many robust learning methods.
Table 2: Test accuracy (mean±std in 5 runs) on CIFAR-100.
Table 3: Test accuracy (mean±std in 3 runs) on ClothingIM. The star* marks results copied from Pa-trini et al. (2017). The result of DivideMix (Li et al., 2020) is reproduced from its official imple-mentation, which uses class-balanced training sampling.
Table 4: Testing accuracy (mean±std in 5 runs) on CIFAR-10. SLN consistently improves manyrobust learning methods. All methods are fairly compared using the same backbone wide ResNet-28-2 and training hyperparameters (Appendix B).
