Table 1: Left: Inference timings of our model per step on a single GPU, for pure neural networkinference (tmodel) and including remeshing and graph recomputation (tfull). Our model has asignificantly lower running cost compared to the ground truth simulation (tGT). A more detailedbreakdown can be found in the section A.5.1. Right: Errors of our methods for a single predictionstep (1-step), 50-step rollouts, and rollout of the whole trajectory.
Table 2: Training noise parameters and batch size.
