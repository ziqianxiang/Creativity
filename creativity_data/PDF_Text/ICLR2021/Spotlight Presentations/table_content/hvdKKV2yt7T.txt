Table 1: Ownership Tester’s effect size (higher is better) and p-value (lower is better) using m = 10samples on multiple threat models (see § 6.1). The highest and lowest effect sizes among the modelstealing attacks (AD, AM, AQ) are marked in red and blue respectively.
Table 2: Ownership Tester’s effect size in a small-data regime (using only m = 10 samples) on theSVHN dataset using Blind Walk attack. 2nd highest and lowest effect size is marked in red & blue.
Table 3: Ownership Tester’s effect size in a small-data regime (using only m = 10 samples) on theImageNet dataset using Blind Walk attack.
