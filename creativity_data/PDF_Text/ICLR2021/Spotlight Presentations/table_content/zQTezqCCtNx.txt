Table 1: Robustness (%) of ResNet-18 trained by different defense (kWTA, SAP, PCL and our CAS)on CIFAR-10. Avg-PGD-100 denotes 100-step averaged PGD attack (Tramer et al., 2020).
Table 2: Effectiveness of the channel suppressing operation in CAS module on CIFAR-10 withResNet-18. CAS is inserted at Block4 of ResNet-18. Without suppressing means the CAS mod-ule is inserted, however, the channel suppressing operation is not applied during either training ortesting. In this case, CAS is just a simple auxiliary classifier.

Table 4: Robustness of defense ResNet-18 models trained with (+CAS) or without CAS module onCIFAR-10 against different attacks. For +CAS models, we only apply the attack on the CAS moduleusing the CAS loss (Equation 4). For baseline defenses, we attack the final layer of the model.
