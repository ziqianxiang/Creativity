Table 1: Train and test accuracies on clean CIFAR10 for ResNet-50 trained using `2 -adversaries.
Table 2: Fine-grained classes in Restricted Imagenetand 3, 4, 3, 3 sized kernels respectively. This is followed by a fully connected layers with a hiddendimension of 1024. The network is optimized with SGD with a batch size of 128, learning rate of 0.1for 60 epochs and learning rate is decreased to 0.01 after 50epochs.
