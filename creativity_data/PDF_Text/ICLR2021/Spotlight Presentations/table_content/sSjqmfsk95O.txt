Table 1: Quantitative results for large scale image completion. Our method is compared againstDeepFillv2 (Yu et al., 2019) and RFR (Li et al., 2020). Results are averaged over 5 runs.
Table 2: Image-to-image translation results on the edges to photos (Isola et al., 2017) datasets.
Table 3: Image-to-image translation results on the COCO-Stuff dataset (labels to photos).
Table 4: User study results for image completion at different masked ratios among PatchMatch (Barneset al., 2009), DeepFillv2 (retrained) (Yu et al., 2019), and ours.
Table 5: Quantitative comparison for image completion at different masked ratios among DeepFillv2(official), DeepFillv2 (retrained) (Yu et al., 2019), and ours. Results are averaged over 5 runs.
Table 6: Ablation study among Vanilla, conditional modulation (C-Mod), and our co-modulation(Co-Mod), as illustrated in Figs. 2(b) to 2(d), for image completion on the FFHQ dataset. Vanillacompletely fails; our co-modulation dominates the conditional modulated version at all masked ratiosand especially when the masked ratio becomes large. Results are averaged over 5 runs.
