Table 1: Basic statistics of the training splits of the data sets. Number of tokens in the training setmeasured before padding.
Table 2: Success rate of predicting the ground truth in a beam search of width 8 after training a modelon various datasets. Bold numbers indicate results that are within 0.5% of the best result. Grayedout values indicate experiments where the training data did not include the <MASK> token but theevaluation did.
Table 3: Percentage of “provable statements”/“provable new statements”. The type inference tasksare not included as we are only interested in the predictions that do not match the ground truth. Forthe type inference tasks, these statements are either semantically equivalent to existing statements orstatements that do not type check.
