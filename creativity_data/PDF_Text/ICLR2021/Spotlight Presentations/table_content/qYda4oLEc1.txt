Table 1: MTL approaches decomposed into encoders f and decoders g*: (a) Standard MTL takesadvantage of the shared spatialization of tasks within a domain by sharing a single encoder acrossall tasks t; (b) Task embeddings allow tasks within a domain to share their decoder as well; (c)Applying standard MTL across domains requires task-specific encoders, and finding some othermethod of sharing parameters across tasks; (d) TOM allows a single encoder and decoder to be usedeven in the cross-domain setting, by embedding all input and output variables into a shared space.

Table 4: UCI-121 Results. (a) Comparisons to external results of deep STL models tuned to each task(see “Experiments” in Klambauer et al. (2017) for more details); (b) Comparisons across methodsevaluated in this paper. Metrics are aggregated over all 121 tasks (± std. err.). TOM achieves highperformance across seemingly unrelated tasks, outperforming the comparisons across all metrics.
