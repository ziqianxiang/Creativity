Table 1: The MLE estimates for practical image datasets, and the state-of-the-art test-set image classificationaccuracy (for classification problems only) for these datasets.
Table 2: Mean and standard error of estimated intrinsic dimensions for practical datasets under the sameresolution 32 × 32 × 3 using different k’s. These results are consistent with the test accuracies on these datasetsunder the same resolution.
Table 3: Estimated intrinsic dimension of the CIFAR-10 dataset after adding different dimensions (d) ofuniformly sampled noise using different k’s. The estimated dimension consistently increases with d underdifferent k’s.
Table 4: Mean and standard errror of MLE estimates on the FONTS dataset under different number of trans-forms using different k’s. Again, the ranks of the estimated IDs are consistent, and the estimated IDs increasewith the number of transforms.
Table 5: Additional results on the relationship betWeen k and MLE dimensionality estimate for syntheticbasenji images with varying d.
Table 6: Additional ID estimators on popular datasets.
