Table 1: Atari Results: mean scores (and std. dev.) obtained for each agent. For PKey and Transporter(re-imp.) we report the mean for 3 different policies (using the median evaluation run over 10environment seeds). Results for Transporter (orig.) are taken from Kulkarni et al. (2019) and forSimPLE, PPO, and Rainbow from (Kaiser et al., 2020), where a similar experimental set-up is used.
