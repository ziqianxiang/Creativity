Table 1: Classification results (%) on Permuted MNIST, Rotated MNIST and Split SVHN. The meansand standard deviations are computed over five runs using different random seeds, When used, episodic memoriescontain 5 samples per class on average. The symbol ↑ (1) indicates that a higher (lower) number is better.
Table 2: Classification results (%) on Split CIFAR10 and Split CIFAR100 and Split MiniImageNet. Themeans and standard deviations are computed over five runs using different random seeds, When used, episodicmemories contain 5 samples per class on average. The symbol ↑ (1) indicates that a higher (lower) number isbetter.
