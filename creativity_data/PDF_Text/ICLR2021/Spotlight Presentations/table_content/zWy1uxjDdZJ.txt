Table 1: Comparison of FGP and its variant with full exploration of the queueonly having a minor impact on the speed of the execution. Moreover, we reduce the number ofunknown results to the extent that we recover the results obtained by GeoCert in every instance forwhich GeoCert terminates, except 3 non-robust points on mnist40x3, while nevertheless performingour analysis two to three orders of magnitude more quickly.
Table 2: (a) Comparison of `2 local robustness certification (FGP vs. GeoCert vs. MIP) on 100arbitrary test instances, including the median runtime, the certification result — either robust (R),not_robust (NR), unknown (U), or a timeout (TO) — and the corresponding Verified robust accuracy(VRA). The upper bound on the VRA (VRAUB) is also given. Each instance is given a time budgetof 120 seconds. Results are for = 0.25, except on CIFAR10, where we use = 0.1, as was usedby (Croce et al., 2019). (b) Comparison of the lower bound obtained by FGP (Section 2.3) to thatobtained by FastLin.
Table 3: Comparison of '∞ local robustness certification (FGP vs. ERAN vs. GeoCert) on 100arbitrary test instances with a time budget of 120 seconds, including the median runtime and thecertification result: either robust (R), not_robust (NR), unknown (U), or a timeout (TO). Results arefor = 0.01.
