We denote “Clean” as the results generatedby medical diagnosis systems without adding perturbations. These results indicate the upper limitof these systems. In general, the perturbations generated via deviation loss term (DEV) decreasethe recognition performance (i.e., segmentation, detection, and classification results in COVID-19,EAD-2019, and ATPOS-2019, respectively). By integrating loss stabilization term (STA), we areable to generate perturbations that decrease the recognition performance even further. On the otherhand, the percentage of positive cosine distance values of DEV+STA is higher than DEV, whichindicates the perturbations generated via DEV+STA are more consistent with each other duringtheir iterative generation process. The results shown in this table indicate that STA improves theadversarial attack with DEV alone on both performance deterioration and perturbation consistencyon three medical analysis scenarios.
