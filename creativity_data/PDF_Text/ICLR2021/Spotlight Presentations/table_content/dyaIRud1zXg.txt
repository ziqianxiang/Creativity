Table 1: Summary of the tradeoff parameters used for the OIL-Y algorithm and random bench-mark from Dirichlet distributions (averaged over 50 independent replications), and the correspond-ing model utility (as evaluated by the closeness of Alice's authentic and effective systems), as wellas the model privacy leakage (as evaluated by Alice's out-sample accuracy).

The underlying metricused is the empirical R2 , which can be less than zero.
