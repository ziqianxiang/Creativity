Table 1: Test set CRPSsum comparison (lower is better) of models from Salinas et al. (2019a) andour models LSTM-Real-NVP, LSTM-MAF and Transformer-MAF. The two best methods arein bold and the mean and standard errors of our methods are obtained by rerunning them 20 times.
Table 2: Properties of the data sets used in experiments.
Table 3: Test set CRPSsum (lower is better) of classical methods and our Transformer-MAFmodel, where the mean and standard errors of our model are obtained over a mean of 20 runs.
Table 4: Test set CRPS comparison (lower is better) of models from Salinas et al. (2019a) and ourmodels LSTM-Real-NVP, LSTM-MAF and Transformer-MAF. The mean and standard errorsare obtained by re-running each method three times.
Table 5: Test set MSE comparison (lower is better) of models from Salinas et al. (2019a) and ourmodels LSTM-Real-NVP, LSTM-MAF and Transformer-MAF.
