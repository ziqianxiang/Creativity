Table 1: Classification error rate (%) on test set of vanilla ResNet, ResFlow and ImpFlow of ResNet-18 architecture, with varying Lipschitz coefficients c.
Table 2: Average test log-likelihood (in nats) of tabular datasets. Higher is better.
Table 3: Average bits per dimension of ResFlow and ImpFlow on CIFAR10, with varying Lipschitzcoefficients c. Lower is better.
