Figure 2: Characterizing the embedding space(d) Semi-supervised contoursTo illustrate the effect of LpDroto in comparison with LpXroto on the counterfactual generation process,we consider a data instance in X (the feature space of the German data set) and we term its corre-sponding encoding as query âˆˆZ. The class tag associated with query is high risk, hence,the target class for CoUnterfactUal explanation is low risk. Based on equation 1, We evaluatedthe proto associated with the class tag low risk and plotted it for both unsupervised (figure 2c)and semi-supervised (figure 2d) scenarios. It can be observed that proto for the semi-supervisedscenario falls clearly in the low risk cluster as opposed to proto for the unsupervised. Undersuch scenarios, the counterfactual explanations generated will be more interpretable because theuncertainty associated with the class tag of the counterfactual is minimized. Apart from higherinterpretability, reduction of uncertainty leads to more robust counterfactual explanations. Because aclear separation between clusters will result in a faster counterfactual search towards target protowithout meandering towards other classes. In the next section, we experimentally evaluate andcompare unsupervised and semi-supervised approaches to generate counterfactual explanations.
