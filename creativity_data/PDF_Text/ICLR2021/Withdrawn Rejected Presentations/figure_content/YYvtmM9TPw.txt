Figure 1: A generic visual depiction of recent con-trastive instance learning methods.
Figure 3: t-SNE plots from 10 randomly chosen ImageNet classes where each class is representedby 64 images. We use the 1000-dim features from a ResNet50 model trained on ImageNet in super-vised manner. The three sub-figures use the same images but under different augmentations: (a) noaugmentation; (b) weak augmentation; and (c) strong augmentation. Best viewed in color.
Figure 4: Comparison of different algorithmswith varying number of negative samples. Kdenotes the number of negative samples. Weshow that MoCov2 performs the same rang-ing from K = 512 to K = 65536.
Figure 5: Illustration of how we perform dy-namic hard-negative sampling on MoCov2during training time for each mini-batch. Wesort the entire dynamic queue based on sim-ilarity with incoming positive samples. Weuse positive skew-normal distribution to se-lect more of hard and semi-hard samples andless of “easy” positive samples.
