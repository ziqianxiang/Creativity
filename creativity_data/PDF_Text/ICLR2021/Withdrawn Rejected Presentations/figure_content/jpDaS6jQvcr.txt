Figure 1: An illustration of the training phase for the proposed RCA framework.
Figure 2: The first and second rows are results for 10% and 40% anomaly ratio, respectively. Thelast column shows the fraction of points with highest reconstruction loss that are true anomalies.
Figure 3: Experimental results on 18 benchmark datasets from ODDS repository.
Figure 4: Results on CIFAR10 for SVDD, DAGMM, and our method. x-axis are the normal classwhile y-axis is the auc score. SVDD are our implementation on contaminated data described above.
Figure 5: Illustration of the effect of K in theorem 3. The left figure means We have small Lmax andlarge μmmin, which leads large κ. According to our bound, large K is not good in terms of correctnessguarantee. As We shall see in the left figure, in this case, the dangerous zone is very large comparedto the right figure, where we have large Lmax, small μmmin, and a small κ. In the right figure, wecould see that the orange curve will be dropped since the probability of the orange curve is sampledis very small in our method.
Figure 6: The rows are the results for 10%,20%,30% and 40% anomaly ratio from top to bottom,respectively. The last column shows the fraction of points with highest reconstruction loss that aretrue anomalies.
