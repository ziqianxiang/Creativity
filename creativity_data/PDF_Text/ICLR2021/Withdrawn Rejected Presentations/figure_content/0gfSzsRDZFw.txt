Figure 1: Example of how an ablation path (sequence of masks, top) gives rise to a transition betweena current target (image of a house finch) and a baseline (orca whale).
Figure 2: Comparison of saliency methods for an image of a pencil, against one of an orca whale asthe baseline.
Figure 3: Method comparison for a house finch image against a gold finch baseline.
Figure 4: Method comparison for a misclassified image: Inception classifies the apple as a fig in-stead.
Figure 5: Comparison of saliency methods for an image of a pencil, against one of a gold finch asthe baseline.
Figure 6: Comparison of saliency methods for an image of a pencil, against one of a house finch asthe baseline.
Figure 7: Examples of how the ablation path saliency “points” in the bounding box of various imagesof bees. The bounding boxes are human defined in the dataset, the red crosses indicate the locationof least-ablated pixel.
Figure 8: Example view of the monotonisation algorithm in practice. (a) contains decreasing inter-vals, which have been localised in (b). For each interval, the centerline is then extended to meet theoriginal path non-decreasingly (c). In some cases, this will cause intervals overlapping; in this casemerge them to a single interval and re-grow from the corresponding centerline (d). Finally, replacethe path on the intervals with their centerline (e).
Figure 9: Function : [0, 1] → R. Note that |(x)| ≤ 5 × 10-2. The formula is (x)tanh(2ζ(x - 1/2))/2 tanh(ζ) + 1/2 - x, with ζ = 0.8.
Figure 10: Histograms of the scores of ablating an image obtained as explained in §4.2 (the goldfinch from Figure 3, against its blurred baseline) along random paths.
Figure 11: Some extra examples with EfficientNet and one class in the ILSVRC14 dataset. In somecases, the network does not correctly classify the image, which explains the poor score.
