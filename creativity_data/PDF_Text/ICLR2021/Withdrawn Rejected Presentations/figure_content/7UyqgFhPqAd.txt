Figure 1: exemplary networks produced by the connection-sparse estimator (3) and the node-sparseestimator (6)is regulated entirely through the tuning parameter rcon in the objective function (rather than througha tuning parameter in the set over which the objective function is optimized). But '1-regularizationcould also be formulated slightly differently. For example, one could consider the estimatorsΘcon ∈ arg minΘ∈Myi -gθ[χi]∣∣2 +『con Y l∣θj∣∣ι]j=0(4)or〜Θcon∈ arg minΘ∈Myi - gΘ[xi]22 + rcon X ∣∣∣Θj∣∣∣1	.
