Figure 1: The three columns present experimental results for CIFAR-100 (left), ImageNet-32 (mid-dle), ImageNet (right). In each case the three rows present plots of training loss (top), test accuracy(middle) and BX/BS (bottom). The test accuracy plots indicate top-1 test accuracy for CIFAR-100,and top-5 for the other two. We run SignXOR experiments for multiple α values.
Figure 2: Evolution of r, q and p in Algorithm 2 for experiments conducted using the ImageNet32dataset. Values are collected When the master calls the encode function with arguments X = gk andy = gk. The peaks at epochs 10 and 20 are due to the drop in the learning rate at these epochs.
Figure 3: Compression performance of the LZMA algorithm on a random binary sequence.
Figure 4: Assessing the impact of batch size on q in SignXOR. The results from four differentminibatch sizes are presented as indicated in the legends. The first and second rows correspond toexperiments with α = 0 and α = 0.7 respectively.
Figure 5:the x-axisThis figure is same as the first two sub-figures in the third column in Figure 1 except thatruns for a larger number of epochs.
