Figure 1: ‘grad1’(‘grad2’): gradient generated by data-rich (data-poor) classes in CIFAR100-LTor gradient generated by the same classes in vanilla CIFAR-100; ‘grad’: the overall gradient inboth datasets. (a) and (b): Cosine similarity between grad1 and grad, grad2 and grad; (c) and (d):Norm of grad1, grad2, and grad; (a) and (b) indicate the overall gradient is shifted to be closer tothe direction of gradient generated by data-rich class. (c) and (d) show that the variance of overallgradient is enlarged by the fluctuation of gradient on data-poor classes.
Figure 2: The classification results on Places-LT with backbone ResNet-152. The right y-axis is todepict the overall result and the left one is for {Many, Medium, Few}-shots in each figure. (a): Thechange of classification results under different memory bank size. (b): The change of classificationresults under different λ, which balances the classification loss and memory-retentive loss.
Figure 3: The classification results on three datasets with different disentanglement points. The righty-axis is for the overall performance and the left y-axis is for results on {Many, Medium, Few}-shots.
