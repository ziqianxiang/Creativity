Figure 1: F1-score in 20 experiments. This paper chooses four datasets to preform the uncertaintyof ROGA. test.id represents the experiment index and vertical axis represents the F1-score. Thevalue range of the vertical axis of each graph is not the same. Although the amplitude is similar, itdoes not mean that the range of change is the same.
