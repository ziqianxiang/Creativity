Figure 2:	Car kinematics: Transfer from surrogate to a nominal model. Top: Lyapunov functioncontours at φ = 0 with trajectories for 40 steps. Bottom: Lyapunov function evaluated for specificpolicy on several initial states (decreasing means more stable).
Figure 3:	Car kinematics: Alternate learning on surrogate model. After every NV = 800 epochsof Lyapunov learning, the learned Lyapunov function is used to tune the MPC parameters. Top:The training curves for Lyapunov function. Vertical lines separate iterations. Middle: The resultingLyapunov function V at φ= 0 with the best performance. Bottom: Line-search for the MPCparameter α to minimize the Lyapunov loss (10) with V as terminal cost. The loss is plotted on they-axis in alog(1 +x)scale. The point marked in red is the parameter which minimizes the loss.
