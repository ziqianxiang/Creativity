Figure 1: Images from our three new datasets ImageNet-Renditions (ImageNet-R), DeepFashionRemixed (DFR), and StreetView StoreFronts (SVSF). The SVSF images are recreated from thepublic Google StreetView, copyright Google 2020. Our datasets test robustness to various naturallyoccurring distribution shifts including rendition style, camera viewpoint, and geography.
Figure 2: ImageNet-Renditions (ImageNet-R) contains 30,000 images of ImageNet objects withdifferent textures and styles. This figure shows only a portion of ImageNet-R’s numerous renditionstyles. The rendition styles (e.g., “Toy”) are for clarity and are not ImageNet-R’s classes; ImageNet-R’s classes are a subset of 200 ImageNet classes. ImageNet-R emphasizes shape over texture.
Figure 3: DeepAugment examples preserve semantics, are data-dependent, and are far more visuallydiverse than augmentations such as rotations.
Figure 4: The left figure shows accuracy as a function of corruption severity. In the right figure, weshow ImageNet accuracy and ImageNet-C accuracy. Previous architectural advances slowly translateto ImageNet-C performance improvements, but the DeepAugment+AugMix robustness interventionon a ResNet-50 approximately yields a 19% accuracy improvement.

Figure 6: Larger models improve ro-bustness on ImageNet-R. The baselinemodels are ReSNet-50, DPN-68, andReSNeXt-50 (32 X 4d). The largermodels are ReSNet-152, DPN-98, andReSNeXt-101 (32 × 8d). The baselineResNeXt has a7.1% ImageNet error rate,while the large has a 6.2% error rate.
Figure 7: Parallel augmentation with Noise2Net. We collapse batches to the channel dimension toensure that different transformations are applied to each image in the batch. Feeding images into thenetwork in the standard way would result in the same augmentation being applied to each image,which is undesirable. The function fΘ(x) is a Res2Net block with all convolutions replaced withgrouped convolutions.
