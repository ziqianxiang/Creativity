Figure 1: Illustration of the conditional independence test with double GANs.
Figure 2: Top panels: the empirical type-I error rate of various tests under H0 . From left to right:normal Z with α = 0.1, normal Z with α = 0.05, Laplacian Z with α = 0.1, and Laplacian Zwith α = 0.05. Bottom panels: the empirical power of various tests under H1 . From left to right:dZ = 100,α=0.1,dZ = 100, α = 0.05, dZ = 200, α = 0.1, and dZ = 200, α = 0.05.
Figure 3: Conditional Histograms. GANs are trained using data generated from the simulation study(see Section 5.1).
Figure 4: The line plots and histograms of real samples and GCIT WGAN samples (scaled between0 and 1). The top two panels are the results under Bellot & van der Schaar (2019)’s setup with threedifferent simulations and the bottom top panels, are the results under our setup with three differentsimulations.
