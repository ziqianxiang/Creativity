Figure 1:	Average normalized regret for single-task sequential HPO methods, a Gaussian process,with different initialization strategies.
Figure 2:	Average normalized regret for state-of-the-art transfer learning HPO methods.
Figure 3: Top 10 hyper-parameters suggested by our approach for test datasets from the threedifferent meta-datasets. We reduce the dimensionality of each search space into a 2D representationvia TSNE (Liu et al. (2016)). The first row represents the actual response surface. We notice thatthe true response and the predicted response are similar, and the location of the predicted minima, ingreen, overlaps with the minima of the actual response.

Figure 5: : Average normalized regret for GROSI, our zero-shot approach, and the refitted responsemodels GROSI(+1) and GROSI(+10). We shade in light blue the improvement over zero-shotperformance.
