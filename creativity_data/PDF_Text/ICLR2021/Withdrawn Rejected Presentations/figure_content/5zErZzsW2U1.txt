Figure 1: (a) Input images; (b) ResNet-50 originally focuses on some background (black rectan-gles) and misses part of the targets (red rectangles); (c) by utilizing the attention maps Ms inferredfrom the CDCs, which indicate category-relevant/irrelevant regions to be encouraged/suppressed;(d) ResNet-50 could be guided to correctly identify the objects of interest in both images. Note: wevisualize the focuses of networks following (Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2017).
Figure 2: The CDC Extraction Network: given an image-category pair (x, y) as input, the conditionalauto-encoder (E1 and E2 are encoders, G1 and G2 are decoders) outputs a reconstructed image x0 ;D is the discriminator for category disentangling and T is the CDC. Note that only the networkswithin the green box are executed for generating T in the evaluation stage.
Figure 3: Demonstration of applying the CDC-based framework to the feature maps F : L1 is thenetwork to infer spatial attention map M from the pooled CDCs [Tsavg ; Tsmax], L2 and L3 areembedding networks to project [Tsavg ; Tsmax] and F into the same feature space for calculatingchannel compatibility; R is the residual unit for adjusting the feature maps after applying attention.
