Figure 1: Overview of the bargaining game. Two agents learn to bargain over how to satisfy the demand ofmarket. The reward of each agent is the value of remaining items. If the demand of market is not satisfied, thedifference will be collected from both agents evenly in a mandatory way.

Figure 3b and 3c show the learningcurves of all agents in terms of reward in the second training phase. Figure 3b presents the gamesbetween liar and truth teller, and Figure 3c presents the games between liars. From Figure 3b, 4 liarsperform better in the game than truth tellers and reach above 0.75, while truth tellers only get around0.45 that is lower than the equally dividing strategy. It shows lying behaviors indeed help liars totake a dominant position over truth tellers. The performance of liars showed in Figure 3c is betweenthe win-win strategy and equally dividing strategy. It turns out there exits a liar that outperformsall other liars when it comes to liar vs. liar games. Figure 4 visualizes two examples of bargainingusing learned policies between truth tellers and between truth teller and liar.
