Figure 1: An overview of our approach. We propose to augment the ImageNet dataset by a versionof the dataset with Anisotropic diffused images. The use of this augmentation helps the networkrely less on texture information and increases performance in diverse experiments.
Figure 2: Examples of images from Sketch-ImageNet. Images have very little or no texture, whichimplies texture will have little to no impact on object classification.
Figure 3: Four different methods for reducing texture in images.
Figure 4: Saliency maps using GradCam. The text on the left of the row indicates whetherAnisotropic model or ImageNet model was used. The figure shows the saliency maps whereAnisotropic model gave correct predictions and ImageNet model gave wrong predictions. The fail-ure of ImageNet model might be due to it not attending to whole object.
