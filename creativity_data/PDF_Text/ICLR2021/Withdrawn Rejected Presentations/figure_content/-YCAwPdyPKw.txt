Figure 2:	The generation of an observed trajectory: a three-body example with unknown mass. Cir-cles are the learnable force function, rectangles are fixed functions, rounded rectangles are randomvariables and others are deterministic variables.
Figure 3:	A grammar of expressions of Newtonian physical lawsSpecifically, we choose the Euler integrator since its update rules correspond to the basic relationsbetween position, velocity and acceleration. With these specifications, equation 1 becomesait	= fti/mi,	vti+1	=	vit	+ at∆t,	pit+1	= pit	+	vti+1∆t,	(2)where mi is the mass of the recipient of the force fti and ∆t is the step size of the Euler integrator.
