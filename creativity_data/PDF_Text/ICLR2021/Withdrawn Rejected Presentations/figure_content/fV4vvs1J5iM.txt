Figure 2: Left: Visualization of the distance minimization problem (7) in R2, where the numberof steps and the number of steps in risky zone are measured. The green hatched region is thepolytope formed by values achievable by mixed deterministic policies c(∆(Π)), and the red hatchedregion is the target set. Middle: Using an optimal RL oracle, 10 paths are sampled to showcase theconvergence property of C2RL and ApproPO, where each cross on the dashed line corresponds to acall to the oracle. Right: If we zoom in, ApproPO suffers from the zig-zagging problem.
Figure 3: Left: Time complexity measured by number of calling an optimal RL oracle. Middle,Right: Using A2C to approximate an RL oracle, time complexity measured by thousands of samplesand memory complexity measured by the number of policies stored are compared.
