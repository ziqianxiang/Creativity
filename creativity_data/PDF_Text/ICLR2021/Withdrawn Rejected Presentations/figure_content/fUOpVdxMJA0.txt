Figure 2: Neuroware illustration: Weights and biases of the output layer of an MNIST digit classifi-cation network. Positive and negative values are blue and red respectively with saturation and sizeindicating magnitude.
Figure 3: Stimuli: "eat," "homework," and proximal concepts in stimulus space. The associationhorizons of the first two are denoted by dotted lines.
Figure 4: Example classification network with internal stimuli labeled.
Figure 5: Sentiment maps for (a) guilt, (b) fear, and (c) anger. Positive, neutral, and negativevalence are indicated by blue, black, and red outlines, respectively. Positive and negative degree ofperception are indicated by solid and dashed outlines, respectively.

Figure 8: The neuroware of several agents: weights and biases of the classification, judgement, anddecision network layers for example cases which resemble (a) direct correlation, (b) schizophrenia,(c) depression, (d) psychopathy, and (e) OCD. Weights are shown as matrices and biases are shownas the last column of each matrix. Positive and negative values are blue and red respectively withsaturation and size indicating magnitude.
