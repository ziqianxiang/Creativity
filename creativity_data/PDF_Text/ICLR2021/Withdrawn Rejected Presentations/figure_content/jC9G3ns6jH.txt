Figure 1: Examples of the proposed method on brain tumor image classification. Given a CNNtrained to classify tumor versus non-tumor brain images in advance, our method provides the statis-tical significance of the attention region for each test image in the form of p-values by comparingthe pixel information in the attention and non-attention regions. Since the attention region is se-lected by the input image, the p-value obtained by the naive comparison of the two regions (naivep-value) is highly biased. In the left-hand side figure where there is no brain tumor, the naive p-valueis nearly zero (indicating false positiveâ€”incorrectly identifying tumor region), while the proposedselective p-value is large (indicating true negative). On the other hand, in the right-hand side figurewhere there actually exist a brain tumor, both the naive p-value and the selective p-values are verysmall (indicating true positive). The proposed selective inference method can provide valid exact(non-asymptotic) p-values for DNN representations such as attentions.
Figure 2: A schematic illustration of the proposed method. By applying DNN on the observedimage xobs, we obtain an representation. Then, we parametrize xobs with a scalar parameter z inthe dimension of test-statistic to identify the subspace X whose data has the same representationas xobs has. Finally, the valid statistical inference is conducted conditional on X . We introduce ahomotopy method for efficiently characterizing the conditional data space X .
