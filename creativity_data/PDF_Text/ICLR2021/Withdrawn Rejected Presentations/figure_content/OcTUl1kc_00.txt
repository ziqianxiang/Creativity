Figure 1: Accuracy on Cora (a), and on D&D (b), of GCNwithout and with the injection of structural information, andfor different restart probabilities of RWR.
Figure 2: Performance of GCN-RWRReg on node classification when trained using Top-K sparsifi-cation of the RWR matrix.
Figure 3: Average distribution of the RWR weights at differentdistances for the node classification datasets. Distance zero indi-cates the weight that a node assigns to itself.
