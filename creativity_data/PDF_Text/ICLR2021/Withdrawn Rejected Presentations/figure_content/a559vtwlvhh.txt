Figure 5: Win rates across different values of αBeyond reinforcing ideas from the abstract game, the success of α = 1.0 demonstrates that thisparameter setting benefits from the intuition that a nonuniform exploration term helps AlphaZerofind new states that will locally help the algorithm win a game, and at the same time increase trainingspeed with proper exploration. An implementation of AlphaZero with the configuration used toproduce these results is available online. ([Link removed for anonymization.])These networks were not all trained to full convergence due to limits in computational resources.
