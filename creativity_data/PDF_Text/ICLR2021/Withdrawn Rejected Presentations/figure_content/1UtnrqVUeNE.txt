Figure 3: Identifying OOD and Adversarial Samples Based on Mean and Variance of Confi-dence Scores. Each dot represents one sample in the testing set in the UCI Annealing task. Thehorizontal axis denotes the variance of RED-calibrated confidence score, and the vertical axis de-notes the mean. If an in-distribution sample is correctly classified by original NN classifier, it ismarked as ”correct”, otherwise it is marked ”incorrect”. Mean is a good separator of correct andincorrect classifications. High variance, on the other hand, indicates that RED is uncertain about itsconfidence score, which can be used to identify OOD and adversarial samples. In this manner, REDcan serve as a foundation for improving robustness of classifiers more broadly in the future.
