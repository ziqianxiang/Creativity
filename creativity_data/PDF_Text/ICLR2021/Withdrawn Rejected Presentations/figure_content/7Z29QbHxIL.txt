Figure 2: FTSO’s found architectures. (a) and (b): Normal and reduction cells found on CIFAR10after one epoch’s search; (c) and (d): Normal and reduction cells found on the entire ImageNet afterone epoch’s search; (e) and (f): Normal and reduction cells found on CIFAR10, where we adopt theoperator search, and use the 3 × 3 separable convolution to search for the topology; (g): FTSO’scell found on NATS-Bench; (h): DARTS’s cell found on NATS-Bench.

However,in general, they still obey a positive correlation, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.77, asshown in Figure 3(j). In terms of the generalization ability from CIFAR10 to ImageNet, Figure 3(l)reveals that the architectures performing well after long-term evaluation on CIFAR10 can usually
