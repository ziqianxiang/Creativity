Figure 1: Reusing components (dotted lines) of the feature engineering process as auxiliary targets(in blue). The MONAH framework (Anonymous, 2021) is introduced in section 4.2Given that we are extracting actions and prosody families as inputs, we propose to explore whetherthey can be reused as supervisors (see Fig. 1). Our hypothesis H1 is that re-using them as auxiliarysupervision improves primary MTL. This is related to using hints in the existing MTL literature,where the auxiliary tasks promote the learning of the feature (Cheng et al., 2015; Yu & Jiang, 2016).
Figure 2: Forward pass of the Flat-MTL HAN architecture. Auxiliary tasks (yellow) are added atthe same level of the primary task (orange).
Figure 3: Forward pass of the HAN-ROCK architecture. There is a primary branch (orange) whereauxiliary supervision (yellow) can not influence. The fusion module (blue) aggregates the talkturnembeddings from all tasks into one.
