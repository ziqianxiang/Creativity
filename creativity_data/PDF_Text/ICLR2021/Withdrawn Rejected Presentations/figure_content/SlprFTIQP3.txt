Figure 1: (a) We show normalized recall weights over iterations for recall loss. The horizontal axisis arranged in descending order in terms of pixel percentage. % indicates class pixel percentage. Therecall weights change dynamically according to the performance metric recall. (b) We design a Sim-ple Decoupled Network (SDN) to decouple representation and classifier learning. (c) In inference,only one branch is used in SDN.
Figure 2: (a) Mean IOU per class on Synthia dataset with Resnet18. (b) Mean Accuracy per classon Synthia dataset with Resnet18. (c) Normalized 1 - Rc,t weights over time for recall loss. Theweight for the bike class decreased over time indicating improved performance.
Figure 3: Visualization of Segmentation results on Synthia with Resenet18. Recall loss encouragesmodels to predict more small classes such as poles and pedestrians. Compared to the cross-entropytrained model, the recall loss trained model is able to output finer details especially for small classes.
