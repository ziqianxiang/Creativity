Figure 1: Yellow vertices are the start vertices, green vertices are the end vertices and black blocksare obstacles where paths can not pass through. (a) Examples of maps without obstacle.(b) Examplesof maps with obstacles. (c) Circuit routing results derived by our algorithm. (d) and (e) show thatsequential A* algorithm will greedily find a shortest path of one pair, and it fails to obtain a globalsolution. (f) shows the solution found by our algorithm, which is actually globally optimal.
Figure 2: (a) The curve of success rates and sample numbers. Our learned ranking order achievesbetter performance than randomly sampled orders. (b) Trained cost map of the example from Fig-ure 1(f). There are two larger cost values (the yellow grids) in the cost map, which will give out alarge cost if the path chooses to go through here. As a result, the first pair ((S1 , E1)) will not takeits shortest path which will block the second pair((S2, E2)). It shows that cost maps can capture theglobal information and guide routers to approach global optimal. (c) An example of routing resultsof our algorithm on maps with size of 150 Ã— 150 and with 15 pairs, which implies that our methodcould be adapted to larger scales of applications.
