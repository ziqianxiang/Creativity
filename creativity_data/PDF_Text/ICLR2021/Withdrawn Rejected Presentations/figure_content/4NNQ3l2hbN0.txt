Figure 1: In the first row are the queries and in the second row are the documents. Each querycorresponds uniquely to one document. On the left, the task is easy, but on the right, it is not.
Figure 2: The average Hamming distance of the 25 models of each 6 HMBS models w.r.t. thepositive (matching) pairs and negative (non-matching) pairs. Using the fixed 10K documents and 1Kqueries, creating 1K positive pairs and 9999K negative pairs for which we computed the Hammingdistance.
Figure 3: The average SSWR Curves W.r.t Halt number for Fbeta, Shared-Fbeta and SHared-MIHash. The colored area is Â±0.01xSTD of the respective curve. The range of the y axis is changingthroughout each graphs, this could be misleading when comparing the STD. As a reference, the av-erage STD is 0.1259, 0.0374 and 0.0864 for Fbeta, Shared-Fbeta and Shared-MIHash respectively.
