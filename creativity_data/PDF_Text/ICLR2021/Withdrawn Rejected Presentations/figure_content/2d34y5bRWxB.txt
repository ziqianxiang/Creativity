Figure 1: Critical difference diagram generated with the Wilcoxon-Holm post-hoc analysis on40 datasets. The diagram shows the ranks and the statistical significance of the results for everyindividual regularization technique and our regularization cocktails.
Figure 2: Rank distribution for the individual regularization methods and the regularizationcocktail. The rank distribution for each method is calculated on the test set over all datasets.
Figure 3: Left: Individual and pairwise cocktail ingredients occurring in at least 30% of the datasets.
Figure 4: Comparison of our proposed dataset-specific cocktail against the cocktail of the top-5most frequent regularizers (top row), and the cocktail of the top-5 regularizers with the highestperformance ranks (bottom row). Each point represents a dataset and the gain is defined as the testaccuracy of our method divided by the test accuracy of each baseline. We illustrate the gain withthree ablations: the number of samples (left), number of features (middle) and test accuracy (right).
Figure 5: Left: Cocktail gain over the GBDT algorithm calculated on the test set for every dataset(The gain is calculated by dividing the cocktail accuracy with the GBDT accuracy). Right: Thedistribution of the cocktail gain.
Figure 6: Pairwise statistical significance and comparison. For every entry, the first row show-cases the wins, draws and losses of the horizontal method with the vertical method on all datasets,calculated on the test set; the second row presents the p-value for the statistical significance test.
Figure 7: Frequency of the regularization techniques. The occurrences of the individual reg-ularization techniques in the best hyperparameter configurations found by the cocktail across 42datasets.
