Figure 1: Latent representations of 100 GMM samples (mode 5 and dimension 10) with dim-z = 2.
Figure 2: Network architecture of SWAEs. To generate new data latent samples are first drawn fromthe marginal prior p(zd) based on the conditional priors p(zd|uk), and then fed to the decoder.
Figure 3: Projection of the latent representation to 2D via t-SNE on MNIST. dim-z = 80 for allmethods.
Figure 4: Denoising effect: reconstructed images on Fashion-MNIST. dim-z = 80 for all methods.
Figure 5: Latent representation on MNIST; dim-z = 2 for all methods. With more compressedlatent representation, the classification accuracy generally decreases except VAE (5-NN accuracywith dim-z = 2: SWAE(β = 1)(0.75), SWAE(β = 0.5)(0.86), VAE(0.84), WAE-GAN(0.81), WAE-MMD(0.81), VampPrior(0.82), and MIM(0.87)). Also, the quality of reconstruction and generationdecreases when dim-z = 2.

Figure 9:	Generated new samples on CIFAR10-sub. dim-z = 512 for all methods.
Figure 10:	Generated new samples on Celeba. dim-z = 512 for all methods. VampPrior has the bestgeneration quality visually. SWAE (β* = 0.5) is better than SWAE (β = 1) and SWAE (β = 0).
Figure 11:	Reconstructed images on MNIST. dim-z = 80 for all methods. As expected, for SWAEsa smaller β leads to a higher quality of reconstruction.
Figure 12:	Reconstructed images on Fashion-MNIST. dim-z = 80 for all methods.
Figure 13:	Reconstructed images on Coil20. dim-z = 80 for all methods. For SWAEs, the differenceof the reconstruction error for different values ofβ is insignificant, and the reconstructed images lookvisually the same.
Figure 14:	Reconstructed images on CIFAR10-sub. dim-z = 512 for all methods. Excluding thereconstruction loss in the objective, the reconstruction of SWAE (β = 1) is blurry.
Figure 15:	Reconstructed images on Celeba. dim-z = 512 for all methods. The average reconstruc-tion error over three seeds is as follows: SWAE (β = 1) : 301.11 ±4.85, SWAE (β = 0.5): 37.78±6.71, SWAE (β = 0): 30.14 ±0.18, VAE: 38.64±5.39, WAE-GAN: 23.63±5.79, WAE-MMD:28.64±2.85, VampPrior: 37.96±0.71, and MIM: 36.40±2.84. As expected, for SWAE a smallervalue of β leads to a lower reconstruction loss.
Figure 16:	Denoising effect: reconstructed images on MNIST. dim-z = 80 for all methods. SWAE(β = 1), WAE-GAN, and WAE-MMD can recover clean images. However, for WAE-GAN andWAE-MMD, we can still see some noisy dots around the digits.
Figure 17:	Denoising effect: reconstructed images on Coil20. dim-z = 80 for all methods. ExceptWAE-GAN and WAE-MMD, the other methods can produce clear images.
