Figure 1: Guided backpropagation of ResNets trained on different subsets of ImageNet. First rowis original image. Middle row is the gradient of a ResNet trained on all ImageNet classes. Last row,the first two columns are from a ResNet trained on 800 random ImageNet classes and the last twocolumns from one ResNet not trained on any canine classes and one not trained on any bird classes.
Figure 2: Validation accuracy when training a model using our class homogeneity task. Accuracyis reported for both classes seen during training (1-800) and classes kept for validation (801-900).
Figure 3: t-SNE plots all test samples in each ImageNet class 901-910. Images were encoded bya ResNet-18 trained with our class homogeneity task before being plotted by t-SNE. On the left,samples are colored using the target labels and on the right using our modelâ€™s clustering prediction.
