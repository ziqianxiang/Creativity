Figure 1: Example IXPE track images at 2.7, 4.5 and 6.4 keV energies (columns). The blue lines show theinitial photoelectron direction; the angle of these lines is y. Color represents the amount of charge deposited ina hexagonal pixel. Track morphology (and thus angle reconstruction) depends strongly on energy.
Figure 2: Left: FoM as a function of hyperparameter λ for the Von Mises ensemble on the PL2 dataset. Thismethod is used to select all of the λ. Right: Histogram of y predictions for the 6.4KeV polarized dataset,Π = 1, φ = π∕2 (ground truth). Black shows the ground truth density, (4), to be estimated. Red and blue showthe single NN and standard moments estimates respectively. A single NN can better predict y and thus extractmore polarization signal, Π100% resulting in a better FoM.
