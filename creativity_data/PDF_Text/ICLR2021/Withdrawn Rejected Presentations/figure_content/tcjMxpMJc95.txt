Figure 1: Grip maps of accuracies according to the change of α and τ on CIFAR-100 when(teacher, student) = (WRN-28-4, WRN-16-2). It presents the grid maps of (a) training top1 ac-curacies and (b) test top1 accuracies. LKD with τ = ∞ is implemented with the hand-craftedgradient (Eq. (3)). Detailed values are in subsection B.3.
Figure 2: Pdf of TLD. All students are trained with α = 1.0 and all teachers do with LCE. WRN-16-2 student models share other training recipes such as learning rate, batch size, and weight decay.
Figure 3: Comparison of pdf of TLD between WRN-16-2 models trained with LCE and with MSE(teacher: WRN-28-4). (a) and (b) has 4 different pdfs of TLD whose data belongs to differentquantiles of teacher’s pdf of TLD.
Figure 4:	Grip maps of accuracies according to the change of α and τ on CIFAR-100 when (a)(teacher, student) = (WRN-16-4, WRN-16-2), (b) (teacher, student) = (WRN-16-6, WRN-16-2), (c)(teacher, student) = (WRN-28-2, WRN-16-2), and (d) (teacher, student) = (WRN-40-2, WRN-16-2). The left grid maps presents training top1 accuracies, and the right grid maps presents test top1accuracies.
Figure 5:	Pdf of TLD. All students are trained with τ =20, and all teachers are trained with CE. Bothmodels share other training recipes such as learning rate, batch size, and weight decay.
