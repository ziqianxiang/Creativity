Figure 1: Number of sentences per language. The number of sentences for a language pair (L1 , L2)is equal to min(|L1 |, |L2|) where |Li| represents the number of sentences of the language LiThe Bible is one of the rare publicly available online corpora for low-resource languages such as thosespoken in Africa. Its structure (made of books, chapters and verse numbers) allows to automaticallyand unambiguously identify parallel paragraphs (verses) across all languages. However, it suffersfrom several flaws for machine translation:1.	In general, YouVersion only provides the New Testament for African languages, consistingof about 7958 verses only. In the case of languages for which both New and Old Testamentare available, one can retrieve around 31170 verses.

(2020) are time-consuming and require a lot of background knowledge onspecific population migration throughout history. Such in-depth knowledge might not be available forall languages. Besides, they donâ€™t provide a quantitative measure for languages similarity, makingit difficult for one to assess if a language Li is closer to a language Lj than to a language Lk .
