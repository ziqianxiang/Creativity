Figure 1: During the training phase, inner ensemble weights are used to achieve better performance.
Figure 2: The variance gain of IEN, maxout and dropout versus the number of ensembles in a singlelinear layer model. Please note that maxout upper variance gain has a different scale.
Figure 3: The effect of changing m versus model mean accuracy. IEN, maxout and base modelaccuracies are shown. CIFAR-10 results are the thin line shapes, while CIFAR-100 results are thethick line shapes. Colors represents different architectures. Dashed line is the base model meanaccuracy.
Figure 4: Cells discovered using NAS DARTS-V1 and GDAS search algorithms. 1 × 1 and 3 × 3 arethe CNN kernel sizes. IEN and maxout have m = 4. The cells are acyclic graphs. The dashed arrowsare skip connections. Colors represent different approaches.
