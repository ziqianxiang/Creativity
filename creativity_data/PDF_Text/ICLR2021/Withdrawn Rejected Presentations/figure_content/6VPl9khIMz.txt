Figure 1: Block description of SGF. A/L means We can plug either the augmented normalizedadjacency matrix or the symmetric normalized Laplacian into this model. In each filter layer, thescalar a` controls the filter,s tangent and the scalar β' controls the filter,s vertical translation.
Figure 2: Learned filteringfunctions f (λ) on threedatasets corresponding tothree frequency ranges.
Figure 3: Vertex classification accuracy for each amount of edge perturbation. Since GCNII hassimilar performance as our model in this setting, we only plot the results for SGF.
Figure 4: Dynamic of a's and β's with fixed initialization at 0.5.
Figure 5: Block diagram example of order-4 stacked filters. Both of these models can learn order-4polynomial as the filtering function.
Figure 6: Box plot of estimated Rayleigh quotient (frequency) by training ratio. For each trainingratio, we randomly sample 10 training sets and compute Rayleigh quotients using equation (9).
Figure 7: Box plot of estimated Rayleigh quotient (frequency) by training ratio. For each trainingratio, we randomly sample 10 training sets and compute Rayleigh quotients using equation (1).
Figure 8: Dynamic of α's and β's with random initialization (seed 0).
