Figure 1: Two examples of the simulated data with five active sources in presence of full-structurenoise (upper panel) as well as heteroscedastic noise (lower panel) at 0 (dB) SNR. Topographic mapsdepict the locations of the ground-truth active brain sources along with the source reconstructionresults of three noise learning schemes. For each algorithm, the estimated noise covariance matrix isalso plotted above the topographic maps. The source reconstruction performance of these examplesin terms of EMD and time course correlation (Corr) is summarized in the associated table next toeach panel. We also report the accuracy with which the ground-truth noise covariance was estimatedin terms of the Λsim and NMSE. The convergence behaviour of all three noise estimation approachesis also shown.
Figure 2: Source reconstruction performance (mean ± SEM) of the three different noise learningschemes for data generated by a realistic lead field matrix. Generated sensor signals were super-imposed by either full-structure or heteroscedastic noise covering a wide range of SNRs. Perfor-mance was measured in terms of the earth mover’s distance (EMD), time-course correlation error,F1-measure and Euclidean distance (EUCL) in (mm) between each simulated source and the recon-structed source with highest maximum absolute correlation.
Figure 3: Auditory evoked field (AEF) localization results versus number of trials from one rep-resentative subject using FUN learning algorithm. All reconstructions show focal sources at theexpected locations in the left (L: top panel) and right (R: bottom panel) auditory cortex. As a result,the limited number of trials does not influence the reconstruction results of FUN learning algorithm.
