Figure 2: Examples of generated spatial function values and graph signals. Node and edge features(function value and relative displacement, respectively) are used to approximate spatial derivatives(arrows). We can adjust the number of nodes (spatial resolution), the number of edges (discretiza-tion), and the degree of fluctuation (scale of derivatives) to differentiate meta-train tasks.

Figure 4: Sensor locations in the AQI-CO dataset. We show sensors as blue nodes and edges ofk-NN graphs as red lines. Borders of provinces are shown in grey.
