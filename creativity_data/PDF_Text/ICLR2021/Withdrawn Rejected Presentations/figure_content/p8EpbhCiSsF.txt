Figure 1: Discriminator with Local Gradient Amplifier (LGA) for the implementation of spatiallydecomposed hinge adversarial lossmisclassified samples proportional to the distance from the class boundary. This hinge adversarialloss not only makes discriminator more focused on misclassified samples, but also makes the losseasier to control than conventional adversarial loss by setting the decision boundary to 0.
Figure 2: FID scores on various data sets. All trainings are conducted with WGAN-GP and RM-SProp. The resolutions of generated images are 32 × 32 for CIFAR10 and STL10 and 64 × 64 forCelebA and LSUN bedroom.
Figure 3: Intermediate results of Training with STL10 and CFIAR10. When training highly complexdataset without LGA, Generator often produces patterns which look like mode collapse.
Figure 4: Intermediate results of Training with LSUN bedroom and CelebA. When generating 64 ×64 images, LGA shows much faster convergence than previous methods.
Figure 5: Generated images with WGAN-GP based network on CIFAR-10. Without LGA, Genera-tor produces image with poor representation.
Figure 6: Generated images with SNGAN based network on STL-10. We can see original SNGANoccurs mode collapse when training with long iterations.
Figure 7: Generated images with WGAN-GP based network on CIFAR-10. For CIFAR-10, we trainour networks with 1000 epochs.
