Figure 1: An example of an equivariant map from RGB images to gray-scale images. An RGBimage x is represented by values (i.e., a function) on 2-dimensional spatial coordinates with RGBchannels. This corresponds to the case where the index set is S = R2×3 = R6 . Similarly, agray-scale image F [x] after equivariant processing F : RS → RT is represented by values on 2-dimensional spatial coordinates with a single gray-scale channel. This corresponds to the case wherethe index set is T = R2 . In this figure, the group action is translation of G = R2 to 2-dimensionalspatial coordinates.
