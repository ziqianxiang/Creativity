Figure 1: Reduction in infection rates relative to apolicy that does not isolate infections (no-actionpolicy) as the daily testing budget varies. Ourmodel achieves the highest reductions in policyrelative to all realistic (i.e., non-oracle) models.
Figure 2: Left: Impact of varying levels of carrier potency controlled by B1,k/B1,2. Our model out-performs baselines, especially in cases with high potency. Right: Impact of high (=.9) and low (=.1)similarity between the characteristics of the untested-uninfected and untested-infected populations.
