Figure 1: Architecture of the proposed cross-domain sentiment analysis framework. Left: separableclusters are formed in the embedding space after initial supervised model training in the sourcedomain and then the prototypical distribution is estimated as a GMM. Right: random samples fromthe GMM with high-confident labels are used to generate a pseudo-dataset. The pseudo-datasetinduces larger margins between the classes to mitigate the effect of domain shift in the target domain.
