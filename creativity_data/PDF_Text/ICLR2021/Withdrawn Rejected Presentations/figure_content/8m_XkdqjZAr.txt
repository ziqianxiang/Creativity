Figure 1: An example of the synthetic minority class samples created using SMOTE and AE-SMOTE.
Figure 2: Overview of our proposed method. Left diagram depicts SMOTE in the sample space,where blue o are majority samples, orange o are minority samples present in the dataset and blue+ are synthetic minority examples generated. Sample points x are fed to an encoding blocked hÏ†to produce latent points z. Subsequently, samples are manipulated by the function g(zi) prior todecoding to the original sample space.
