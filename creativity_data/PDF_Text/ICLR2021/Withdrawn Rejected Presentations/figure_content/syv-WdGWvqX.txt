Figure 1: We propose to: (a) learn domain specific models and map training domains (in red) in alatent space via population statistics of the BN layers, (b) project a sample from an unknown domainto the same space via its instance statistics (in green), and (c) measure its distance from the knowndomains to approximate the unknown test distribution by a mixture of the domain models.
Figure 2: Our method on PACS (Li et al. (2017)) with Sketch as unknown domain. Our Multi-SourceDomain Alignment Layer (a) collects domain-specific population statistics and compute instancestatistics for test samples. (b) The population and instance statistics map respectively the sourcedomain and the test sample into the latent space L. Domain similarity is estimated as the reciprocalof the distance Dd,t between the target embedding rt and each domain centroids ed.
