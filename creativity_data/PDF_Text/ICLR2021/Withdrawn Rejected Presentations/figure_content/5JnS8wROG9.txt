Figure 1: Empirical analysis of c*. (a) Empirical calculation of c* for Du and Dajc. Values are inlog scale. (b) C as a function of the network size k (c) Positive correlation between Mu(I)) andmax (-SSi, 0). The depicted line is the best PSI bound with b = 2 (lowest c).
Figure 2: Experiments on a variant of MNIST. (a) Examples of data points. (b) Filters of CNN withk = 1 that perfectly classifies the data (c) Examples of learned filters of overparameterized CNNsfor different training set sizes. Figures of all learned filters are given in Section G.
Figure 3: c* as a function of the training set size m.
Figure 4: Example of points in an orthogonal patterns distribution. Here there are 25 possibleorthogonal patterns (∣P∣ = 25) and each pattern is a 10 × 10 image patch and thus d = 100. Thenumber of patterns in each image is n = 16. The image consists of 4 rows of 4 patches each. Thepositive examples contain the pattern in P+ . The negative examples contain the pattern in P-. Inthe two leftmost images of each class, the corresponding pattern is shown. All other patterns in animage are from the set of spurious patterns Ps .
