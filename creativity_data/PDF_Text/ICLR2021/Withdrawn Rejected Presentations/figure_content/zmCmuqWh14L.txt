Figure 1: Representation of a standard architecture of a CNN used for off-target predictions. Theencoded matrix containing the SgRNA-DNA information of each nucleobase sequences is used asinput. Different convolutional layers capture the SgRNA-DNA information of the encoded matrix,a maxpooling is used to downsample the output of the convolutional layers. Fully connected layersare finally used to perform off-target predictions. Minor variations exist between different CNNarchitectures used in our experiments depending on the number of layers considered.

Figure 6: ROC curves for the FNN models with 3, 5 and 10 layers, the CNN models with 3 and 5layers, the CNN model of Lin and Wong and the RF model obtained on the CRISPOR data set usingthe 4 × 23 data encoding. The AUC ROC value for each model is shown within the figure.
Figure 7: ROC curves for the FNN models with 3, 5 and 10 layers, the CNN models with 3 and 5layers, the CNN model of Lin and Wong and the RF model obtained on the CRISPOR data set usingthe 8 × 23 data encoding. The AUC ROC value for each model is shown within the figure. The8 × 23 encoding always provided greater values of the AUC ROC statistic than the 4 × 23 encoding,see Figure 6.
Figure 8: ROC curves for the FNN models with 3, 5 and 10 layers, the CNN models with 3 and5 layers, the CNN model of Lin and Wong and the RF model obtained on the GUIDE-seq data setusing the 4 × 23 data encoding. The AUC ROC value for each model is shown within the figure.
