Figure 1: Graph AdVersariaL Networks (GAL). GAL defends node and neighborhood inference attacks Viaa min-max game between the task decoder (blue) and a simulated worst-case attacker (yellow) on both theembedding (descent) and the attributes (ascent). Malicious attackers will haVe difficulties extracting sensitiVeattributes at inference time from GNN embeddings trained with our framework.
Figure 2: GAL effectively protects sensitive information. Both panels show t-SNE plots of feature represen-tations of a graph under different defense strengths λ (0 vs. 1.3). Node colors represent node classes.
