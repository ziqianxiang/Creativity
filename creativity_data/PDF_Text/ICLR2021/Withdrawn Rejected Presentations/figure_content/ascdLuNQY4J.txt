Figure 1: Illustration of a K-operation parameterized by weights W and K-matrices a = (Ki, K2, M), Withelementwise product in orange (left). a is found via search, while weights w are retrained for the discovered a.
Figure 2: ComParison of the filters, and filter analogues, Produced by three Parameterized oPerations trainedon CIFAR-10: convolutions, K-operations warm-started with convolutions, and K-operations searched fromscratch. The latter two are discovered using Supernet SGD. In the case of convolutions, these are randomlyselected filters at random positions on the input feature map. In the cases of the learned K-operations, theseare randomly selected neighborhoods of the operation over the input feature map. The first layer of the warmstarted K-operation remains mostly convolutional, while the second layer pools features more globally. Thefirst layer of the from scratch K-operation has some locality structure, while the second layer does not.
