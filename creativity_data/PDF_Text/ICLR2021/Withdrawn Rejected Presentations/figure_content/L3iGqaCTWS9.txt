Figure 1:	A sample representation of the random Gaussian data and the Retro-synthesis data usingthe proposed in Algorithm 1 respectively for a sample class of ResNet-50 model.
Figure 2:	An example weight distribution plot of a random layer in a model with a weight range of[0 - 3] divided into 6 groups of equal width. The ranges from 0.5 to 1 and 2.5 to 3 are labeled as‘group-m’ and ‘group-n’ respectively. For clarity only the weights in these two groups are shown.
Figure 3: Weight distribution of FP32 model, model quantized using the proposed Non-UniformQuantization method and uniform quantization method in respective order for a sample layer inResNet-18 model. The horizontal and vertical axis represents the weights range and frequencyrespectively.
Figure 4: Sensitivity plot describing the respective layer’s sensitivity for per-tensor and per-channelquantization schemes in case of MobileNet-V2 model. The horizontal axis represent the layer num-ber and the vertical axis represents the sensitivity value.
Figure 5: Sensitivity plot describing the respective layer’s sensitivity for original ground truthdataset, random data and the proposed retro-synthesis data for ResNet-18 model quantized usingper-channel scheme. The horizontal axis represent the layer number and the vertical axis representsthe sensitivity value.
