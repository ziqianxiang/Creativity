Figure 1: Visual aids of proposed algorithm. Note that for visualization purposes we are exhibiting a 1 + 2dimensional Euclidean space rather than a high dimensional Riemannian manifold.
Figure 2: (a): Random sampling was constrained in Experiment 1 such that the samples lie inside the lightcone with an upper temporal bound. Samples in the last row of Figure (a) had no constraints imposedon them. We observe larger morphological and location differences as time progresses. This is consistentwith the theory that the system had enough time to evolve into these states. (b): In Experiment 2 weare intersecting 2 cones. For ease of reading the figures have been arranged such that the movements aremore apparent. on the left in (b) we exhibit vertical movements while on the right we exhibit horizontalmovements. The arrows guide the direction of reading in the figure.
Figure 3: Samples from Experiment 2 (a) and Experiment 3 (b). 5 cones intersected, trained on the movingMNIST dataset (a) and the KTH movement video dataset (b). Differences in image brightness in (b) are dueto PyTorchâ€™s contrast normalization in the plotting function.
