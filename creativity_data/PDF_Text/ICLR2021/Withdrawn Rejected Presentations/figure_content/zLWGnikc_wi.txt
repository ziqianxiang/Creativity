Figure 1: Illustration of the proposed °DNN architecture and its similarity to the filling-in Phenom-ena in human vision. Input x is initially corrupted by δ(x), removing some information while keep-ing contextual clues. p(δ(x); θ) uses this corrupted image to predict a partial (or whole) recreationWhiCh is then aggregated with function μ to compose a complete recreated image. This recreatedimage is sent to the vanilla classifier.
