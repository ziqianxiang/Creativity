Figure 1: Visualization of pointspread functions (convolutional kernels) previously observed to belearned in the early layers of ConvNets. Brightness corresponds to pointwise function values. Themajority of the plots show characteristics of oriented bandpass filters in two spatial dimensions,i.e., oscillating values along one direction, while remaining relatively constant in the orthogonaldirection, even as there is an overall amplitude fall-off with distance from the center. The specificexamples derive from the early layers of a ResNet-50 architecture He et al. (2016) trained on Ima-geNet Russakovsky et al. (2015).
Figure 2: Visualization of an analytically defined oriented bandpass filter (12). The left panel showsthe pointspread function corresponding to the odd symmetry (sin) component, while the right panelshows its power in the frequency domain. Brightness corresponds to pointwise function values.
