Figure 1: (a) Areal surveillance example with an arbitrary forest and m = 2 drones, (b) Adversarialcoverage example with m = 2 drones and n = 2 lumberjacks (red circles).
Figure 2: Plots of true reward achieved over DeepFP iterations by diff, nn and gnn.
Figure 3: Visualizing final actions for a randomly chosen forest with m = 2.
Figure 4: Visualizing final strategies found via diff, nn and gnn with best responses of the form brnetand pop4 on a randomly chosen forest with m = n = 2. The blue (red) dots are sampled from thedefender’s (attacker’s) strategy for the 2 drones (lumberjacks).
