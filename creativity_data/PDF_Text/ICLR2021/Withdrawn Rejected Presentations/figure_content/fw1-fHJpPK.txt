Figure 1: Comparing graph attention network (GAT) with decentralized attention network (DAN).
Figure 2: Open entity alignment results on DBP15K. Bars with dotted lines denote the performancedrop compared with the corresponding results in the non-open setting. The same to the following.
Figure 3: MRR results on open FB15K-237.
Figure 4: HitS @1 results of each layer and the concatenation. The results of AliNet are from (SUnet al., 2020). It has no L3 and L4 scores as its best performance was achieved by a two-layer model.
Figure 5: OvervieW of a four-layer decentralized attention netWork (DAN). Best vieWed in color.
