Figure 2: Comparison between distributional and traditional (non-distributional) approach. We con-ducted five experiments (with different seeds) for no-CSI using the traffic model of table 1a anda maximum number of users K = 75. In the first figure we depict the average over those fiveexperiments; in the other figures we consider two specific experiments (named exp. 1 and exp. 2).
Figure 3: Performance of Deep Scheduler versus the benchmarks on different scenarios. The firstfour correspond to the case of Table 1a) and the last to the other. Figures 3a,3b,3b refer to the caseof full-CSI and the rest to no-CSI.
