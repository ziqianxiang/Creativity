Figure 1: Estimating the distribution of adversarial examples qθ in two stages: 1) estimate thedistribution of benign data pθ. 2) transfer pθ to estimate qθ.
Figure 2: The architecture of AT-GAN. The first training stage of AT-GAN is same as AC-WGAN_GP.
Figure 3: Adversarial examples generated by various attacks on three datasets (Zoom in for details).
Figure 4: T-SNE visualization for the combination of testset and adversarial examples generated byvarious attacks on MNIST (top) and Fashion-MNIST (bottom). For (a), we use total testset with10,000 images. For (b) to (f), we use 5,000 sampled images in testset and 5,000 adversarial examplesgenerated by various attacks. The position of each class is random due to the property of t-SNE.

Figure 6: The adversarial examples generated by AT-GAN for various values of kpk∞ .
Figure 7: The adversarial examples generated by AT-GAN on CIFAR-10 dataset.
Figure 8: Adversarial examples generated by AT-GAN to various targets with the same random noiseinput for each row. The images on the diagonal are generated by Goriginal which are not adversarialexamples and treated as the initial instances for AT-GAN.
