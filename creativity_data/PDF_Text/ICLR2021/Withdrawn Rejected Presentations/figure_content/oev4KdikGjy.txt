Figure 1: Robustness of PreAct-ResNet18 models trained on CIFAR-10 with standard augmen-tations (Baseline) and the addition of MixUp and CutMix to uniform noise, DeepFool (Moosavi-Dezfooli et al., 2016), and the worst case performance after multiple attacks including the additiveuniform noise and DeepFool. MixUp improves robustness to adversarial examples with similarproperties to images generated with MixUp (acting as adversarial training), but MSDA does notimprove robustness in general. Shaded region indicates the standard deviation following 5 repeats.
