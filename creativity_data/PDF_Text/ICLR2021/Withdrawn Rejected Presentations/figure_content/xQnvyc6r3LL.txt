Figure 3: Mean Prediction accuracy/speed comparison for different methods for the test set overT = 30 steps and R0 = 2.5. The time to perform inference over the test set for different models havebeen listed above. Note that the time taken by GCN represents the mean time taken by GCN variants.
Figure 2: Theoretical upper boundon accuracy (dashed line) vs ex-perimental (solid line) on ER forvarying Ro . While accuracy dropsbelow the theoretical limit at t ã€œtmax.
Figure 4: Performance of GCN-S for SIR and SEIR epidemic dynamics as top-1 accuracy over thetest set. The top-1 recovery accuracy of P0 vs time (first and second row) and normalized rank of P0(third and fourth row) for different graph topologies with varying R0 values. Note that in BA-Tree(a), which is a tree, the accuracy remains fairly high in both SIR and SEIR, consistent with existingliterature, and confirming that cycles significantly reduces accuracy of P0.
Figure 5: Performance on Boston co-location net-work with simulations following the natural historyof COVID-19. Shown here are the top-k accuracy andnormalized rank.
Figure 6: Performance of GCN-S for SIR epidemic dynamics as top-1 accuracy over the test set withvarying number of layers.
Figure 7: Degree distribution of the original co-location network with 384, 590 nodes and thesubsampled network with 2, 689 nodes. We subsample the larger network to find a subgraph in orderto reduce computational costs of our experiments. We observe that the distribution of our subsamplednetwork is similar to the original graph.
