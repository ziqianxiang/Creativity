Figure 1: An overview of the proposed object detection network. The main difference with originalSSD (LiU et al., 2016) is in the localization and classification branches. Instead of having determin-istic outputs, our approach learns the parameters of a K-component GMM for each of the outputs.
Figure 2: Examples of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties for inaccurate detections, see moreexamples in the appendix. From left to right: Person is a false positive; Person bounding box is notcorrect; A sheep is misclassified as a cow; A bird is misclassified as Aeroplane.
Figure 3:	VOC07+12: a) Comparison to published work using a single model for scoring; b) Com-parison to ensemble and MC-dropout; c) Model parameters in milions and forward time in seconds.
Figure 4:	a) Accuracy comparison on COCO; b) Performance comparison using Faster-RCNN onVOC07; b) Transferability of datasets created using our approach.
Figure 5: Examples of normalized aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties for inaccurate detections.
