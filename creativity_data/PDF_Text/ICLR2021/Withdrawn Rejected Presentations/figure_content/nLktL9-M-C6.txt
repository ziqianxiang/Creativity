Figure 1: Normalization tools for UDA. (a) Typical Batch Normalization (BN) in green background firstlyestimates the mean μsj)and variance σ(j) from the j-th feature map, and then normalize F：；) into Yj). TNfurther extended BN by exploring a(j)(dash lines) to enhance the transferability of several channels. (b) OurCoN advances the BN with dashed lines and borrows cross-domain knowledge derived from all feature mapsFs/ to implement collaborative normalization and eliminate domain shift.
