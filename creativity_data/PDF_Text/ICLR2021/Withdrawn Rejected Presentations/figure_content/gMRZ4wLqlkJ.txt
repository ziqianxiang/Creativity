Figure 1: Overall procedure of the proposed few-round learning algorithm for federated learning. By usingthe meta-trained initial model, a set of clients with new tasks can quickly obtain a high-accuracy global modelwithin only a few rounds of FL. Meta-training is based on episodic training that mimics actual inference pre-ceded by an R-round FL procedure. A global prototype-assisted learning strategy at both meta-training anddeployment phases further improves model accuracy.
Figure 2: Test accuracy after R = 3 global rounds in the testing phase, with varying numbers of communicationrounds in the meta-training phase (or pre-training phase).
