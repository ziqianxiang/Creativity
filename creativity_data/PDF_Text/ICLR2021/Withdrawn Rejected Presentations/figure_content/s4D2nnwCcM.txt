Figure 1: An illustrative example in the SQuAD dataset (Rajpurkar et al., 2016).
Figure 2: Illustration of our learning algorithm in each iteration. Given a pool of unlabeledpairs of passage-questions, the algorithm first identifies the instances that it is most uncertain on,e.g. those marked in red. Then it queries to an expert to gather the answers (i.e. labels), and restrictsto fit the newly labeled instances.
