Figure 1: (a) Quantum circuit implementing a quantum deformed layer. The thin vertical line indi-cates that the gate acts as identity on the wires crossed by the line. (b) Quantum deformed multilayerperceptron with 2 hidden quantum neurons and 1 output quantum neuron. |xi is an encoding of theinput signal, y is the prediction. The superscript ' in Uj and Wj,： refers to layer '. We split theblocks of t` ancilla qubits into a readout qubit that encodes the layer output amplitude and the rest.
Figure 2: (a) The entangling circuit D for N = 3. (b) Ki entering the computation of μ. (c)KiKi+1 entering the computation of σ2. Indices on P, Q, B are omitted for clarity. Time flowsdownwards.
