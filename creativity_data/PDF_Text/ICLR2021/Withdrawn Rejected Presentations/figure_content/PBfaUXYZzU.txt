Figure 1: Skew in distributions of Class Cardinalities or Class Importance, and the potential mis-match between these two distributions render Accuracy and Balanced Accuracy metrics unusable ingeneral multi-class prediction problems.
Figure 2: WBA vs. class-insensitive & class-sensitive metrics for log parsing: F1-Score & Accuracyagree in all. BA & WBA agree in (c) & (d) only. WBA disagrees with class-insensitive in all.
