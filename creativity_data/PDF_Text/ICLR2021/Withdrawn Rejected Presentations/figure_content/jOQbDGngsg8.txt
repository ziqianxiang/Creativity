Figure 1: A toy pair of anonymized and generated networks.
Figure 2: Neural architecture of DPGGan (best viewed in color): Our novel graph generationmodel consists of a GCN-based encoder, an FNN-based decoder (generator), and a GCN+FNN-baseddiscriminator. Sensitive data and modules are marked as red, while safe operations (i.e., gradientclipping, noise injection and sampling) are marked as green, leading to DP modules and data.
Figure 3: Accuracy of links predicted based on networks generated by DPGGan with varyinghyper-parameters and evaluated on the original networks. Lower AUC means the information in thegenerated networks is less useful in revealing the true existence or absence of links in the originalnetworks, thus better individual data privacy.
