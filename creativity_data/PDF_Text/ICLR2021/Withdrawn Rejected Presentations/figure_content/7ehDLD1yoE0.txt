Figure 1: Visualization of embedding vectors for code2seq-sm.
Figure 2: The F1 scores of the code2seq models, evaluated on the java-small or python testingdataset that has been adversarially perturbed with STRATA for given top-n parameters, using 5-sameconcatenation. A lower F1 score corresponds to a more effective attack.
Figure 3: Changing local variable identifiers affects prediction. Left: Original Java method sumcomputes the sum of a list of integers. code2seq, trained on java-large, predicts that the methodname is sum. Right: Perturbed Java method with the same behavior, but the local variable totalhas been replaced with answer, causing CODE2SEQ to misclassify this method as getInt.
