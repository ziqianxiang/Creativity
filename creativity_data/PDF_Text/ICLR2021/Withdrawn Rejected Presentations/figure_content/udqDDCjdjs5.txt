Figure 1: 2-DWPT decomposition tree of U down to resolution level j = 3. A sequence {h0, h1} isused for recursive decomposition of the tree nodes.
Figure 2: 3-DWPT decomposition tree of U down to resolution level j = 2. A sequence {h0, h1 , h2}is used for recursive decomposition of the tree nodes.
Figure 3: MultiSerial DWPT tree with M1 = 2, M2 = 3 and M3 = 2. Three sequences {h1,0, h1,1},{h2,0, h2,1, h2,2} and {h3,0, h3,1} are used for recursive decomposition of the tree nodes. The 3hidden layers have respectively 2, 6 and 12 nodes, but a total of M1 + M2 + M3 = 7 differentconvolution filters have been used. This structure will be associated to an expanded CNNs havingj = 1, 2, 3 hidden layers involving respectively 2, 3 and 2 convolution layers.
Figure 4: Standard CNN structure composed by 3 hidden layers that have respectively 2, 3 and 2convolution filters. It involves fusion (sum in general) of convolutional outputs associated with thesame filter over the previous layer channels and prior to applying the transfer function: compare theabove graph with the expanded one given by Figure 3.
Figure 5: Hyperserial CNN structure where the node Lj,n of layer j involves Mj,n convolutionfilters and the sequence (Mj,n)n is not necessarily constant. Compare this graph with the multiserialone given by Figure 3: on the latter, every node of layer j has the same number Mj of convolutionfilters (it is multiserial because Mj = m` in general from layer to layer). The multiserial graph isdescribed by 2 parameters whereas the hyperserial one requires 3 parameters.
Figure 6:	Graphs illustrating several possible processing: (i) analysis at nodes{V3,n : n = 0, 1, . . . , 11} of hidden layer 3 and reconstruction at output node U0 ; (ii) joint analysisfrom a late fusion stage at nodes {V4,n : n = 0, 1, . . . , 5} of hidden layer 4 (in contrast with earlyfusion stage for standard CNNs) (iii) selective analysis at nodes {V4,n : n = 0, 1} and instancereconstruction at output node U00 .
Figure 7:	Hybrid representation space. Gabor 00 and 01: Gabor magnitude coefficients correspondingto two different wavelengths. Smooth 00 to 05: post-processing associated with different scalingfilters (for instance Gaussian filters with different scaling parameters). CNNs 00 to 11: CNNarchitectures, where even numbers are associated with Xception CNN and odd numbers correspondto DenseNet CNN. The fusion stage is associated with a geometric mean on the softmax probabilitiescomputed by the different CNNs.
