Figure 1: 1-D Encoding Scheme: On the left we show the Forward Transform. T representsthe transform matrix that takes the input X into an intermediate coordinate system, resulting inrepresentation Y. On the right, we show the Inverse Transform that uses Y to reconstruct X overtime. Here T -1 = T0. The input image X is reconstructed progressively at each timestep bysumming the basis vectors Tn modulated by the corresponding coefficient yn over all previoustimesteps. Since there are 5 bases shown here, X requires 5 timesteps for reconstruction.

Figure 3: 8 Ã— 8 2-D DCT bases on the left and PCAbases for CIFAR-10 on the right. The DCT basesare ranked in a zig-zag fashion starting from top leftto the bottom right and the PCA bases are ranked insignificance from left to right and top to bottom.

We empiriCally find that DCT-2 is unableto Converge, and that overlapped version of DCT-4 with a stride of 2 outperforms all other Cases.
