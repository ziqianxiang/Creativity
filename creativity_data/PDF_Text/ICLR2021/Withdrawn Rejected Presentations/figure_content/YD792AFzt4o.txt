Figure 1:	Reliabilitycurve (upper) and pre-dictive uncertainty onout-of-distribution samples(lower) of ResNet.
Figure 2: Monitoring changes in the behavior of ResNet during training on CIFAR-100. In (a),LL indicates the log-likelihood Ex,y[log φyW (x)] and max log-prob indicates Ex [log φmWx (x)]. In(c), the L2 norm is approximated with respect to empirical distributions of training samples andvalidation samples.
