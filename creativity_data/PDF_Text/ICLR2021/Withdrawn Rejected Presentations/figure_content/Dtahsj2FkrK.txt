Figure 1: Empirical rejection probabilities of our test and the two-sample t-test with α(∙) = αι (∙). Settingscorrespond to the alternating-time-interval, adaptive and Markov design, from top plots to bottom plots.
Figure 2: Our test statistic (the orange line) and the rejection boundary (the black line) in the A/A (left plot)and A/B (right plot) experiments.
Figure 3: Empirical rejection probabilities of our test and the DRL-based test.
Figure 4: Empirical rejection probabilities of the modified version of the O’Brien & Fleming sequen-tial test developed by Kharitonov et al. (2015). The left panels depicts the empirical type-I error andthe right panels depicts the empirical power. Settings correspond to the alternating-time-interval,adaptive and Markov design, from top plots to bottom plots.
