Figure 2: Results of runs. Top row. We selected three random weights and plotted them in RGBchannels. This way elements with similar weights will have similar colour and those with differ-ent weights will likely have different colour. Bottom row. First three chemicals plotting in RGBchannels. Discussion. We see a lot of diversity in the runs. These are best viewed in accompanyingvideo. We often see coexistence of two species - seen in two different colours in the same regionof space. We also see that the elements moved the chemicals around creating regions of high andlow densities. In the top left square, we see that the region of low density is occupied by differentspecies than the region of high density First graph Fraction of elements alive as a function of timefrom the start of the run (random new weights with no evolution in this run only). We see oscillatorybehavior resulting from dynamics of two species. Second graph Energy content of elements in pureenergy system of moving elements that need no energy to survive. However, those elements thatcollect energy can copy weights onto those with less energy, and those that do that propagate.
