Figure 1: Matrix ShUffle-Exchange model consists of one or more Benes block that is enclosed byZ-Order flatten, and Z-Order unflatten transformations. For a 2k X 2k input array, Benes block hastotal of 2k - 1 Quaternary Switch and 2k - 2 Quaternary Shuffle layers, giving rise to O(n2 log n)time complexity.
Figure 2: Depiction how the Quaternary Shuffle layer permutes the matrix (technically it permutes1D sequence representation of matrix). The left image shows the matrix elements ordered accordingto Z-Order curve, where the ordering indices are represented by base-4 numbers. The right imageshows element order after the Quaternary Shuffle. Quaternary Shuffle permutation can be interpretedas splitting matrix rows into two halves (white and green) and interleaving the halves, then applyingthe same transformation to columns (white and red).
