Figure 1: Trajectories of SGD over OLS with and without Unbiased Random Label Noises usingvarious σ2 and Σ1,2 settings for (noisy) random data generation. For Figures (a)-(d), the experimentsare setup with a fixed Σ1,2 = [[20, 0]>, [0, 20]>] and varying σ2. For Figures (e)-(h), the experi-ments are setup with a fixed σ2 = 0.5 and varying Σ1,2, where We set ΣVer = [[10, 0]>, [0,100]>]and ΣHor = [[100, 0]>, [0, 10]>] to shape the converging distributions.
