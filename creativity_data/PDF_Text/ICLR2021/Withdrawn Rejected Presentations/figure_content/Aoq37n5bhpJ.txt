Figure 1: Overview: Federated mixtures of experts using local gating functions. Some clients opt-out from federation, not contributing to the global model and keeping their data completely private.
Figure 2: Accuracy on unbalanced local validation data for CIFAR-100 for different majority classfractions p. Opt-out factor q = 0.0, number of clients is 50 and number of data points per clientis 100. Reported values are means over four runs. In (a) we sample a fraction 1.0 of all clients toparticipate each communication round of FedAvg, and in (b) we sample a fraction 0.1 of clients.
Figure 3: Accuracy on unbalanced local validation data for CIFAR-10 for different majority classfractions p. Number of clients is 5 and train set size per client is 500. (a) opt-out factor q = 0.0 (b)opt-out factor q = 0.5 and (c) opt-out factor q = 0.9. Reported values are means over four runs.
Figure 4: Accuracy on unbalanced local validation data for Fashion-MNIST for different majorityclass fractions p. Number of clients is 5 and number of data points per client is 600. (a) opt-outfactor q = 0.0 (b) opt-out factor q = 0.9. Reported values are means over four runs.
Figure 5: Heatmap showing the difference in validation accuracy on CIFAR-10 (a) and Fashion-MNIST (b) for different majority class fractions and client train set sizes between the mixture ofexperts (ours) and the fine-tuned baseline. Number of clients is 5 and opt-out factor q = 0.0.
