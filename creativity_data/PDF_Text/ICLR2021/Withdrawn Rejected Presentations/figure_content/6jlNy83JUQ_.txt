Figure 1: Rt/ logt vs. round t for different methods for randomly drawn d binary features, expecteddt/d features per example, and standard deviation of true log-odds noted in each graph.
Figure 2: Left: Rt / log t vs. t for synthetic data with millions of long tail features. Right: Lossrelative to the best SGD on the Criteo benchmark dataset for multiple algorithms.
Figure 3: Left: Logistic and Normal N(0, 8∕π) distributions and their differences. Middle: Sigmoidand Normal CDF N(0, 8∕π) and their differences. Right: Differences between logistic and normal(PDFs and CDFs).
Figure 4: Normalized Rt / log t vs. round t for various methods with randomly drawn binary fea-tures, with d, expected dt /d, and standard deviation of true log-odds noted in each graph. Graphsshown for d = 200, E[dt] ∈ {5, 20, 40} and true log-odds std in {1, 2, 3}.
Figure 5: Normalized Rt/ logt vs. round t for different algorithms and different data generationmodels. On the left, a model with d = 200 features, out of which in average dt = 40 occur in anexample, and weight standard deviation is 2, with nonbinary feature values uniform in [0, 1]. Right:models with d = 2000, average dt = 200, data generation standard deviation of 2, with binaryfeatures.
Figure 6: Normalized by Rt/ logt vs. round t for categorical models and different algorithms. Left:2000 features in 10 categories of 200 features each, where in each example 5 features from eachcategory are present, with true weight standard deviation of 2. On the right: A similar setting, exceptthat in each category features are selected with a long tail exponential distribution (prioritizing a fewfeatures and rarely selecting others).
