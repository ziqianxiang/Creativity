Figure 1: Examples of predicted distribution fromTrajectron++ (Salzmann et al., 2020). Whitepoints denote the ground truth trajectory Yi,gt andthe color region indicates the predicted distribu-tion. Some of the prediction go outside of thedrivable region or go to the lane in opposite di-jectory Yig is on the outermost lane, a trajec-tory that is close to Yi,gt but outside the driv-able region is unlike to happen in the real world.
Figure 2: Examples of maps used in the checker in nuScences (Caesar et al., 2019a). Green andblue region together denote the drivable region and the blue means that we have lane directioninformation here. Random locations are sampled and their lane directions are plotted as red arrowsto show the concrete directions. Blue line denotes the trajectories to check and the velocity directionsare represented as yellow arrows. (a) shows a negative trajectory that goes out of the road. (b) is apassing case.
Figure 3: Qualitative results of our method and Trajectron++ in a complex scenario. Some of thepredicted distribution of Trajectron++ are out of the road or cover the lane with wrong direction.
