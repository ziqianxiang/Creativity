Figure 1: Desired behaviors of an ensemble of regression models. The bottom row displays thedesired Normal-Wishart Distribution and the top row depicts Normal Distributions samples from it.
Figure 2: Comparison of different models on synthetic data y 〜N(Sin X + 卷,∣x∣+1 + 0.01). Grayarea indicates training data region.
Figure 3: Comparison of uncertainty measures between ensembles and EnD2. For two input images,we demonstrate the difference between prediction and ground truth (Error), measures of Total Variance(Total) and EPKL (Knowledge) obtained from ensembles and our model. The left and right imagescorresponds to models trained on the KITTI an NYU datasets, respectively.

Figure 6: Examples of test inputs for Nyu model. Images are in order: NYU, LSUN-bed, LSUN-church, KITTI. OOD images are center-cropped and re-scaled to the in-domain data, preserving theaspect ratio.
Figure 7: Examples of test inputs for KITTI model. Images are in order: KITTI, LSUN-bed, LSUN-church, NYU. OOD images are center-cropped and re-scaled to the in-domain data, preserving theaspect ratio.
