Figure 1: CIFAR100 Class 17 (right to left): (1) - During training all samples approach the centerof train set features (2) - When normalized by the train average distance st , the normal samplesstay dense, while the anomalous ones initially move further away and then ”collapse”. The ROCAUC performance behaves similarly to the anomalous samples’ normalized distance. (3),(4) - whentraining with EWC the collapse is mitigated.
Figure 2: An illustration of our feature adaptation procedure, the pre-trained feature extractor ψ0 isadapted to make the normal features more compact resulting in feature extractor ψ . After adaptationanomalous test images lie in a less dense region of the feature space.
