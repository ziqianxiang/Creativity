Figure 2: Three experimental scenarios: (a)prisoner, (b) traffic, and (c) routing.

Figure 5: Temporal pattern of selfishnessFigure 6: Spatial pattern of selfishnessdifferent selfishness. In addition, inner agents keep their selfishness more uniform during off-peakperiods, while they diverge and present cross-like patterns during peak periods. This shows thathandling heavier traffic requires more diverse reward sharing schemes among agents to promotemore sophisticated cooperation.
