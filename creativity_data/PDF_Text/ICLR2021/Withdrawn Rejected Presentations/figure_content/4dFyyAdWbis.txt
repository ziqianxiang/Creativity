Figure 1: 0° is the labeled source domain while the domains in blue are unlabeled target domains. Thenumbers in rectangle denote the post-adaptation accuracy for a domain. (a) Static Design: Labeled Sourceacts the collaborator for each target domain. (b) Flexible Design: Each target domain chooses its collaboratordynamically. Previously adapted target domains can also act as collaborators. Note that choosing the rightcollaborator leads to major accuracy gains over the Static Design for many domains (shown in red).
Figure 2: (a) A new target domain DTK+1 finds its optimal adaptation collaborator Dopt from a set of candidatedomains. (b) DTK+1 performs distributed uDA with Dopt to learn a model for its distribution.
Figure 3: Effect of varying the sync-up step p from 1 to 10 on target domain accuracy.
Figure 4: OCS prevents negative transfer and error propagation in sequential adaptation caused by the presenceof unrelated domains. 0° is the labeled source domain while the domains in blue are unlabeled target domains.
