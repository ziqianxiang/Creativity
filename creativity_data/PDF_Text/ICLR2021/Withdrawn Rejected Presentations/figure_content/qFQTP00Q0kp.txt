Figure 3: Data augmentations examples from CricketX dataset. The blue solid line is the originalsignal and the red dotted lines are the transformations.
Figure 5: Linear evaluation on CricketX under individual or composition of data augmentations.
Figure 6: t-SNE visualization of the learned feature on UGLA dataset. Different colors indicatedifferent labels.
Figure 7: Impact of augmentation number K .
Figure 8: Impact of different temporal relation class numbers and piece sizes on other five datasets.
Figure 9: Linear evaluation on UWaveGestureLibraryAll, DodgerLoopDay, and InsectWingbeat-Sound datasets under individual or composition of data augmentations. For all columns but the last,diagonal entries correspond to single transformation, and off-diagonals correspond to compositionof two transformations (applied sequentially). The last column reflects the average over the row.

For all columns but the last, diagonal entries correspond to single transformation,and off-diagonals correspond to composition of two transformations (applied sequentially). The lastcolumn reflects the average over the row.
