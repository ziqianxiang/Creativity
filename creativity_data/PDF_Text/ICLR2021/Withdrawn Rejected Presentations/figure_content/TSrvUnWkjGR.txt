Figure 1: The Latent-Pursuit inverts the generative model layer-by-layer as described in Algorithm 3,and is composed of three steps: (1) last layer inversion by Algorithm 5;(2) midlayer inversions usingAlgorithm 2; and (3) first layer inversion via Algorithm 2 with the x-step replaced by Equation 10.
Figure 2: Gaussian iid weights: Recovery errors as a function of the hidden-layer size (n1), wherethe image space is 625. Subfigures (a)-(c) correspond to z ∈ R100 and (d)-(f) to z ∈ R200 . Theseresults support Theorem 2 stating that to guarantee a unique solution, the hidden layer cardinalitys1 ≈ n should be larger than the latent vector space and smaller than the image space. Moreover, itsupports Corollary 1 by showing that under the non-zero expansion condition, both Layered Basis-Pursuit and Latent-Pursuit (Algorithms 1 and 3) recover the original latent vector perfectly.
