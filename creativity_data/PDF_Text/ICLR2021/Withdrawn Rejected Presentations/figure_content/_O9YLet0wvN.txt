Figure 1: A. One-shot object detection: Identify and localize all objects of a certain category withina scene based on a (single) instructive example. B. Increasing the number of categories used duringtraining reduces the generalization gap to novel categories presented at test time (in parenthesis:number of categories in each dataset).
Figure 2: Siamese Faster R-CNNthe unified RetinaHead to jointly propose and classify bounding boxes. To counter the effect of toomany negative samples, the classifier is trained with focal loss Lin et al.(2017b).
Figure 3: Example predictions on held-out categories (ResNet-50 backbone). The left three columnsshow success cases. The rightmost column shows failure cases in which objects are overlookedand/or wrongfully detected.
Figure 4: Relative performance growswith the number of categories but stayslower than that of Siamese-U-Net on Clut-tered Omniglot (Michaelis et al., 2018a).
Figure 5: A. Experiment subsampling LVIS and Objects365 categories during training. When morecategories are used during training performance on held-out categories (blue) improves while per-formance on the training categories (light blue) stays flat or decreases. B. Comparison of the per-formance on held-out categories if a fixed number of instances is chosen either from all categories(green) or from a subset of categories (blue). Having more categories is more important than havingmore samples per category. (1-shot results, for 5-shot see Appendix Fig. A.2)6Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2021Model	Backb.	Sched.

Figure 6: Predictions on COCO tend to be more accurate and cleaner when using a bigger backboneand training on LVIS. Especially on categories with more ambiguous references like sports ball ordining table the LVIS trained model is more precise. Additionally the ResNeXt backbone leads to”cleaner” results with less false positives.
