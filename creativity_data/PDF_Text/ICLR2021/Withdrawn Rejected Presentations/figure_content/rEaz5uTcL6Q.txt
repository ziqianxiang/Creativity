Figure 1: A schematic of the model architecture. See the main text for details.
Figure 2: Different masking schemes for self-supervised learning applied to our model.
Figure 3: Accuracy with/without auxiliary loss for different proportions of CLEVRER (row 1) andCATER (row 2) training data.
Figure 4: Comparison of different mask types and loss functions for auxiliary loss computation.
Figure 5: The video for an example counterfactual question that can be answered as if it were adescriptive question. The question is: if the brown rubber sphere is removed, what will not happen?and parsed questions to determine causal connectivity and whether each choice happened in thenon-counterfactual scenario.
