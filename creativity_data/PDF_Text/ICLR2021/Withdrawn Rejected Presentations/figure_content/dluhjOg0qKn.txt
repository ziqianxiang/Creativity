Figure 1: Overview of the different ways of constructing diverse ensembles studied in this work.
Figure 2: Inference cost vs. VTAB1K performance. State-of-the-art generalist models of differentscales are compared against ensembles with varying inference budgets.
Figure 3: Effect of fine-tuning budgeton ensemble VTAB1K performance.
Figure 4: Expert ensembles re-tain higher accuracy under do-main shift. Aside from the firstbar, which shows test accuracy,all other bars correspond to someform of induced distribution shift,either artificially or otherwise. Inall but one, we get significantboosts in accuracy compared tothe HyperEnsembles.
