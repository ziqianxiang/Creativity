Figure 1: Example of the model with onlyone gradient-boosting module. Green linesare for local update and red lines are for globalupdate.
Figure 2: Performance on 4-mode regression tasks with one step of global learning. Blue lines showthe real distribution. Red nodes stand for the real values of the support set samples.
Figure 3: Model performance under different settings on (a) the dimension of the weak learner, (b)the number of gradient boosting modules, and (c) the updating strategy for gradient boosting moduleson 4-modes image classification tasks.
Figure 4: Model performance under different settings for the base learner with respect to (a) thenumber of weak learners, (b) the sharing strategy of the base learner, and (c) the choice for theboosting rate Î± on 4-modes image classification tasks.
