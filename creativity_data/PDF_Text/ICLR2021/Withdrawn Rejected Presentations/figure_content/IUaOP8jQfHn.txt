Figure 1: Common principles of all models: Decomposition of an image into a fixed number of slots,each of which contains an embedding zt,k and a mask mt,k of (ideally) a single object. Dotted lines:temporal connections. Solid lines: information flow within one frame.
Figure 2: MOTA on frames11-20 of the VMDS test setwith warm starts of 1-10frames (0 = no warm start).
Figure 3: Distribution offailure cases dependenton number of objects inVMDS videos. Mean ofthree training runs. Errorbars: standard deviation.
Figure 4: Example failure cases for all models on VMDS. Segmentation masks are binarized andcolor-coded to signify slot assignment.
