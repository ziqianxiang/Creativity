Figure 1: The framework of our proposed coverage assessment network (CaNet).
Figure 2: Prediction and conditional coverage of 95% PIs on synthetic examples. (a) CP =0.95, IW = 0.40, ECE1 = 0.62%. (b) CP = 0.96, IW = 0.40, ECE1 = 0.12%. (c)CP = 0.95, IW = 0.50, ECE1 = 0.65%. The predicted coverage estimation from CaNet ishighly consistent with the conditional coverage under different noise settings.
