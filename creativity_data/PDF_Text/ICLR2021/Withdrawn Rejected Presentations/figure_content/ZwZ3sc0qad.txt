Figure 1: Examples of fully connected networks with multi-dimensional outputs where alignment isnot an invariant of training.
Figure 2: Examples of layer constrained networks, where alignment is not an invariant of training.
Figure 3: As proven in our work, alignment is an invariant of training when X, Y satisfy the conditionsof Theorem 1.
