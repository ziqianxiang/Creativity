Figure 1: (a) Empirical distributions for the continuous state variable representing stroke width are digit-dependent, illustrating dependence of style on type. (b) Multi-agent autoencoder framework proposed ascpl-mixVAE model. This framework uses a type-preserving augmentation network G . Each augmented sampleis obtained by first projecting the sample to a lower dimension, then perturbing it with noise n, and finallyprojecting it back to the data space. Agents receive noisy copies of given samples x, i.e. {xa , xb, . . . },where they all belong to the same class label, to learn mixture representations, i.e. {q(ca , sa), q(cb, sb), . . . }.
Figure 2: (a) Augmented samples for the MNIST dataset generated by the type-preserving augmentation conservetype of the original sample. (b-e) Continuous latent traversals of 1st agent of the cpl-mixVAE framework withtwo autoencoding agents, where each agent mixture representation is parameterized with 10-dimensionalcontinuous and 10-dimensional categorical variables. Examples of (b) rotation angle, (c) stroke thickness, (d)character width and (e) roundness of looped features are presented. The discrete variable c is constant for allreconstructions in the same row.
Figure 3: Clustering performance for the MNIST dataset, when the number of discrete variable (|c|) is notequal to the true number of clusters (10 in this case). (a) ACC represents the accuracy of categorical assignmentand AMP denotes average maximum posterior probability for JointVAE and 1st agent of cpl-mixVAE. Errorbars indicate mean ± s.d. over 5 randomly initialized runs. (b-c) Confusion matrices for JointVAE withAMP=0.57(|c| = 9) and AMP=0.54(|c| = 11); (d-e) Confusion matrices for 1st agent cpl-mixVAE withAMP=0.88(|c| = 9) and AMP=0.80(|c| = 11). Color bar indicates per-category accuracy.
Figure 4: Interpretable continuous latent traversals of the trained cpl-mixVAE model with 6-dimensionalContinuouS variable and 3-dimenSional CategoriCal variable for the dSpriteS dataSet. ExampleS of (a) rotation, (b)scale, and (c) position are shown. The discrete variable is held as fixed for all reconstructions in the same row.
Figure 5: Categorical assignments for the scRNA-seq dataset. (a) Confusion matrices of JointVAE, CascadeVAE,and cpl-mixVAE trained by |C| = 115, |s| = 2, andτ = 1, over 45K iterations. For each model, hyperparameterswere assigned as followings: Cs ∈ [0, 7], Cc ∈ [0, 10] (over 10K iterations), and βs = βc = 100 for JointVAE;β ∈ [0.1, 10], and λ = 0.1 for CascadeVAE; λ = 1 for cpl-mixVAE. The dendrogram on the y-axis showsmarker-based hierarchical classification with 115 cell types. (b) Accuracy improvement by adding more agentsfor cpl-mixVAE, over 3 runs. A-agent’s performance for A ≥ 2 is compared with a baseline 1-agent, JointVAE.
