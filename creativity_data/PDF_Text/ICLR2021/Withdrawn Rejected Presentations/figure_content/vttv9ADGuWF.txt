Figure 1: Forward pass of randomized crop defenseand aggregating such local features for final classification are more robust against patch attacks. Anexample of such methods is Bagnets (Brendel & Bethge, 2019), where 1x1 convolutional kernelsare used to restrict the size of the receptive fields. Several existing techniques (Zhang et al., 2020;Xiang et al., 2020) utilize Bagnets for adversarial defense. However, the major drawback of Bagnetsis that it extracts local features at fixed locations, therefore a patch may be placed in particularlocations to influence more number of local features than other locations, thus reducing the worst-case robustness of Bagnets. In contrast to this architecture, we propose to extract local features atrandom locations by sampling random crops; this greatly reduces variations in the number of localfeatures an adversarial patch can influence.

Figure 3: Certified accuracy and inference time(ms) with different number of sampled crops. Left:CIFAR10 with 2.4% patch. Right: ImageNet with 2.0% patchwith the black dotted line as reference. This line can be viewed as the upper bound of the proposedmethod. With more crops sampled, the certified accuracy increases but however inference time alsoincreases close to linearly. Therefore we chose relatively small number of crop samples to balancebetween inference time and certification accuracy.
