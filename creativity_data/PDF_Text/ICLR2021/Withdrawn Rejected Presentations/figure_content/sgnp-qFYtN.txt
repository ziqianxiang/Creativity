Figure 1: Convergence of SLIC: Top row shows the first layer (ReLU activated) and bottom rowshows the last layer (softmaxed) in LeNet-FCN. (a) and (d) shows the evolution of the maximum valuecmax of the constraint functions (cj)16j6J, (b) and (e) shows the evolution of kW k1 in Algorithm 1iterations. (c) and (f) shows kW k1 evolution in Algorithm 2.
Figure 2: Effect of η on LeNet-FCNThe η parameter in our algorithm controls the accuracy tolerance. The higher, the more tolerant weare on the loss of precision and the sparser the network is. Thus, this parameter also controls thenetwork sparsity. The choice of this parameter should be the result of an accuracy-sparsity trade-off.
