Figure 1: From SWaP regret to external regret.
Figure 2: The left and right shows distances (log10) between the strategies and Nash equilibriuminthe two games when β ∈ {0.01, 0.1, 1(RM), 10, a0.01, a0.1, a1, a10}. The results are reported byusing in 10000 itearations. a0 represents a value β ∈ (0, 2a) that is randomly set in each iteration.
Figure 3: The left and right shows the exploitability (log10) of these algorithms when β ∈{1, a0.99-1.01, a0.995-1.005, a1.005-0.995, a1.01-0.09}. The exploitability (y-axis) are reported in Titearations (x-axis, T = 65536 in Leduc and T = 1024 in Big Leduc). ax,y represents a value thatis set as β = X + t(y-x) in iteration t.
Figure 4: The left and right shows the exploitability (log10) of TRM and RTRM in CFR, CFR+ andLCFR. The exploitability (y-axis) are reported in T itearations (x-axis, T = 65536 in Leduc andT = 1024 in Big Leduc).
