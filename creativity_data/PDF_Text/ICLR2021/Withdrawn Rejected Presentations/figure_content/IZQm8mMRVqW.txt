Figure 1: Performance of HB with different β = {0, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 1.0 → 0.9} for phase retrieval. (En-larged figures are available in Appendix H.) Here “1.0 → 0.9” stands for using parameter β = 1.0 in the firstfew iterations and then switching to using β = 0.9 after that. In our experiment, for the ease of implementa-tion,We let the criteria of the switch be 叫 f(WI(Wf)(Wt)≥ 0.5}, i.e. if the relative change of objective valuecompared to the initial value has been increased to 50%. Algorithm 3 and Algorithm 4 in Appendix H describethe procedures. All the lines are obtained by initializing the iterate at the same point wο 〜N(0, Id/(10000d))and using the same step size η = 5 × 10-4. Here we set w* = eι and sample Xi 〜N(0, Id) with dimensiond = 10 and number of samples n = 200. We see that the higher the momentum parameter β, the faster thealgorithm enters the linear convergence regime. (a): Objective value (1) vs. iteration t. We see that the higherthe momentum parameter β, the faster the algorithm enters the linear convergence regime. (b): The size ofprojection of wt on w* over iterations (i.e. |wtk | vs. t), which is non-decreasing throughout the iterations untilreaching an optimal point (here, kw* k = 1). (c): The size of the perpendicular component over iterations (i.e.
Figure 2: Solving (2) with different values of momentum parameter β . The empirical result shows the clearadvantage of Heavy Ball momentum. Subfigure (a) shows that larger momentum parameter β results in a fastergrowth rate of ∣∣wt ∣∣, which confirms Lemma 2 and shows that it enters the benign region IB faster with larger β.

Figure 5: Performance of gradient descent with Heavy Ball momentum with different values ofβ = {0, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 1.0 → 0.9} for solving the phase retrieval problem (1). The case ofβ = 0 corresponds to the standard gradient descent. Left: we plot the convergence to the truemodel w*, defined as min(kwt - w*k, kwt + w*k), as the global sign of the objective equation 1 isunrecoverable. Right: we plot the objective value (1) vs. iteration t.
Figure 6: Performance of HB with different β = {0, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 1.0 → 0.9} for phase retrieval. (a):The size of projection of Wt on w* over iterations (i.e. |wk | vs. t), which is non-decreasing throughout theiterations until reaching an optimal point (here, ∣∣w* ∣∣ = 1). (b): The size of the perpendicular component overiterations (i.e. kwt⊥ k vs. t), which is increasing in the beginning and then it is decreasing towards zero aftersome point. We see that the slope of the curve corresponding to a larger momentum parameter β is steeper thanthat of a smaller one, which confirms Lemma 1 and Lemma 3.
