Figure 1:	Accuracy versus training iterations of partial pre-training and baselines.
Figure 2:	Accuracy versus wall-clock time of partial pre-training and baselines. Same as Figure 1,but with wall-clock time on the x axis rather than training iterations5.2 Accuracy v.s. wall-clock timeThis section presents the accuracy attained by partial pre-training across different wall-clock trainingtimes. Table 2 first presents the per-training-iteration slowdown of simulated low-precision optimiza-tion, the standard practice in the literature. Figure 2 then presents the accuracy attained at differentwall-clock times, showing how the per-iteration accuracy gains from Section 5.1 and the full-precisionspeedups from Table 2 compound to lead to faster network training from partial pre-training.
