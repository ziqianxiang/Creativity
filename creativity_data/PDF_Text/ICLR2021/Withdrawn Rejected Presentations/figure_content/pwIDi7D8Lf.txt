Figure 1: Estimated posterior densities. (a) and (b) are the estimated posteriors of r and p for the negativebinomial model by Gibbs sampling (red), MFVI (gray) and MIVI (orange for qφ and blue for q。,.)，respectively.
Figure 2: Bridge regression of diabetes data. (a) is results of α = 1 (Lasso), (b) α = 0.5 and (c) α = 1.5,inCluding point estimates of β by a frequentist approaCh (green triangle) minimizing the loss funCtion, Gibbssampling or the extrapolated Markov chain (red square), ∣qη,φ of MIVI (blue dot) and OLS (yellow diamond)and the 95% CIs by Gibbs (or the extrapolated Chain) and MIVI.
