Figure 1: Illustration of diffeomorphism integrated over in time applied to shape prior. Right: Targetannotation. Top: Class probabilities over voxel location. B ottom: Thresholded class probabilities(p > 0.5) laid over the input.
Figure 2: Illustration of Diffeomorphic Spatial Template Transformer: a neural network predicts a setof velocity fields V = f(I, S) from an input image I and prior shape S. The fields are integratedto a diffeomorphic transformation grid TΦ(G), which transforms the prior shape into an output O,while preserving topology. The model is trained end-to-end so that output O matches target Y .
