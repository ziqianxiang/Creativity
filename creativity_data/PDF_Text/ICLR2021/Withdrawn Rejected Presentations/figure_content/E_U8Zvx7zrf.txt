Figure 1: Training curves using T = 56 and s = 1 for the delay-tolerant methods, and T = 0 andp = 56 for Local SGD. Test accuracy can be found in Appendix A.3. Best viewed in color.
Figure 2: Left: Vary delay tolerance T = sp with staleness fixed at s = 1. Local SGD uses thesame p as the delay-tolerant methods but has T = 0. Right: Vary staleness s with delay tolerancefixed at T = 56. Results for more configurations of s and p can be found in Appendix A.4.

Figure 6: Vary delay tolerance T for ResNet-56 on CIFAR-10. We set p of Local SGD equivalentto T of other delay-tolerant methods. Left: s = 1 for the OLCO3 variants. Middle: s = 2 for theOLCO3 variants. Right: s = 4 for the OLCO3 variants.
