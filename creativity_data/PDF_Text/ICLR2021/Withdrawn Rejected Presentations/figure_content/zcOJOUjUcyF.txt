Figure 1: Illustration of how a “-model’s (Laine & Aila, 2017) decision boundary changes as theproposed algorithm enlarges the labeled set. The 4 initial pivot points were manually selected.
Figure 2: Performances when the initial AL queries were performed using a randomly initializedmodel. The figure on the right underscores performance gains in consecutive query steps.
Figure 3: Minimum eigenvalues’ distribution in log-scale (Q = 50). Left figure shows how in-formative the minimum eigenvalues are in terms of predicting the number of epochs required forconvergence, and right figure illustrates how the minimum eigenvalues’ distribution concentratestowards zero. Negative linear slope implies (a) exponential convergence as predicted by Eq. 3 and (b)slower convergence rate with increasing labeled set size.
