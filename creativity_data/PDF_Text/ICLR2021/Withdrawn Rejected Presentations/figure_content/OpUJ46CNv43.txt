Figure 1: The overview of MOFA. MOFA consists of four modules. (a) an OLH-based sampler forhyperparameter sampling; (b) a paralleled evaluator; (c) a transformer collapsing OLH performancetable into an OA. (d) an analyzer narrowing down the search space.
Figure 2: The negative log-likelihood of BNN on two different UCI datasets (λ = 1, l = 5, t = 2).
Figure 3: The accuracy of ResNet on CIFAR10 (left) and the accuracy of EEG-based intentionrecognition (right). We set the size of OLH to λ = 1, l = 5, t = 2.
Figure 4: The negative log-likelihood of MOFA with varying λ (left) and MOFA with varying l and t(right) on BNN task. The maximum budgets (number of runs) is fixed to 125.
Figure 5: The GPU resource usage ratio.
Figure 6: Comparison of BO and BO withMOFA initialization for BNN task.
