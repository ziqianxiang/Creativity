Figure 1: Tradeoff of fairness violation vs test error for different baselines on German Credit and Adultdatasets. The desired operation point is the lower left corner where both fairness violation and test error aresmall. FERMI achieves the best fairness vs performance tradeoff across all baselines.
Figure 2: Comparison between FERMI and RFI (Baharlouei et al., 2020). FERMI achieves a better fairness vsperformance tradeoff. Moreover, due to computationally expensive operations like performing singular valuedecomposition (SVD), RFI has poor scalability with the cardinality of sensitive features and target classes.
Figure 4: The application of FERMI to Color MNIST dataset (Li & Vasconcelos, 2019). As expected, FERMIachieves a tradeoff between demographic parity L∞ violation and train error on the colored training samples.
Figure 5: Tradeoff of fairness violation vs test error for ERMI algorithm on COMPAS dataset. The solidand dashed curves correspond to ERMI algorithm under the demographic parity and equality of opportunitynotions accordingly. The left axis demonstrates the effect of changing λ on the test error (red curves), whilethe right axis shows how the fairness of the model (measured by equality of opportunity or demographic parityviolations) depends on changing λ.
