Figure 1: An overview of our proposed Bayesian Deep Metric Learning methoddeep metric learning (Hoffer & Ailon, 2015; Hu et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2017; Lu et al., 2017;Do et al., 2019), and Bayes by Backprop (Blundell et al., 2015). Compared to the BLMNN thatonly considers a linear metric learning, our framework can handle non-linear deep metric learning,which is useful for many real-life applications. Moreover, directly applying the variational Bayeslearning (Wang & Tan, 2018) in deep learning is challenging since it requires sampling from a dis-tribution of the neural network parameters. Instead, we adapt the variational inference by Blundellet al. (Blundell et al., 2015), which allows to efficiently sample the parameters of a Bayes neuralnetworks by using a backpropagation-compatible algorithm. We also theoretically show the robust-ness of our proposed method when working with label noise. The experimental results on severalnoisy data sets show that our novel proposed method can generalize better compared to the linearBLMNN (Wang & Tan, 2018) and the point estimation-based deep metric learning (Hoffer & Ailon,2015; Lu et al., 2017), especially when the noise level increases.
