Figure 1: Model Architecturelength of (T1, T). Given the length of (T1, T) is Te, the length of (0, T1) is sum of Ta, Tb, Tc, andTd, while length of Ta , Tb , Tc, and Td are the same and all equal to Te . 20% of N dimensions arerandomly selected to be masked with a fixed random series in Te . Then, the left 80% original seriesand 20% masked series in Te, as well as all series in Ta to Td, are input series of GenAD. Networkarchitecture of GenAD: GenAD consists of four parts, which are position encoding, 4 hiddenlayers with Time-Series Attention and Multi-Correlation Attention in each layer, linear layer andloss function. Positional encoding is injected into time series in order not to lose the Sequentiality.

Figure 4: Case of latency of anomaly detectionD Impact of number of attention heads and hidden layersThe number of attention heads and hidden layers is important for GenAD. Table 4 shows F1-scoreof GenAD on SMD-1 by varying different attention head numbers and hidden layer numbers. Weobserve that keeping the number of heads constant and changing the number of layers, the 4-layersperform best. The 2-layer Multi-Correlation Attention is weak in represent deep and high-ordercorrelations, which leads to a decrease in F1-score; the 6-layer requires a higher amount of trainingdata, and the model convergence is not as good as the 4-layer. In addition, we try the 12-layerattention, and the model can not converge, which further verifies the analysis results. Similarly,keeping 4-layers unchanged, and changing the number of heads, 12-head attention performs best.
