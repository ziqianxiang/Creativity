Figure 1: ILL'S main idea: decompose the signal into rules that are individually simple but collectivelyexpressive. A lattice is first constructed regardless of the signal (prior-driven), yet the same lattice maybe later used to learn rules (data-driven) of signals from different topics, e.g., music and chemistry.
Figure 2: Basic information-lattice terms: signal, partition, rule, lattice, projection and lifting.
Figure 3: An ILL toy example: (A.) shows the HaSSe diagram of an information lattice R., demarcatedby six levels of e-frontiers. (B.) outlines the full search process along the e-solution path, where thered highlights the activated rules and the blue background shows the marching of the BFS frontier.

Figure 8:	Examples of ILL-generated music rule histograms: first two are context-free rules, the lastone is a context-dependent rule.
Figure 9:	Rules on figured soprano, figured alto, figured tenor, and figured bass. Each histogramshows only the top 20 most probable figures (for brevity), while the entropy is computed from theentire rule. Among the four cases, ILL shows that figured bass (with the smallest entropy) is mosteffective in explaining Bach’s chorales, echoing its importance as a main topic in any standard musictheory curriculum. ILL further reveals figured soprano as the next most effective.
