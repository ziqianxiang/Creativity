Figure 1: Overview of Cross-modality Knowledge Enhancement MechanismExternal Class description(such as label names)3	Methodology3.1	Overview of Cross-modality Knowledge Enhancement MechanismIn this section, we dive into details of proposed Cross-modality Knowledge Enhancement Mecha-nism, which is designed to enhance generalization ability for existing metric-based methods. Con-cretely, this mechanism explicitly enhances class representations (prototypes) by exploring classrelevant semantic information in the external knowledge bank. As described in figure 1, CKEMis divided into two parts, Cross-modality Graph Builder and Knowledge Fusion Model. Cross-modality Graph Builder(CGB) construct cross-modality graph Gc by encoding both auxiliary andtasks-specific class representation into the same feature space. In this feature space, two modal pro-totypes formulate two knowledge graphs, Gt for semantic-based prototypes and Gv for visual-basedprototypes, and these two graphs align to each other during training stage. After that, KnowledgeFusion Model is constructed upon this cross-modal knowledge graph to transfer auxiliary knowledgefrom semantic knowledge bank to visual target prototypes.
