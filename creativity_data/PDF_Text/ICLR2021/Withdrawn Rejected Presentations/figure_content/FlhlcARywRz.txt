Figure 1: Different datasets span diverse semantic and visual domains. We learn to unify the labelspaces of multiple datasets and train a single object detector that generalizes across datasets.
Figure 2: A standard object detection pipeline (a) fits bounding boxes to objects and predicts detec-tion scores over a fixed set of output classes. In single-dataset training, class scores are superviseddirectly from annotations in the dataset. In multi-dataset training (b), a detector learns its own outputspace and links it to the label space of each dataset.
Figure 3: Example differences between an expert designed label space provided as part of the ECCV2020 Robust Vision Challenge (top of each row, blue) and our learned label space (bottom of eachrow, pink). Best viewed on the screen.
