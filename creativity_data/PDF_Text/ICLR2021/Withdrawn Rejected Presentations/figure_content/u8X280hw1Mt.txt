Figure 1: Evolution of the empirical mutual information lower bound fbound during training. We useα = 65536 for EqCo. Results are evaluated with MoCo v2 on ImageNet. Refer to Theorem 1 fordetails. Best viewed in color.
Figure 2: Comparisons with/without EqCo under different number of negative samples (noted byK). Results are evaluated with ImageNet top-1 accuracy using linear evaluation protocol. In EqCo,we set α = 65536 for MoCo and MoCo v2, and α = 256 for SimCLR (except for one data pointwith α = 4096, as noted in the legend). Best viewed in color.
