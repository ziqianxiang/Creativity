Figure 1: Discrimination part and DCLM of a CNN(A predication Zi indicates an activated state ofa neuron Ii of the discrimination part of the CNN and a predication Di indicates an activated stateof a neuron Oi)The DCLM consists of three layers:feature predicate layer, disjunction layer, and decision layer. Thetop layer is feature predicate layer which consists of many nodes. Every node has a predicate Zj (Γ)that expresses a positive action or negative action of features which the jth neuron in the first fullyconnected layer of the discrimination part captures. The predicate Zj (Γ) is defined as follows:'1,	Pk=1 Ti * Wi, 1	>	-b	and Ti	∈	Γ,	⑴Z1 (F)=	<	null,	Pk=1 Ti * Wi,ι	=	-b	and Ti	∈	Γ,	(Y)0,	otherwise.	(100)where j ∈ 1, 2, ..., N, N is the number of the input neurons of the first fully connection layer ofthe discrimination part of the CNN. wi,j is a weight vector between the ith feature map and the jthneuron, bj is the bias of the jth neuron, and ”*” is a convolution operation. ”1” and ”0” denote apositively activated state and a negatively activated state of the neuron respectively. ”null” denotesan inactivated state.
Figure 5: Accuracies of CNNS obtained by the traditiontraining method and the proposed methodcan see that after the 15th epoch, interpretation distances of CNNs from the proposed method tendto converge. The phenomenon indicates that the discrimination part of the CNNs can be explainedby its DCLMs at every epoch after the fifteenth epoch.
