Figure 1: Top row: Cumulative error (CME) trends with respect to tasks; Bottom row: new task error (NTE)trends With respect to tasks. The error bars describe the area between μ + σerr°r and μ 一 σerr°r over 50repetitions. Gaussian smoothing filter with standard deviation of 2 is applied on each trajectory.
