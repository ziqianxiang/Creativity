Figure 1: Aggregate weight change from initialization and output evolution aligns with PathKernel estimate near initialization. Each point represents a particular FC-X , ResNet-20 orWideResNet-20 model pruned at initialization at a range of compression ratios [0.5-3.0], colored byeach pruner. The plotted curve is the continuous-time convergence estimation of Equations 1 and 2.
Figure 2: Aggregate weight change from initialization and output evolution is predicted byTr(Πθ0). Each point corresponds to a particular model pruned at initialization at a range of com-pression ratios [0.5-3.0], colored by model. The line of best fit is estimated on Tr(Πθ0) versus eachaggregate convergence value (kωtk and kf-(X, θt)k) with coefficient of determination inset.
Figure 3: Top-1 accuracy of models pruned by SynFlow and Path Kernel variants. Plotted isthe mean Top-1 accuracy across three seeds for each combination of variant, model, and dataset.
