Figure 1: R must cook a pie for H, by placing flour on the plate to make the pie dough, filling it witheither Apple, Blueberry, or Cherry filling, and finally baking it. However, R does not know whichfilling H prefers, and H is not available for questions since she is doing something else. What shouldR do in this situation? On the right, we show what qualitative reasoning we might want R to use tohandle the situation.
Figure 2: The wormy-apples kitchen environ-ment. H wants an apple, but R might discoverworms in the apple, and have to dispose of itin either of the trash or compost bins.
Figure 3: The cake-or-pie variantof the kitchen environment. H isequally likely to prefer cake or pie.
