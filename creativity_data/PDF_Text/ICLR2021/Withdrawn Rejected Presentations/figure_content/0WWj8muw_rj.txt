Figure 1: Previous results on the strong growth conditionSince the PL inequality holds for strongly convex functions, strongly convex functions with interpola-tion property must satisfy the strong growth condition. Results in (Milne, 2019) demonstrate thatthe quadratic loss function with l2-penalty for a feed-forward neural network with ReLU activationis piecewise strongly convex, with domains of convexity determined by the network architecture,penalty factor, and data. Based on this fact, we may have the following lemma for the strong growthcondition.
