Figure 1: Comparison of DONUT and Dragonnet inpresence of selection bias. Reported is the mean andstandard deviation of ATE on synthetic data as selectionbias is varied (measured by the Kullback-Leibler diver-gence). For each level, both algorithms are run on 100realizations of the datasets. Lower is better.
