Figure 1: Density functions oftheN(0, 1) and Nσm,1ix feature. A new entry is independently sampledfrom the 1-dimensional distribution being either a standard Gaussian or trimodal Gaussian mixture.
Figure 2: Illustration of multiple descent for the dimension-normalized generalization loss L0d as afunction of the dimension d. A local maximum occurs at d if L0d-1 < L0d > L0d+1. The tripletL0d-1, L0d, L0d+1 then form an ascent/descent, which is marked by the shaded area. Local maximaare marked by the dotted lines. Adding a new feature with a Gaussian mixture distribution increasesthe loss, while adding one with a univariate Gaussian distribution decreases the loss. Therefore, aGaussian mixture feature followed by a Gaussian feature creates one ascent/descent.
Figure 3: Illustration of the multiple descent phenomenon for the generalization loss Ld (or thedimension-normalized generalization loss L0d) versus the dimension of data d in the overparameter-ized regime starting from d = n + 8. One can fully control the generalization curve to increase ordecrease as specified by the sequence ∆ = {，↑,，，↑,，...}. Adding a new feature with Gaus-sian mixture distribution increases the loss, while adding one with Gaussian distribution decreasesthe loss.
