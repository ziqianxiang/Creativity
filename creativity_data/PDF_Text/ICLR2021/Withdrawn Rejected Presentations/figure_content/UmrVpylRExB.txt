Figure 1: a -b Respectively, WPT and DT-CWPT filters for j = 2, computed with Q-shift or-thogonal CMFs of length 10 (Kingsbury, 2003). The matrices have been cropped to 11 × 11. bdisplays 32 complex filters, alternatively represented by their real and imaginary parts. 1 and 2are the filters computing Ej%(k) and Ej-(k), respectively. c Convolution kernels Walex [0, k] inAlexNet’s first layer. We used a model from the Torchvision package, pretrained on ImageNet.
Figure 2: 1 First layer of AlexNet; 2 WPT module; 3 DT-RWPT module; 4 DT-CWPT module.
Figure 3: From left to right: {Wwpt [0, k]}, {Wdt-Rwpt [0, k]}, {Wdt-Cwpt [0, k]}k∈{0..63} aftertraining with ImageNet ILSVRC2012. All modules are implemented with a Q-Shift filter (μ = 10).
Figure 4: Evolution of the loss function (left) and top-1 validation error (right) during the first 65training epochs. Validation has been performed by simply resizing the smaller edge of each imageto 224 and extracting a single patch of size 224 × 224 at the center.
Figure 5: Shift-robustness of our models, compared to standard AlexNet. The Kullback-Leibler di-vergence is computed between output vectors and averaged over the whole dataset (50, 000 images).
Figure 6: Mean energies of the 30 feature maps of high-frequency DT-CWPT coefficients, computedover our custom ImageNet test set.
Figure 7: Evolution of the loss function (left) and average error (right) over VOC and COCO vali-dation sets (top and bottom, respectively).
Figure 8: Left: original image from ImageNet2012 (j = 0). Middle: WPT with j = 1. Right:WPT with j = 2. At each step j , the feature maps of wavelet packet coefficients D(jk) are furtherdecomposed into four smaller submatrices D(j4+k1+l), for l ∈ {0 . . 3}, according to (1). To avoidoverexposure, scaling coefficients D(j0) have been set to 0 (top-left images).
Figure 9: Modulus of the complex DT-CWPT coefficients, computed with j = 2: Ej%(k) (left) andEj-(k) (right), for k ∈ {0 . . 15}. Numbering follows the order of Figure 8. To avoid overexposure,scaling coefficients Ej%(0) and Ej-(0) have been set to 0 (top-left images).
