Figure 1: Inverted Residual Block with Squeeze-and-ExcitationIn order to prune this cell we build three groups of convolutions. The first includes the successive’Point-wise linear projections’. The second includes the ’Point-wise expansions’, the ’Depth-wiseconvolutions’ and ’Squeeze-and-Excitation Expansion convolutions’ of the same block. The thirdconsists of the ’Squeeze-and-Excitation Reduction Convolutions’. As mentioned above, for each ofthese three groups we prune their associated channels together.
