Figure 1: Overview of our GNN transfer learning framework: (1) we represent graph as a combination of its1-hop ego-graph and node feature distributions; (2) we design a transferable GNN regarding the capturing ofsuch essential graph information; (3) we establish a rigorous guarantee of GNN transferability based on therequirement on nodes features and difference between graph structures.
Figure 2: Role identification on the Gene dataset. Due to severe label imbalance that vanishes the performancegaps, we only use the 7 brain cancer networks that have a more consistent balance of labels. We visualize thesource graph Go and two example target graphs that are relatively more similar (G5) and different (G6) with Go.
