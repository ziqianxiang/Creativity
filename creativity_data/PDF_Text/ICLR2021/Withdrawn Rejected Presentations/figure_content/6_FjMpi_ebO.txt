Figure 1: A scheme of an image classification model with three target classes. Edges from the samecolor compose a class representation vector.
Figure 2: The matrices show the cosine-similarity between the class vectors of non-fixed (left) andfixed (middle) dot-product maximization models trained on STL-10 dataset. Right is a plot showingthe number of misclassifications as a function of the cosine-similarity between class vectors.
