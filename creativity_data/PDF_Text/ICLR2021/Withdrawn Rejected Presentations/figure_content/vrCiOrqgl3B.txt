The data is generated from (1 - )N (η0, Id) + N (η1 , Id) and thegoal is to estimate η0. Prior work has advocated for using f -divergence GANs (Chao et al., 2018;Wu et al., 2020) for this problem and pointed out inefficiencies of Wasserstein GAN in the presenceof outliers. We show that our robust OT formulation allows us to estimate the uncontaminated meanη0 comparably or better than a variety of f -divergence GANs. We also use this simulated setup tostudy sensitivity to the regularization hyperparameter λ.
