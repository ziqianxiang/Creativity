Figure 1: Ensemble of 3 components with Anti-Distillation: Each component is trained with itsown loss. The ensemble prediction is an average of the predictions of the components (Output 1: inprobability, Output 2: in logits). An additional AD loss is applied either on the logit values (A) ordirectly on the predictions (B).
