Figure 1: This figure depicts our framework. Previously collected state-action pairs are fed into anLSTM embedding layer. Mean and variance statistics are also calculated for each state and action.
Figure 2: This figure depicts the d-dimensional hyper-ellipsoid of safety. ~xr denotes the safest statefor the system and the shaded region is the set of all safe states. Action, ~u(t), is an exploratory action,which may bring the system outside of the hyper-ellipsoid of safety. Action, ~u(t+1) , estimates thatthe system returns to a safe state with probability 1 - .
Figure 3: Fig. 3a depicts a surgical ADMETS device implanted in a rat brain (Ashmaig et al., 2018)(Section 4.1). Fig. 3b depicts the high-dimensional domain for dynamical control (Section 4.2).
Figure 4:	This figure depicts our empirical validation in the ADMETS domain, benchmarkingalgorithm accuracy per time step (Fig. 4a), overall (Fig. 4b), and vs. computation time (Fig. 4c).
Figure 5:	This figure depicts our empirical validation in the high-dimensional domain benchmarkingalgorithm accuracy per time step (Fig. 5a), overall (Fig. 5b), and vs. computation time (Fig. 5c).
Figure 6:	This figure shows the results of our ablation analysis. In the above plots, we set Î» = 0,meaning there is no active learning and only safety is maximized in our objective function. Fig. 6ashows the results in the ADMETS domain and Fig. 5b the results in the high-dimensional domain. Inboth domains, our meta-learned acquisition function is clearly an important component to achieveefficient learning.
