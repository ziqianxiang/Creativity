Figure 1: The technique framework of the pro-posed DQfDD-BC method where IL model rep-resents an imitation learning model.
Figure 2:	The training episode scores of different methods with perfect demonstrations in differentenvironments. The green line is the average sCores of the perfeCt demonstrations.
Figure 3:	Experimental result with imperfect demonstration. (a) The training score of differentmethods in the CartPole-v1 environment. The green line is the average scores of the demonstrations.
Figure 4: Ablation experimental results. The dy-namic demonstration (DQfDD) and expert losswith a behavioral cloning model (DQfD-BC) areadded to the original DQfD method.
