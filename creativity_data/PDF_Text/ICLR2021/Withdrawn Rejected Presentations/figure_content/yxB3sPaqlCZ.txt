Figure 1: (a) The graphical model of data generation process under independence assumption; (b)The graphical model of the case when C is a confounder of the generative factors and (a) can beseen as a special case that C = 0; (C) The intervention operation do(Gk = g∆) which CUt offs alledges pointing to Gk and set its value to g3(d) The intervention operation on representation Z.
Figure 2: Overall structure of our model. (a) We do two interventions on the original image andmake the reconstruct image meet Proposition 1. (b) We use a network W to calculate the weights ofimages from PX and make its weighted distribution match PX. (C) We construct image translationsby intervention.
Figure 3: Spearman rank correlation of existed different disentanglement metrics and ours on twodatasets. The first row/column is our self-supervised image-translation metric, which is highly cor-related with all other disentanglement scores (row/column 2-4).
Figure 4: Qualitative comparison on 3DShapes under correlated factors. The results are from ourmodel and FactorVAE(γ = 40) respectively. (a) The importance of individual feature predicting thevalue of a given generative factor. (b)The result of latent traversal, we fix other features, change onefeature from its 10%-quantile to 90%-quantile. )(b)QueryOUrSZ1 (color)	Z2 (shape)	Z3(background)Figure 5: Qualitative comparison on OxfordFlowers102.
