Figure 1: An high-level overview of NASLib which contains 3 main building blocks that interactwith each other: (1) Search spaces, (2) Optimizers and (3) Trainers/Evaluators.
Figure 2: Results for searching with DARTS, GDAS in the NAS-Bench-201 search space on CI-FAR10 for 4 random seeds each. The performance of the intermediate architectures as queried fromNAS-Bench-201 is plotted on the left axis and the validation error of the one-shot model is shownon the right axis (lighter colors). As NAS-Bench-201 contains the results for architectures on threedifferent datasets we can directly assess how well the architectures found on CIFAR10 (left plot)transfer to CIFAR100 (middle plot) and ImageNet16-120 (right plot). We show the first 50 epochs.

Figure 4: Anytime performance of DARTSand GDAS queried on Nas-Bench 301.
Figure 5: Normal and reduction cell found by DARTS on CIFAR-10.
