Figure 2: Clean accuracy as a function of local for novel-class classification on latent level (left)and feature level (right). Each line indicates a different value of (, δ = 10-5)-CDP at which theencoder was trained. The x-axis shows the -LDP guarantee for the collected training set.
Figure 1: Clean accuracy as a function of local for data collection. Results are shown for theMNIST dataset (top) and Lending Club (bottom), on latent level (left) and feature level (right). Eachline indicates a different value of (, δ = 10-5)-CDP at which the encoder was trained. The x-axisshows the -LDP guarantee for the collected training set.
Figure 3: ‘Semi-private’ accuracy versus localfor data joining (private features shared andjoined on latent level). The x-axis shows the -LDP guarantee for the collected training set.
Figure 4: Private accuracy versus local forlatent-level data collection. Each line indicatesa different value of (, δ = 10-5)-CDP at whichthe encoder was trained. The x-axis shows the-LDP guarantee for the collected training set.
Figure 5: The decision boundary for a classifier that equally separates (in '1-distance) vertices c(i)for i ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4} in 2-dimensional space.
Figure 6: The shaded areas represent, for d = 2 and K = 2, the decision boundaries for: (a) afunction f (∙) that maps the two classes onto opposing vertices; (b) a function f (∙) that maps the twoclasses onto adjacent vertices. Refer to Appendix F for details on the color-coding of shaded areas.
Figure 7: Private accuracy as a function of local for data collection (feature level). Each lineindicates a different value of (, δ = 10-5)-CDP at which the encoder was trained, each point onthe x-axis shows the -LDP guarantee for the collected training set.
