Figure 3: Examples from MNIST-UV dataset created for user verification by handwriting. Each example in thedataset is of size 28 × 28 × 4 and is composed of images of digits 2, 3, 4 and 5 obtained from one writer. Infigure, sub-images are placed in a 2 × 2 grid for clarity. MNIST-UV dataset contains data of 1, 000 writers eachwith 50 training, 15 validation, and 15 test examples. It also contains a separate test set with 1, 000 examplesfrom writers that were not selected for training (one example per writer).
