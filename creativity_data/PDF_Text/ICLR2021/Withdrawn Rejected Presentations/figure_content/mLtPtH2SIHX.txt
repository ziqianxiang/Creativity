Figure 1: Illustration of the proposed method. The mixed input is theaverage of the two inputs; the training target for the averaged input is thecombination of the local soft label (average of the two one-hot targets)and the global soft label (dynamically generated during training).
Figure 3: Soft targets used for training (left subfigure) and the globalsoft labels generated (right subfigure) for a batch of training samples over400 epochs. The x-axis depicts the soft target values and the y-axis is thedistribution mass over the 400 training epochs (from top to down).
