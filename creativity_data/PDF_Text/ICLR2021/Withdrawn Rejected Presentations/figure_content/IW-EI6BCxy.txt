Figure 1: Online incremental meta-learning. We visualize our online incremental meta-learning problemsetting in the above figure using the Incremental Pose Prediction dataset discussed in Section 7. At round t, thecurrent task is to predict the pose of a sofa with a small training set containing several datapoints of the sofa withdifferent orientations. After one epoch of training, we evaluate the few-shot generalization performance on a testdatapoint where the number of shots equals the size the taskâ€™s training set. If the test performance exceeds someproficiency threshold C, we advance to the next task, i.e. predicting the pose of the airplane. Otherwise, we addanother training example of the sofa to the training set and repeat the above process.

Figure 3: We visualize the Siamese network architecture for Contextual MiniImagenet, which takes in a pair of input and reference imagesand classify if they belong to the same class.
