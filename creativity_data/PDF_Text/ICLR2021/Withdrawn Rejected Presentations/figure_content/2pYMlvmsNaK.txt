Figure 1: (a): Test accuracy of SGD with momentum and MDA on CIFAR-10 and (b) on ImageNet.
Figure 2: Reconstruction images for an illustrative knee slice for the same model trained with eachof the 3 methods, using the best model for the seeds for each. The difference image between theground-truth and the noise is shown on the right.
Figure 3: Left: performance of Adam and MDA in NMT on IWSLTâ€™14. The plot shows the trainingloss convergence, while the table provides the BLEU score on the test set. Right: performance ofADAM and MDA on RoBERTa training.
