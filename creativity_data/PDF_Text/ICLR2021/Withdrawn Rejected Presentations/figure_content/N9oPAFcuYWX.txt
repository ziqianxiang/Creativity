Figure 1: The left figure illustrates how accuracy disparity arises by minimizing the global squaredloss. The right figure gives a schematic illustration of the proposed algorithmic framework.
Figure 2: Overall results: R2 regression scores and error gaps in different datasets. Our goal is toachieve high R2 scores with small error gap values (i.e., the points located in the upper-left corner).
