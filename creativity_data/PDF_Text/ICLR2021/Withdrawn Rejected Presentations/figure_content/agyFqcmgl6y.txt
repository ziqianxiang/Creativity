Figure 8: Results of DEAR. Note that the ordering of the representations matches that of the indices in Figure2. On the left We show the traditional latent traversals (the first type of intervention stated in Section 5.1). Onthe right we show the results of intervening on one latent variable from which we see the consequent changesof the others (the first type of intervention). Specifically intervening on the cause variable influences the effectvariables while intervening on effect variables makes no difference to the causes.
Figure 9: Traversal results of baseline methods. We see that (1) entanglement occurs; (2) somefactors are not detected (traversing on some dimensions of the latent vector makes no difference inthe decoded images.) Besides, the generated images from VAEs are blurry.
Figure 10: Traversal results of baseline methods. CausalGAN uses the binary binary factors as theconditional attributes, so the traversals appear some sudden changes. In contrast, We regard the logitof binary labels as the underlying factors and hence enjoy smooth manipulations. In addition, thecontrollability of CausalGAN is also limited, since entanglement still exists. Results of S-VAEs areexplained in Figure 9.
