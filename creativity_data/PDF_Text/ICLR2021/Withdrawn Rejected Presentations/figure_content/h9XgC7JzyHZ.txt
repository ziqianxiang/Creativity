Figure 1: Mean estimation of SDφ (μ,ν) fordifferent values of the latent dimension k.
Figure 2: Mean normalized distances withand without noise for SDφ(μ, V) and Sj2(μ, V)as a function of latent dimension k. Theshaded area shows the standard deviationover 20 runs.
Figure 3: Comparison between normalizedSDφ(μ, V) and normalized Sj2(μ, V) as a func-tion of dimension. The shaded area shows thestandard deviation over 20 runs.
Figure 4: Mean relative computation time(log scale) comparison between the two dis-tances. The shaded area shows shows thestandard deviation over 20 runs.
