Figure 1: Top-label calibration error and accuracy of members (mem) and the whole ensemble (ens)on CIFAR-100 (test set) using LeNet, DenseNet and ResNet. “pre” denotes the calibration whereshared temperature is applied to members before combination. The reliability curves shows thecalibrated members and calibrated ensembles with optimal temperature values.
Figure 2: Reliability curves of weighted combination of 4 calibrated structures, LEN, DSN100,DSN121 and RSN on CIFAR-100. The weightes are estimated by Max LL. Each structure is anensemble of 10 models.
Figure 3: Impact of different region numbers on dynamic temperature annealing in calibration ofensembles of DSN100, DSN121 and RSN.
Figure 4: ACE (calibration) and ECE (top-label calibration) of a perfectly calibrated set of ensemblemembers, as the value of varies.
