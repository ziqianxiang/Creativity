Figure 1: Vertex domain interpretations of vanilla GC, First-Order GC and SoGC. Denote I as thezero-hop aggregator, A the first-hop aggregator and A2 the second-hop aggregator. Nodes in thesame colored ring share the same weights. (a) I and A of vanilla GC share the same weights. (b)First-order GC disentangles I from A. (c) SoGC introduces new weights for A2 in addition.
Figure 2: Visualizing output activation in graph spectrum domain for vanilla GCN, SoGCN, andGRU variants. The test is conducted on a graph from the ZINC dataset. The spectrum is definedas a projection of activation functions on the graph eigenvectors. SoGCN preserved higher-orderspectrum, while vanilla GCN shows over-smoothing. See Appendix F for more visualizations onthe ZINC dataset.
Figure 3: Relations between test MAE and depth or width. Experiments of both (a) and (b) areconducted on synthetic Band-Pass dataset. Each model in (a) has 16 channels per hidden layer withvarying depth. Each model in (b) consists of 16 GC layers with varying width.
