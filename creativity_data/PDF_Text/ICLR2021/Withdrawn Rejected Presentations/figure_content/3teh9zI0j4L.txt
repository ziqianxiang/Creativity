Figure 1: EB-C measurements (with dJS) for comparing non-MLE methods in the synthetic experi-ment. The ScratchGAN model behaves better with model prefix than data prefix.
Figure 2: Left: An example of context-generation pair used for human evaluation, the fixed-lengthprompt part is underlined, and the remaining part of the context is either from PD or PM. A screenshotof our web interface is included in Figure 3 (Appendix B). Right: The distribution of scores forgeneration from model or data prefix of length 60.
