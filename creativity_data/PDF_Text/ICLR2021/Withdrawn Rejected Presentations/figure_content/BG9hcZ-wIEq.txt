Figure 1: Illustration of our two-stream pseudo-siamese network. Color code used: light green =Conv+ReLU, purple = max pooling, green = bilinear pooling, yellow = fully connected layers. TheRGB stream uses original images as input, and captures subtle difference like contrast difference,unnatural pixels from the RGB features. The noise stream first obtains noise feature maps througha SRM filter layer, and leverages the noise features to provide additional evidence for adversarialimage detection. Bilinear pooling combines the spatial co-occurrence features extracted by the twostreams. Finally, passing the combined features through a decision network composed of fullyconnected layers and a softmax layer, the network generates the predicted label and determineswhether the input image is adversarial or not.
Figure 2: The SRM filter kernels used in our work to extract local noise features. In grayscaleimages, we only use the left kernel to generate SRM images.

Figure 4: Some ROC curves of detection methods on CIFAR-10. We choose to display the ROCcurves of detection methods on three different attacks. We can intuitively see that our method (RGB-N) is better than other methods in all cases.
Figure 5: ROC curves of detection methods on MNIST. Due to the curves of RGB and RGB-Ncoincide with the coordinate axes, they are not displayed.
