Figure 1: Left panel: example of piece-wise constant function in change point literature. Middlepanel: the oracle Q-function on the feature-action space. Right Panel: the green curve presents theoracle Q-function Q(x, π(x)) under policy π(x) = x; and the red curve is the fitted mean value byDJQE and the pink dash line corresponds to the 95% confidence bound.
Figure 2: The box plot of the estimated values of the optimal policy under the proposed DJQE andtwo kernel-based methods for Scenario 1-4.
Figure 3: Illustration of multilayer perceptron with two hidden layers and three nodes each hiddenlayer. Here μ is the input, A(I) and b(I) denote the corresponding parameters to produce the lineartransformation for the (l - 1)th layer.
Figure 4: The bias of the estimated value and the computational cost (in minutes) under the DJQEwith different initial number of intervals (m) when n = 100 in Scenario 1.
