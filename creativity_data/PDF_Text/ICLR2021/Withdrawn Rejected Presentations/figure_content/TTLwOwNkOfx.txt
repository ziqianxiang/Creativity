Figure 1: Our method learns hyperbolic representations of subvolumes of 3D voxel grid data,through a 3D hyperbolic VAE with a gyroplane convolutional layer. We enhance the VAE trainingobjective with a self-supervised hierarchical triplet loss that facilitates learning hierarchical structurewithin the VAEâ€™s hyperbolic latent space.
Figure 2: Sampled 2D slices from a 3D volume in our biologically-inspired toy dataset. The top rowshowcases the raw input data, and the bottom row showcases the ground truth segmentation.
Figure 3: Leftmost image is a partial slice from a 3D cryo-EM image. The middle box showssegmentation from our best hyperbolic model, the rightmost box shows segmentation from our bestEuclidean model. The segmentations in each box correspond to clustering using 2 vs. 4 classes.
Figure 4: Sampled 2D slices from two examples of 3D volumes in our irregular biologically-inspiredtoy dataset, showing large variance in shapes across input. For each 3D volume example, the toprow showcases the raw input data, and the bottom row showcases the ground truth segmentation.
