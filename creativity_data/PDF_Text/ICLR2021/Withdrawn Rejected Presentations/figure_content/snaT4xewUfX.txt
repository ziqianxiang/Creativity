Figure 1: Variational vs. True smoothing posterior density on the 1-D simulated dataset. The toprow compares the variational approximation with the true smoothing density. The bottom-left plotshows the ELBO as a function of epochs of the training algorithm. We also compute the L1 distancebetween the VB and true smoothing density over 20 sample paths of both training and test countobservations as the training progresses and plot the 10th, 50th and 90th quantile in the bottom-middle figure. The bottom-right plot depicts that 95% of the test count observations are within the5th and 95th quantile of the simulated counts, where counts are simulated using the learned VBSPSDE for that test sample path of count observations.
Figure 2: VBSP smoothing posterior density for Bike Sharing Data. The left plot shows theELBO as the training progresses. The second and third plots depict the empirical VBSP densitycomputed on a test sample path of count observations, using 1000 simulated sample paths of thelearnt variational smoothing SDE. In the right plot, we use the same test sample path of countobservation, compute the VBSP using the trained drift and demonstrate that most count observations(of the test sample path) ( 70%) lie within the 97.5th and 2.5th quantile of the simulated counts.
Figure 3: Multivariate VB smoothing posterior density: The first two rows of Figure 3 show themarginals of the (empirical) VBSP density using the trained drift coefficient for a given test samplepath of count observations. The bottom-left figure plots the ELBO value as a function of the numberof training epochs. Then, for a test sample path of count observations, the right hand plot shows thatmore than 95% of these observations are within the 95% confidence interval of the simulated countobservations generated from the trained 4-dimensional VBSP density computed for that test path.
