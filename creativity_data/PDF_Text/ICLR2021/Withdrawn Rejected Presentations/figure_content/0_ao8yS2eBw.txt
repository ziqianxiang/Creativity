Figure 1: Example of MaxCut MDP trainsitions. In the transition sequence, the upper left andcenter node are colored in •, the right and lower left node are colored in •, resulting in the cumulativereward 3.
Figure 2: Backup. After estimating the reward of the expanded node, we iteratively update therewards of its ancestors.
