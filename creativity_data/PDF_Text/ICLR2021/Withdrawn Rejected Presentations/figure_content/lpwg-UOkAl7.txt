Figure 1: The spectral reconstruction results and their SAD values corresponding to different pixelsobtained by a GAN model. Left: The locations of anomaly pixels and background pixels in the colorcomposites. Middle and Right: The thick solid line and thin dotted line correspond to the spectralvector curves at the same location in the original HSI and the reconstructed HSI, respectively. Thesmaller the corresponding SAD values indicate that the spectral vectors are more similar, which alsomeans that the reconstruction errors are smaller.
