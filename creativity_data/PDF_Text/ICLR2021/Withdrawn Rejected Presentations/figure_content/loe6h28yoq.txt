Figure 1: An example to illustrate individual certification vs. joint certification. Suppose rNNcorrectly classifies the two testing examples without attack. An attacker can poison 3 trainingexamples. The attacker can make rNN misclassify each testing example individually. However,the attacker cannot make rNN misclassify both testing examples jointly.
Figure 2:	(a)-(b) comparing kNN and rNN with state-of-the-art methods. (c)-(d) comparingindividual certification with joint certification for rNN.
Figure 3:	Impact of k ((a)-(b)) and r ((c)-(d)) on the certified accuracy of kNN and rNN.
