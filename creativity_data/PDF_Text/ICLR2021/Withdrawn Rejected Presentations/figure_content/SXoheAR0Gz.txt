Figure 1: (a) Run time vs. input size for target range R0,29 with {Sn}2n2=12 datasets, and (b) runtime vs. output size for S22 . PFT runs faster than the competitors if the output size is small enough(< 10%) compared to the input size. Note that PFT consistently outperforms the pruned FFT.
Figure 2: Run time vs. output size results for (a) Urban Sound dataset and (b) Air Conditiondataset. PFT outperforms the competitors regardless of the fact that the input size is not a power of2 (N = 28 × 53) or even it has a large prime factor (N = 5 × 3947).
Figure 3: Top-20 anomalous points detected in Air Condition time-series data, where each red dotdenotes a detected anomaly position. Note that replacing FFT with PFT does not change the resultof the detection, still reducing the overall time complexity.
