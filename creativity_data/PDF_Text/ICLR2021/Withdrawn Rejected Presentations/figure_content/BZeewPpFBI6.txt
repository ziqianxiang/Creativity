Figure 1: The architecture of the proposed dual adversarial training (DAT) method. Our DAT con-sists of five components: the domain-related feature extractor Fd is used to capture class-invariantfeatures, the class-related feature extractor Fs aims to learn domain-invariant features, the multino-mial task discriminator Dt identifies the label of the input feature, the binary domain discriminatorDd differentiates between the source features and the target features, and the classifier C is used toconduct the classification. Lc(Fd, Fs, C) is the cross-entropy loss, Ld(Fs, Dd) and Lcd(Fd, Dt) areadversarial losses that guide the domain-invariant feature generation and the class-invariant featuregeneration, respectively.
