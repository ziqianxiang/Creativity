Figure 1: Architecture of ResNet18-FPN and the searched network of MSNAS-R18. MSNAS-R18has different stride values of blocks in the encoding network and a more flexible feature utilizationstrategy. For simplification, P6 of FPN is not included in the figure and only three detection headsare presented.
Figure 2: Figure (a) shows the basic architecture of stride selection in the super-net for featuregeneration. The path represents one of its sub-architectures. The colored nodes are correspondingoutput features of the encoder network. Figure (b) illustrates the feature utilization search. Theformula in Figure (b) represents the rule to assign RoIs to multi-scale features in FPN. We usedifferent ranges of k to distinguish different object groups as well as their detection heads. The solidlines show an example of feature utilization strategies. The dotted lines imply each detection headcan select any of the output features.
Figure 3: Comparison of the evolutionary process in the ablation of constraints. Itâ€™s easy to observethat the evolutionary process converges faster with constraints.
