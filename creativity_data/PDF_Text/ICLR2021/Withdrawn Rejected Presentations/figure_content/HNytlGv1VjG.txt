Figure 1: (a): An example showing AutoLabel assigning different labels to augmented images(e.g., by AugMix (Hendrycks et al., 2020)) based on their transformation distances to the clean image.
Figure 2: Calibration across corruption severities on three datasets. Severity 0 denotes clean data.
Figure 3: Effects of AutoLabel for adversarialtraining on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100. Each model istested on the '∞ norm based white-box PGD attacksgenerated by 50 iterations and 3 random restarts. TheX axis is the maximum '∞ norm. 0 denotes the cleandata.
