Figure 1: Examples of images (feature maps) withdifferent group representation ρ. Both images un-dergo 90deg rotation. The upper row is an RGBimage whose 3-channel colors remain the samewhen the image is rotated. The lower row is a gra-dient image whose two channel value should berotated in the same way when the gradient imageThe group representation of RGB is ρ(g) ≡ 1is rotated.
Figure 2: Illustrations for (10) for g = (0, 1) at left and g = (1, 1) at right. Red, light yellow andgreen denotes negative, 0 and positive values, respectively.
Figure 3: Visualization of FILTRA filter examples. Based on a same weight kernel K, we generatefilters K0C→Nreg, K0D→Nreg, KkC→N reg and KjD,kN→reg. In this example we set j = 1, k = 1, N = 8. Thetwo-columns of matrix βk is splitted as βk0 and βk1 for visualization. Red, light yellow and greendenotes negative, 0 and positive values, respectively. Please view this figure in color.
