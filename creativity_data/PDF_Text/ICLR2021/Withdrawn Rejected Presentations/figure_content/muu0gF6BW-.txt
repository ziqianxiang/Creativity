Figure 1: The illustration of ODE-RNN and our methods. The top left is ODE-RNN showing theinterpolation curve jump at the observation points. The top right is the smoothed output by our CSSC,where the jump is eliminated, and the output strictly passes the observation. The bottom left showsthe ODE-RNN ’s discontinuous output caused by the hidden state discontinuity. The bottom rightshows that our hidden CSSC is applied to the hidden state of ODE-RNN, resulting in the smoothhidden state and so as the output.
Figure 2: The visual result for Sinuous Wave dataset with 10 observations. (a) shows the comparisonof CSSC against other methods; (b) demonstrates the effect of C to smooth the o; (c) shows the hiddenCSSC output is smooth because its unsmooth hidden state h is smoothed into h.
Figure 3: The visual result for MuJoCo. We visualize part of the interpreted trajectory with 5 framesinterval. 10% frames are observed out of 100 frames. The observation is highlighted with white box.
Figure 4: The visual result for Moving MNIST. The observation is indicated in white box. Thecomparison of discontinuity is highlighted in red box.
Figure 5: The interpolation MSE of CSSC with different α of MuJoCo dataset. The curve is the 4-thdimension of the hopper,s state.
