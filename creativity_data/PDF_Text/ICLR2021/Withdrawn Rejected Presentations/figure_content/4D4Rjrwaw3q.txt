Figure 2: Additional problems: Pyomo (covering Knapsack, P-median and others), Sequential-Fastgames (presented as heatmaps due to the high noise: GuessWho, War, Batawaf, Flip). Rockets,SimpleTSP, PowerSystems, and LSGO plots are available in Appendix B, Figures 7, and 8. Pyomoand SimpleTSP include discrete variables. Pyomo includes constraints. Rocket, PowerSystems, Se-quentialFastGames are based on open source simulators and are already merged from OptimSuite toNevergrad.
Figure 1: Average normalized loss and heatmap for YABBOB. Additional plots for High-dimensional (HD), NoisyHD, and Large budgets are available in Appendix B. Other variants in-clude parallel, differences of budgets, and combinations of those variants, with excellent results forABBO (see Nevergradâ€™s dashboard https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/nevergrad/allxps/list.html, publicly visible with anonymized entries, for the part of our code whichis already merged).
Figure 3: Results on the MuJoCo testbeds. Dashed lines show the standard deviation. Compared tothe state of the art in (Wang et al., 2020), with an algorithm adapted manually for the different tasks,we get overall better results for Humanoid, Ant, Walker. We get worse results for Swimmer (couldmatch if we had modified our code for the 3 easier tasks as done in (Wang et al., 2020)), similarfor Hopper and Cheetah: we reach the target for 5 of the 6 problems (see text). Runs of Shiwacorrespond to the improvement of Shiwa due to chaining, as explained in Table 2.
Figure 5:	ABBO vs specific families of optimization algorithms (DE, and BO in the high-dimensional case) on Cigar, Hm, Ellipsoid, Sphere functions. Not all run algorithms are mentioned,for short. Bayesian optimization (Nevergrad uses NogUeira (2014-)), often exploring boundariesfirst, is outperformed in high dimension (Wang et al., 2020).
Figure 6:	Up: experiments for the parallel multimodal setting PARAMULTIMODAL. Budget up to100000, parallelism 1000, Ackley+Rosenbrock+DeceptiveMultimodal+Griewank+Lunacek+Hm.
Figure 7:	Additional problems (1): Rocket (26 continuous variables, budget up to 1600, sequentialor parallelism 30) and SimpleTSP (10 to 1000 decision variables).
Figure 8:	Additional problems (2): PowerSystems (1806 to 9646 neural decision variables) andLSGO (mix of partially separable, overlapping, shifted cases as in Li et al. (2013)).
