Figure 1: The overview of the proposed framework. The blue dot line (or red dash line) is onlyenabled in the training (or inference) stage.㊉ denotes the vector concatenation. Linear representsthe linear transformation and Plan denotes the self-planning module (discussed in Section 3.3).
Figure 2: (a) a sample symbolic graph of equation “ax+by = m”；(b) the edge-enhanced LeVi graph ofthe same equation; (C) an illustrative sample of the CSKG under topic poultry; (d) the correspondingedge-enhanced Levi graph of CSKG. The red dash arrows represent the reverse edges and the bluedot arrows represent the self-loop edges. Mul and Add denote the multiply and addition operations.
