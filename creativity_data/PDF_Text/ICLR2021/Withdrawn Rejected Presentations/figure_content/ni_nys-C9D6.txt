Figure 1: (a) Treeverse algorithm for optimal checkpointing. (Griewank, 1992) η(τ, δ) ≡(τT+δ)! is the binomial function. (b) Bennett's time space trade-off scheme for reverse Com-puting. (Bennett, 1973; Levine & Sherman, 1990) P and Q are computing and uncomputingrespectively. The pseudo-code is defined in Listing. 3.
Figure 2: The flow chart for reversible (a) if statement and (b) while statement. “pre” and “post”represents precondition and postcondition respectively. The assersion errors are thrown to the hostlanguage instead of handling them in NiLang.
Figure 3: Absolute runtimes in seconds for computing the objective (-O) and Jacobians (-J). (a)GMM with 10k data points, the loss function has a single output, hence computing Jacobian is thesame as computing gradient. ForwardDiff data is missing due to not finishing in limited time. TheNiLang GPU data is missing because we do not write kernel here. (b) Bundle adjustment.
Figure 4: Peak memory of running the original and the reversible GMM program. The labels are(d, k) pairs.
Figure 5: The Petersen graph has 10 vertices and 15 edges. We want to find a minimum embeddingdimension for it.
Figure 6: Round-off errors in the final axes of planets as a function of the number of time steps.
Figure 7: Compiling the body of the complex valued log function defined in Listing. 5.
