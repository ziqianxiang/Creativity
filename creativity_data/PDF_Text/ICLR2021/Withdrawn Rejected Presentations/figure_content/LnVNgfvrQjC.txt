Figure 1: Architecture overview of the proposed CAFENet. The feature extractor or encoder extracts featurefrom the image, the segmentator generates a segmentation mask based on metric learning, and the edge detectordetects semantic boundaries using the segmentation mask and query features.
Figure 2: Network architecture overview of proposed CAFENet. ResNet-34 encoder E(I)〜E⑷ extractsmulti-level semantic features. The Segmentator module generates a segmentation prediction using query fea-ture from E(4) and prototypes Pfg, PBG from support set features. Small bottleneck blocks S(O) 〜 S(4)transform the original image and multi-scale features from encoder blocks to be more suitable for edge detec-tion. The attention maps generated from segmentation prediction are applied to multi-scale features to localizethe semantically related region. Decoder D(O)〜 D(4) takes attentive multi-scale features to give edge predic-tion.
Figure 3: Comparison between (a) High-dimensional feature matching used in (Dong & Xing, 2018; Wanget al., 2019) and (b) split-wise feature matching in MSMRto overfit due to the massive number of parameters in feature vectors. To get around this issue,We propose a novel regularization method, multi-split matching regularization (MSMR). In MSMR,high-dimensional feature vectors are split into several low-dimensional feature vectors, and the met-ric learning is conducted on each vector split as Fig. 3b.
Figure 4: An example of activation map of (Yosinski et al., 2015) before and after pixel-wise semantic attention(warmer color has higher value). As seen, the attention mechanism makes encoder side-outputs attend to theregions of the target object (horse in the figure).
