Figure 2: Illustration of the policy model. Theencoder embeds the observed data Xj into thestate Sj. An action at can be selected by thedecoder according to the given state St at eachtime step t.

Figure 5: Illustration of the Transformer encoder. The encoder embeds the observed data Xj of eachvariable j into the state Sj. Notation block@3 denotes three blocks here.
Figure 6: Illustration of the LSTM decoder. At each time step, it maps the state ^t to a distributionover action space A := {aÎ¹,...,ad}, then an action (variable) can be selected randomly accordingto the distribution.
