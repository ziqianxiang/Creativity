Figure 1: Example of different feature distributions. (a) Overall entity feature distributions of two KGs,i.e., AE. Blue points denote entities in G1 and orange ones are entities in G2 . The two distributionsare nearly uniformly distributed and almost aligned (based on the EEA model RDGCN (Wu et al.,2019)). (b) The head entity feature distributions of relation “genre”. The two distributions areonly aligned partially. (c) Head entity feature distributions conditioned on “genre”, i.e., AEh|ri(based on NeoEA with RDGCN as EEA model, the same below). Two conditioned distributions arealigned as expected. (d) The head entity distributions conditoned on three different relations: “genre”(colors: <blue,orange>), “writer” (colors: <purple,pink>), “brithPlace” (colors: <green,red>). Thedistributions corresponding to the first two relations are overlapped, while a clear decision boundarybetween them and the last one is observed. (e) Triple feature distributions conditioned on relations“artist” (colors: <blue,orange>) and “musicalArtist” (colors: <purple,pink>), respectively. Thedistributions referred to sub-relation “musicalArtist” are covered by those corresponded to “artist”.
Figure 2: The architecture of NeoEA. The solid lines denote the forward propagation, while the dottedlines represents the backward propagation. The architecture consists of three decoupled modules:(1) Entity alignemnt module, in which the EEA model is unaware of the existence of other modules.
