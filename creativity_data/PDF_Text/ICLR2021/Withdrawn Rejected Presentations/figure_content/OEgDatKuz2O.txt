Figure 1: The mediator has the same conditional probability as the source and the same marginalprobability as target. According to Theorem 1, we will have t (h) ≤ m(h) for any hypotheses hsince the last two terms are zero.
Figure 2: Inter-twining moons example. (Left) Samples from the source and target distributionswhere there is a 40° rotation in target; (Right) EMTL result on the target test data under differentiterations and ηs. Small η results in a local optima. Larger η allows the objective function to escapefrom the ps (y| x) = pt (y| x) constraint which is wrong in this case.
Figure 3: In inter-twinning moons example, as η increase, both AUC and accuracy will increase.
