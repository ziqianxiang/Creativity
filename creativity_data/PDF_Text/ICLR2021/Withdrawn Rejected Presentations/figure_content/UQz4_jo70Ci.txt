Figure 1: Tracking results on the challenges of three aspects: scale variation (book), similar dis-tractors (crabs) and fast motion (dinosaur). Compared with other two state-of-the-art trackers, ourtracker (SiamCAN) performs better.
Figure 2: Illustration of the proposed tracking framework, consisting of feature extraction, cross-attention module and anchor-free network. In the feature extraction part, the features of the third,fourth and fifth blocks are sent to the cross-attention module. The cross-attention module uses thechannel attention from the template branch to combine with the feature from the search branch. Theright side shows the classification and anchor-free regression network, which is taken to localize thetarget and predict the size of bounding box.
Figure 3: Success and precision plots on UAV123.
Figure 4: Comparision of different label assignments. Both 2 and 4 predict accurate boundingbox,but the latter focuses more on the target center.
Figure 5: Visualization of confidence map. The left: the performance of tracker 1 and tracker 3 .
Figure 6: Success and precision plots on OTB100.
Figure 7: Comparisons on OTB-100 with challenges: Deformation, Background Clusters, ScaleVariation and Out-of-Plane Rotation. Our SiamCAN performance ranks in top two.
Figure 8: Comparisons on UAV123 with challenges: Scale Variation, Similar Object, Fast Motionand Low Resolution. Our SiamCAN performance ranks in top two.
