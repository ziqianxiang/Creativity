Figure 1: A UMAP (McInnes et al., 2018) of features extracted from CIFAR-10 using C2D (upperrow) vs. DivideMix (lower row) for 20% and 90% noise at the end of warm-up stage, as well asself-supervised pre-training. Colors show ground-truth label.
Figure 2:	Training time ROC-AUC scores (left) and effective noise rates. C2D demonstrates higherinitial score, faster rise, and more stable decrease in effective noise level.
Figure 3:	Loss distribution of clean and noisy samples after warm-up on CIFAR-100 with 80% noisefor DivideMix, DivideMix with ImageNet pre-training, and C2D. As seen in the zoom-in, ImageNetpre-training damages the seperability whereas self-supervised pre-training (C2D), improves it.
