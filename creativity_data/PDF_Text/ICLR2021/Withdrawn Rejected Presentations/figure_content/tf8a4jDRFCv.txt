Figure 1: LAF functions with randomly generated parametersIt should be emphasized at this point that the primary purpose of LAF is not to provide a uniformrepresentation of different standard aggregators as displayed in Table 1, but to enable a continuum ofintermediate and hybrid aggregators. Figure 1 shows the graphs of 4 different randomly generatedLAF functions over the unit square [0, 1] × [0, 1], i.e., evaluated over sets of size 2. Parametersα, . . . , γ were randomly sampled in the interval [0, 1]; parameters b, d, f, h are randomly sampledfrom the integers 0, . . . , 5, and a, c, e, g are obtained as 1/i with i a random integer from 0, . . . , 5.

Figure 3: Test performances for the synthetic experiment with integer scalars on increasing testset size. The x axis of the figures represents the maximum test set cardinality, whereas the y axisdepicts the MAE error. The dot, star, diamond and triangle symbols denote LAF, DeepSets, PNA,and LSTM respectively.

Figure 5: Scatter plots of the MNIST experiment comparing true (x axis) and predicted (y axis)values with 50 as maximum test set size. The target aggregations are max (up-left), inverse count(up-right), median (bottom-left) and kurtosis (bottom-right).
