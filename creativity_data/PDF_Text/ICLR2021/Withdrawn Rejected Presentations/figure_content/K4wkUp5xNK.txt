Figure 1: (a) Causal structure of Model 1. (b) A more practical extension of Model 1, where X1 and X2 arenot directly observed and O is their observation. (c) A general version of (b), where we assume there existmultiple unobserved variables. Each of them could be either a parent, a child of Y , or has no connection withY . Grey nodes denote observed variables and white nodes represent unobserved variables.
Figure 2: (a) General causal structure over {Xi , Y , O, E}, where the arrow from Xi to O is a must-haveconnection and the other four might not be necessarily. (b) 12 possible causal structures from (a).
Figure 3: Left: Comparison of the raw data X and the mean of X inferred through the learnedinference model in the Nonlinear case. Right: Comparison of the raw data X and the sampledpoints X using the reparameterization trick in the Nonlinear case. The comparisons clearly showthat the inferred X is equal to X up to a permutation and pointwise transformation.
Figure 4:	Comparison of the inferred X1 and X2 in terms of their final performance.
Figure 5:	Left: Energy plot of Xi = fχι (g(X)). Right: Energy plot of X = fχ>(g(X)). Notethat, here Φχi is denoted by fχi .
