Figure 1: TemporalPointConv operates on unsynchronized sets of spatio-temporal samples by ap-plying two point-based convolutional operators in sequence, each of which exploits separate notionsof either spatial or temporal locality.
Figure 2:	Validation performance throughout the training process averaged across four runs.
Figure 3:	Input Distribution Comparison. 3(a) shows the probability of selecting each timestepas input during training for each distribution type. 3(b) depicts the relative performance of networkstrained on each input distribution when evaluated across all four. Note that Y-axes are scaled by row.
Figure 4:	Query Distribution Comparison. 4(a) shows the probability of selecting each timestepas a query during training. 4(b) shows loss on queries by timestep up to t = 15 for networks trainedon each query distribution.
Figure 5: ROC curves of each modelâ€™s prediction error thresholding anomaly detection performance.
Figure 6: Combined distance function experiment results.
