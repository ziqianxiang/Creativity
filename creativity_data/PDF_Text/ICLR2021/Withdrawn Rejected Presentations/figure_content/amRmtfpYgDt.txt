Figure 4:	In (a)-(c), the red areas are goals reachable by the orange agent. In (d) any point withinthe blue frame is a feasible goal (purple balls) and the rest are unfeasible (black triangles).
Figure 5:	Learning curves of RERL, HGG, HER, SR, AutoGG, EMDQN and POINT on variousenvironments, where the solid curves depict the mean, the shaded areas indicate the standard devia-tion, and dashed horizontal lines show the asymptotic performance. Several curves are omitted dueto page limitations. A full version is deferred to Appendix E.1.
