Figure 4: Dynamic Prototye Refinement (DPR) performance with respect to iterations MWe evaluate the influence of DPR iteration count M with respect to model performance in the 5-way 1-shot setting and report respective test accuracies in Figure 4. We observe similar behaviourfor both datasets considered (miniImageNet and tieredImageNet), with performance improving and11Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2021455456457458459460461462463464465466467468
