Figure 1: (a) The overall architecture of HiFiSinger, which consist of a parallel acoustic model and aparallel vocoder. (b) The sub-frequency GAN on mel-spectrogram. (c) The multi-length GAN onwaveform.
Figure 2: Music score representation.
Figure 3: The mel-spectrogram comparisons for SF-GAN. (a) HiFiSinger w/o SF-GAN generatesover-smoothing mel-spectrogram, and after adding SF-GAN, the mel-spectrogram generated by (b)HiFiSinger have more high frequency details and closer to the (c) Ground truth.
Figure 4: The mel-spectrogram comparisons for ML-GAN. It can be seen that there is a glitch inthe long vowel generated by (a) HiFiSinger w/o ML-GAN (use a single length of 1s discriminator),while (b) HiFiSinger can generate stable long vowel similar to the (c) Ground truth, thanks to thefiner granularity modeling of long vowel by multi-length discriminators.
Figure 5: The mel-spectrograms comparisons of HiFiSinger w/ and w/o pitch and V/UV, where“silence” and “unvoiced” represent the silence frames and unvoiced frames.
Figure 6: The mel-spectrograms of singing voice with the pitch of the normal scale, down 4 semitonesand up 4 semitones.
Figure 7: The mel-spectrograms of singing voice with 0.75x, 1.00x and 1.25x speed respectively. Itcan be seen that HiFiSinger can adjust the singing voice speed from 0.75x to 1.25x smoothly, withstable and almost unchanged pitch.
