Figure 2: Symmetries in 2D PRinjective when m1 ≥ 2n1 - 1 and m2 ≥ 2n2 - 1, up to three intrinsic symmetries: 1) 2D translation1Interestingly, the more train samples one gathers, the more serious the problem is.

Figure 5: Visualization Comparisonwith ALM4 Related WorkAs alluded to above, re-cently there have been in-tensive research efforts onsolving inverse problemsusing deep learning (Mc-Cann et al., 2017; Lucaset al., 2018; Arridge et al.,2019). The end-to-end ap-proach is attractive not onlybecause of its simplicity,but also because (i) we donot even need to know theTable 3: Test error comparison with iterative method for randomlysampled 1000 fashion mnist test images containing shift flipping sym-metryMethod	MSEALM	0.299
