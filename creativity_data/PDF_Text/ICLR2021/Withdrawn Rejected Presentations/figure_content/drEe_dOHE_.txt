Figure 1: Mode collapse in the view of mapping: the left is the source distribution and the right istarget. (a) mode missing in grey; (b) mode imbalance as the green part is less mapped from source.
Figure 2: The InvertGAN: generator G maps random samples from source standard MD Gaussianto target ones and F inverts the target sample back to a source sample obeying MD Gassuian.
Figure 3: Results visualization for Ring, by comparing VEEGAN and InvertGAN under differentGaussian losses as detailed in Sec. 4.2 after training 24K mini-batches. Both 1D and MD Wasser-stein distance are used. The first column is the inverse {Zi} of real data {xi}, which has the samenumber of points for each color (i.e. mode). The red box in the third row represents that 1D Gaussianloss may cause some modes to gather and affect the balance. The second column refers to randomsampling based on standard Gaussian Pz, which maps to different modes. The third column is therandom generation result, and the fourth column is the generation percentage of each mode.
Figure 4: Comparison of different Gaussian distribution loss on the Ring synthetic data.
Figure 5: Generations of grid data given poor initialization. Compared with 1D Gaussian loss, MDGaussian loss can overcome the mode collapse after enough training steps (i.e. batch iteration). Thecomparison on Ring is given in appendix which similarly shows the advantages of our methods.
