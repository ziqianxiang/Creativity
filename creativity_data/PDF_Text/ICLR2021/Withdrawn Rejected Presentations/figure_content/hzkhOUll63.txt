Figure 1: For the same magnitude of step taken (same ball radius), a larger norm of parameters leadsto a smaller change in angle.
Figure 2: Norm of parameters for 3 different layers when training a convolutional network on Ci-far10 and a fully connected network on Mnist with SGD.
Figure 3: Î¶t(S) when training a convolutional network on Cifar10 and a fully connected network onMnist.
Figure 4: Norm of the gradient when training a convolutional network on Cifar10 and a fully con-nected network on Mnist.
Figure 5: Norm of the parameters (layer 3) when training a convolutional network on Cifar10 and afully connected network on Mnist.
Figure 6: The bound obtained from the euclidean distance is much worst than the bound obtainedfrom our normalized distance. The network is a 6-layer fully connected network and the training setis MNIST.
