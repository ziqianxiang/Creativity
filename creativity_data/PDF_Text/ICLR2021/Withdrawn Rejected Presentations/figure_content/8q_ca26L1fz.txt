Figure 1: The structural rolesof link (v1 , v2 ) and link (v1 , v3 )are different, but GAE will assignequal probabilities to them.
Figure 2: When we predict (v1 , v2 ), we will label these two nodes differently from the rest, so that a GNN isaware of the target link when computing v1 and v2â€™s embeddings. Similarly, when predicting (v1 , v3), nodesv1 , v3 will be labeled differently. The aggregated embedding of v1 , v2 in the left graph will be different from theaggregated embedding of v1, v3 in the right graph, enabling GNNs to predict (v1, v2) and (v1, v3) differently.
