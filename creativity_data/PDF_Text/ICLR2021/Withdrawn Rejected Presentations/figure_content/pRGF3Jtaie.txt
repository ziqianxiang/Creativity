Figure 1: Average relative error of the estimated metrics, for each combination of model-under-test(M-MNIST, M-FashionMNIST, & M-MNIST-ES) and metric set. Curves are smoothed over a slidingwindow of 10 oracle queries (iterations). Plotting mean and standard error over 3 repetitions. Bettermethods are those that converge faster to zero (Best seen in color).
Figure 2: Average relative error of the estimated metrics, for each combination of model-under-test(M-CIFAR10, M-SVHN, & M-CIFAR10-ES) and metric set. Curves are smoothed over a slidingwindow of 10 oracle queries (iterations). Plotting mean and standard error over 3 repetitions. Bettermethods are those that converge faster to zero (Best seen in color).
Figure 3:	The accuracy of the BNN, for each combination of model-under-test (M-MNIST, M-FashionMNIST, & M-MNIST-ES) and metric set. Curves are smoothed over a sliding window of 5oracle queries (iterations). Plotting mean and standard error over 3 repetitions (Best seen in color).
