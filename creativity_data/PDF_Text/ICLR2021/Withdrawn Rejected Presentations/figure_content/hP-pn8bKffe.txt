Figure 8: Application of BTGM in the context of energy management: generating consumptioncurves biased according to: Average Wednesday consumption (8a); Average Wednesday consumptionand difference between Wednesday consumption and average weekly consumption (8b). Blue curvesrepresent the mean and standard deviation of samples from the original model, and red curves that ofsamples from the biased model (best seen in color).
Figure 9: Application of BTGM in the context of energy management: generating consumptioncurves biased to maximize (9a) and minimize (9b) the L1 distance between the consumption and itsaverage. Blue curves represent the mean and standard deviation of samples from the original model,and red curves that of samples from the biased model (best seen in color).
Figure 10: BTGM: adversarial refinement of p (VAE trained on MNIST) along criterion f, withf a discriminator. As in Appendix C, Blue line are the theoretical curves, and orange dots are theempirical values. 10a, 10b: Evolution of Eqβ f and DKL (qβ kp) with β . 10c: Pareto front of bothcriteria. 10d: generated samples with a clear mode dropping phenomenon, with top to bottom rowsrespectively corresponding to β in {0.0, 0.125, 0.250, 0.375, 0.5, 0.625, 0.750} and correspondingDKL values 0.0, 0.6, 1.4, 2.4, 2.9, 3.6, 3.7.
Figure 11: Distribution of the norm of the gradient of the objective f (pre-activation output of thediscriminator) wrt to the latent variable. The histogram is truncated at a norm of 20 for legibility, butaround 1% of the gradients have a higher norm, going up to 230.
