Figure 1: Illustration of learning spatiotemporalpoint process. We aim to learn the space-timeintensity function given the historical event se-quence and representative points as background.
Figure 2: Design of our DeepSTPP model. For a historical event sequence, We encode it with atransformer network and map to the latent process (zι,…，Zn). We use a decoder to generate theparameters (wi, γi, βi) for each event i given the latent process. The estimate intensity is calculatedusing kernel functions ks and kt and the decoded parameters.
Figure 3: Ground-truth and learned intensity on two synthetic data. Top: ground-truth; Middle:learned intensity by our DeepSTPP model. Bottom: learned conditional intensity by NSTPP. ‘X’srefer to event history, where smaller ‘X’ refers to larger time difference.
Figure 4: Log train time comparison on all datasetsduces overly smooth intensity surfaces, and lostmost of the details at the peak. In contrast, ourDeepSTPP can better fit the multimodal distri-bution through the form of kernel summation and obtain more accurate intensity functions.
