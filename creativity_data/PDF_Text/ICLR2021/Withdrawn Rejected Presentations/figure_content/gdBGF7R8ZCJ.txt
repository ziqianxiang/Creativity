Figure 1: Scatter plot illustrating the relation between the best observed test accuracy on the CIFAR10 dataset(y-axis) and the amount of emitted CO2 in grams (x-axis) with respect to the number of randomly selectedclients. “IID” and “non-IID” correspond to the corpus partitioning strategy that is employed as described inSection 4.2. It is nearly impossible to pick the right FL setup to maximise the performance and minimise theCO2 emissions without an appropriate algorithm. However, the latter solution allows important CO2 savings.
Figure 2: Growth of CO2 emissions with a PUE = 1.67 in the USA, (expressed in grams, i.e lower isbetter) observed with FL and centralised training while learning on the CIFAR10 dataset (IID partitioning).
