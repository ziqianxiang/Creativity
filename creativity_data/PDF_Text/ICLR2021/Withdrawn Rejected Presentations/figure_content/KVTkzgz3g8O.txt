Figure 1: TraDE is well suited to density estimation ofTransformers. Left: Bumblebee (true density), Right:density estimated from data.
Figure 2: Qualitative evaluationon 2-dimensional datasets. Wetrain TraDE on samples from six 2-dimensional densities and evaluate themodel likelihood over the entire domainby sampling a fine grid; original den-sities are shown in rows 1 & 3 and es-timated densities are shown in rows 2& 4. This setup is similar to (Nash &Durkan, 2019). These distributions arehighly multi-modal with complex corre-lations but TraDE learns an accurate es-timate of the true density across a largenumber of examples.
