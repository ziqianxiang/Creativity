Figure 3: The EpiOut prediction of the disturbance model allows smart selection of the measure-ments taken. While a random selection constantly takes data points, out proposed approach takesmore measurements when entering new areas (0s to 3s and 9s to 12s) and less when repeating thepattern (bottom). This results in overall improved tracking performance of a root mean squared errorin z-direction of 0.00733 (middle) vs 0.00773 (top) while taking less data. The epistemic uncertaintyestimate is low near training data and high in unobserved regions.
