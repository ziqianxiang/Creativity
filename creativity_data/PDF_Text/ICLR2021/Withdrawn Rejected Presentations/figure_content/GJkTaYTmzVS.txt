Figure 1: Bounce can have different “themes” for the background, paddle, and ball. There are twothemes to choose from: “hardcourt” and “retro”. We show the complete eight different combinationsof themes and what the game would look like under these settings.
Figure 2: This is the drag-and-drop style code editor that students use to create the game Bounce.
Figure 3: We demonstrate three examples of how Bounce can be programmed freely by allow-ing infinite repetition of commands and commands to be placed under any condition. Only (a) isconsidered correct since theme change does not affect game play. Both (b) and (c) are consideredincorrect. (c) represents a reward design error (give points at incorrect condition). This demonstratesthe difficulty of generalization in our setting.
Figure 4: Vπ (st) indicates the model’santicipation of future reward.
Figure 5: We compute the average reward across correct environments sampled from head, body, andtail of the distribution and we compare our Mixed Theme training to Color Jitter, Cutout, CutoutColor, Grayscale (Laskin et al., 2020). “Reference” represents a single environment specifiedby the standard program that all agents have been trained on. “Head” refers to the top 51 mostfrequently appeared correct programs. “Tail” refers to any correct programs that had less than 5submissions in total. “Body” is every program in between. Total reward range is [-50, 100].
