Figure 1: Computational graphs. From left to right: two-network GAN, two-network VAE, one-network GAN, one-network VAEOne may consider the single-network formulation a weakly-informative prior for our desired model,since it is intentionally less engineered than our full knowledge may permit (the correspondence offunctions to distinct topologies).
Figure 2: The correpsonding negative lower bound -L over total number of samples seen. Thesingle-network and baseline exhibit similar performance across samples, though the single-networkis always slower to converge.
Figure 3: The top row (a & b) is generated by the single-network VAE, the bottom row (c & d)from the baseline two-network VAE. The first column (a & C) is the plot of the 2D encoded space Zfrom the full MNIST test data. Y labels are depicted. The second column (b & d) is generated by agrid-sample of the decoders.
Figure 4: GAN comparison. Top row: samples from the single-network GAN. Bottom row: samplesfrom the comparable two-network baseline.
