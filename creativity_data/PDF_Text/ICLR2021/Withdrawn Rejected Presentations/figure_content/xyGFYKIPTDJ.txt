Figure 1: The graphical structure ofthe proposed Causal Semantic Gener-ative model (CSG) for the semantic sand variation v latent factors and su-pervised data (x, y). Black solid ar-rows represent invariant causal gen-erating mechanisms p(x|s, v) andp(y|s), the black undirected edge rep-resent a domain-specific prior p(s, v),and blue dashed bended arrows repre-sent the inference model q(s, v|x) forlearning and prediction.
Figure 2: Examples of noisy (left) or de-generate (right) generating mechanismsthat lead to ambiguity in inference. Left:handwritten digit that may be generatedas either "3” or “5”. Right: Schroder'sstairs that may be generated with either Aor B being the nearer surface. Inferenceresults notably rely on the prior on thedigits/surfaces, which is domain-specific.
