Figure 1: Running example Poole & Mackworth (2010)Our goal is to reason about the ML model, i.e. to implement model-based reasoning, so we need topropose a logical representation for the ML model.
Figure 2: The ‘real vS fake’ imageS. The firSt row ShowS reSultS for the real image 6; the Second -results for the fake image 6. The first column shows examples of inputs; the second - heatmaps ofXGBoost’s important features; the third - heatmaps of SHAP’s explanation. Last three columns showheatmaps of CXp of different cardinality. The brighter pixels are more influential features.
Figure 3: Results of the 3 vs 5 digits experiments. The first row shows results for the image 3. Thesecond row shows results for the image 5. The first column shows examples of inputs; the secondcolumn shows heatmaps of XGBoost’s global important features; the third column shows heatmapsof SHAP’s important features. Last three columns show heatmaps of CXp of different cardinality.
Figure 4: Additional fake images. We reduced values of zero-valued pixels to highlight gray pixelson the edges for some fake images.
