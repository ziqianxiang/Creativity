Figure 3: Visual comparison of single-coil (top row) and multi-coil (bottom-row) reconstructionsusing varying amounts of training data with and without data augmentation. We achieve reconstructionquality comparable to the state of the art but using 1% of the training data. Without DA fine detailsare completely lost.
