Among the most populardeep CNN architectures LeNet-5 (Lecun et al., 1998), AlexNet (Krizhevsky et al., 2012) and Vgg16(Simonyan & Zisserman, 2015) were chosen to be evaluated upon their description and suitabilityfor the particular time of the images. These architectures were chosen based on their popularity anddescription, which is at least in theory, fits the type of images representing drawings of the dLAST.
