Figure 4: Examples of mis-identified facesalong with their corresponding animal distrac-tors on the IJB-B for ArcFace.
Figure 5: In-domain data point versus background data point. The background is cropped from thein-domain image and provides complementary information to the main data, thereby we can providea better estimation of the pdf parameters of in-domain data.
Figure 6: Relationship between the theorems in Section 3 and the proposed method in Section 4.
Figure 7: Feature distance between different classes with and without additional background class fora toy example. Left: Contains 8 classes and the feature separation is visibly larger; Right: Containsan additional noise class that decreases the feature distance for all the other classes.
