Figure 1: Network robustness to feature perturbations. (a) An image x from CIFAR10. (b) Amaximally perturbed input from the maximally L∞ neighborhood B(x) proven robust by ERAN.
Figure 2: (a) A frog x from CIFAR10. (b) A maximally perturbed frog from the B=0.024(x)neighborhood - the maximal e proven robust. (C) A maximally perturbed frog from the (PCA, 0, δ)-neighborhood (δ = -6.66). (d)+(e) Two other images in the (PCA, 0, δ)-neighborhood of x.

Figure 5: Examples of provably robust PCA-guided neighborhoods. (a) An input x. (b) A maximallyperturbed input from the B(x) neighborhood, for the maximal proven robust ( is indicated to theleft). (c) A maximally perturbed input from the (PCA, 1, δ)-neighborhood of x (δ is indicated to theleft). (d)+(e) Two input examples in the (P CA, 1, δ)-neighborhood of x.
