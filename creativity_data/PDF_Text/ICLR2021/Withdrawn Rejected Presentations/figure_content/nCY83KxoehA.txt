Figure 1: The main paradigm of our approach is shown in the middle, where an example of rewardfunction is represented in the left and an example of a concatenation action is shown in the right.
Figure 2: Comparing the efficiency of random search (Random) and ACE. The x-axis is the numberof time steps. The left y-axis is the averaged best validation accuracy on CoNLL English NERdataset. The right y-axis is the averaged validation accuracy of the current selection.
