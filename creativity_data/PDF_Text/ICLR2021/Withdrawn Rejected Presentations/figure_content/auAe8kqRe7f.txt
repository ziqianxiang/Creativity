Figure 1: Left: Saliency maps for different version of original image, x0. Its adversarial exampledenotes as x0. X are image after pressing with saliency map. Sx denotes saliency map of image x.
Figure 2: (a) Adversarial training for linear classifier. (b) SAD defense for linear classifier. Î´^,pindicates the adversarial direction. xo indicates the saliency map direction. r indicates the strengthof the added saliency map.
Figure 3: Saliency maps of samples from CIFAR-10. The first row: the natural input images. Thesecond row: the saliency map of the naturally trained model. The third row: the saliency map ofthe naturally trained model with SAD. The fourth row: the saliency map of the adversarially trainedmodel. The fifth row: the saliency map of the adversarially trained model with SAD. Last row: theprocessed data, which consists of original data and saliency maps of SAD. Overlaying the saliencymap with the original image makes the area of focus more prominent.
