Figure 1: Overview of the proposed approach MaMa. MaMa constructs an open knowledge graph (KG)with a single forward pass of the pre-trained language model (LM) (without fine-tuning) over the corpus. Giventhe input: a textual corpus containing passages and sentences, e.g., English Wikipedia, and a pre-trained LM,e.g., BERT, GPT-2/3, MAMA (1) generates a set of candidate facts via matching the knowledge in the pre-trained LM with facts in the textual corpus, e.g., a candidate fact (Dylan, is, songwriter) from the sentence“Dylan is a songwriter.”, and (2) produces an open KG by mapping the matched candidate facts to both anexisting KG schema, e.g., (Bob.Dylan.Q392, occupation.P106, Songwriter.Q753110) in Wikidata schema, andan open schema, e.g., (Bob-Dylan.Q392, sign, AlberLGroSSman.Q708584).
Figure 2: Illustration of Match stage. The upper part of (a) represents the general matching steps of generatingthe best matched candidate fact (Dylan, is, songwriter) from the sentence “Dylan is a songwriter.” The lowerportion shows the corresponding step-by-step process. Given a head-tail pair (Dylan, songwriter), at eachstep, the search chooses one of the actions, i.e., START, YIELD, STOP to produce an intermediate candidatefact. The search starts by adding the head “Dylan” as an initial candidate (step 0). The matching degree ofthe candidate is initialized as 0. Next, a new candidate is yielded if the candidate has not reached the tail“songwriter” (step 1 and step 2), by appending the next largest attended token (with the largest score from theattention matrix (b) of the sentence) to the end of the current candidate, and the corresponding matching degreesare increased by the associated attention scores (0.3 and 0.4) to 0.3 (0+0.3) and 0.7 (0.3+0.4) respectively.

The blue node and arrow represent the mapped facts in the Wikidata schema,while the yellow node and arrow denote the unmapped facts in the open schema. We also visualize the correctfacts that are new in Wikidata in yellow.
