Figure 1: An illustration of dual-perturbation attacks. Adversarial examples are with large '∞perturbations on the background (6b = 20/255) and small '∞ perturbations on the foreground(F = 4/255). A parameter λ is used to control background salience explicitly. A larger λ results inless salient background under the same magnititude of perturbation.

Figure 3: Saliency analysis. Dual-perturbation attacks are performed by using {F , B} ={2.0, 20.0} and a variety of λ displayed in the figure. Left: foreground scores of dual-perturbationexamples in response to different classifiers. Right: accuracy of classifiers on dual-perturbationexamples With salience control.
Figure 4: Robustness to white-box `2 attacks on ImageNet-10. Left: dual-perturbation attacks withdifferent foreground distortions. B is fixed to be 20.0 and λ = 1.0. Middle:dual-perturbation attackswith different background distortions. F is fixed to be 2.0 and λ = 1.0. Right: PGD attacks.
