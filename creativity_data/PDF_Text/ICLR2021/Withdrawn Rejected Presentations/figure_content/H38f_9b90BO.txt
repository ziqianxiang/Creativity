Figure 1: Illustration of label propagation in our method. The two types of nodes are distinguishedby two colours (blue and green). The nodes surrounded by dotted line are training nodes Dtrainwhose label may be incorrect and those surrounded by solid line are clean sets Dclean In Fig-ure.1(b), one half of every training node is pseudo label predicted by LP and the other half is originallabel. Some nodes, (node 5,7) pseudo labels are the same with their original labels, we select themDselect to train GNNs and inject them to clean sets for better label propagation. We can get properlabels for the left nodes Dleft (node 6,8,9,10) based on meta learning.
