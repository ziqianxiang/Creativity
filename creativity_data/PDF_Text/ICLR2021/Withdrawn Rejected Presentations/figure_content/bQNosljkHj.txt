Figure 1: Illustration of two-stage GBALD framework.
Figure 2: Optimizing BALD with sphere and ellip-soid geodesics. Ellipsoid geodesic rescales the spheregeodesic to prevent the updates of the core-set towardsthe boundary regions of the sphere where the charac-teristics of the distribution cannot be captured. Blackpoints denote the feasible updates of the red points.
