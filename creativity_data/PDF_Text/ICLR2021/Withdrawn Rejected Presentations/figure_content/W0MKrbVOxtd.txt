Figure 1: Results of the proposed One Vertex AttackTable 4 shows the experiment results. Our proposed one vertex attack method outperforms attackingone vertex randomly (RAN) and attacking the vertex with the most edges (MOS), which representsthat the proposed method on locating the weakest vertex works. Our method outperforms attackingthe weakest vertex with GWN (RAN2), which represents the proposed method can generate theoptimal perturbations for one vertex attack.
