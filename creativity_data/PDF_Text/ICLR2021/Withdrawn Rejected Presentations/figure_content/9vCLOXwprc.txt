Figure 2: An overview of IGNNS. The upper part of the Figure describes how to generate two affinetransformations on R4, where we use the mean-pooling method to normalize A, p0 = 0.6, p1 = 0.4,	1		1	0	0	∖		/	1 2	1 2	0	0	∖		1		0	0	0	∖A =		1 0	1 1	0 1	1 1		,Ao =		0 0	1 2 0	0 1 0	1 1 2		and A1 =		1 2 0	1 1 1 3	0 1 1 3	0 0		∖	0	1	1	1	)		∖	0	0			)		∖	0			1 3	)We call F the fractal set or invariant set of IFS. More conclusions on IFS can be found in the Ap-PendiX D. It is Wen known that there exists a unique probability measure μ With support F satisfyingthe equationmμ = X Pi μ ◦ f-1.	(I)i=1The probability measure μ in (1) is called the self-similar measure of IFS with probability vector p.
