Figure 1: Visualizing the activation maps. (a) input image, (b) activation maps from our approach,(c) activation maps from only optimizing the classification loss. One can see that our approach (b)tends to more focus on the textured region.
Figure 2: Visualizing learned feature distributions for2D toy examples. Each color corresponds to augmentedviews of the same instance. (a) jointly optimize the con-sistency and classification losses. (b) only optimize theclassification loss.
Figure 3: Illustration of the fi-nal classification loss and consis-tency loss values in training.
Figure 4: Performance with different batch sizes: (a) Linear evaluation on ImageNet, (b) VOCdetection, and (c) COCO-StUff segmentation. The performances with batch sizes 256, 512 and 1024are similar.
Figure 5: Illustrating the effect of sampling classifier weight update. Three results, the baseline w/osampling, sampling update w/o sampling compensation, and sampling update w/ sampling compen-sation, are reported. The results show that sampling update w/ sampling compensation performsbetter than w/o sampling compensation and similar to the baseline w/o sampling.
