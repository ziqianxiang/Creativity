Figure 1: Loss landscape visualization of the found architecture. We project architectures (insteadof the network weights) onto a 2D plane. The architectures are sampled along two prominent direc-tions (the two axes, 位0 and 位1), with (0, 0) denotes the found architecture. We see that our foundarchitecture (right) is a much flatter minimum than that found with the standard formulation (left).
Figure 2:	Loss landscape visualization of the found architecture. The two plots in Figure 2a (Fig-ure 2b) are generated from two independent runs of DARTS (NA-DARTS). The left plot in Figure 2aand Figure 2b are the same as the plots in Figure 1 in the main text. For the architecture found byDARTS (Figure 2a), we observe that the loss of its neighbors increase drastically as the magnitudeof 位0 or 位1 increases. However, for the architecture found by our NA-DARTS (Figure 2b), the lossof its neighbors increases much slower. This shows that the architecture found by our NA-DARTSis a much flatter minimum than that found by DARTS.
