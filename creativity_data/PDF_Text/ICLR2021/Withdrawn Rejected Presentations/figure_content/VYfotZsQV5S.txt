Figure 1: Convergence of parameters δ and β for the SAEM, the MCEM and the MISSO methods.
Figure 2: Negated ELBO versus epochs elapsed for fitting (a) Bayesian LeNet-5 on MNIST and (b)Bayesian ResNet-18 on CIFAR-10. The solid curve is obtained from averaging over 5 independentruns of the methods, and the shaded area represents the standard deviation.
