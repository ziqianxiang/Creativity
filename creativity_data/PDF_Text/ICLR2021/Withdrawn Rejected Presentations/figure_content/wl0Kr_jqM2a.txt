Figure 1: Adversarially distorted chow chow dog images created with old attacks and our newattacks. The JPEG, Fog, Snow, and Gabor adversarial attacks are visually distinct from previousattacks, result in distortions which do not obey a small Lp norm constraint, and serve as unforeseenattacks for the ImageNet-UA attack suite.
Figure 2: Randomly sampled distortions and adversarially optimized distortions from our new at-tacks, targeted to the target class in red. Stochastic average-case versions of our attacks affectclassifiers minimally, while adversarial versions are optimized to reveal high-confidence errors. Thesnowflakes in Snow decrease in intensity after optimization, demonstrating that lighter adversarialsnowflakes are more effective than heavy random snowfall at uncovering model weaknesses.
Figure 3: Accuracies of L2 and Elastic attacks at different distortion sizes against a ResNet-50model adversarially trained against L2 at ε = 9600 on ImageNet-100. At small distortion sizes, themodel appears to defend well against Elastic, but large distortion sizes reveal that robustness doesnot transfer from L2 to Elastic.
Figure 5: UAR(L∞) and mUAR for L∞-trained modelsat different distortion sizes. Increasing distortion size inL∞-training improves UAR(L∞) but hurts the mUAR,suggesting models heavily fit L∞ at the cost of general-ization.
Figure 4: UAR for adv trained de-fenses (row) against attacks (col) onImageNet-100. Defenses from L∞ toGabor were trained with ε = 32, 4.8k,612k, 2, 16, 8192, 8, and 1.6k.
