Figure 1: We show the conversion processused to generate our dataset and add ourdataset attributes in the last 3 columns to theresized image. e-o-ratio affects the numberof lines observed on the image. g1 /g2 andgw respectively affect the location and sizeof the green pixels (small vertical lines ontop-left of the image).
