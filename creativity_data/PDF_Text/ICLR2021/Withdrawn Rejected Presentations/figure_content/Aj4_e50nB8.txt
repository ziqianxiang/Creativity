Figure 1: Overview of our contextual knowledge distillation. (a) In the teacher-student framework, wedefine the two contextual knowledge, word relation and layer transforming relation which are the statistics ofrelation across the words from the same layer (orange) and across the layers for the same word (turquoise),respectively. (b) Given the pair-wise and triple-wise relationships of WR and LTR from teacher and student, wedefine the objective as matching loss between them.
Figure 2: In L/H, L denotes the numberof hidden layers and H does the embed-ding size. Listing of x-axis is width-first.
