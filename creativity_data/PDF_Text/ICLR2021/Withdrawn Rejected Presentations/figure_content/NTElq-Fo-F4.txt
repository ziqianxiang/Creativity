Figure 1: Architecture of the networks used for the experiments. The sizes of the layers differs inthe models due to different embedding dimensions: we considered n = 384 for code2vec vectorsand n = 300 for doc2vec vectors. Layers highlighted in yellow are those tested in the classificationexperiments.
Figure 2: Results for the structural problem. The plot to the left reports the accuracy for each neuron,while the plot on the right show the accuracy distribution with respect to the number of neurons thatachieve a certain accuracy level.
Figure 3: Results for the semantic problem, considering different identifiers. The plot to the leftreports the accuracy for each neuron, while the plot on the right show the accuracy distribution withrespect to the number of neurons that achieve a certain accuracy level.
Figure 4: Results for the random problem. The plot to the left reports the accuracy for each neuron,while the plot on the right show the accuracy distribution with respect to the number of neurons thatachieve a certain accuracy level.
