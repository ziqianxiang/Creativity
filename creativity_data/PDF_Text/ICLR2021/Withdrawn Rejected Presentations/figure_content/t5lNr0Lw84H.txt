Figure 2: Visualizations of the StarCraftII domain and the hide-and-seek domain.
Figure 1: Task visualizations. (a) the Particle-World domain. simple-spread (left): agents need tocover all the landmarks and do not have a color preference for the landmark they navigate to; speaker-listener (middle): the listener needs to navigate to a specific landmarks following the instruction fromthe speaker; simple-reference (right): both agents only know the otherâ€™s goal landmark and needs tocommunicate to ensure both agents move to the desired target. (b) The simplified Hanabi domain(Hanabi-small): We use just two colors instead of the five used in the original Hanabi game.
Figure 3: Evolution of cumulative episode rewards according to step-number (top) and wall-clocktime (bottom) for different algorithms in the particle-world domain.
