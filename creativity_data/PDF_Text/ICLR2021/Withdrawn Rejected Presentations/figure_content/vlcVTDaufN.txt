Figure 1: Test set error (left) and total training time (right) for increasing bag sizes for classifierstrained using the proposed bipartite matching loss with gradients calculated using the proposedapproach and, for comparison, using cvxpylayers (Agrawal et al., 2019) and using an interpolationapproach for obtaining gradients of the solution vector of combinatorial problems (VlaSteliCa Pogancicet al., 2020). A supervised model with true label available for each individual sample, whichcorresponds to bag of size one, is used as a baseline lower bound on the error that the bag-trainedmodels should attempt to match. Mean, and the 95% confidence interval of the mean, are shown.
Figure 2: A directed acyclic graph (DAG) corresponding to the global sequence alignment betweenthe target sequence and the sequence predicted by the RNN model. Each node, except the end ofsequence indicator < / >, has out-degree of three: a diagonal edge corresponding to a match betweenthe predicted and the target sequence, a horizontal edge corresponding to a gap in the predictedsequence, and a vertical edge corresponding to a gap in the target sequence. Optimal sequencealignment is depicted in red, With the weights - the alignment costs - of the selected edges in blue.
