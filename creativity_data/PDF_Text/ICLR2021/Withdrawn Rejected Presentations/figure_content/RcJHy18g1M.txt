Figure 1: Data Set used in (a) and (b) is Inliers taken from MNIST ”1”s while outliers are MNIST”0”s, such that the outliers account for roughly 20% of the total data. (a) Left plot shows averagereconstruction error of outliers over average reconstruction error of inliers during the training of astandard autoencoder. of the total data. As the plot shows, the ratio of errors for outliers to inliersgoes to 1, meaning outliers are difficult to distinguish from inliers after training. (b) The right plotshows inliers and outliers in the 2-dimensional latent space of a Wasserstein Autoencoder (a populartype of distribution mapping autoencoder). As seen, the outliers are in high-probability regions ofthe latent space and are thus difficult to separate from the inliers.
Figure 2: An overview of OP-DMA. Data is mapped to latent space with prior distribution usinga Prior-Weighted Loss (PWL), which encourages outliers to be mapped to low-probability regions.
