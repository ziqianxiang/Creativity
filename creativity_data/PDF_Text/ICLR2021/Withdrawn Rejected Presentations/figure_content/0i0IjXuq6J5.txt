Figure 1: Illustration of Lemma 3.1: we observe that Inequality (7) is satisfied on these examples,even without the log NC term, and that both losses behave similarly (5 runs are displayed togetherwith their average).
Figure 2:	Illustration of Lemma 3.2 with N = 15, 25, 35 on MNIST. We observe again that boththe unsupervised and supervised losses behave similarly and that Inequality (8) is satisfied in theseexperiments, even without the 1∕ρpc factor (5 runs are displayed together with their average).
Figure 3:	Minimum and maximum Euclidean norms of the outputs of the encoder along contrastiveunsupervised training. We observe that Assumption 2 is satisfied on these examples (5 runs aredisplayed together with their average), the dashed line shows that the minimum norms are awayfrom 0 even in the early iterations.
