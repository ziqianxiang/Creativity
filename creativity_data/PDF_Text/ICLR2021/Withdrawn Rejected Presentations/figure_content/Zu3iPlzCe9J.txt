Figure 1: Illustration of a non-Lipschitz feature mapping using a deep network.
Figure 3: A simple example to illustrate Theorem 4.1.
Figure 4: A simple intuitive example where we compute the optimal value of the abstention thresholdexactly. Classes A and B are both distributed uniformly on one-dimensional segments of length D,embedded collinear and at distance r in R2 .
Figure 5: Adversarial accuracy (i.e., rate of adversary failure) vs. abstention rate as threshold τ variesfor n3 =1and different outlier removal thresholds σ.
