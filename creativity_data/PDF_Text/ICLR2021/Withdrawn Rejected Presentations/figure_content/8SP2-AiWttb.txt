Figure 1: A toy illustration of im-balanced gradients at X = 0: thegradient of margin loss (Z2 - Z1 ) isdominated by its -Z1 term, pointingto a suboptimal attack direction to-wards +2, where X is still correctlyclassified.
Figure 2: (a): Gradient imbalance ratio of 5 models. (b): Attack success rate of PGD-20 with differentlosses. (c): The margin loss of the AdVInterP defense model on points x* = X + α ∙ sign(Vχ(-Zy)),where X is a natural sample and Sign(Vχ(-Zy)) is the signed gradient of loss term -Zy. All theseexperiments are conducted on test images of CIFAR-10.
Figure 3: Changes in gradient imbalance ratio when apply PGD-20 (e =焉)attack with the marginloss (a), only the zmax term (b), or only the -zy term (c), on the AdvInterp model for 5 CIFAR-10test images. The imbalance ratio is effectively reduced by attacking a single zmax term.
