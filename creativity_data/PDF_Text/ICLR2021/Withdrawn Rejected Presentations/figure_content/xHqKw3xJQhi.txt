Figure 2: Visualization results of topology optimization on the Cora-ML dataset under the full-supervised setting. We plot an induced subgraph (node indices from 450 to 850) for a better view.
Figure 3: Visualization results of topology optimization on the Cora-ML dataset under the label-scarce setting (10 labels per class). We plot an induced subgraph (node indices from 450 to 850) fora better view. (a) The observed graph Aobs; (b) The optimal graph A; (c) The approximate posteriordistribution qφ on Alatent; (d) The refined graph q^φ.
Figure 4: t-SNE plots of learned node embeddings extracted by vanilla GCN with varying layers onthe Cora-ML dataset. Different colors denote different classes.
Figure 5: t-SNE plots of learned node embeddings extracted by VEM-GCN with varying layers onthe Cora-ML dataset. Different colors denote different classes.
