Figure 1: Two-time-scale convergence of user em-beddings motivates us to design a two-stage method,where the first stage estimates transductive embed-ding and the second stage learns two different RNNsfor active and inactive users respectively.
Figure 2: Test MRR versus training time. Wecompare the convergence speeds of differentmodels in wall-clock time. Run-time on lastfm-1K is not showed because it is small-scale.
Figure 3: Test MRR in different segments of users.
