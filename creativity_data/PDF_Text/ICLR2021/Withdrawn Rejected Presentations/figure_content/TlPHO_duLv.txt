Figure 1: Our Class-Agnostic Bounding Box Correction (CA-BBC) disentangles bounding box (bbox) noisefrom label noise, by directly optimizing the noisy bbox coordinates regardless of its class label. We use twodiverged classifiers to predict the same image region, and update the bbox b to b* by minimizing classifierdiscrepancy and maximizing region objectness. Boxes with very low objectness are rejected as false positives.
Figure 2: The proposed framework alternately performs noise correction (with fixed model parameters) andmodel training (with corrected annotations) for each mini-batch. The noise correction procedure consists oftwo steps: (1) the class-agnostic bounding box correction (Figure 1) disentangles bbox noise and label noise;(2) the class-specific correction step uses dual detection heads to generate soft labels for label correction andrefine bounding boxes using class-specific bbox offsets. The two detection heads are kept diverged by differentrandom parameter initialization and different random RoI sampling during training.
Figure 3: Examples of class-agnostic bounding box correction on VOC with 40% label noise and 40% bound-ing box noise. Noisy GT bounding boxes are in red and the corrected bounding boxes are in green.
Figure 4: Examples of failed bbox corrections from CA-BBC. Noisy GT bounding boxes are in red and thecorrected bounding boxes are in green. CA-BBC could be confused when the GT bboxes cover multiple objectinstances of the same class. It also sometimes fails to extend the box boundaries to cover the entire object.
