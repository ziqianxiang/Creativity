Figure 1: Plot of train and test mean squared error (MSE) vs distance between an interpolating solutionw^ and the minimum norm interpolant Wt of a linear regression problem. Data was syntheticallygenerated as y = w>X, where X ∈ Rd×n with i.i.d N (0, 1) entries and d = 1000, n = 200. Otherinterpolating solutions were computed as W = y> Xt + v> (I - XXt) and the norm of V was variedto obtain the plot. Train MSE is 0 for all interpolants, but test MSE increases as ||v|| increases, withWt having the best performance. This plot represents results averaged over 100 trials.
Figure 2: Typical double descent of the condition number (y axis) of a radial basis function kernelK(x, χ0) = exp (-l⅛-σχ-LL^ built from a random data matrix distributed as N(0,1): as in the linearcase, the condition number is worse when n = d, better if n > d (on the right of n = d) and alsobetter if n < d (on the left of n = d). The parameter σ was chosen to be 5. From Poggio et al. (2019)worst case scenarios where the minimum norm is arbitrarily large (when n ≈ d). One of our keyfindings is the relationship between minimizing the norm of the ERM solution and minimizing abound on stability.
Figure 3: Typical double descent of the pseudoinverse norm (y axis) of a random data matrixdistributed as N(0,1): the condition number is worse when n = d, better if n > d (on the right ofn = d) and also better if n < d (on the left of n = d).. From Poggio et al. (2019)In the above equation we make use of the fact that b> (X) = 0. We use an old formula (Meyer,1973; Baksalary et al., 2003) to compute (X) from X*. We use the development of pseudo-inversesof perturbed matrices in Meyer (1973). We see that a = -Xi is a vector in the column space ofX and b is in the range space of Xt (provided X has full column rank), with β = 1+ b>X*a =1 - b>X*Xi = 0. This means we can use Theorem 6 in Meyer (1973) (equivalent to formula 2.1 inBaksalary et al. (2003)) to obtain the expression for (Xi)土(Xi)t = Xt - kktXt - Xthth + (ktXtht)kh(29)where k = Xta, and h = bτXt, and ut = y^p for any non-zero vector u.
