Figure 1: We get the prediction model with the input of full size images by pretraining with patchesin a multi-step way. In the begining (Step 1), small patches are sampled as training data with image-level labels. Then (Step 2), the lower layers pretrained in the former step (Step 1) are frozen as theearly feature extractor in the model of this step. Iteratively continue this procedure until (Step 3) thesize of patches to be sampled is equal to the full size of images.
Figure 2: Samples of two datasets. Images in the top row are sampled from LIVE dataset whileimages in the bottom row are from MIT Indoor dataset.
