Figure 1: The proposed clustering method includes a VAE based network and z-score based clustermethods. The VAE based network encodes the image into the multivariate normal distribution, andthe z-score based clustering method takes advantage of the distribution's boundary information.
Figure 2: The framework of the proposed VAE based network.
Figure 3: (a) Representation A is illustrated as a five-dimensional distribution. The dots representthe mean of each dimension, and its z-score range is indicated by the bars; (b) Representation B isclustered by A, as all the means of B fall into the z-score range of A. However, representation Ccannotjoin the A's cluster as some of C's means fall out of the required z-score range. (c) Represen-tation A cannot be clustered by B, even representation B is clustered by A. Because B has a narrowz-score range; (d) With the loose match strategy, the representation D can be accepted tojoin the A’scluster, although one of its means cannot fall into the required z-score range.

Figure 5: (a) the clustered size increases as α increases and reaches converged number within α ≤ 2;(b) the cluster accuracy decreased as the α increases and maintains the accuracy within α ≤ 2.
