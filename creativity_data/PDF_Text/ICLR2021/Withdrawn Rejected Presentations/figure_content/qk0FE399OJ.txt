Figure 1: (a) The comparison of the Spearman’s ρ across 10 PS and the GS. The architectures inthe PS are uniformly sampled from the GS. (b) Six different scenarios of Spearman’s ρ through theRandomNAS training. “Global top-x%" stands for the RandomNAS trained in the GS and evaluatedby architectures in the the top-x% of the GS. “Proxy top-x%" stands for the RandomNAS trainedand evaluated in a PS which consists of architectures in the top-x% of the GS.
Figure 2:	(a)Validation losses vs. sizes for 4000 architectures after RandomNAS training. (b)Pareto-front architectures’ average sizes via RandomNAS training.
Figure 3:	(a) The average ranking correlation of EPS with size regularization on NASBench-201with α (y-axis) and β (x-axis). (b) Average ranking and Spearman’s ρ of EPS’s proxy search spacewhen training.
Figure 4: Rankings and ground-truthaccuracy of searched architectures fromEPS and RandomNAS(RS) on DARTSsearch space. ρ is calculated byestimated ranking and ground-truth-accuracy ranking(descending). The redline is the average accuracy of randomsamples.
