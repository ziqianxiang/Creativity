Figure 1: Importance of data variability in CIFAR-10 (left) and CIFAR-100 (right). Top: randomlyselecting samples at every epoch (unif-SGD) outperforms fixed core-set or random subsets. Bottom:the entropy of sample counts during training (0.3 budget) demonstrates that importance sampling,linear learning rate, and data augmentation contribute to higher data variability (entropy).
