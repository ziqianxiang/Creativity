Figure 1: Illustration of the GB. The maximum error (the GB), at order O(|Si|4), is obtained by comparing themaximum variations of fθ, and the first order approximation of f, whose trends are given by Kθ and f0 (Xi).
Figure 2: From left to right: (a) Double Moon (DM) data set. (b) Decision boundary with the baseline method.
Figure 3: Samples from Cifar10 and MNIST with high wi. Those pictures are either unusual or difficult toclassify, even for a human (especially for MNIST).
Figure 4: Left: (left axis) Runge function w.r.t x and (right axis) x → Df2 (x). Points sampledusing TBS are plotted on the x-axis and projected on f . Right: Same as left, with hyperbolictangent function.
Figure 5: 1a: t → fθ(u0, η0, t) for randomly chosen (u0, η0), for fθ obtained with the two sam-plings. 1b: t → fθ(u0, η0, t) for (u0, η0) resulting in the highest point-wise error with the twosamplings. 2a: u0 , η0 →max Dn (u0 , η0, t) w.r.t.
Figure 6: Color map of the error, with respect to m and k. Left: BH data set, for the mean of theMSE accross 10 different seeds and right: BC data set, for the mean of 1 - acc across these seeds.
