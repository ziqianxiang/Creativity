Figure 1: Various residual structures. H and T refer to non-linear units, N is the injected noise. Ahighway block learns how much it needs to transform (T) or to carry (1 - T). DARTS decides therelative importance of operations between any two nodes by σ(α). Note here σ refers to softmax.
Figure 2: Exemplary illustration on the relationof the set (denoted as H) of models found withlow Hessian norms and the set (G) of models withbetter test accuracy. The Hessian norm criteriontends to reject a part of good models.
Figure 3: Smoothed maximal Hessian eigenvalues Xmax (Zela et al., 2020) during the optimizationon CIFAR-10. Zela et al. (2020) suggest that the optimization should stop early at the marked points.
Figure 4: The landscape of validation accuracy w.r.t the architectural weights on CIFAR-10 andthe corresponding contours. Following Chen & Hsieh (2020), axis x and y are orthogonal gradientdirection of validation loss w.r.t. architectural parameters α, axis z refers to the validation accuracy.

Figure 8:	Stacked plot of dominant operations during searching on ImageNet. The inferred model ofDARTS (left) obtains 66.4% accuracy on ImageNet, while NoisyDARTS (right) obtains 76.1%.
Figure 9: Evolution of maximal Hessian eigenvalue when searching with NoisyDARTS on tworeduced search spaces S2 and S3 proposed by Zela et al. (2020). Compared with RDARTS, theeigenvalues still have a trend of increasing. Notice that better models can be found 3× faster thanRDARTS (they run four times to get the best model while we produce better ones at each single run).
