Figure 1: Though illustrated 2Drepresentations are linearly sep-arable, irrelevant instances areclustered together.
Figure 2: Visual illustration of how our method leads to both linearly separable and clusterable repre-sentations. While semantically unrelated samples are pushed apart with the cluster-wise contrastiveloss, the invariant mapping can be maintained by our instance-wise bootstrapping loss.

Figure 6: Qualitative comparisons of the top-k retrieved images by C2BIN (Columns 2-6), SimCLR(Columns 7-11), and PICA (Columns 12-17) given a query image (Column 1) from the STL-10 testset where the k is set as {1, 2, 10, 50, 100}.
Figure 7: Top-k retrieved images by C2BIN (Columns 2-6), SimCLR (Columns 7-11), and PICA(Columns 12-17) given the query image (Column 1) from the STL-10 test set where k is set as{1, 2, 10, 50, 100}.

Figure 9:	This figure shows a random samples of STL-10 test set images associated to the selectedclusters from k = 10 cluster-branch. This visualization uses the experiment settings from unsu-pervised clustering experiment in Section 4.3. The border color enclosing each image indicates itsground-truth class.
Figure 10:	This figure shows a random samples of STL-10 test set images associated to the selectedclusters from k = 40 cluster-branch. This visualization uses the experiment settings identical toFigure 9.The border color enclosing each image indicates its ground-truth class.
Figure 11: This figure shows a random samples of STL-10 test set images associated to the selectedclusters from k = 160 cluster-branch. This visualization uses the experiment settings identical toFigure 9. The border color enclosing each image indicates its ground-truth class.
