Figure 1: An illustration of different few-shot learning settings. The difference between thesesettings is whether they have labels for examples from base classes and unlabeled examples fromnovel classes.
Figure 2: A comparison between UBC-FSL, FSL baseline, UBC-TFSL, and Combined for 5-shot accuracy on four datasets. UBC-TFSL significantly outperforms other methods.
Figure 3: Few-shot classification accuracy with various depths of backbone architectures.
Figure 4: Accuracy of 1-shot cross-domain FSL (first row) or single-domain FSL (second row).
Figure 5: Few-shot classification accuracy with larger shots. We use ResNet-50 as our backbonearchitecture and evaluate on tieredImageNet and CalteCh (transferred from tieredImageNet).
Figure 6: 1-shot testing accuracy under various scales of dataset size. ResNet-12 is our backbonearchitecture. In (a), we compare UBC-FSL, FSL baseline, UBC-TFSL, and Combined on threedatasets of different sizes (30607, 60000, and 779165 images). In (b), we randomly select part ofthe miniImageNet (e.g. 20% of the whole dataset) and compare our methods.
