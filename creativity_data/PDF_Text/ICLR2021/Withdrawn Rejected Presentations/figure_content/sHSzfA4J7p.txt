Figure 1: Image processing aims for images that lookvisually pleasing for human, but not those accuratelyrecognized by machines. In this work we try to enhanceoutput images’ recognition accuracy. Zoom in for details.
Figure 3: Examples where outputs of RA processing models can be correctly classified but those from plainprocessing models cannot. PSNR/SSIM/class prediction is shown below each output image. Slight differencesbetween images from plain processing and RA processing models could be noticed when zoomed in.
Figure 4: Different models’ decision boundaries are similar, especially along the RA direction (horizontal axis).
Figure 5: Examples where output images from RA processing models can be correctly classified but thosefrom plain processing models cannot. PSNR/SSIM/class prediction is shown below each output image. Slightdifferences between images from plain processing and RA processing models (especially with large λs) could benoticed when zoomed in.
Figure 6: Different models’ decision boundaries are similar, especially along the RA direction (horizontal axis).
