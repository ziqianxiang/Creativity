Figure 1:	Effect of hyper-parameters of ξ, α and m. We use ResNet18, and domain A is taken astarget domain on PACS dataset in the setting of MSDS.
Figure 2:	Curves of target errors and losses of task A (PACS) and Ar (Office-Home) during trainingbased on ResNet50 in the setting of MSDS.
Figure 3: The t-SNE visualization of extracted features, using our proposed DFAS (a-b) and Baseline(c-d) on PACS dataset in MSDS setting. In (a) and (c), the different colors indicate different domains.
