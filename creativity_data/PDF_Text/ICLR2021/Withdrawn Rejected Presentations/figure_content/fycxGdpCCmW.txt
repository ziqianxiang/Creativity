Figure 1: Histograms for OOD detection using density q(x) as score function. The model is WideResNet-28-10(without BN). Green corresponds to the score on (in-distribution) training dataset CIFAR-10, and red correspondsto the score on the testing dataset. The cifar10interp denotes a dataset that consists of a linear interpolation ofthe CIFAR-10 dataset.
