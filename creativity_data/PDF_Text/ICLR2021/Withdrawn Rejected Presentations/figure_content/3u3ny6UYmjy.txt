Figure 1: Examples of (a) a chemical reaction and (b) the corresponding reaction template in theUSPTO-50k dataset. The objective of retrosynthesis is to find the reactants for the given product.
Figure 2: Illustration of the search procedure in RetCL. It first (1-3) selects reactants sequentiallybased on ψ (R|P, RgiVen), and then (4) check the synthesizability of the selected reactant-set basedon φ(P |R). The overall score is the average over all scores from (1) to (4).
