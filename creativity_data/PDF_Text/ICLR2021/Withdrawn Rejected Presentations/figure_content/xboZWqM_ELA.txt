Figure 2: (a) Diagram of decorrelating node embedding with confounding balance. H(K-1) is thenode embedding to be decorrelated. T is the treatment, corresponding to one target variable inH(K-1). X is the confounders, corresponding to the remaining variables of the target variable inH(K-1). Y is the outcome, corresponding to labels. (b) The framework of GNN-DVD. The samecolor in the two figures represents the same kind of variable.
