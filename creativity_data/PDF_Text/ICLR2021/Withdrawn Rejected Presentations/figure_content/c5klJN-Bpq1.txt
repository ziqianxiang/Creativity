Figure 1: Illustrations of a binary tree model by (a) a traditional node-and-branch structure and (b)our representation as a decision transformer. The traditional view treats the prediction as a sequenceof decisions d0, d1, d4, and d9 following the path of x. We understand the same model as a decisiontransformer represented as a series of linear transformations regardless of the actual path of x.
Figure 2: A comparison between (a) a binary tree model, (b) DTN-D, and (c) DTN-S, assumingthree layers each of which has four nodes. A tree model propagates an example through a single pathdenoted by the bold lines. DTN-D uses all nodes at the internal layer in the propagation, as all pairsof nodes are connected. DTN-S simplifies the structure of DTN-D by imposing a spatial locality,minimizing the number of parameters, still allowing a change of information between nodes.
