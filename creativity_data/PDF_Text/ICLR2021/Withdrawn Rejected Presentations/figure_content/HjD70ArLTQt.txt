Figure 1: Comparison of state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision (P), recall (R), consistency(C), F1-score (F1), object accuracy (Acc.), FID and DS for (a-d) seen conditionings (Ss), (b-e)unseen finegrained conditionings (Su), (c-f) unseen coarse conditionings (Su2). Plots show meanand std over 5 generation processes. *Trained using the open-sourced code. Best viewed in color.
Figure 2: Comparison of state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision (P), recall (R), and consis-tency (C), and matching class distributions for (a-b) seen and unseen finegrained conditionings, (c)seen and unseen coarse conditionings. *Trained using the open-sourced code. Best viewed in color.

Figure 5: Class-wise comparison of state-of-the-art methods in terms of object-wise precision (P),recall (R) and consistency (C) (a,d,g) for seen conditionings (Ss), (b,e,h) unseen finegrained condi-tionings (Su), (c,f,i) unseen coarse conditionings (Su2). Plots show mean and std over 5 generationprocesses. *Trained using the open-sourced code. Best viewed in color.
