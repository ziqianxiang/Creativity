Figure 1: Multimodel assessment GAI composed by B = 3 SAIs and a single IAL Training,validation and testing examples are assumed to pertain to the same observation modality.
Figure 2: Multimodal GAI: the upstream part of the network learns to efficiently integrate assessmentprocesses issued from the downstream SAIs, the latter have been trained with respect to several imageobservation modalities. Figure 15DTD Cimpoi et al. (2015) is collection of 5640 wild textural images annotated with a series of perceptualdescription characteristics. DTD dataset consists of 47 texture categories, with at least 90% of the image surfacecovered by the category description characteristics. DTD has been divided in 10 splits, each split being associatedwith train, validation and test images.
Figure 3: Distributed multimodal system with cooperative GAIs. DGAI = (DGAI-1, DGAI-2), whereDGAI-1 = (DIAI-1, GAI-1, GAI-2) and DGAI-2 = (DIAI-2, GAI-2, GAI-3). Any GAI has the formXCEPTION ㊉ GOOGLENET ㊉ DENSENET given in Figure 1.
