Figure 1: The workflow of the proposed attacks. Phase 1 (model extraction attack): we first samplequeries, label them using the victim API, and then train an extracted model on the resulting data.
Figure 2: The correlation between the empirical privacy of AIA and the maximum posterior probabil-ity. ag news uses news data as queries, while Blog and tp-us query the victim models with reviewsdata. mean and median denote the mean and median of the maximum posterior probability of thequeries.
Figure 3: The distribution of different datasets grouped by private attributes.
