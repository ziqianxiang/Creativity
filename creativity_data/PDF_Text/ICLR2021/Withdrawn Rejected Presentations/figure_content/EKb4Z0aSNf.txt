Figure 1: Illustration of the three continual learning scenarios. A network is sequentially exposed totasks (Class-IL) with mutually-exclusive pairs of classes, (Time-IL) with data collected at differenttimes of the year, and (Domain-IL) with data from different input modalities.
Figure 2: Trajectory of β1k and β2k on task k.
Figure 3: Mean validation AUC of the a) fine-tuning and b) CLOPS strategy (b = 0.25 and a = 0.50)in the Class-IL scenario. Coloured blocks indicate tasks on which the learner is currently beingtrained. The shaded area represents one standard deviation across five seeds.
Figure 4: Mean validation AUC of the (a) fine-tuning and (b) CLOPS strategy in the Time-ILscenario. Coloured blocks indicate tasks on which the learner is currently being trained. The shadedarea represents one standard deviation from the mean across five seeds.
Figure 5: Mean validation AUC of four different learning strategies in the Class-IL scenario. 1)CLOPS, 2) Random Storage, 3) Random Acquisition, and 4) Random Storage and Acquisition.
Figure 6: Distribution of the s values corresponding to CLOPS (b = 0.25 and a = 0.50) in theClass-IL scenario. Each colour corresponds to a different task. The ECG recording with the lowest svalue is labelled as normal despite the presence of ST-elevation, a feature common in heart attacks.
Figure 7: Similarity of tasks in the Class-IL scen-ario. We create a curriculum by following chainingtasks that are similar to one another.
