Figure 1: (a) Tight lower bound on the value of a smoothed function at x0 (i.e. pa(x0)) as a functionof kx0 - xk2. In this example, pa(x) = 0.8 and the smoothing standard deviation σ = 1. Thered line shows the lower bound for the function, with no information about the gradient given.
Figure 3: Worst case base classifiers for second-order smoothing for the same value of pa (X) atdifferent values of ∣Vxpa (X)∣2. The base classifier is f = 1 in the blue regions and f = 0 inthe red regions. The point X is shown as a blue dot, with the Gaussian sampled region used forcalculating pa (X) is approximately shown as a dashed blue circle. Vxpa (X) is shown as a bluearrow. (a) The gradient takes its maximum possible value: ∣Vxpa(X)∣2 = σ-1Φ0(Φ-1 (pa(X)). (b)The gradient has an intermediate value: 0 < ∣Vxpa(X)∣2 < σ-1Φ0(Φ-1(pa(X)). (c) The gradientis zero: ∣Vxpa(X)∣2 = 0.
Figure 2: Comparison of second-order smoothing cer-tificates to standard Gaussian smoothing certificates ona selection of points from the Swiss Roll dataset. Cor-rectly labeled points with (second-order) certificatesare shown in light red and blue, and points with in-correct label or no certificate are in black. For a selec-tion of points, shown in red/blue, the first-order certi-fied radii shown are as red/blue rings. Increases to cer-tified radii due to second-order smoothing shown areas light blue (light red, absent) rings around certificateradii. For both experiments, N = 108, and η = 0.001.
