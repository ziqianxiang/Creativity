Figure 1: Our OT-GNN prototype model computes graph embeddings from Wasserstein distancesbetween (a) the set of GNN node embeddings and (b) prototype embedding sets. These distancesare then used as the molecular representation (c) for supervised tasks, e.g. property prediction. Weassume that a few prototypes, e.g. some functional groups, highlight key facets or structural featuresof graphs relevant to a particular downstream task at hand. We express graphs by relating them tothese abstract prototypes represented as free point cloud parameters.
Figure 2: We illustrate, for a given 2D point cloud, the optimal transport plan obtained fromminimizing the Wasserstein costs; c(∙, ∙) denotes the Euclidean distance. A higher dotted-linethickness illustrates a greater mass transport.

Figure 5: 2D heatmaps of T-SNE Maaten & Hinton (2008) projections of molecular embeddings(before the last linear layer) w.r.t. their associated predicted labels. Heat colors are interpolationsbased only on the test molecules from each dataset. Comparing (a) vs (b) and (c) vs (d), we canobserve a smoother space of our model compared to the D-MPNN baseline (see also main text).
Figure 6: The closest molecules to some particular prototypes in terms of the corresponding Wasser-stein distance. One can observe that some prototypes are closer to insoluble molecules containingrings (Prototype 2), while others prefer more soluble molecules (Prototype 1).
