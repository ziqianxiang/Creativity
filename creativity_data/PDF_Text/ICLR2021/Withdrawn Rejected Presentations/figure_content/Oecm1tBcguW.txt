Figure 1: BNN posterior predictions with (a) standard Gaussian prior vs. (b) meta-learned prior.
Figure 2: Scalability comparison of PACOH-NN andMLAP-S in memory footprint and compute time, as thenumber of meta-training task grows.
Figure 3: MHC-I peptide design task: Regret fordifferent priors and bandit algorithms. A meta-learned PACOH-NN prior substantially improvesthe regret, compared to a standard BNN/GP prior.
Figure S1: Overview of our meta-learning framework with environment T, meta-task distributionsDi, target task distribution D, hyper-prior P, hyper-posterior Q, target prior P, target posterior Q,datasets S, and data points z = (x, y).
Figure S2: Depiction of tasks (i.e., functions) sampled from the Sinusoid and Cauchy task environ-ment, respectively. Note that the Cauchy task environment is two-dimensional (dim(X) = 2), while(b) displays a one-dimensional projection.
