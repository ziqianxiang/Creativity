Figure 1: (a) A causal model for the online continual learning under conditional domain shift. Tis the number of tasks and Nt is the number of training samples of task t. The causal interactionbetween the domains and images are not considered in the traditional setting. (b) An example of thedomain shift, sampled images are extracted from the DomainNet dataset (Peng et al., 2019).
Figure 2: Overview of Conditional Invariant Experience Replay (CIER). CIER employs a set ofdomain critics (blue) to learn a conditional invariant representation via an adversarial training lossin every experience replay round. Best viewed in colors.
Figure 3: Sample images from the iANimal benchmark. Images are extracted from the Animalsuperclass of the NICO dataset (He et al., 2020).
Figure 4: Sample images from the iVehicle benchmark. Images are extracted from the Vehiclesuperclass of the NICO dataset (He et al., 2020).
Figure 5: Sample images from the iDomainNet benchmark. Images are extracted from the Domain-Net dataset (Peng et al., 2019).
