Figure 2: Effect of Bias and Regularisation on SI. Left: Summed Importances for SI and itsunbiased version, showing that the bias dominates SI and that Assumption 1 holds. Mid: PearsonCorrelations of SI, its bias (SIB), and unbiased version (SIU) on MNIST, showing that relationbetween SI and (On)AF is due to bias. Right: Relation between standard-SI (blue) and OnAF andtwo SI-controls: ‘no init’ (turquoise) does not re-initialise network weights after each task; ‘c = 0’(purple) has regularisation strength 0. This shows that strong regularisation weakens the tie betweenSI and (On)AF as explained by our theory.
