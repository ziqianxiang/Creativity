Retail purchase history age group prediction10 - the task is to predict the age group of aclient based on its retail purchase history. The group ratio is balanced in the dataset. Thedataset consists of 45,8M retail purchases representing 400k clients. Only labeled data isused. Each purchase is characterized by time, product level, segment, amount, value, pointsreceived.
