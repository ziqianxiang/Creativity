Figure 2: Comparison of CF-metric and MAE of decision making algorithmsWang et al. (2019) showed that the AA algorithm can achieve zero AA-metric in Example 3, but itdoes not satisfy either of the non-sensitive conditions for achieving CF. As shown in Figure 2b, allalgorithms we consider cannot achieve CF, but the FLAP algorithms still have the lowest CF-metric.
Figure 3: Power for testing CF using conditional independent test plot against the CF-metric5	Real Data AnalysisWe apply our methods to a loan application dataset from a fintech company, the adult incomedataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository1 and the COMPAS recidivism data from ProP-ublica2 (Angwin & Larson, 2016). Here we present our analysis of the loan application data, and theresults from the other two publicly available datasets are shown in Appendix C since the conclusionsare similar.
Figure 4: Comparison of CF-metric and prediction performance of decision making algorithms14Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2021attribute between sensitive groups affects fairness. In Figures 2b and 4d, we set β0 = -1, βt = 2,βs = 1 and increase λ from 0 to 0.8 to see how the mean difference of test scores affects fairness.
