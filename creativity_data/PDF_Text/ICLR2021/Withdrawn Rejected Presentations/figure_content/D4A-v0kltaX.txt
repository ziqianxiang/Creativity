Figure 3: Overview: To obtain the solution of A(x, θ)x = b, we first generate a random initialguess x0 . Then in each iteration step i, we apply the functional convolution C on xi to obtain theconvolution kernels A(xi , θ). We obtain xi+1 by solving A(xi , θ)x = b. We repeat this process toobtain a converged solution.
