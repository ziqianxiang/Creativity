Figure 1: Histogram of the Energy Dependence of skip-units. (a) and (b) denote the histogram ofthe Energy Dependence for CIFAR-10 respectively for N = 0 (full model), and for the last stage,N = 9. (c) and (d) denote the histogram of the Energy Dependence for CIFAR-100 respectively forN = 0 (full model), and for the last stage (N=9).
Figure 2: Comparison of clustering scheme in PED (N = 10) against pruning using units with thelargest energy values, and random selection. The experiments are based on ResNet56 and CIFAR-10.
