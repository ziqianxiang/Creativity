Figure 1: Examples of two transition graphs. The circles denote candidate states and the arrows representcandidate transitions. The ultimate model is the one with higher accuracy of the two final states.
Figure 2: The examples of (a) the collected performance-epoch curves; (b) the fitting results for training modelfrom scratch; (c) the fitting results for fine-tuning model.
Figure 3: An overview of our proposed Dual-head Global-contextual Pseudo-3D (DG-P3D) network. Here,we take the 16-frame input as an example and the size of output feature map is also given for each layer.
Figure 4: The best optimization path produced by the proposed optimization planning on (a) ActivityNet; (b)SS-V1; (c) SS-V2; (d) Kinetics-400. The red edge represents the state transition in the optimization path, whilethe black edges denote the transitions that have been explored but not selected in the final optimization path.
Figure 5: The best optimization path produced by the proposed optimization planning on (a) HMDB51, (b)UCF101, (c) ActivityNet, (d) SS-V1, (e) SS-V2, (f) Kinetics-400, (g) HMDB51 with Kinetics-400 pre-trainingand (h) UCF101 with Kinetics-400 pre-training. The red edge represents the state transition in the optimizationpath and the optimal number of training epochs is also given for each transition.
