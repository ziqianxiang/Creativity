Figure 1: Panel A shows the modeled county-level results from the Deep MLM versus the truecounty-level results. Panel B shows the difference between modeled and true demographic supportlevels for three models: the baseline linear (dense) model, the deep dense model, and the deep MLM.
Figure 2: Here we demonstrate the benefits of joint training to learning the covariance structure overraces. Panel A shows three modeled covariances: the baseline linear model using our loss function,a deep model trained independently, and a deep model trained jointly. The deep models are the bestperforming dense nets. Panel B shows that the examples in Panel A are representative. We plot theMSE of the modeled covariance against depth, where the solid lines indicate independent trainingand dotted lines joint training. We see that joint training leads to significant gains in estimating thecovariance. Panel C shows the mean MSE of modeled demographic support over all races. It showsthat - especially for the MLM - joint training can improve demograhic-level support estimates.
Figure 3: The first two panels here show two dimensional PCA embeddings of the latent represen-tations of all Maryland voters from the best performing binomial and multinomial models, coloredby the registered party. The binomial loss embeds voters along a partisanship axis. The multinomialembedding is more three dimensional, reducing less to pure partisanship. The second two panelsshow the results of training linear models to predict survey responses using the latent space, forlatent spaces of various depths. performance of the latent space for predicting survey responses.
