Figure 1: (1) Our Neighbor Class Consistency framework. (2) An overview of our approach:(a) Self-Training methods ignore the intrinsic target structure while aligning the features of twodomains based on a biased classifier. They potentially deteriorate the intrinsic target clusters. (b)Our approach enforces the Neighbor Class Consistency on target features, therefore progressivelystrengthen the instrinsic discrimination of target features while regularizing the unified classifier lessbiased towards source data.
