Figure 1: (a) We generate counterfactual images by moving along the direction of the classifierweights w of the attractive class and inverting it back to the input. Last row shows the saliencymaps from the center row (logit y=0) to the top row (y=8). Blue marks features changed into adifferent direction and red marks features getting enhanced. (b) We extract principal components(L=ei, R=-ei) orthogonal to the classifier weight w. All images in a row have the exact same logitscore given on the left. The saliency maps show the change between the bottom (y=-8) and top (y=8).

(b) Integrationof the raw feature attribution values, e.g. gradient w.r.t. to a single neuron. The gradient (grad)results in a strong logit change (given on toP) but fails to create visible changes. Differences withthe original images (img) are magnified below (×10). SmoothGrad and the resPective Penalizedversion (pe.gr andpe.s.g), show similar results. The directional derivative d夕-1/dw adds sunglasses.

Figure 6: Parameters in the TWO4TWO dataset. The objects in the TWO4TWO dataset are Stickyshown in (a) and Stretchy shown in (b). Each animal consists of a spine of four blocks and two sets ofarms at either end. For Sticky, the right set of arms is moved inwards. For the stretchy class, bothsets of arms are moved outwards. (a) background and (b) animal colors can be changed. (c) Theindividual blocks can be spherical, cubic or something in between This is achieved by rounding offcubes until they become spherical. (d) The animals can take a random pose.

Figure 9:	CelebA correlation matrix indicating the relationship among the annotated labels. Thelabels are sorted according to a hierarchical clustering on the correlation values. There are two strongclusters of labels (upper left and lower right), in which e.g., the label Attractiveness belongs to thesame cluster (lower right) as Wearing Lipstick while the label Male belongs to the other cluster. Thisconfirms the biases highlighted by our method.
