Figure 1: The workflow of Efficient-Adam in the Parameter-Server model. For each worker, parame-ters are updated via Adam. For the server, information is gathered and averaged to update parameters.
Figure 3: Results of the stochastic convex case for N = 10 for different method.
Figure 4: Results of image classification. The upper row shows the training loss and the bottom rowshows the testing accuracy. "err_s", represents Efficient-Adam without error feedback on server and"err_w" represents Efficient-Adam without error feedback on workers.
