Figure 1: Learning meta-features with Dida. Top: the Dida architecture (BN stands for batchnorm; FC for fully connected layer). Bottom left: Learning meta-features for patch identificationusing a Siamese architecture (section 4.1). Bottom right: learning meta-features for performancemodelling, specifically to rank two hyper-parameter configurationsθ 1 andθ 2 (section 4.2).
