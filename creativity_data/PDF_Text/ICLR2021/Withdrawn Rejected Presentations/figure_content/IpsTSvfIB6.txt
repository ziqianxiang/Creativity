Figure 2: Performance of the approximate BvNDon synthetic data: for different matrix sizes. (top)Reconstruction error as a function of the numberof components. (bottom) Histogram of the orthogo-nalization error of each component.
Figure 3: Static fairness exposure on toy data: a) Unfair ranking; b) Ranking satisfiesthe disparate exposure constraint. We decompose a fair probabilistic ranking using theapproximate and differentiable BvND using three components.
Figure 4:	Performance of the fairness controller as a function of the parameter λ: Both meth-ods, BvN and Diff-BvN display almost the same behavior across values of the regularizationparameter. These values correspond to ten trials of the simulated news data of 3000 users.
Figure 5:	Performance of the fairness controller (λ = 0.01) as a function of the number ofusers: Both methods, BvN and Diff-BvN display the same convergence behavior on variousmetrics computed on ten trials of the simulated news data (3000 users).
