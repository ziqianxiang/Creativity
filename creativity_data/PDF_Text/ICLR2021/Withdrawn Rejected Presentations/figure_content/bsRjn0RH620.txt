Figure 1: t-SNE visualization of features of novel classes. The first column: feature space is learntin conventional training. The second and third column: feature space is learnt with disMSE anddisKL. In each dataset, 5 novel classes are randomly sampled. Backbone: ResNet-12. Base learner:PN. Best viewed in color.
