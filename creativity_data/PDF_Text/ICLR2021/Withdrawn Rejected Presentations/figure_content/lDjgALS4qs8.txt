Figure 4: The effect of sentence length and layers on performanceof 27.5. For both tasks, weight-gate is the most effective among all fusing methods. Using weight-gate to weight different groups of subgraphs has shown indeed helpful.

Figure 6: An example of layer-level iteration in Figure 2. Note that in one layer, layer-level iterationonly operates once which only takes output of previous layer as input and generates new subgraphs.
