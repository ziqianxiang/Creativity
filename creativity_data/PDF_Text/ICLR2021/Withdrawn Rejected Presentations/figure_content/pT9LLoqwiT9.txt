Figure 1: Amodal Completion with Compositional Priors. (a) demonstrates the object cluster thatthe compositional prior in (b) is trained on. We observe an optimization of the compositional priorfrom iteration 0 (top) to iteration 2 (bottom). Lastly, (c) shows amodal estimation from modal (blue)to amodal (green) bounding box. The pixel-level labels, F, O, and C, are depicted as blue, red,green, scaled by their responses, respectively.
Figure 2: Qualitative Amodal Instance Segmentation Results. From the top to the bottom row, wepresent the raw image, BBTP/PCNet-M predictions, our methodâ€™s predictions, and Ground Truth.
