Figure 1: An overview of the proposed protocol for distributed k-CSSp in the column partition model.
Figure 2: Results on synthetic and TechTC. The green line denotes Greedy k-CSS1,2, the orangelines denotes Regular k-CSS1,2, and the blue line denotes SVD.
Figure 3: Plots (a) and (C) show minimum '1 error across 15 trials on gastro_lesions andsecom respectively, while plots (b) and (d) show the mean `1 errors and the standard deviation. Forranks 90 and 120, our protocol affords a 3% improvement in minimum error secom, while for rank30 on gastro-lesions, our protocol gives over 40% improvement. Note that the mean error forboth protocols is noticeably higher on gastro_lesions — in the case of our protocol, the error inthe case k = 30 is distorted by two trials with `1 errors 205827 and 134945 respectively.
Figure 4: Plots (a) and (b) show the average work and span respectively for gastro_lesions,while plots (c) and (d) show the average work and span for secom. As expected, our protocol usingGREEDY k-CSS1,2 takes more time — to our knowledge, there is not yet an optimization similar toLAZIER-THAN-LAZY GREEDY for the '1,2-norm. Nevertheless, running time is less important thancommunication in the distributed setting.
Figure 5: Results on bcsstk13, isolet, and caltech-101 from top to bottom. The left plotsshow minimum error across all 15 trails; the right plots show the corresponding mean and standarddeviation in error. In all plots, the first bar denotes SVD, the second bar denotes greedy k-CSS1,2,and the rest of the bars denote all settings of regular k-CSS1,2, at all ranks on the axis 10 through 60.
Figure 6: Results on bcsstk13, isolet, and caltech-101 from top to bottom. The left plotsshow average work in seconds across all 15 trails; the right plots show the corresponding averagespan. In all plots, the first bar denotes greedy k-CSS1,2, and the rest of the bars denote all settings ofregular k-CSS1,2, at all ranks on the axis 10 through 60.
