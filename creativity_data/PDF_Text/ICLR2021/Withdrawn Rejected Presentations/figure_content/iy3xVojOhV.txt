Figure 1: Ablation study for size of fake nodes B . It can be shown that moderate size of fake nodesCan boost the classifier in graph-based SSL.
Figure 2: Representation of the generated nodes during training process. Karat club: Real nodes areshown as colored dots representing different manually assigned groups. Three fake nodes (black)are generated, for fake nodes, the initial generated adjacency vectors are set as 1, after training,fake nodes mainly connect to the boundary nodes; MNIST: One fake image as nodeâ€™s feature aregenerated, after training, the fake image shows the shape around to digit eight; Cora: 256 fake nodes(black) with features are generated, the plots show the t-SNE embedding for the feature space of thegraph, the generated nodes show as a complementary part for the existed nodes (colored dots).
