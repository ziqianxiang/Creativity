Hence,function evaluations are in the range [0, 2k(k - 1)], and a function evaluation of zero corresponds toa Latin square of order k. We consider a noisy version of this problem, where an additive Gaussiannoise with zero mean and standard deviation of 0.1 is added to function evaluations observed by eachalgorithm. Both ECO-F and ECO-G outperform the baselines with a considerable margin. In addition,ECO-G outperforms COMBO until time step t = 190. At larger time steps, COMBO outperformsthe other algorithms, however, this performance comes at the price of a far larger computation time.
