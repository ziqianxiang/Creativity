Figure 1: The convergence curves of the two versions of DSPGD and standard deviation curves ofthe normalized recover error on the Mushrooms dataset and the MNIST-small dataset.
Figure 2: The average communication cost per iteration of the two versions of DSPGD.
Figure 3: The NMI score versus the average communication cost of FK k-means and the existingmethods on the four datasets.
Figure 4: The values of Q0 and Q1 versus the number of iteration t for the four real-world datasetswhere T = log「2 log2 T〕.
Figure 5: The rank of Zt versus the number of iteration t for the four real-world datasetsthe value of t inCreases. Besides, the uPPer bound of rt is a Constant faCtor larger than the numberof eigenveCtors s in Table 1, and suCh uPPer bound is muCh smaller than the number of users’ loCaldata samPles, whiCh Can exPlain the dramatiCal reduCtion on the CommuniCation Cost in Figure 2.
