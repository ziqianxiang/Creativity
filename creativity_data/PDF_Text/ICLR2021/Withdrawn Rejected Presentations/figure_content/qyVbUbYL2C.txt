Figure 1: Diagram of training and testing flow for single blur trainingvisual angle. AlexNet and SqueezeNet accept input images of size 227 x 227 x 3 pixels (Krizhevskyet al., 2012). At the age of one month, infant visual acuity is about 30 arc minutes or 1/2 of a degree.

Training on a sequence of low to high resolution images allows for significantly morerobust image recognition that is impacted less by degradation that comes from image blur. In somecases, this overall gain comes at the cost of losing some accuracy when classifying high resolutionimages, particularly with AlexNet. For most training regimes, classification accuracy for higherresolution images is close to equivalent for higher blur training, while improvements for higher blurclassification are still significant.

Thehuman visual system is far more robust than CNN vision for reasons that are not yet entirely clear.
