Figure 1: Flowchart of the proposed safety verification algorithm. The rectangle on the left repre-sents the flow for computing the forward reachable tube (FRT), which can only state if π(s) is safeor unsafe for S0 . The rectangle on the right presents the flow for computing the backward reachabletube (BRT), which is invoked if π(s) is unsafe. The BRT analysis can compute the subset of safeinitial states Ssaf e for π(s), if such a set exists.
Figure 2: (Left) The environment for the safe land navigation problem. (Middle) The FRTs for boththe augmented learnt model dynamics and true system dynamics classify the controller as unsafe.
Figure 3: (Left) The safe aerial navigation domain. (Middle) The FRT is computed for the aug-mented learnt dynamics. For clarity in 3D, FRT with true dynamics is not plotted; instead theapproximation quality can be better visualized in BRT. (Right) Comparison of Ssaf e computed bythe proposed BRT algorithm with the ground truth data of the safe initial states, marked in green(and unsafe states marked in red), it is observed that the BRT over approximates Sunsaf e .
