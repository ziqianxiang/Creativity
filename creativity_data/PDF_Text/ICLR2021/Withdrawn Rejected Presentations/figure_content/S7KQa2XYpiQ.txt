Figure 1: Illustration on AFD: with samples from support sets of novel classes, features are obtainedby using a pre-trained feature extractor F and then these features are passed through the featurenormalization layer which is parameterized by a scale vector; with using a non-parametric evaluationmetrics gradients flow into optimizing the scale vector.
