Figure 1: Representation of source and target words in the input (Min) and output (Mout) matrix infastText (skip-gram). The sentence is “a quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog”, the current wordwi is “brown” and the context window size is 2. The words in the corpus are represented as indicesof the corresponding rows in Min and Mout.
Figure 2: Dependency between our code variants of skip-gram and CBOW. The experiments for the“NS” variants (no box frames) are only shown in the appendix due to inferior experimental accuracy.
