Figure 1: Graphical model.
Figure 2: Qualitative results. Compared with previous methods, VarSal visually captures the mostsophisticated borderlines and object-oriented saliency map.
Figure 3: Prior selection.
Figure 4: Sanity check.
Figure 5: (a) Quantitative results for pixel perturbation benchmark The results verify the usefulnessof our method. (b) Time complexity of each interpretability methods. SG-sq. refers to SmoothGrad-squared.
Figure 6: Sampled saliency map.
Figure 7: Uncertainty over the explanation. The posterior distribution of saliency map gives twosummaries, which are the explanation (mean) and the uncertainty over the explanation (standarddeviation). They are compared qualitatively on the original dataset and two different shifted dataset.
