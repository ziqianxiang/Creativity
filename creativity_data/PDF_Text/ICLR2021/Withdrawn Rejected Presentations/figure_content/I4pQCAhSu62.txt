Figure 1: Synthetic MNIST data. We synthesize new images by adding a scaled down version of arandom digit to a random corner. Images synthesized from digits 5-9 keep their label (Figure 1b)while images synthesized from digits 0-4 are considered to be of a different class (Figure 1c). In thissetup corner pixels are informative only in a certain context.
Figure 2: Class distribution. Train split is highlyunbalanced with classes 10-14 appearing rarely.
Figure 3: Two types of random noise, used toevaluate notions of robustness.
Figure 4: Visualization of utility averaged over classes (modulo 10) within one batch. Each of theten panels shows the average image on the left, and the average utility on the right. We can see thatthe corner pixels have high utility only in a certain context. When the central digit is 0-4, the cornerpixels are important, since they can flip the class, but when the central digit is 5-9 they are not.
