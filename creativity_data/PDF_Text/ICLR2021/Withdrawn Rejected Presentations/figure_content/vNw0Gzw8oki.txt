Figure 1: The posterior distribution of the learned solution functions on 1stODE. The red lines in the middle arethe posterior means and the red dashed lines on the boundary of the shaded region the posterior mean plus/minusone posterior standard deviation. The black line is the ground-truth solution. The training inputs stay in [0, 0.1](e) SKL (PSD)(f) DKL (PSD)(g) LFM (PSD)(h) PI-DKL (PSD)Figure 2: The absolute value of the difference between the posterior mean and the ground-truth (1st row) andposterior standard deviation (2nd row) on IdDiffuSion. The training examples Stay on t = 0.5 (the green line).
