Figure 1: Left: The matrix representation of a general linear SOp2q equivariant operator T acting onthe spherical harmonic expansion coefficients of a function f P L2 pS2q. Note that the coefficientshave been grouped by their order (superscript). Right: The matrix representation of an SOp3qequivariant linear operator. The matrix elements shown in the same color are identical, since allcoefficients of the same degree are multiplied by the same number.
Figure 2: Correlation interpretation of an SOp2q equivariant transformation. To the left, four pointsare shown, positioned at two azimuths φ1 and φ2, and polar angles θ1 and θ2 . To compute theresponse at a point pθ, φq, the polar-dependent filter hθ is rotated around the z-axis by φ, as shownin (b), before being multiplied with the input signal f and integrated over the sphere. This is similarto regular correlation in R2, except that changing θ does not translate the filter, but rather morphsthe filter into a new one. The operator shown is the partial derivative B{Bφ.
Figure 3: (a) The equivariance error ∆ as a function of the number of consecutive correlation andReLU layers in the network Φ. (b) Accuracy during training of the network with general block-diagonal correlation filters. The accuracy is plotted both for the original test set, as well as for arotated version of the test set, where each image has been randomly rotated about the z-axis.
Figure 4: Accuracy during training of the discretized sphere implementation of Jiang et al. (2019)and our SFT-based implementation. The accuracy is plotted both for the original test set, as well asfor a rotated version of the test set, where each image has been randomly rotated about the z-axis.
