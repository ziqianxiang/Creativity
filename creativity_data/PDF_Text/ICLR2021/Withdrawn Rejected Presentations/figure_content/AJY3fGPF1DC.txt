Figure 1: Method overview. We propose selectingITE model whose predictions of the treatment effectson the target domain satisfy the causal relationshipsin the interventional causal graph GT.
Figure 2: ICMS is unique in that it calculates a causalrisk (green) using predictions on target data. Purplearrows denote pathways unique to ICMS.

Figure 7: Performance gain in terms of known edges into the outcome node.
Figure 8: Performance of ICMS on incorrect graphs using IWCV(DEV(IF)). ∆PEHE-10 error isthe difference of the PEHE-10 error of GT and GT using ICMS versus the percentage of graphicaldistance (in terms of total edges). GT is the oracle causal graph and is held static across the x-axis.
