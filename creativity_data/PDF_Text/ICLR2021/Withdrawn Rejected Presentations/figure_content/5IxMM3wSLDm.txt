Figure 1: Rotated CPC consists of a patch-level encoder genc , a CPC module, and a rotation clas-sifier. Within the CPC module, there are 4 autoregressive model and projection layer pairs for eachprediction direction (i.e. d âˆˆ {top-down, bottom-up, right-left, left-right}). To optimize its objectiveon rotated images, the CPC module is forced to learn separate latent subspaces.
