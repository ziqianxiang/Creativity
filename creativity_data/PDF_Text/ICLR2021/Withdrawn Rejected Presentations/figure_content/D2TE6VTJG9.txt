Figure 1: Left two: how MSE scales with k (the dimension of Y ) and CI (ACI 4.1) with the linearfunction class. Right two: how MSE scales with k and e with ψ* and non-linear function class.
Figure 2: Performance on SST of baseline φ1(x1), i.e. bag-of-words, and learned ψ(x1) for the twosettings. Left: Classification accuracy, Right: Regression MSE.
Figure 3: Left: MSE of using ψ to predict Y versus using X1 directly to predict Y . Using ψconsistently outperforms using X1. Right: MSE of ψ learned with different n1. The MSE scale with1/n2 as indicated by our analysis. Simulations are repeated 100 times, with the mean shown in solidline and one standard error shown in shadow.
Figure 4: Left: Example of the X2 (in the red box of the 1st row), the X1 (out of the red box of the1st row), the input to the inpainting task (the second row), ψ(X1) (the 3 row in the red box), and inthis example Y = 1967. Middle: Mean Squared Error comparison of yearbook regression predictingdates. Right: Mean Absolute Error comparison of yearbook regression predicting dates. Experimentsare repeated 10 times, with the mean shown in solid line and one standard error shown in shadow.
Figure 5: Left: Mean Squared Error comparison of predicting gender and predicting date. Right: thespectrum comparison of covariance condition on gender and condition on date.
