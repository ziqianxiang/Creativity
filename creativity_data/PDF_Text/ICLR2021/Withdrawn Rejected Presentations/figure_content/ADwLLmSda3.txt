Figure 4: The S3(00 (top) and S(I)(bottom) matrices produced by Neu-ral NCPD on the Twitter dataset.
Figure 5: Standard ranks 4 and 2NCPD of the Twitter dataset. Ateach rank, we display the top fivekeywords and candidate and tempo-ral mode heatmaps.
Figure 6: We display seven of 37 extracted frames from a year-long time-lapse video of a forest.
Figure 7: A three-layer Neural NCPD of the time-lapse video at ranks r = 8, r0 = 6, and ri = 3.
Figure 8: A decomposition of the time-lapse video byrank 3 NMF on slices of the tensor along the chromaticmode. For each color, we display the three topics inspatial (left) and temporal (right) modes. Relative re-construction loss is 0.101.
Figure 9: Here We display the projections onto all three modes for the original data tensor X andapproximations of X at ranks r = 7, r(0) = 5, and r(1) = 3 produced by Neural NCPD, StandardHNCPD, and HNTF at tWo levels of noise.
Figure 10: Here We display a three-layer HNTF on the TWitter dataset from Section 3.2 at ranksr = 8, r(0) = 4, and r(1) = 2, run separately for each of the possible ordering on the data tensor. Wedisplay the top keywords and heatmaps of topics in the candidate and temporal modes at ranks 4 (left)and 2 (right). We note that the rank 8 factorization is identical to that of Neural NCPD, so We do notre-display it here (see section 3.2).
Figure 11: Here we display the first 36 of 37 frames of the time lapse video dataset from Section 3.3(The 37th frames is included in Figure 6In Figure 11, we display the first 36 of 37 frames of the time lapse video dataset from Section 3.3(the 37th frame is included in Figure 6) in order to make it clear how seasons progress throughoutthe frames. We see that the video begins in the white winter months, transitions to spring at aroundframe 16, and stays green until it transitions to fall around frame 28.
