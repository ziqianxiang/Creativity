Figure 1: Overview. We collect and calibrate frames from the unmodified environment (shown inthe green box), and given a choice of attack pattern parameters, composite the pattern to createapproximate renderings of frames corresponding to placing the pattern in the environment. Ourcomposition function is differentiable with respect to the attack pattern parameters, and we are thusable to use end-to-end gradient-based optimization when attacking a differentiable control network,to cause the network to output incorrect controls that cause the vehicle to deviate from its intendedtrajectory (from the green to the blue trajectory, as shown in the right column), and crash.
Figure 2: Trajectory deviations induced by attack. For four example scenarios, we illustrate the effectof the attack patterns found by the proposed GradOpt method and BO, by showing trajectories takenby the vehicle in the simulator when these patterns are placed on the road, and comparing these to theoriginal trajectory in the unmodified environment.
