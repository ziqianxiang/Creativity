Figure 1: Comparison between the vanilla GAN loss and the Intervention loss. Here the intervenedsamples are generated through different intervention operations, namely O1 , ..., Ok.
Figure 2: The supports of the two orig-inal distribution are the squares withblack border, and the supports of the syn-thetic distributions are the area enclosedby red and blue dotted line, respectively.

Figure 5: Training curves of different methods in terms of FID on different datasets, averaged overfive runs. Left: CIFAR10. Right: Church Outdoors. Note that the raise of curves in the later stagemay indicate mode collapse.
