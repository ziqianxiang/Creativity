Figure 1: We propose an approach, using the regions ignored by the attention mechanism (e.g., hairor background), as noise estimates. We train a model to learn a denoising mapping to remove thesenoise sources from the physiological signal. Our approach produces more accurate physiologicalwaveforms, even in severely challenging scenarios.
Figure 2: Temporal changes of background (gray), hair(green) and skin (red) pixel intensities in a video arecorrelated due to large change (e.g., motion, shadows).
Figure 3: Pulse signals output by a state-of-the-art network and our denoising method. Our methodproduces cleaner signals, free from motion artifacts (present in the benchmark method), and bettermatching the ground truth subtle dynamics and shape. Notice the zoomed-in portions with easilyidentifiable dicrotic notch and diastolic peaks in our outputs.
Figure 4: Examples of attention masks, inverse attention masks (yellow=higher weight) and thecorresponding original physiological estimates, the noise estimates (shown for the green channelonly for visual clarity), and denoised physiological signals from AFRL (left) and MMSE-HR (right)datasets. Green lines indicate the ground truth HR.
Figure 5: Proposed denoising architecture. The encoder provides the initial physiological signal andthe noise estimates to the LSTM at each time step which outputs a denoised physiological signal.
Figure 6: Examples of images used to evaluate ourproposed approach.
Figure 7: Respiration signals output by a state-of-the-art network and our denoising method. Thesignals produced by our method are cleaner andmatch the ground truth better.
