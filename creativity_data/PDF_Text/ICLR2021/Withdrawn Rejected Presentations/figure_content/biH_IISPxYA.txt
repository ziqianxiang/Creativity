Figure 1: The proposed MGPLL model. It consists of an adversarial generative model at the labellevel with a conditional noise label generator Gn and a discriminator Dn , and an adversarial gener-ative model at the feature level with a conditional sample generator Gx and a discriminator Dx . Theprediction network F builds connections between these two level generative models while providingan inverse mapping for Gx .
Figure 2: Test accuracy of each comparison method as increases from 0.1 to 0.7 (with 100%partially labeled examples [p = 1] and one false positive candidate label [r = 1]).
Figure 3: Test accuracy of each comparison method changes as (co-occurring probability of thecoupling label) increases from 0.1 to 0.7 (with 100% partially labeled examples [p = 1] and onefalse positive candidate label [r = 1]).
Figure 4: Test accuracy of each comparison method changes as p (proportion of partially labeledexamples) increases from 0.1 to 0.7 (with one false positive candidate label [r = 1]).
Figure 5: Test accuracy of each comparison method changes as p (proportion of partially labeledexamples) increases from 0.1 to 0.7 (with two false positive candidate label [r = 2]).
Figure 6: Test accuracy of each comparison method changes as p (proportion of partially labeledexamples) increases from 0.1 to 0.7 (with three false positive candidate label [r = 3]).
