Figure 1:	Recalibration results for ImageNet under the “fog” perturbation, with varying (1a) number of privatedata sources, (1b) number of samples per data source, and (1c) privacy level . Acc-T does best in these settings.
Figure 2:	Recalibration results for CIFAR-100 under the “jpeg compression” perturbation, with varying (2a)number of private data sources, (2b) number of samples per source, and (2c) privacy level . Acc-T does best.
Figure 3:	Recalibration results for CIFAR-10 under the “motion blur” perturbation, with varying (3a) number ofprivate data sources, (3b) number of samples per source, and (3c) privacy level . Acc-T does best.
Figure 52: Recalibration results for CIFAR-10 under the “snow” perturbation with a perturbation severity of 1,with different clipping thresholds. Number of sources = 50, number of samples per source = 30, and = 1.0.
