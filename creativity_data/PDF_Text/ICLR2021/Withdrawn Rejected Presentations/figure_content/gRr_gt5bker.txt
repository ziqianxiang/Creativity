Figure 1: In each subfigure, the left part visualizes the joint policy π(a1, a2|s) on the joint ac-tion space [-3, 3]2 and the right part shows the corresponding marginal policies (e.g., ∏ι(aι∣s)=a π(a1, a2|s)da2) as well as the copula c(F1(a1 |s), F2(a2 |s)) on the unit cube. Here Fi is thecumulative distribution function of the marginal ∏i(a∕s) and Ui := Fi(a∕s) is the uniformly dis-tributed random variable obtained by probability integral transform with Fi . More details and defi-nitions can be found in Section 3.2.

Figure 3: Generated trajectories on RoboCupdataset using independent modeling or copula.
Figure 4: (a) Trajectories of 10 players (except the goalkeeper) of the left team in one RoboCupgame; (b) Copula density between x-axis of the L2 player and x-axis of another player (L3 〜L11).
Figure 5: Original and generated trajectories on Driving dataset. The x-axis is timestamp and y-axisis the location (1D coordinate) of two cars.
