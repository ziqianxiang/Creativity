Figure 2:	Portion of the Zork1 quest structure visualized as a directed acyclic graph. Each noderepresents a state; clouds represent areas of high branching factor with labels indicating some of theactions that must be performed to progresswhere each vertex is tuple v = hsl , si, r(s)i containing information on some state s such that slare location dependencies, si are inventory dependencies, and r(s) is the reward associated withthe state. There is a directed edge e âˆˆ E between any two vertices such that the originating statemeets the requirements sl and si of the terminating vertex. D can be topologically sorted into levelsL = {l1, ..., ln} where each level represents a set of game states that are not dependant on each other.
