Figure 1: Overview of SLAPS. At the top, a generator receives the node features and producesa non-symmetric, non-normalized adjacency having (potentially) both positive and negative values(Section 4.1). The adjacency processor makes the values positive, symmetrizes and normalizesthe adjacency (Section 4.2). The resulting adjacency and the node features go into GNNC whichpredicts the node classes (Section 4.3). At the bottom, some noise is added to the node features.
Figure 2: The dashed edge receives no su-pervision when training a two-layer GCN asit is not in the two-hop neighborhood of anylabeled node.
Figure 3: The performance of SLAPS (a) compared to SLAPS2s on Cora with different generators,(b) with MLP graph generator on Cora and Citeseer as a function of Î», (C) with different graphgenerators on Cora as a function of k in kNN, and (d) on Cora and Citeseer with different adjacencysymmetrizations. (e) The odds of two nodes in the test set sharing the same label as a function ofthe edge weights learned by SLAPS.
