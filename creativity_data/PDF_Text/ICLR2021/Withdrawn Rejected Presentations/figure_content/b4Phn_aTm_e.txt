Figure 2: Cross-view consistency loss. Monoc-ular depth or semantic segmentation maps arewarped using dlpgt and drpgt , and the consistencylosses are measured using equation 3 and equa-tion 7. Dotted lines mean a warping operatorG(a; b), and solid lines denote the cross-view con-sistency losses. As summarized in Table 1, eitherSipgt or Sigt is used as supervision for semantic seg-Furthermore, we extend the cross-view consis-tency to the monocular depth estimation, whichmentation.
