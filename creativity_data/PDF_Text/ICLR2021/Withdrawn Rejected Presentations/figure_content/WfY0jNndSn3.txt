Figure 1: An overview of the DISUSE. The left part reveals the pre-trained models could learnartifactual causality for the question-clue pair relations, and make incorrect prediction. The rightpart reveals our DISUSE can relieve this faultiness by erasing less important clues and preservesmore important ones in the form of probability under the help of erasure sampler. The dotted boxesrepresent the corresponding objects are erased, and the digits denote the probabilities of erasure.
Figure 2: Framework of the proposed DISUSE for commonsense reasoning. The upper left partexpresses the vanilla context/question pair and its erased pair generated by erasure sampler whichcan assign a probability of erasure to each clue and is shown in the middle part. The supervisor inthe right part is employed to progressively improve the quality of erasure sampler by maximizingagreement between the erased sample and its vanilla sample over answer prediction distribution.
Figure 3: Detailed procedure of the erasuresampler. The highlight digits represent thesoft boundary and its corresponding proba-bility of erasure.
