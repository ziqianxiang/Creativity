Figure 2: Preference test result with Non-AttentiveTacotron with Gaussian upsampling comparedagainst Tacotron 2 (GMMA).
Figure 3: Single word pace control with sentence“I’m so saddened about the devastation in Big Basin.”The top spectrogram is with regular pace. The restslow down the words “saddened”, “devastation”, and“Big Basin” respectively to 0.67× the regular paceby scaling the predicted duration by 1.5×.
