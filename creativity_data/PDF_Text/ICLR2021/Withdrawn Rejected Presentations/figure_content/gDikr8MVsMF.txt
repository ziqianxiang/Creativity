Figure 1: The GraPhMIX architecture, comprising individual agents that make their decisions in adecentralized manner, alongside a mixing GNN that is used for centralized training of the agents.
Figure 2: Screenshots of the four considered SMAC maps at the beginning of each episode.
Figure 3: Comparison of the mean training return and median test win rate achieved by GraphMIXand QMIX (Rashid et al., 2018) on the four SMAC maps under study.
Figure 4: Trade-off between the average attention received by an agent from its (alive) team-mates,the effective fraction of global reward allocated to that agent, and the agentâ€™s median distance to theenemy units. Each point represents an alive agent in a single time step within a batch of transitionssampled from the experience buffer while training GraphMIX.
