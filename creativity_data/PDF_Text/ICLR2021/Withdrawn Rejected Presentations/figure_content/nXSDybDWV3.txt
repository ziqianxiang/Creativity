Figure 1: Linear regression example model in NumPyro with EinStein VI for inferenceStein Variational Inference (Liu and Wang, 2016) is a recent non-parametric approach to VI whichuses a set of particles {zi }iN=1 as the approximating distribution q(z) to provide better flexibility incapturing correlations between latent variables. The technique preserves the scalability of traditionalVI approaches while offering the flexibility and modelling scope of techniques such as Markov ChainMonte Carlo (MCMC). Stein VI has been shown to be good at capturing multi-modality (Liu andWang, 2016; Wang and Liu, 2019a), and has useful theoretical interpretations as particles following agradient flow (Liu, 2017) and as a moment matching optimization system (Liu and Wang, 2018).
