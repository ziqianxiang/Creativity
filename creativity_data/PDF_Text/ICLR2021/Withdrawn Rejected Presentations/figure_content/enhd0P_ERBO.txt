Figure 1: An example of mCVRP. (Left) a snapshot of environment state at time t. The circular rangeof each vehicle indicates the possible moving range with the current fuel level. (Right) a feasiblesolution of the environment example.
Figure 2: Sequential decision-making framework with trained GRLTS.
Figure 3: Nc = 100, Nv = 5 case of mCVRP(c) Final state using train epoch#420 modelFigure 3 depicts the evaluation case (Nc = 100, Nv = 5 case of mCVRP) during training process.
Figure 6: Performance curves of training (1st row) and testing (2nd, 3rd and 4th rows). Note that weplot a reward curve and cover ratio curves in 1st column for training and tesing, respectively.
