Figure 1:	For each algorithm, we show the convergence of the value estimate at the root node to therespective optimal value (top), to the UCT optimal value (middle), and the regret (bottom).
Figure 2:	For different branching factor k (rows) and depth d (columns), the heatmaps show: theabsolute error of the value estimate at the root node after the last simulation of each algorithm w.r.t.
Figure 3: Cumulative rewards of AlphaZero with UCT and entropy-based operators, in CartPole (a)and Acrobot (b). Results are averaged over 5 and 10 seeds and show 95% confidence intervals.
