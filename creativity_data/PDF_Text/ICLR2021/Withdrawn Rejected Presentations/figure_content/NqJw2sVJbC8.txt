Figure 1: Two targeted universal adversarial attacks computed on the same model (MLP trained onFord data)τu月 IUniversal perturbations bring to light two important features of these price predictors. The first isthat targeted universal perturbations, which are generally less effective, have a major impact on theperformance of these models. The models are vulnerable even to these weak attacks. Second, thetargeted universal attacks expose interpretable model behavior. In Figure 1, we see that the attackercreates local extrema in the order book which cause the model to anticipate mean reversion. Furthervisualizations of adversarial order book perturbations can be found in Appendix A.4.
Figure 2: This sample of the SWA curve for GE data shows an example of an input snippet. The labelfor this input is determined by the change in price from the right end of the green snippet to the greendot.
Figure 3: The unperturbed and perturbed order books (top left and top right, respectively). Thebottom two images show the unpropagated and propagated adversarial perturbations (left and right,respectively). In this instance, the addition of the bottom right image to the clean signal in the topleft yields the perturbed input in the top right. Note that the difference between the perturbed andunperturbed signals is not noticeable here, where the model was fooled into incorrectly classifyingthe SWA as going up.
Figure 4: Examples of two targeted universal adversarial attacks computed on the same linear modelon Ford data. The perturbation on the left was computed without constraint, while the perturbation tothe right is the result of the same process with an added penalty on relative size. The penalized attackshows a sparser perturbation which is still nearly as effective at fooling the model.
