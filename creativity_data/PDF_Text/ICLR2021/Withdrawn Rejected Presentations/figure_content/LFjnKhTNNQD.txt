Figure 1: Images from ImageNet variants along with classification scores by a pre-trainedResNet-50 model. The right-most image is generated by our Adversarial Batch Normalizationmodule. Details on how we generate this image can be found in Section 3.
Figure 2: Examples of perturbed ImageNet images generated by AdvBN with a decoder. Thefirst row contains the original versions from the ImageNet validation set.
Figure 3: The effect of adversarial strength on visualized examples. = 0 corresponds to imagesreconstructed by our autoencoder without AdvBN.
Figure 5: More example images. For each pair of adjacent columns, original versions are on the left,ImageNet-AdvBN-VGG is on the right.
