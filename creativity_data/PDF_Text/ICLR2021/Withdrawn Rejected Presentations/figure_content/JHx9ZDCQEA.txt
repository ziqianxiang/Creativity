Figure 1: Condensation polymerization for synthesizing PET. We use shaded color regions to highlightthe monomers (light blue), polymer (light pink), repeat unit (dark pink), end-groups (purple), andby-product (light yellow). Unit polymer is a polymer with unit length (n = 1).
Figure 2: PolyRetro beam search framework. Given the repeat unit r, We first generate unit polymercandidates U by polymer induction. We then rank the candidates using p(u∣r) and sample monomers(mi, m2) from the top-n unit polymers. Next we re-rank the unit polymer and monomer pair(u, mi ,m2) using the joint p(u, m1,m2∣r) = p(u∣r) ∙ p(m1,m2∣u) and perform the synthesizabilitycheck on (mi, m2) using Retro*, a multi-step retrosynthesis planner. Finally the top-k results whichpass the check are returned.
Figure 3: Polymer induction for generatingunit polymer candidates. For each of thereaction template, we apply it to the doublerepeat unit, if it can break the bond connect-ing two repeat units into two end-groups.
Figure 4: Percentages of targets recovered by algorithms in top-k prediction. Left: unit polymersprediction using p(u∣r); Right: monomer prediction using p(u∣r) ∙ p(m1,m2∣u). We also showPolyRetro’s performance upper bounds after addressing the labeled constraints on the right.
