Figure 1:	autoregressive factorization assessment. Figures a) and b) correspond to Factored ppoperformance in the Google Football 3 vs 1 keeper environment. Figure c) compares fppo and fsacin the gym platform environment.
Figure 2:	Independent factorization assessment. fsac (in blue) vs fppo (in purple) in factoredMujoco environments. We use independent factorization for both agents.
Figure 3: Study on the impact of the entropy target in fsac on the Humanoid-v2 environment. Eachrun has been averaged over 4 seeds. In this example, all dimensions share the same entropy targetHi = β log 17. Each run represented corresponds to a different value of parameter β.
