Figure 1: Behavior of α with (a) varying stepsize η andbatch-size b, (b) d and σ, (c) under RMSProp.
Figure 2: Results on FCNs. Different markers represent different initializations with the same η, b.
Figure 4: The curve h(a, S) = 1 in the (a, S) planeGeometrically, we see from Figure 4 that the curve S(a) as a function of a, is sandwiched betweentwo rectangular boxes and has necessarily S0(a) < 0. This can also be directly obtained rigorouslyfrom the implicit function theorem; if we differentiate the implicit equation h(a, S(a)) = 0 withrespect to a, we obtain∂h	∂h	0(a- (a*, s*) + ^τj~(a*, s*)s (a*) = 0 .
