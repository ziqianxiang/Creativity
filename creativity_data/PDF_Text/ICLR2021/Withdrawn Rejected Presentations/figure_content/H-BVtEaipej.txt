Figure 1: Ablation study on CLUSTER dataset. TheX-axis represent the ratio between the rank parameterK and the average graph size n = 117. The Y-axisrepresent the network’s accuracyH Implementation DetailsIn this section we describe the datasets on which we performed our evaluation. In addition, wespecify the hyperparameters for the experiments section in the paper. The rest of the model con-figurations are determined directly by the evaluation protocols defined by the benchmarks. It isworth noting that most of our experiments ran on a single Tesla V-100 GPU, if not stated other-wise. We performed our parameter search only on κ and d (except for CIFAR10 and MNIST werewe searched over different dropout values), since the rest of the parameters were dictated by theevaluation protocol. The models sizes were restricted by the allowed parameter budget.
