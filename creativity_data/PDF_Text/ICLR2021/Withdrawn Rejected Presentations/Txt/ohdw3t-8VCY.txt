Text Summarization

Paper under double-blind review
Ab stract
Current summarization systems yield generic summaries that are disconnected
from users’ preferences and expectations. To address this limitation, we present
CTRLsum, a novel framework for controllable summarization. Our approach
enables users to control multiple aspects of generated summaries by interacting
with the summarization system through textual input in the form of a set of key-
words or descriptive prompts. Using a single unified model, CTRLsum is able to
achieve a broad scope of summary manipulation at inference time without requir-
ing additional human annotations or pre-defining a set of control aspects during
training. We quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on three
domains of summarization datasets and five control aspects: 1) entity-centric and 2)
length-controllable summarization, 3) contribution summarization on scientific pa-
pers, 4) invention purpose summarization on patent filings, and 5) question-guided
summarization on news articles in a reading comprehension setting. Moreover,
when used in a standard, uncontrolled summarization setting, CTRLsum achieves
state-of-the-art results on the CNN/DailyMail dataset.1
1	Introduction
Neural summarization systems aim to compress a document into a short paragraph or sentence
while preserving key information. There are largely two categories of summarization systems:
extractive summarization that extracts important portions of a document (Cheng & Lapata, 2016;
Nallapati et al., 2017; Narayan et al., 2018), and abstractive summarization that freely generates novel
sentences (Rush et al., 2015; See et al., 2017; Paulus et al., 2018) which can produce coherent and
fluent summaries more flexibly. In this paper we focus on abstractive summarization.
Typically abstractive summarization methods take a document as input and yield a generic summary
to cover certain information identified by the model. However, content of interest is user-dependent.
Summaries should select information with respect to preferences of a user. For example, Figure 1
shows an NBA basketball news article, and the reference summary describes several match results.
However, fans of certain basketball stars in these teams such as Lebron James or Stephen Curry might
only be interested in the matches they played and would like to know the player’s scores as well.
Motivated by this, we focus on controllable summarization which allows the users to manipulate
the summaries from the model. We propose CTRLsum, a framework to control summaries through
control tokens in the form of a set of keywords or descriptive prompts. At training time, the model
learns to predict summaries conditioned on both the source document and keywords that serve as
external guidance. During inference, keywords and optional prompts, which are the target prefix to
constrain decoding, are combined as control tokens to convey user preferences as shown in Figure 1.
Keywords and prompts are complementary. Prompts do not perform well in many cases such as entity
or length controlled summarization as our preliminary experiments imply, but keywords can achieve
those goals in a flexible way, for example, by using entity as keywords or varying the number of
keywords to control entities and length respectively. However, keywords struggle in more open-ended
scenarios like summarizing a list of contributions of scientific papers, while constraining the de-
coding with prompt “the main contributions of this paper are:(1)” is possibly
sufficient to achieve the goal.

Figure 1: Workflow of the CTRLsum framework at inference time. Users interact With summaries through
textual control tokens in the form of keywords or prompts. Keywords are required as input during training and
testing, while prompts are optionally used at test time. Dashed lines represent optional paths - control tokens can
come from the source article, user, or both. The right portion of the figure shows actual outputs from CTRLsum.
CTRLsum is trained using only keywords as additional input which can be easily identified from
training summaries. It requires neither extra human annotations nor pre-defining control aspects for
training, yet is quite flexible to achieve a broad scope of text manipulation as we will show in this
paper. In contrast, prior work primarily rely on pre-defined “control codes” (Fan et al., 2018; Liu
et al., 2018; Keskar et al., 2019), thus need to collect annotations for training and cannot generalize
to unseen control aspects easily at test time.
We use pretrained BART (Lewis et al., 2019) as the underlying architecture and perform experiments
on three datasets in three distinct domains: CNN/Dailymail news articles (Hermann et al., 2015),
arXiv scientific papers (Cohan et al., 2018), and BIGPATENT patent documents (Sharma et al.,
2019). We quantitatively evaluate CTRLsum on five control aspects: (1) entity-centric (§4.2) and (2)
length-controllable summarization (§4.3), (3) summarizing the contributions of scientific papers, (4)
summarizing the purpose of an invention (§4.4), and (5) summarizing answers to given questions in a
zero-shot reading comprehension setting (§4.5). Notably, our approach also achieves comparable
or superior performance to the strong BART summarization model on all datasets in a standard,
uncontrolled setting (§4.6), leading to state-of-the-art results on the CNN/Dailymail dataset.
2	CTRLSUM
2.1	Overview
Unconstrained neural summarization methods are trained to learn the conditional distribution p(y|x),
where x and y represent the source document and summary respectively. The generated summaries
depend solely on the document x without human involvement. To control the output summaries, we
propose using additional control tokens z to represent user preferences and training a summarization
model that predicts the conditional distribution p(y|x, z).
The control tokens z include keywords as extra inputs during training and inference. They can
also optionally include prompts at test time to further constrain the decoding process. As shown in
Figure 1, control tokens - in the form of keywords, prompts, or a combination of both - act as an
interface between users and an otherwise black-box neural model, providing a flexible way for users
to explicitly control automatic summarization. Next we describe how to obtain automatic keywords
for training as well as potential applications at test time.
2.2	Automatic Keyword Extraction
In addition to extracting keywords from training data to train the model, CTRLsum also features
an automatic keywords extraction mechanism at test time, which can be used to suggest automatic
2

keywords according to user preferences, or perform uncontrolled summarization without user signals.
Next we describe the keywords extraction methods at training and inference time respectively.
Training. For training, we use the ground-truth summary to identify keywords in the source
document. Specifically, we first greedily select sentences from the document that maximize the
ROUGE scores (Lin, 2004) with the reference summary. This step constrains keywords to those found
in important sentences. Then, we identify all the longest sub-sequences in the extracted sentences that
have matched sub-sequences in the ground-truth summary, similar to the copying word recognition
method in (Gehrmann et al., 2018). Finally, we remove duplicate words and stop words and keep
the remaining tokens as keywords. Compared to other keywords extraction methods (Riloff &
Lehnert, 1994; Mihalcea & Tarau, 2004) which output only a few salient words, our extraction retains
most content words found in the summary. This encourages dependence on the given keywords by
building a reliable correlation between their presence in the input and the target. It in turn ensures
that user-provided keywords are not ignored by the model at test time, which is catastrophic for a
controllable summarization system.
Inference. We formulate the keyword extraction problem at test time as a sequence labeling task.
Concretely, we train a BERT-based sequence tagger (Devlin et al., 2018) on the keywords and
documents from training dataset. This tagger then computes the selection probability qj for each
token in the test document. Similar to training time extraction, we first select ns sentences with
the highest average token selection probability. Within these sentences words with qj > are
selected as keywords up to a maximum number of mmax. The three hyperparameters ns , , mmax are
selected based on the uncontrolled summarization performance on validation datasets. The results are
reasonably robust to different settings (see Appendix D for details).
2.3	Summarization: Training Details
Format. At training time we prepend the keyword sequence to the source document separated with
a special token. The summarization model is then trained to maximize p(y|x, z) in an end-to-end
fashion. The keyword sequence maintains the order of the keywords as they were in the source
document, but we observe that the model often ignores this ordering as it frequently differs between
source and target summary. We also separate keywords from different source sentences with the
special token (“|”). In applications where the sentence boundary is unknown, as when users propose
their own keywords, the “|” token can be ignored as in some of our experiments.
Keyword Dropout. As mentioned in §2.2, our keyword extraction strategy retains most words
from the summary found in the source document. Without regularization, the dependence on such
keywords is strong enough that the model rarely generates novel words in the summary. To remedy
this, we randomly drop keywords at training time so that the model learns to rely on keywords that are
present in the input, while also learning to still carry over key information from the source document
that is not present in the keywords. Note that keywords dropout is applied at training time only.
Next we are going to introduce the five control aspects that we study in this paper as example use
cases of CTRLsum. Qualitative examples of them are shown in Table 1.
2.4	Summarization: Inference with Keywords.
The keywords provide a generic interface to control multiple aspects of summaries, which allows the
user to optionally rely on automatically extracted keywords, user provided keywords, or a combination
of both. This method provides clean separation of test-time user control and the training process,
including pretraining. Consequently, CTRLsum can be adapted to new use cases without changing
model parameters. For example, though nothing during training specifically focuses on controlling
entities or length, examples below demonstrate the general applicability of keyword control to entity
and length manipulation.
Entity Control. The goal of entity control is to produce summaries that focus on entities of interest.
Figure 1 exemplifies summarization with respect to different players when those player names are
included as keywords directly influencing the summary.
Length Control. Users may have different preferences as to the length of summaries. We allow
such manipulation of the summary length through a user-specified length parameter. Specifically, we

first separate the training data into 5 buckets by summary length so that each bucket has the same
number of examples. Then we compute the average number of keywords Kl for each bucket on the
training data. At test time, a user can specify length parameter l ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} to include the Kl
keywords with the highest selection probability computed by the sequence tagger. This is similar
to (Saito et al., 2020a), which uses the number of “guiding words” to control summary length.
2.5	Summarization: Inference with Keywords and Prompts
Prompts are pre-defined text sequences used as the target prefix to constrain decoding. They have
been utilized to perform multi-purpose text generation with a single unified model (Radford et al.,
2019; Brown et al., 2020). In the CTRLsum framework, prompts are a kind of control token sequence,
and we always use such tokens as both the target prefix and keywords (ablation results on using
prompts as keywords or prefix alone can be found in Appendix C). We find that using prompts as
keywords besides prefix helps focus on prompt-related content and mitigate the over-generation issue
of vanilla summarization models, as we will show in §4.4. To the best of our knowledge, we are the
first to evaluate such a prompt-based control method for summarization systems.
Summarizing Contributions. Existing datasets about scientific papers such as arXiv (Cohan et al.,
2018) collect paper abstracts as the summaries, which often include extra background context and
lack detailed contribution descriptions for the associated paper. In many cases, readers would benefit
from an explicit list of contributions in order to understand the novelty and value of the paper.
For these cases, We propose using control tokens - "the main contributions of this
paper are:(1)”. This prompt then triggers generation of a summary focused on contributions.
Summarizing Invention Purpose. Patent article summaries in existing datasets such as BIG-
PATENT (Sharma et al., 2019) can be over-complicated, often covering core method details. Yet for a
non-technical reader it Would be preferred to provide a one-sentence summary that states the purpose
of the invention While ignoring technical details. To apply CTRLsum in this scenario, We use the
4
Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2021
control tokens, “the purpose of the present invention is”. This triggers a concise
summary focused on patent purpose.
Question-guided summarization. Human summarization can be constrained by questions (Kry´-
cinski et al., 2019) that require answers to be found in the summary. This points to an important
connection between summarization and reading comprehension that we further explore. We hypoth-
esize that a summarization model can directly answer some questions about the article if guided
properly. This suggests the possibility of subsuming reading comprehension as a form of summariza-
tion. To verify this hypothesis, we use the control tokens “Q: question text? A:” to trigger
reading comprehension behaviour.
We note that prompts- and keywords-based control are complementary in practice - while prompts
could theoretically achieve any type of control, empirically they often do not work well for many
aspects and the model is very sensitive to the precise wording of the prompt. For example, we
found that using prompts such as “a summary focused on [entity] is:” or “a short
summary is:” does not work as well as explicitly using keywords for entity or length control
(details can be found in Appendix C).
3	Related Work
Previous work on controllable summarization often collects control codes such as entity or length as
supervision to train the model conditioned on both the code and article together (Fan et al., 2018; Liu
et al., 2018). These methods do not generalize for controlling aspects of the summarization that were
not seen during training. Recently Saito et al. (2020a) use the number of word prototypes to control
summary length in a similar way to how we use keywords. Interactive summarization provides a way
for users to continuously control the information that is included in the summary (Bornstein et al.,
1999; Leuski et al., 2003). More broadly, controllable text generation has been studied for styles (Hu
et al., 2017; Fu et al., 2018; He et al., 2020b), topics (Tang et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2019), and
templates (Guu et al., 2018; Wiseman et al., 2018; He et al., 2020a).
Keyword-guided text generation has been applied in other contexts with different motivations.
Gehrmann et al. (2018) utilize copying words at test time to mask copying operations in a sum-
marization task. Li et al. (2018) and Saito et al. (2020b) use keywords as extra input to improve
the uncontrolled summarization performance. Wang et al. (2016), Mou et al. (2016), and Yao et al.
(2019) use textual input to plan poetry, dialogue, and stories respectively. Lexically-constrained
decoding specifies certain lexicons as hard constraints in the target text (Hokamp & Liu, 2017; Post
& Vilar, 2018). Prefix-constrained decoding was used in machine translation (Knowles & Koehn,
2016; Wuebker et al., 2016) and also to demonstrate the multi-task ability present in large pretrained
models (McCann et al., 2018; Radford et al., 2019; Keskar et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020).
4	Experiments
Our experiments below are designed to (1) test the control efficacy of CTRLsum on five different
aspects, and (2) examine the performance of CTRLsum in a traditional summarization setting without
external control signals. Also, extensive model output examples can be found in Appendix E.
4.1	Experimental Details
We perform experiments on three distinct-domain summarization datasets: CNN/Dailymail (CN-
NDM) news articles (Hermann et al., 2015), arXiv scientific papers (Cohan et al., 2018), and
BIGPATENT patent articles (Sharma et al., 2019). For all datasets the source documents are trun-
cated to 1024 tokens and the target summaries are truncated to 256 tokens following (Zhang et al.,
2019). The conditional distribution p(y|x, z) in CTRLsum is our fine-tuned version of the pretrained
BARTLARGE model (Lewis et al., 2019), which achieves state-of-the-art performance on several
summarization benchmarks. The automatic keyword tagger at test time is based on the pretrained
BERTLARGE model (Devlin et al., 2018) fine-tuned as described in §2.2. Our summarization model
implementation is based on the fairseq toolkit (Ott et al., 2019) and the automatic keyword extraction
model is based on the HuggingFace Transformers library (Wolf et al., 2019). Complete setup and
training details can be found in Appendix A.1.

and requires entity annotations at training time.

For evaluation, we measure commonly used ROUGE scores (Lin, 2004) and the recently proposed
BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2020) when ground-truth is available. For control-related evaluation where
we often do not have reference summaries, we (1) collect ground-truth summaries when possible, (2)
examine whether summaries respect the control signal, or (3) resort to human evaluation.
4.2	Entity control
Setup. We first simulate user preference by providing the model with oracle entities extracted from
the ground-truth target. Then we compare it to the model using automatic keywords in a uncontrolled
setting to show the effect of oracle entities. To examine whether the decoded summaries respect
entity change, we sample 100 documents and repeatedly acquire every entity in the document to
generate summaries, following Fan et al. (2018). Then we compute Success Rate, the fraction of
requested entity actually occurring in the output summaries. The results are reported in separation of
whether the entity is from leading 3 sentences or from the full article. To test if the summaries from
different entity input are factually consistent with the document, we sample another 100 documents,
and for each we randomly sample one “important” entity that appears in the reference, and one
“unimportant” entity that occurs neither in the reference nor the leading three source sentences to
produce summaries. For each (article, summary) pair we ask 3 annotators from Amazon Mechanical
Turk to make a binary decision as to whether the summary can be entailed from the article. We then
take the majority vote as the result and report the fraction of factually correct summaries. We evaluate
on CNNDM only since many examples in arXiv and BIGPATENT do not have identifiable entities.
Results. In Table 2 we observe that the use of oracle entities helps boost the ROUGE-2 score by 3.6
points compared with using automatic keywords, which means CTRLsum is able to take advantage of
the given entities. Table 3 shows the Success Rate and factual correctness evaluations. We include the
numbers from Fan et al. (2018) (EntityCode) for reference point. We note that their numbers come
from a convolutional seq2seq architecture (see Appendix B for ablation analysis on this) and their
method utilizes entity annotations during training time, thus is not very comparable to CTRLsum.
Remarkably, our model achieves a high success rate for both lead-3 and full-article entities reaching
around 95%. Yet other systems struggle to include the given entities especially for the ones that do
not occur in the beginning of the article. Factual correctness scores from human annotators suggest
that CTRLsum is able to generate factually consistent summaries no matter whether the entity of
interest is important or not, comparable to the unconstrained BART baseline.

4.3	Length control
Setup. Similar to entity control, we first examine the effect of oracle length signal from the reference
to simulate user preference. In addition to ROUGE and BERTScore, we measure the length distance
between the decoded summary and the reference following (Liu et al., 2018). Specifically, we
compute the mean of absolute deviation (MAD) of the actual length bucket code lsys of the decoded
summary from the ground-truth control code 精，as N PN |照) - l(『|. To assess the summary
variations as length signals change, we further sample 1000 documents and decode 5 different-length
summaries for each document. Then we report the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) between
the input bucket code and actual bucket code. Experiments are conducted on CNNDM and arXiv.
Results. In Table 2 CTRLsum with oracle length signals only presents relatively small gains over
the automatic CTRLsum baseline. This implies that oracle lengths only convey limited additional
information to help generate the reference summary. We also run the LengthCode baseline (Fan
et al., 2018) based on BART, where the ground-truth length bucket code is prepended to the article
at both training at test time. However, LengthCode fails to consistently improve over BART with
oracle length signals. Moreover, we find that the BART model fine-tuned with LengthCode method
almost ignores the length signal with PCC close to 0, as shown in Table 4. This is not very surprising
since length code would be less useful when the summarizers grow stronger, which can already learn
a good length predictor implicitly. In contrast, CTRLsum with length-guided keywords achieves
high positive PCC between control signal and actual output length, and is able to reduce the length
deviation MAD compared to automatic baselines.
4.4	Contribution and Purpose summarization
Contribution Summarization Setup. There is no existing dataset to evaluate contribution sum-
marization of scientific papers, bringing challenges to our evaluation. However, researchers often
summarize the bullet contributions of their paper in the Introduction section, which inspire us to
extract such contribution claims as the reference summary. Therefore, we resort to the entire arXiv
database,2 and download all the papers whose first submission time is within the first six months of
20193 that gives us 67K papers. We extract the Introduction section and bullet contributions with
regular expression and filter out the ones that fail. The contributions are used as the reference and the
Introduction section after removing the contribution claims is used as the source article - We aim
to predict contributions from the rest of the introduction section. This procedure leads to 1018 test
examples. We test the model trained on arXiv.
Purpose Summarization Setup. To collect a test dataset that features one-sentence invention
purpose summaries, We sample 1000 test examples from BIGPATENT and present their reference
summaries to human annotators from Amazon Mechanical Turk. For each example We ask one
annotator to select the sentence that convey the purpose of the invention. We also provide the option
for annotators that the invention purpose cannot be identified. After filtering out the invalid examples,
We collect 763 examples as our test data.
2We do not use the arXiv test set because We can only extract 20 valid test points from it. The entire arXiv
database is at: https://www.kaggle.com/Cornell-University/arxiv
3The arXiv dataset used to train CTRLsum is collected before April 2018 according to their paper submission
time, thus there should be no data overlap betWeen the training data and our contribution test data.

Results. Table 6 shows results of contribution summarization on scientific papers and invention
purpose summarization on patent filings. Through using the prompt text as both the decoder prefix
and keywords, CTRLsum outperforms the BART baseline in most cases. We further report the
precision (P) and recall (R) scores in BERTScore besides F1. We observe that the BART baseline
tends to over-generate a full summary with low precision scores while CTRLsum is able to focus on
keywords-related content.
4.5	Question-guided summarization
Setup. We directly test question-guided summarization on reading comprehension benchmarks
in a zero-shot setting. Specifically, we evaluate the CNNDM summarization models on in-domain
NewsQA (Trischler et al., 2017) and out-of-domain SQuAD 1.1 (Rajpurkar et al., 2016) respectively.
We note that some NewsQA test articles are present in the CNNDM summarization training dataset,
yet we think it is still a reasonable unsupervised setting since our model never sees questions or
answers during training. In addition to comparing with the vanilla BART model, we also include the
zero-shot performance from GPT2 language models (Radford et al., 2019) (without fine-tuning) as a
reference point. We omit the largest GPT2 model with 1.5B parameters since it cannot be evaluated
in our single GPU device due to memory limits. We report F1 scores on the two benchmarks.
Results. BART is pretrained with a denoising task to predict the denoised version of the source, and
performs poorly on zero-shot reading comprehension out of box, as shown in Table 5. Interestingly,
however, BART fine-tuned on a summarization task - without seeing any question-answer pairs in
the training data - is able to improve the F1 scores by 24.4 and 25.9 points on NewsQA and SQUAD
respectively. Moreover, CTRLsum equipped with question keywords is able to further boost the
performance by 15.6 and 17.9 points, approaching the supervised MatchLSTM (Wang & Jiang, 2017)
score on NewsQA. Such results suggest that summarization might be a suitable transfer task for
abstractive reading comprehension, which we leave for future work to explore.
4.6	Automatic Summarization
Table 7 shows the uncontrolled summarization performance without any user input, where our method
uses the automatically extracted keywords as described in §2.2. On CNNDM and arXiv datasets
CTRLsum outperforms the strong BART and PEGASUS baselines by a large margin, leading to
new state-of-the-art performance on CNNDM. It also performs comparably to the BART baseline on
BIGPATENT in terms of BERTScore, though with an inferior ROUGE-2 score. Yet there is a big
performance gap between BART-based models and PEGASUS on BIGPATENT. The reasons might
be different dataset processing,4 sub-optimal learning schedule, or inherent difference between BART
and PEGASUS.

4.7	Human Evaluation
In this section we present human evaluation results for both controlled and uncontrolled summariza-
tion. Full experiment details can be found in Appendix A.2.
Controlled Summarization. We present further human evaluation results to evaluate “control”
directly by informing annotators the intended control signal. We conduct experiments on entity and
purpose control. Specifically, we inform the annotators our intent (to obtain summaries focused on
a specific entity or purpose of patent), then we ask them to provide scores in scale 1-5 over two
dimensions: (1) Control Accuracy (CA): whether the summary contains accurate main information
with respect to the intent, and (2) Control Relevance (CR): how the summary is relevant to the control
intent overall - a summary that contains redundant contents that are unrelated to the intent will
be penalized. Results including significance tests are shown in Table 8. The control accuracy for
important entity control and purpose control are comparable between BART and CTRLsum without
significant difference (p-value > 0.05), while CTRLsum shows significantly better control relevance
overall by focusing on the desired information. Also, the unconstrained BART are unable to generate
unimportant-entity-related summaries and thus suffers from poor scores on both dimensions.
Uncontrolled Summarization. We follow (Grusky et al., 2018; Fabbri et al., 2020) to ask human
annotators from Amazon Mechanical Turk to score summaries (scale 1-5) over four dimensions: (1)
Factual Consistency (FAC): the summary should only contain statements that can be entailed by the
source document, (2) Relevance (REL): the summary should only contain important information of
the source document, (3) Fluency (FLU): each sentence in the summary should be fluent, and (4)
Coherence (COH): the summary should be well-structured and well-organized. Results including
significance tests are present in Table 9. The quality of summaries from all systems on all dimensions
is generally good with a score mostly higher than 4.0. However, most scores do not show significant
difference from CTRLsum (Automatic Keyword) with large p-values, despite their very different
similarities against the reference summaries in terms of ROUGE/BERTScore (e.g. CTRLsum with
oracle keywords). This implies that the summary quality from different systems powered by strong
pretrained models like BART has become difficult to be clearly distinguished by non-expert MTurkers.
We also note that non-expert human judgement for summarization may be unreliable and exhibit poor
correlation with expert judgement (Gillick & Liu, 2010; Fabbri et al., 2020).
5	Conclusion
In this paper we propose a generic framework to perform multi-aspect controllable summarization.
The model is conditioned on keywords to predict summaries during training. At inference time the
control tokens, in the form of keywords or prompts, enable users to interact with models in a very
flexible way. Experiments on five different control aspects demonstrate the efficacy of our method.

A Experimental Setup Details
A.1 General Setup
In this section we include additional experimental details left out in the main content due to space
limitations. We fine-tune the pretrained BARTLARGE model in all our experiments. Specifically we
use the bart.large checkpoint from fairseq (Ott et al., 2019). For all BART-based summarization
models, we fine-tune with learning rate 3e-5 and a polynomial learning rate decay schedule, the
optimizer is Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2015) and batch size is 64. Our optimization scheme and hyperpa-
rameters follow the BART fine-tuning instructions in fairseq examples. We train the summarization
models with 20k steps on CNNDM, 50k steps on arXiv, and 300k steps on BIGPATENT. We train the
BERT tagger with learning rate 5e-5, Adam optimizer, and batch size of 128 on all datasets. Similar
to summarization models, the tagger is trained with 20k, 50k, and 300k steps on CNNDM, arXiv,
and BIGPATENT respectively. Also, we adopt a sliding window approach so that the BERT-based
tagger is able to handle sequences that are longer than 512 tokens. For both ROUGE and BERTScore
evaluation, we report the F1 measure. We report the rescaled BERTScore, and the hash code is
roberta-large_L17_no-idf_version=0.3.6(hug_trans=3.0.2)-rescaled.
As mentioned in §2.2, we need three hyperparameters for automatic keywords extraction during
inference - the number of pre-selected sentences n§, the selection probability threshold e, and the
maximum number of keywords mmax . We select these hyperparameters for each dataset based on the
uncontrolled summarization ROUGE-2 score on validation dataset. The summarization performance
is robust to these hyperparameters in a reasonable range, as shown in Appendix D. Specifically, we
use {ns = 10, = 0.25, mmax = 30} for CNNDM, {ns = 10, = 0.15, mmax = 40} for arXiv,
and {ns = 5, = 0.15, mmax = 30}.
Invention Purpose Summarization. In the experiment of summarizing invention purpose on
patent articles (§4.4). We examined whether the model would possibly copy source sentences through
matching the prompts, we search strings in the form of “the purpose of [some words or phrases]
is” among 763 test examples, and only 3 test articles are identified. This means the models are not
generating by exactly matching prompts most of the time.
A.2 Human Evaluation Setup
Here we include details about human evaluation experiments in §4.7.
Controlled Summarization. For controlled summarization, we sample 100 examples for each
task, and summaries of each example from all systems are presented together to the human annotator
to be scored. For CNNDM we provide article and summaries, while for BIGPATENT we provide
reference and summaries using the reference summary as a surrogate for the source article. This is
because the source patent documents are very long and hard to be read by non-expert humans. We did
not evaluate contribution summarization since it is unrealistic to ask humans to judge contributions of
many scientific papers from various domains. We tried to hire workers from Amazon Mechanical
Turk first, but we failed to obtain reliable results from them - they often ignored the given user
intent and tended to score the text as uncontrolled summaries (reflected by very poor scores on
unimportant-entity summaries because these summaries do not contain the main information of the
article), even though we instructed them that the control signal is critical. Therefore, we ask two
independent human annotators through personal correspondence from the authors of this paper. One
of the annotator is a PhD researcher on physics, and the other is a law graduate on intellectual property
in the United States. They are able to follow the given control intent and considered more reliable
than the MTurkers. We take the average of two annotators as the score for each example, and average
over all examples to obtain the final score.
Uncontrolled Summarization. For uncontrolled summarization, we sample 100 examples for each
dataset, and hire 3 independent workers from Amazon Mechanical Turk to conduct evaluation. For
CNNDM we provide article and summaries, while for arXiv and BIGPATENT we provide reference
and summaries using the reference summary as a surrogate for the source article. This is because the
source patent documents or scientific papers are very long and hard to be read by non-expert humans.
Summaries of each example from all systems are presented together to the human annotator to be
13
Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2021
scored. The median score of 3 workers is taken for each example, and average over all examples is
reported.
B Ablation Analysis of Entity Control
In Table 3 We observe that CTRLsum achieves a very high success rate (〜95%) of entity control,
compared to previous work (Fan et al., 2018) which can only succeed 61.2% and 33.8% of the
time on lead-3 and full-article entities respectively. We perform ablation analysis to understand
the important gradients that contribute to the success of CTRLsum. We train CTRLsum With
another tWo architectures in addition to BART: (1) convolutional seq2seq (Gehring et al., 2017)
With the same hyperparameters as in (Fan et al., 2018), and (2) transformer seq2seq With the same
hyperparameters as the base model in (VasWani et al., 2017). Note that the transformer model is
trained from scratch Without pretraining. Results are shoWn in Table 10. CTRLsum parameterized
With a Weaker convolutional seq2seq architecture fails to depend on the keyWords Well With an over
40-point success rate drop, yet the success rate of transformer seq2seq Without pretraining only drops
around 5 points. This implies that the transformer seq2seq architecture is critical for CTRLsum to
depend on the keyWords Well, While pretraining can further improves it.5
Table 10: Entity control results on CNNDM. Success rate is the fraction of decoded summaries that actually
mention the given entity.
Model	Success Rate (%)	
	Lead-3	Full-article
BART (Lewis et al., 2019)	61.4	29.0
Fan et al. (2018)	61.2	33.8
CTRLsum (COnV Seq2Seq)	50.1	23.3
CTRLsum (Transformer Seq2Seq)	92.6	88.3
CTRLsum (BART)	97.6	94.8
C Ablation Analysis on Keywords and Prompts
In the controlling aspects We studied CTRLsum uses control tokens either as keyWords alone (entity
and length), or as keyWords and prompts together (contribution, purpose, QA). Here We present further
results When control tokens are used as prompts, keyWords, or both for entity control, contribution
control, and NeWsQA tasks. Specifically for entity control, We use the control tokens “a summary
focused on [entity] is:” for “prompt” and “prompt + keyWord” variants.6 In this case
success rate is computed excluding the prompt text. The control tokens for other settings are the
same as previous experiments. Results are shoWn in Table 11, Where keyWords and prompts are
of different importance for different tasks and are complementary in general. For example, using
prompts to control entities turns out to be difficult with a very low success rate - we find that the
system fails to understand the prompt and produce summaries appropriately in most cases. HoWever,
prompts contribute the most to contribution summarization with comparable performance with using
prompts and keywords together, while removing prompts and using keywords alone suffers from
drastic performance drop to trigger the contribution. For NewsQA task, prompts and keywords
demonstrate mixing effectiveness - using either of them alone experiences over 20 F1 points loss
compared to using them together.
5For reference points, the ROUGE-1/2/L scores (with automatic keywords) of CTRLsum (Conv Seq2Seq) is
41.19/18.71/38.05 while CTRLsum (Transformer Seq2Seq) obtained 43.69/20.78/40.55.
6We tried several prompts variants, for example, QA style ones “Q: What happened to [entity]?
A:” or “Q: What do we know about [entity]? A:”. None of them lead to meaningful entity
control.

D Robustness Analysis of Keywords Extraction Hyperparameters
Table 12 shows the ROUGE-2 scores of uncontrolled summarization on the validation set with
different keywords extraction hyperparameters. We use more fine-grained stride size to iterate
the mmax hyperparameter for CNNDM since its source articles are usually shorter than arXiv and
BIGPATENT. As observed, the automatic summarization performance is relatively robust to these
hyperparameters in a reasonable range.

Americans on the United States’ no-fly list will now be privy to information about why they have been banned
from commercial flights and be given the opportunity to dispute their status, according to court documents filed
by the Justice Department this week. The revised policy comes in response to a June ruling by a federal judge
that said the old process was in violation of the Fifth Amendment’s guarantee of due process. The decision
was part of an American Civil Liberties Union lawsuit brought on behalf of 13 Americans on the list. But the
ACLU isn’t satisfied with the government’s new policy, outlined in documents filed Monday in federal courts in
Oregon (PDF) and Virginia (PDF). "After years of fighting in court for complete secrecy and losing, it’s good
that the government is finally now going to tell people of their status on the No Fly List," said Hina Shamsi,
director of the ACLU National Security Project and the lead attorney on the case, in a statement. "Unfortunately,
we’ve found that the government’s new redress process falls far short of constitutional requirements because it
denies our clients meaningful notice, evidence, and a hearing. The government had an opportunity to come up
with a fair process but failed, so we’re challenging it in court again." People on the no-fly list, managed by the
FBI’s Terrorist Screening Center, are prohibited from boarding a commercial flight for travel into or out of the
United States. The number of people on the list is classified. An official with knowledge of the government’s
figures told CNN in 2012 that the list contained about 21,000 names, including about 500 Americans. Before
the change, American citizens and permanent residents who inquired with the government about being denied
aircraft boarding received a letter that neither confirmed nor denied their inclusion on the no-fly list. Now, they’ll
be made aware of their status if they apply for redress, with an option to request further information. "The U.S.
government is making enhancements to the Department of Homeland Security Traveler Redress Inquiry Program
(DHS TRIP) to provide additional transparency and process for U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents
who have been denied boarding on a commercial aircraft because they are on the No Fly List," the Department
of Homeland Security said in a statement. In cases in which travelers included on the list request to receive
or submit more information about their status, the government will provide a second, more detailed response,
identifying "specific criterion under which the individual has been placed on the No Fly List," according to
the court documents. An unclassified summary of that information will be provided "to the extent feasible,
consistent with the national security and law enforcement interests at stake," court papers said. Those who
appear on the no-fly list will then have further opportunity to dispute their status in writing, with supporting
materials or exhibits, and will receive a final written decision from the Transportation Security Administration.
The 2014 ruling that prompted the policy changes had called for passengers on the list to be given the opportunity
to dispute their status before a judge.

A former U.S. Army enlistee who posted on Facebook about "the adrenaline rush" of dying in jihad was arrested
Friday and charged with trying to detonate a car bomb at Fort Riley military base in Kansas, authorities said.
A second man, who allegedly knew about the bomb plot but didn’t call authorities, was charged with failing
to report a felony. John T. Booker Jr. of Topeka, an American citizen also known as Mohammed Abdullah
Hassan, was taken into custody near Manhattan, Kansas, in a van that contained what he thought was a bomb,
the criminal complaint said. The "bomb" had actually been put together by two confidential informants with
nonexplosive materials, the complaint said. Fort Riley’s security was never breached and no people were in
danger, the U.S. Justice Department said in a press release. Booker enlisted in the Army last year and was due
to ship out to basic training April 7, 2014, said Army spokesman Wayne Hall. The criminal complaint said
the FBI questioned him March 24, 2014 about comments posted on Facebook, such as, "Getting ready to be
killed in jihad is a HUGE adrenaline rush. I am so nervous. NOT because I’m scare to die but I am eager to
meet my lord." Booker waived his Miranda rights and told the agents he enlisted to commit an insider attack
against American soldiers like Maj. Nidal Hassan had done at Fort Hood, Texas, the complaint said. Hassan
opened fire in a building in November 2009, killing 13 people and wounding more than 30. His enlistment was
terminated March 24, 2014, at the request of Army Criminal Investigation Command, Hall said. Booker began
communicating with a confidential informant later in 2014, the complaint said, and often talked about his plans
to engage in violent jihad in support of ISIS. He and the informant watched ISIS videos together, the complaint
said, and Booker talked about how he wanted to go to Iraq and turn his weapon on American soldiers when
Article	ordered to shoot the enemy. On March 9, Booker said he believed ISIS wanted him to commit a truck bombing
in the United States and thought a good target would be nearby Fort Riley, a large Army base that’s home to
the 1st Infantry Division, known as "The Big Red One." Booker said "that detonating a suicide bomb is his
No. 1 aspiration because he couldn’t be captured, all evidence would be destroyed and he would be guaranteed
to hit his target," the criminal complaint said. He made a video with a Fort Riley airfield in the background
and said ISIS was coming to kill American soldiers, both abroad and in the United States, the complaint said.
Booker acquired components for a bomb and rented a storage locker to store the components, the complaint said.
The plan was for confidential informants to build a bomb and for Booker to drive to Fort Riley and detonate
it, the complaint said. But the bomb was built with "inert" parts and would never explode, the complaint said.
On Friday, the informants and Booker drove to what Booker thought was a little-used utility gate near Fort
Riley, the complaint said. While Booker was making final connections on the "bomb," the FBI arrested him, the
complaint said. He was charged with one count of attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction, one count of
attempting to damage property by means of an explosive and one count of attempting to provide material support
to the Islamic State of Iraq, a designated foreign terrorist organization. If convicted, he could face life in prison.
Alexander E. Blair, 28, of Topeka was taken into custody Friday and charged with failing to report a felony. The
FBI said agents interviewed Blair after Booker’s arrest. Blair said he shared some of Booker’s views, knew of
his plans to detonate a vehicle bomb at Fort Riley and loaned him money to rent storage space, according to the
FBI’s criminal complaint. He said he thought Booker would carry out his plan but did not contact authorities,
the complaint said. If convicted, Blair faces a maximum of three years in prison.

A husband accused of trying to murder his cheating wife was ready to let her have sex with another man once
a month as long as she stayed with him, his trial heard yesterday. A close friend told how Joseph O’Riordan,
74, had confided in him about the extraordinary plan for his 47-year-old wife Mandy. O’Riordan, a councillor
and former nightclub owner, stabbed her eight times in a jealous rage after finding out she had been having an
affair with a postman. . Extraordinary deal: Joseph O’Riordan stabbed his wife of ten years Amanda (left) with
a seven inch kitchen knife eight times - yesterday Brighton Crown Court heard he was considering allowing
her to have affairs. She suffered life-threatening injuries after being knifed in the torso, chest, arms and back.
The jury was also shown dramatic footage of the moment police arrived at the couple’s home to be greeted by a
‘calm’ O’Riordan opening the door. The revelation of his proposal for keeping his wife of ten years came from
Alfred Harris. He told how O’Riordan had confided five days before the attack that he believed she was having
an affair. O’Riordan was ‘choked up and emotional’ when he said: ‘I think Amanda is playing away. She’s
getting her nails and hair done more regularly, she’s been on a diet and doesn’t want sex.’. Asking for a suit:
O’Riordan sent his wife this letter from his prison cell. The following day, added Mr Harris, the men met for a
pub lunch in O’Riordan’s home village of Polegate, East Sussex. ‘I saw Joe and he told me that Amanda had
been seeing someone else - a guy Who drove a van. Joe Said he loved Amanda to bits and if She wanted to have
sex with someone else once a month that would be okay as long as she stayed with him.’. In a statement read to
Brighton Crown Court, Mr Harris also described the couple as ‘loving and close’. . He was ‘so shocked’ to learn
Article	that O’Riordan had attacked his wife at their flat on a residential care home estate. The jury saw images of four
police officers, one of whom was wearing a lapel camera, arriving shortly before 10pm last October 22 after
racing to the scene. . PC Dave Catt said they drew their ‘incapacitating’ sprays fearing the knifeman would be
still holding his weapon. They were greeted by O’Riordan wearing a blood-spattered light blue shirt and holding
a cordless phone on which he had phoned for an ambulance. Mr Catt said O’Riordan admitted: ‘I found out
that she was having an affair and I lost it.’. Mrs O’Riordan was moaning and lying on a bed, holding a towel to
her stomach with a deep chest wound and serious wounds to her hand and back. Paramedics arrived moments
later and took her to hospital. Jurors looked at two screens as images of her husband’s arrest and subsequent
detention at a police station were shown. Growing suspicion: Giving evidence yesterday Alfred Harris - a friend
of the couple for more than six years - told how O’Riordan had confided in him that he believed his wife was
having an affair. Yesterday, jurors at Brighton Crown Court (above) were shown dramatic footage of the moment
police arrived at the couple’s home to be greeted by a ‘calm’ Mr O’Riordan opening the door. PC Stuart Kenway
told how, as O’Riordan had opened the door, he ‘appeared calm and composed and the situation was surreal’
as he then said: ‘She is in the bedroom - do you want the knife?’ Officers were directed to a 7in blade with a
black handle which was in the kitchen. Dr Stephen Drage, an intensive care consultant with Brighton and Sussex
University Hospitals, told the jury how seriously Mrs O’Riordan was hurt. ‘It is quite clear she was bleeding to
death,’ he said. ‘She underwent life-saving surgery which took six hours.’. O’Riordan denies attempted murder.

Film director David Lynch has confirmed he will no longer direct the revival of "Twin Peaks" - a cult 1990s
television show that was set to return in 2016. The offbeat TV series, created by Lynch and Mark Frost, featured
a quirky FBI agent who went to the Pacific Northwest town of Twin Peaks to investigate the mysterious murder
of a high school girl named Laura Palmer. The groundbreaking series is considered one of the most influential
shows in television history. Lynch broke the news about his departure in a series of tweets, saying that the show’s
third season will continue without him. He said he felt the network was not offering enough money to produce
the show "the way it needed to be done." Lynch also wrote that he had personally called the actors over the
Article	weekend to let them know he would no longer be directing. Showtime Network, which will air the nine-episode
comeback, released a statement saying they were "saddened" by Lynch’s decision. "We were saddened to read
David Lynch’s statement today since we believed we were working towards solutions with David and his reps
on the few remaining deal points," read the statement. "Showtime also loves the world of Twin Peaks and we
continue to hold out hope that we can bring it back in all its glory with both of its extraordinary creators, David
Lynch and Mark Frost, at its helm." Showtime announced they would produce a third season in October last
year. Actor Kyle MacLachlan, who played the coffee-obsessed FBI agent Dale Cooper in the original series, had
confirmed he would reprise the lead role for the new season.

Washington (CNN)An Iranian military observation aircraft flew within 50 yards of an armed U.S. Navy helicopter
over the Persian Gulf this month, sparking concern that top Iranian commanders might not be in full control
of local forces, CNN has learned. The incident, which has not been publicly disclosed, troubled U.S. military
officials because the unsafe maneuver could have triggered a serious incident. It also surprised U.S. commanders
because in recent months Iranian forces have conducted exercises and operations in the region in a professional
manner, one U.S. military official told CNN. "We think this might have been locally ordered," the official said.
The incident took place as the U.S. and other world powers meet with Iran in Switzerland to negotiate a deal
limiting Tehran’s nuclear program. At the same time, Iran has been active in supporting proxies in several
hotspots in the Persian Gulf and neighboring regions. The Navy MH-60R armed helicopter was flying from the
deck of the USS Carl Vinson on a routine patrol in international airspace, the official said. An unarmed Iranian
observation Y-12 aircraft approached. The Iranian aircraft made two passes at the helicopter, coming within 50
yards, before the helicopter moved off, according to the official. The official said the helicopter deliberately
broke off and flew away in a ’predictable’ manner so the Iranians could not misinterpret any U.S. intentions. The
Article Navy helicopter was in radio contact with the ship during the encounter, but there was no contact between the
two aircraft and no shots were fired. The Navy crew took photos of the incident but the military is not releasing
them. The U.S. administration is considering a potential demarche protest against Iran, the official said. CNN
has reached out to Iranian officials but has not received a response. This type of Iranian observation aircraft
generally operates over the Gulf several times a month. But after the recent incident, U.S. naval intelligence
did not see it again for two weeks, leading to the conclusion that the incident may have been ordered by a local
commander who was then reprimanded by higher-ups. The Pentagon has noted for the last several years that
most encounters with the Iranian military at sea or in air are conducted professionally, but that some missions run
by Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps forces have been too aggressive against U.S. forces in the area. The U.S.
military’s concern has been that one of these incidents could escalate into a military encounter. This incident
"might have been buffoonery" the official said, but there is always a risk from such actions. The incident comes
as the Navy patrols the Gulf of Aden to watch for Iranian ships the U.S. believes are trying to bring weapons to
resupply the Houthi rebels in Yemen. The Navy would share such intelligence with Saudi Arabia, a second U.S.
official told CNN.

Summary
It's a sight that draws giggles and curious stares from tourists and other first-timers - an unusual festival where
revellers carry gigantic phalluses through the streets of a Japanese city. But for the residents of Kawasaki, who
lug erotic shapes of all different sizes, this odd tradition is not a joke. Shinto Kanamara Matsuri started as a small
tradition but has grown into a popular a tourist attraction, with participants praying to a god of fertility, child birth
and protection from sexually transmitted infections. Participants carry a gigantic phallus through the streets of
Kawasaki, Japan during the Shinto Kanamara Matsuri festival. The sight of three large phalluses being paraded
through neighbourhoods in the city south of Tokyo draws giggles from tourists. Shinto Kanamara Matsuri, the
Festival of the Steel Phallus, started as a small tradition but has grown into a popular a tourist attraction. Known
as the Festival of the Steel Phallus, it is held every spring at the phallus-shaped Kanayama Shrine. Festivalgoers
parade through the streets with three giant phalluses, while spectators lick lollies or snack on sausages or
vegetables shaped as male and female genitalia. Rainy weather didn’t ruin the mood at this year’s festival, which
had a massive collection of foreigners, according to Japanese website RocketNews24. They watched as groups
of locals carried three heavy phalluses modelled after a mikoshi portable shrine, which is commonly used in
Shinto festivals. Residents of Kawasaki carry phalluses of all different sizes while participating in a tradition that
began nearly 40 years ago. Participants pray to a god who is said to help with fertility, child birth and protection
from sexually transmitted infections. Rainy weather didn’t ruin the mood at this year’s festival, which attracted
thousands of spectators from Japan and abroad. Spectators can buy lollies, sausages and vegetables shaped as

synchronization of neural activity appears in different parts of the mammalian cerebral cortex @xcite , and
underlies different neural processes in both normal and anomalous brain functions @xcite . it has been suggested
that synchronization plays a vital role in information processing in the brain , e.g. , processing information from
different sensory systems to form a coherent and unified perception of the external world @xcite . on the other
hand , synchronization has been detected in pathological conditions such as parkinson s disease @xcite . and
epileptic seizures have long been considered resulting from excessive synchronized brain activity @xcite , though
some recent studies suggest that this picture may be an over - simplification @xcite . therefore understanding
the mechanisms of synchronization may be a critical step in elucidating how neural systems work @xcite . it has
stimulated a great deal of theoretical and numerical works , such as the studies on the effects of the topological
properties of underlying networks @xcite and the dynamical properties of synaptic coupling @xcite . it was
recently shown that the response time of synaptic couplings influences the stability of synchronized oscillation
in the nonlocally coupled hodgkin - huxley ( hh ) equations @xcite . if the response time of synaptic coupling
is slower , synchronized activity of the systems is instable for excitatory coupling . however , the underlying
dynamical mechanism of the influence is not clear . in experimental studies @xcite , it has been suggested
that the generation of prolonged epileptiform neuronal synchronization is favored by lower efficacy of synaptic
transmission . the numerical studies @xcite in a detailed computational model revealed that seizure - like activity
occurs when the excitatory synapses are weakened , and the results were confirmed experimentally in mouse
neocortical slices . according to the common accepted assumption that synchronization of neuronal activity
Article	underlies seizures , the dynamical mechanism of synchronization may be useful for understanding the way the
biological neural system works . in this work , we numerically investigated the dynamical mechanism underlying
the influence of synaptic efficacy on firing synchronization in hh neuron networks . to do this , we first studied
the dynamics of the response of hh neuron to excitatory synaptic current . when the efficacy of synapse is low
, namely , strength is weak and duration is short , the limit cycle is stable to the perturbation of the synaptic
current . when synaptic efficacy is high , synaptic current can induce the transition of the neurons from limit
cycle to fixed point or transient state . the transition is determined by dynamics of neuron s ionic channel . the
decrease of synaptic current depresses the feedback of sodium ionic current which is responsible for the initiation
of the spike . for simplicity we will refer to the transitions as spike death . in neuronal networks , synaptic input
of a neuron is the accumulation of the currents received from all presynaptic neurons . when the coherence of
firing time of neurons is enhanced by the excitatory interaction , the synaptic input of neurons transforms from
the fluctuating waveform into the pulse shape like the signal produced by one synapse . if synaptic efficacy is
high , the input signal can induce spike death of the neuron . then spike death disorders the adjustment of the
rhythm of neurons and prevents neurons from firing spikes synchronously . in contrast , for synapses of lower
efficacy , the duration of synaptic current is too short to induce spike death of neurons . additionally , the firing
synchronization is different from synchronous activity of oscillators for the existence of the transitions of neuron
s state . the paper is organized as follows . the hh neuron model and the synaptic coupling were introduced in
sec . the response of a hh neuron to synaptic current was investigated in sec . the influence of the dynamics of
neurons on firing synchrony was shown in sec .
we investigated the influence of efficacy of synaptic interaction on firing synchronization in excitatory neuronal
networks . we found spike death phenomena , namely , the state of neurons transits from limit cycle to fixed
point or transient state . the phenomena occur under the perturbation of excitatory synaptic interaction that has a
Reference	high efficacy . we showed that the decrease of synaptic current results in spike death through depressing the
Summary	feedback of sodium ionic current . in the networks with spike death property the degree of synchronization is
lower and unsensitive to the heterogeneity of neurons . the mechanism of the influence is that the transition of
neuron state disrupts the adjustment of the rhythm of neuron oscillation and prevents further increase of firing
synchronization .

for the understanding of surface reactions and the characterization of materials it is desirable to measure local
forces close to a sample surface . the most common method to measure these surface forces is atomic force
microscopy ( afm)@xcite . historically , the first force measurements were static measurements for which the
force is presented as a scalar function of the static tip - sample separation , the so - called force curve@xcite . this
representation is sufficient for conservative forces but the total tip - surface force may also contain contributions
from dissipative forces . since dissipative forces depend on probe velocity and past trajectory , dynamic force
spectroscopy methods are required for their measurement . moreover , the visualization of dissipative forces as a
function of position is valid only for a specific probe trajectory and simple force curves can not capture the full
character of the interaction . despite the development of several dynamic methods@xcite surface forces are still
usually treated as functions of the probe position only and represented by simple force curves . here , we present
a comprehensive framework for the representation and analysis of complex surface forces as they are measured
by dynamic afm . we concentrate on the most common modes of dynamic afm : amplitude - modulated afm (
am - afm ) and frequency - modulated afm ( fm - afm ) , which can be considered as narrow frequency band
methods@xcite . we explore the fundamental limit of force reconstruction with narrow band dynamic afm
at fixed probe height and show how minimal assumptions allow for a quantitative reconstruction of the tip -
surface interaction . at the heart of the afm apparatus is a micro - cantilever with a sharp tip . the cantilever
is firmly clamped at one end and the tip is located at the other end which can move freely . it is assumed that
surface forces only act on the tip whereas the rest of the cantilever does not experience significant surface forces
. in dynamic afm an additional external drive force is applied to maintain an oscillatory motion . thus , the
dynamics are governed by the force between tip and surface , the external drive force and the properties of the
cantilever beam . since the cantilever is a three dimensional continuum object its motion is usually described by
the amplitudes of different oscillation eigenmodes . in general , these modes can cause the cantilever to bend in
all directions in space . however , the cantilever is positioned such that the softest flexural modes bend the beam
in a plane orthogonal to the surface plane . we restrict ourselves to the case where only these flexural modes
are excited by the drive force . due to this experimental configuration the cantilever is much more susceptible
to the component of the tip - surface force which is orthogonal to the surface plane . this component of the
force is typically the most dominant component and the influence of lateral force components is considered
negligible . in this case the cantilever acts as a mechanical projector which reacts only to one component of a
three dimensional force vector field . the deflection @xmath0 of a cantilever of length @xmath1 orthogonal
to surface is described by a one dimensional euler - bernoulli equation@xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 is
the young s modulus , @xmath4 is the second moment of area , @xmath5 is the mass per unit length of the
cantilever , @xmath6 is the position coordinate along the cantilever beam and @xmath7 is the time variable
. the force term @xmath8 includes the surface forces acting as a point - like load at position @xmath9 , the
external drive force and the hydrodynamic damping due to the surrounding medium@xcite .
in atomic force microscopy ( afm ) tip - surface interactions are usually considered as functions of the tip position
only , so - called force curves . however , tip - surface interactions often depend on the tip velocity and the
past tip trajectory . here , we introduce a compact and general description of these interactions appropriate to
dynamic afm where the measurement of force is restricted to a narrow frequency band . we represent the tip -
surface interaction in terms of a force disk in the phase space of position and velocity . determination of the
amplitude dependence of tip - surface forces at a fixed static probe height allows for a comprehensive treatment
of conservative and dissipative interactions . we illuminate the fundamental limitations of force reconstruction
with narrow band dynamic afm and we show how the amplitude dependence of the fourier component of
the force at the tip oscillation frequency , gives qualitative insight into the detailed nature of the tip - surface
interaction . with minimal assumptions this amplitude dependence force spectroscopy allows for a quantitative
reconstruction of the effective conservative tip - surface force as well as a position - dependent damping factor
. we demonstrate this reconstruction on simulated intermodulation afm data . _ keywords _ : atomic force

in this paper we discuss the mathematical aspects of the problems originating in the solution of nonlinear systems
of hyperbolic partial differential equations . these equations describe a large variety of physical phenomena ,
such as , gasdynamics , magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) , shallow water equations , elasticity equations , etc .
being nonlinear , these systems usually require numerical methods for their solution . presence of discontinuous
solutions motivates the necessity of the development of reliable numerical methods based on the fundamental
mathematical properties of hyperbolic systems . although such methods are rather well developed for the euler
gasdynamic equations in the conservation law form , their extension to more complicated hyperbolic systems is
not straightforward . it requires a mathematical justification of the solution uniqueness , a formulation of the
selection principles for relevant solutions , and , finally , an investigation of their physical validity . most of high
- resolution methods for gasdynamic equations use the exact or some of the approximate self - similar riemann
problem solutions to determine fluxes through the computational cell surfaces . similar methods are expected to
be developed for various types of hyperbolic systems . in this case we must construct the elementary self - similar
solution using only admissible discontinuities ( entropy consistent , evolutionary , etc . ) . basically the choice
of the solution must be made on the basis of the structure of the solution of the extended problem @xcite . all
mentioned above makes very important the study of discontinuous solutions behavior under vanishing viscosity
and dispersion to create a proper background for the development of high - resolution numerical methods for
hyperbolic systems more complicated than the euler equations of gasdynamics . we discuss several analytical
and numerical solutions in the mentioned fields which illustrate the complexity of the selection problem and
outline the methods of its solution . tvd upwind and symmetric differencing schemes have recently become very
efficient tool for solving complex multi - shocked gasdynamic flows . this is due to their robustness for strong
shock wave calculations . the extension of these schemes to the equations of the ideal magnetohydrodynamics is
not simple . first , the exact solution @xcite of the mhd riemann problem is too multivariant to be used in regular
calculations . second , several different approximate solvers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite
, and @xcite applied to mhd equations are now at the stage of investigation and comparison . this investigation
requires i ) determination of a proper slope limiting method in the parameter interpolation procedure necessary
to obtain nonoscillatory schemes of the order of accuracy higher than one ; ii ) development of an efficient
entropy correction method necessary to exclude rarefaction shocks ; and , finally , iii ) solution of the problem of

referring to the drawings and , in particular to fig1 therein illustrated is a prior art surgical support mesh 10
. mesh 10 may be manufactured from monofilament or multifilament yarns . prior art mesh 10 , as shown
, includes multifilament horizontally - extending yarns 12 and multifilament vertically - extending yarns 14
woven together to form a support trellis . the use of multifilament yarns , such as yarns 12 and 14 , provides a
mesh having greater pliability and suppleness than the use of monofilament yarns . these characteristics result
from both the smaller diameter of the individual filaments and the interstitial spaces or voids that are located
between such filaments . in particular , the flexibility of a filament ( or fiber ) generally increases as its diameter
decreases . because the solid cross - sectional area of the filaments of a multifilament yarn is less than the cross -
sectional area of a monofilament yarn of equivalent diameter , the multifilament yarn will have a greater degree
of flexibility and pliability than that of the monofilament yarn . as shown in fig1 a , each of multifilament yarns
12 and 14 is composed of a plurality of filaments 16 that are intermingled or bundled together to form the yarn .
interstitial spaces 18 , which are pockets of air , are formed between adjacent filaments of the yarn . although
these voids contribute to the softness and pliability of the formed mesh , they also provide a natural breeding
ground for bacteria or other infectious material . surgical mesh is , of course , thoroughly sterilized prior to
implantation . nevertheless , surgeons typically prefer the use of monofilament - designed mesh to minimize any
risk of infection . as a result , the advantages associated with multifilament - designed mesh ( i . e ., softness
and pliability which result in better assimilation of the mesh into the body ) are typically sacrificed . it has
been discovered herein that a surgical support mesh having both the softness and pliability of a multifilament -
designed mesh and the infection resistance of a monofilament - designed mesh may be produced . particularly ,
Article it has been discovered that a support trellis formed of multifilament yarn wherein the interstitial voids located
between adjacent filaments are enclosed within an infection - impervious matrix exhibits the desired resistance to
harboring of infectious matter without significant loss of flexibility . particularly , the matrix , which completely
encloses the interstitial voids between the filaments of the yarn , provides an effective barrier to the passage
of infectious matter between the interior and exterior of the yarn . accordingly , any voids remaining in the
yarn after encapsulation of such yarn are enclosed ( and thereby sealed ) within the resultant matrix . a first
embodiment of the present invention is shown in fig2 . particularly , this first embodiment includes a support
trellis 20 formed of multifilament yarns 22 and 24 which overlap at cross - over junctions 25 . subsequent to
forming of the trellis , such trellis is encapsulated within a matrix 26 , which is preferably a flexible material that
continuously surrounds the exterior of the yarns thereby enclosing interstitial voids 27 located between filaments
28 ( see fig2 a ). in one embodiment , the matrix is formed from a polymeric resin . as shown in fig2 a , the resin
can be applied to the yarn in such a manner as to not allow the resin to substantially penetrate into the yarn .
particularly , the penetration of the resin can be controlled through the application procedure , e . g ., quantity of
resin applied and / or encapsulating time . in such an embodiment , the interstitial spaces are enclosed ( rather
than filled ) within the continuous matrix . however , it is contemplated that the resin can be allowed to penetrate

four tower arrangements 2 a , 2 b , 2 c and 2 d for printing a single color or a multicolor image on the webs 4 a , 4
b , 4 c and 4 d . the webs 4 a , 4 b , 4 c and 4 d travel in a substantially linear direction through each of the towers
2 a - 2 d . for example , the web can travel along a substantially vertical path , as shown in fig1 . alternatively ,
as those skilled in the art will appreciate , the web path can be in a substantially horizontal direction , or in a
substantially linear path at any desired angle relative to the vertical direction shown . the towers 2 a - 2 d each
include four printing units 6 c , 6 m , 6 y and 6 b for respectively printing an image in cyan , magenta , yellow
and black on both sides of each web 4 a - 4 d . other colors besides cyan , magenta , yellow and black can be
used . the webs 4 can be , for example , between 1200 and 1600 millimeters wide . each of the printing units 6
c , 6 m , 6 y and 6 b in a tower can be moved along a respective web 4 by a lifting and positioning system 8
shown in fig2 . the lifting and positioning system 8 includes a spindle drive 10 , which has a fixed spindle 12
spanning a range 14 over which the printing units 6 c , 6 m , 6 y and 6 b can be moved . each of the printing
units 6 c , 6 m , 6 y and 6 b includes a ball screw 16 , which is rotatably supported in a housing 18 . the ball
screw 16 can be rotated by a motor 20 as shown in fig2 . fig2 shows one set of a spindle drive 10 , fixed spindle

6 m and 6 c in a tower 2 . rail systems ( not shown ) fixed to a side frame of each tower 2 can also be used to
precisely guide movements of the printing units 6 in the tower . as shown in fig1 and 2 , the position of each of
the printing units 6 along the webs 4 and fixed spindles 12 can be controlled by the operator to allow access to a
desired part of a printing unit 6 . for example , in fig1 the operator has moved the print unit 6 b of tower 2 b into
a position where a printing plate of the print unit 6 b can be most easily accessed . after the printing plate has
been accessed , the operator can move the print unit 6 b into a different position so that inker units in an upper
part of the printing unit 6 b can be easily accessed . two or more printing units 6 in tower 2 can also be moved as
a group . for example , if the operator wants to access the plate cylinder of the printing unit 6 m of tower 2 b
shown in fig1 he can simply move the two printing units 6 y , 6 m upwardly together until the top surface 28 of
the printing unit 6 y contacts the bottom surface 30 of the printing unit 6 b . thereafter , the operator can move
the group of printing units 6 b , 6 y and 6 m upwards into the position shown in tower 2 c of fig1 where the plate
cylinder of the printing unit 6 m can be easily accessed . although fig1 and 2 show four printing units 6 for each

TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) - Iran,s parliament speaker has criticized U.S. President-elect Barack Obama for saying
that Iran’s development of a nuclear weapon is unacceptable. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has
outlined where he thinks U.S. policy needs to change. Ali Larijani said Saturday that Obama should apply his
campaign message of change to U.S. dealings with Iran. "Obama must know that the change that he talks about
is not simply a superficial changing of colors or tactics," Larijani said in comments carried by the semi-official
Mehr News Agency. "What is expected is a change in strategy, not the repetition of objections to Iran’s nuclear
program, which will be taking a step in the wrong direction." In his first post-election news conference Friday
afternoon, Obama reiterated that he believes a nuclear-armed Iran would be "unacceptable." He also said he
would help mount an international effort to prevent it from happening. Larijani said that U.S. behavior toward
Iran "will not change so simply" but that Obama’s election showed internal conditions in the United States have
shifted. He added that Iran does not mind if the United States provides other Persian Gulf countries with nuclear
technology, but "you should know that you cannot prevent the Islamic Republic [from reaching its goals in the
nuclear field]," according to the news agency. Obama cautioned Friday that it had only been a few days since
the election and that he was not in office. "Obviously, how we approach and deal with a country like Iran is
not something that we should simply do in a knee-jerk fashion. I think we’ve got to think it through," Obama
said. "But I have to reiterate once again that we only have one president at a time. And I want to be very careful
that we are sending the right signals to the world as a whole that I am not the president, and I won’t be until
January 20th." Larijani was speaking two days after Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad congratulated
Obama, the first time an Iranian leader has offered such wishes to a U.S. president-elect since the 1979 Islamic
Revolution. One analyst said the welcome was a gesture from the hard-line president that he is open to a more
conciliatory relationship with the United States. Ahmadinejad said Tehran "welcomes basic and fair changes in
U.S. policies and conducts," according to the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency on Thursday. Relations
between the United States and Iran have historically been chilly and have been further strained in recent years
over Iran’s nuclear program. Tehran insists that the program exists for peaceful purposes, but the United States
and other Western nations are concerned by Iran’s refusal to halt uranium enrichment activities. CNN’s Shirzad
Bozorgmehr contributed to this report.

Editor’s note: The staff at CNN.com has recently been intrigued by the journalism of VICE, an independent
media company and website based in Brooklyn, New York. VBS.TV is Vice’s broadband television network.
The reports, which are produced solely by VICE, reflect a transparent approach to journalism, where viewers
are taken along on every step of the reporting process. We believe this unique reporting approach is worthy
of sharing With our CNN.com readers. Brooklyn, New York (VBS.TV) - Whenever someone at our office
bitches about being overworked, our stock response is "Beats digging ditches." While the express intention
of the statement is usually not-so-supportive, we think it’s a healthy reminder that at the end of the day, we
are all basically professional e-mailers and should be thankful for such. The wildland firefighters who work
for Grayback Forestry in Medford, Oregon, have no such motivational adages because their job is actually
digging ditches. Around active forest fires. On the sides of mountains. You can’t even bitch at these guys
for having cushy government pensions to fall back on when they get older, because they’re all private-sector
contractors. Which means if they aren’t out fighting forest fires or doing preventative forestry on unburned
woods (basically extreme landscaping), they are losing money. They are the hardest working men in the tree
business. Southern Oregon in the summer is a tinderbox. Last year the state recorded some 560 wild fires, the
majority of which occurred in the seemingly endless sea of trees running across its bottom from the Cascades to
the Pacific Coast. Humidity is next to nonexistent, which is extremely pleasant, but means that even an errant
spark from a chainsaw or the proverbial cigarette butt out the car window can set the entire region ablaze. Flying
into the Rogue Valley, there is evidence of past wild fires is everywhere: From the miles-long scar of the 2002
"Biscuit" fire stretching past the horizon, to the smaller pockets of charred trees crowding the edge of towns
to the blue Wilderness-Firefighter-ribbon bumper stickers flying past on the I-5 to the elaborate wildfire and
firefighter shrines at a local bar. See more of Oregon Fire Lines at VBS.TV There are very few places firemen
aren’t revered as local heroes, but the wilderness firefighters of Oregon go past people simply risking their lives
to help others into a crazy superhero realm where their work regularly prevents entire settlements from being
destroyed. They’re literally the guardians of their communities. Incidentally, their work is also very beneficial
for the forest. We spent a few days following a crew of Grayback forest-firefighters walk up the sides of what
most people would consider a cliff, to chop down underbrush in preparation for a controlled burn. This is what
they like to call "project work" - the light stuff they do between fires. The work is the hardest and least rewarding
work we have ever tried to do. Unless you consider 12-hour-plus shifts of backbreaking labor, virtually zero
outside recognition, and occasional accusations of being shills for the timber industry rewards. Which we do not.

WASHINGTON (CNN) - The nation's largest publicly owned utility company may be vulnerable to cyber
attacks, according to a new report. In 2007 President Bush visited the Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant, operated
by the Tennessee Valley Authority. The Tennessee Valley Authority, which supplies power to almost 9 million
Americans, "has not fully implemented appropriate security practices to protect the control systems used to
operate its critical infrastructures," leaving them "vulnerable to disruption," the Government Accountability
Office found. Simply put, that means a skilled hacker could disrupt the system and cause a blackout. Rep.
James Langevin, a Rhode Island Democrat, fears the problem is much larger than just the TVA. "If they are not
secure, I don’t have a great deal of confidence that the rest of our critical infrastructure on the electric grid is
secure," he said. The TVA operates 52 nuclear, hydroelectric and fossil-fuel facilities in the southeastern United
States. Among the government watchdog agency findings: • The TVA’s firewalls have been bypassed or are
inadequately configured • Passwords are not effective • Servers and work stations lack key patches and effective
virus protection • Intrusion-detection systems are not adequate • Some locations lack enough physical security
around control systems. The GAO recommends 73 steps to correct the problems in its report to Congress. In
September, CNN first aired dramatic footage of a government experiment demonstrating that a cyber attack
could destroy electrical equipment. The experiment, dubbed "Aurora," caused a generator to fall apart and grind
to a halt after a computer attack on its control system. The test was conducted by scientists at the Idaho National
Laboratory. In October, the North American Electric Reliability Corp. told Congress that 75 percent of utilities
had taken steps to mitigate the Aurora vulnerability, but Langevin said it now appears that Congress was misled.
A congressional audit of the electric reliability corporation’s claim cast doubt on the assertion that most utilities
were taking steps to fix the problem. "It appears that they just made those numbers up," Langevin said. "It is not
acceptable. It is outrageous." He said the result is there is now no clear picture of how vulnerable utilities are to
cyber attacks. The electric reliability corporation - a nongovernmental group that oversees the power system
and comprises members of the industry and some consumers - told CNN it regrets the confusion. Experts told
CNN that Cooper Industries is the only manufacturer of hardware that can close the Aurora vulnerability. The
company estimated it would need to sell about 10,000 devices to fix the problem nationwide. It has sold just
over 100, it told CNN. Langevin said the federal government may need new powers to require utilities to take
corrective actions to close cyber security gaps, and he will press to give those powers to the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission. The congressman is chairing an Emerging Threats, Cybersecurity, and Science and
Technology subcommittee hearing Wednesday afternoon. Representatives of the TVA, the GAO, the federal
commission and the electric reliability corporation are to appear before the subcommittee.
[Q: Are cyber attacks a real threat? A:]: Yes.
Gold Answer: skilled hacker could disrupt the system and cause a blackout.
[Q: What steps are being taken to access vulnerabilities? A:]: The GAO recommends 73 steps.
Gold Answer: 73
