Table 1: Table of results for experiments run using a pre-trained ResNet-101 encoder. The Upperbound model is a baseline model where only canonical views are given as input, and is expectedto have the highest performance since it does not have to answer questions from another randomviewpoint as input. For the columns shown: 3D? refers to whether we are using 2D latents or 3Dlatents (the difference between Figs 2 and 4); camera (embed) refers to embedding the cameracoordinates and concatenating it with the question embedding; camera (rotation) refers to using thecamera to map to a rigid transform of the volume (shown in Figure 4). The result denoted with â†‘(in small text) indicates the same experiment but with the postprocessor frozen after random weightinitialisation. See Supp. 6.3 for more on MAC baseline. Accuracies shown are percentages. For all3D FILM, projection results, the mean/stdev is computed over the top 3 performing models (out of 6).
Table 2: Table of results for experiments run with the contrastive encoder described in Section2.2.3. For the columns shown: Data aug refers to what data augmentation scheme was used, forstochastic data augmentation operator T() (2D = contrast T(X1) and T (X1), 3D = contrast X1 andX2, 2D+3D = contrast T(X1) and T (X2); NCE accuracy is how well the contrastive encoder isable to distinguish between pairs of views that belong to the same/different scene; the remainingcolumns denote the FILM task, as described in Table 1.
Table 3: Select experiments from Table 1 but trained on CLEVR-MRT. For all experiments shown inthis table, the mean/stdev is computed over the top three runs (out of six in total).
