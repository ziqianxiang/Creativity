Table 1: Average accuracy and standard deviation for graph benchmarks are presented. The Diff-Pool* denotes DiffPool with additional losses originally proposed in Ying et al. (2018). Also,SSGPool-NoReg indicates the SSGPool without regularization. We highlight the best results (bold)and second best results (blue).
Table 2: The results of image retrieval interms of NDCG. Higher the NDCG score is,better the performance.
