Table 1: Comparison of experimental results on CIFAR-10-C dataset with three different classifiers.
Table 2: Mean PSNR values for enhanced CIFAR-10-C images from different approaches.
Table 4: The table represents the information of datasets used in the experiments, where P, F, andT represent pretraining, finetuning, and testing phase. * Learning rate in pretraining and fine-tuningis reduced by the factor of 10 after every 50 and 100 epochs respectively. * LR stands for learningrate, CCE for Categorical Cross Entropy and DC for Dice Coefficient.
