Table 1: Comparison of different backdoor defenses on CIFAR-10 dataset. ‘Clean’ and ‘ASR’indicates the accuracy (%) and attack success rate (%) on testing set, respectively. The boldfaceindicates the best results among all preprocessing based defenses.
Table 2: The comparison between standard backdoor attacks and enhanced backdoor attacks fromthe aspect of attack success rate against different transformation-based defenses.

We examine four types of color-shifting, including modifyinghue (dubbed Hue), modifying contrast (dubbed Contrast), modifying brightness (dubbed Bright-ness), and modifying saturation (dubbed Saturation). All images are randomly transformed withmaximum perturbation size ∈ {0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4}.
