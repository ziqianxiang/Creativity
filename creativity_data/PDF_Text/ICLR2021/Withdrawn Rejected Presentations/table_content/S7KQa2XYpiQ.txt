Table 1: Results on mini-ImageNet and tiered-ImageNet for 5-way evaluation. The results are theaverage accuracy with 95% confidence intervals based on the same 2000 test episodes among all ourexperiments. The 95% confidence intervals is reference to comparing with other methods.
Table 2: Domain Difference Testing on CUB Dataset using the mini-ImageNet Trained Model.
Table 3: Ablation Studies on CUB. All experiments are in 5-way evaluations. The results are theaverage accuracy based on 2000 test episodes. Episodes are the same over all experiments. The 95%confidence intervals are approximately the same(with 0.01 difference among experiments), and weput the values correspondingly: 0.43, 0.38, 0.48, 0.39.
