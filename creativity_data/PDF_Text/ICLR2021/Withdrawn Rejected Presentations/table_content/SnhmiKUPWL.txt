Table 1: Data composition and nomenclature of the four studied datasets. IR stands for the ImbalanceRatio (largest over smallest class count), nodes and leaves denote respectively the total number ofclasses and leaf-classes in the tree-shape hierarchy, ABF stands for the Average Branching Factor,and hDi stands for the average pairwise distance.
Table 2: Influence of the choice of scaling in Ldisto, metric guiding regularizer, and distance functiond on the performance of Guided-proto on the four datasets. For d, we compare the performance ofthe Euclidean norm, the pseudo-Huberized Euclidean norm, and the square Euclidean norm.
