Table 1: CP with External Observer. Proof-of-Concept Task: 2 Concepts. In both settings (with or without acurriculum), near-perfect ZS Coordination can be achieved.
Table 2: CP with External Observer. For tasks of increasing complexity: 5 and 10 intents. ZS Coordination ismaximized when using an energy curriculum and providing the explicit latent structure.
