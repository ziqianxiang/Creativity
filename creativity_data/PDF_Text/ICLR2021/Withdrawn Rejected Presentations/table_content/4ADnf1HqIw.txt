Table 1: Per-pixel square root of meansquared error (SqrtMSE) for the entiredataset.
Table 2: Per-pixel SqrtMSE for the test set. In-spite of Table 1 demonstrating that subdivisionimproves the ground truth TS data, the improve-ments are not uniformly realized by the TSNN(which we discuss in the supplemental material).
