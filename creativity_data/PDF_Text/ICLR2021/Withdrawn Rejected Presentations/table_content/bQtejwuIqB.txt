For MNIST, the hypocritically perturbed set F andthe adversarially perturbed set A are constructed by attacking every example in the clean test setsampled from D. Both attacks are bounded by a l∞ ball with radius = 0.2. For ImageNet, F andA are constructed based on its validation set sampled from D. Both attacks are bounded by a l∞ball with radius = 16/255. For each experiment, we conduct 3 trials with different random seedsand report the averaged result to reduce the impact of random variations. Appendix A.2 describesfurther experimental details about DNN architecture, training procedure and more results.
