Table 1: Performance of detection methods in defending against adversarial examples generated bydifferent models and attack methods on different datasets.
Table 2: The detailed two-stream network architectures for MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.
Table 3: Classifier architectures for MNIST and CIFAR-10. These three classifiers are designed byus, so it is specifically explained here in the form of a table. All models will be used to generateadversarial examples with different attack methods, but only local models can be used to assistdetection methods.
