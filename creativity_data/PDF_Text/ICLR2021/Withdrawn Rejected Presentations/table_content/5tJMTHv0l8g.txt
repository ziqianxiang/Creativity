Table 1: Summary of sensitivity analysis on ResNet-18 architecture. We measured the sensitivity ofall layers in the model. Then, we categorized and averaged the result by the type of layers. Batchnormalization layers, which accounts for 0.08% of the total number of parameters are particularlymore sensitive to the output.
Table 2: Accuracy of the original and the perturbed image classification models (Krizhevsky et al.,2012; Simonyan & Zisserman, 2015; He et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2017). We measured accuraciesof various model architectures with four perturbing strategies on ImageNet validation dataset.
Table 3: Result of runs tests on ResNet-18 parameters and Imagenet validation images. A high Z-score can be interpreted as an evidence that the corresponding sequence of the variables are noti.i.d.
