Table 1: S2SD comparison against strong baseline objectives. All results computed over multipleseeds. Bold denotes best results per loss & benchmark, bluebold marks best results per benchmark.
Table 2: State-of-the-art comparison. We show that S2SD, represented by its variants MSDF(A),boosts baseline objectives to state-of-the-art across literature. (*) stands for IncePtion-VI with frozenBatch-Norm. Bold: best results per literature setup. Bluebold: best results per overall benchmark.
