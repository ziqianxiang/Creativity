An extremely large ξ, which represents abnormaldriving behaviors in traffic domains, will be detected easily. By analyzing PeMS and META-LA(S),speed variation within 15km/h occurs frequently, and consequently, We regard the accessible bound-ary of speed variation is 15km/h, namely √ξ = 15.
Table 3: The effectiveness test on the proposed weakest vertex locating strategy	NMAPEI	30%-IVMOS	-^45%^^	3CEN	3.2%	1CT	15.2%	17Proposed	15.2%	17The proposed strategy’s effectiveness is close to the complete traversal algorithm. In this experiment,it locates the same weakest vertex as the complete traversal algorithm does. Poisoning the vertexwith the most edges or the highest centrality cannot fool the forecasting model effectively. A possiblereason is that these vertices’ robustness is improved by their neighbors because of the STGCN’sspatiotemporal mechanism.

Because it attacks all vertices rather than onevertex, we set e as 3 and 2 respectively.
