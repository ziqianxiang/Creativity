Table 1: Top-1 accuracy (%) on 50K-image ImageNet validation-set and PGD adversarial examples.
Table 2: While standard classifiers rely heavily on textures, R classifiers rely heavily on shapes. Thetop-1 accuracy scores (%) are computed on the cue-conflict dataset by Geirhos et al. (2019).
Table 3: R models often do not generalize well to common distorted images (c-d), which are outsidetheir training distribution (b), but interestingly outperform S models on texture-less images (e-f).
Table 4: Mean total variance of conv layers of 6 different models. Our observation shows that thetotal variance in early layer of R models are consistently lower than S model. See Fig. A27 forlayer-wsie analysis.
Table A1: Top-1 accuracy of 6 models (in %) on all 15 types of image corruptions in ImageNet-C(Hendrycks & Dietterich, 2019). On average over all 15 distortion types, R models underperformtheir standard counterparts.
