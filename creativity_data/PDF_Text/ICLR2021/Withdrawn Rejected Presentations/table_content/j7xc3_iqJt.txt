Table 1: Results on the PubMed, arXiv and Newsroom dataset. Each type corresponds to purelyabstractive (A), extractive (E), or extractive-abstractive hybrid (H) approaches. TLM uses the GPT-2 model (Radford et al., 2019) that has 16 times larger parameters than Mem2Mem. The highestROUGE scores for abstractive methods are boldfaced. All ROUGE scores have a 95% confidenceinterval of at most Â±0.25 as reported by the official ROUGE. Results taken from: 1Subramanianet al. (2019) and 2Cohan et al. (2018). * Newsroom abstractive summarization test set results.
