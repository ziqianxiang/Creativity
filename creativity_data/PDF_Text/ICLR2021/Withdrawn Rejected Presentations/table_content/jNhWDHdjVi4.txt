Table 1: Test accuracy of SSL methods. Our results show mean (std. dev.) across 10 samples of the labeled set.
Table 2: Ablation study for SSL on MNIST using a dense MLP matching M2’s network architecture. Trialsused 100 labels and encoding size C = 50. Unless cited, all results come from our implementation, whereencoder and decoder have 1000 units per hidden layer. All our introduced techniques improve accuracy. M2’saccuracy deteriorates when its networks are overparameterized, even after tuning α on validation set instead ofusing default from Kingma et al. (2014), while our method remains stable.
