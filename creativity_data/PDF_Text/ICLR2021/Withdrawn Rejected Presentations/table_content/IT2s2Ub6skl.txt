Table 1: Information about the metagenomic datasets5.2	Reference Methods compared to metagenome2VecTo our knowledge there is no other study applying machine learning directly on raw metagenomicdata to predict disease. In general, disease classification with metagenomic data is done with stan-dard pipeline using species-level relative abundances and presence of strain-specific markers (Pasolliet al. 2016). On top of these bioinformatic processes, machine learning algorithms like SVM, Ran-dom Forest or Elastic Net are trained to make predictions. More recently, Oh et al. (2020) haveproposed to highlight the use of auto-encoder models on such metagenomic abundance tables. Re-sults are reported in the table 2 and are used in this paper as part of the state-of-the-art benchmark.

Table F.1: Mantel Test scores between Mash distance and genomes embeddings. Parameters k anddim are for k-mer size and embeddings dimension respectively. When k increases the Mantel testgets a better value. FastDNA dominates the ranking in front of the Transformer, which is itself betterthan FastText.
