Table 1: Results on Kinetics-600 We compare different versions of our two-stage model against the reportedmetrics for DVD-GAN models (Clark et al., 2019). Our model when unrolled is able to generate 48 framesof similar quality as a 128x128 DVD-GAN model trained to generate 48 frames while having computationalrequirements close to the 128x128/12 version. Furthermore, we compare two versions of our model with thesecond stage trained on different window sizes. We verify that the model with the bigger window size performsbetter at the cost of being more computationally expensive.
Table 2: Stage 2 128x128/6 comparison We report metrics on Kinetics and BDD for our model with/out thematching discriminator (MD). Both models perform similarly for 6 frames, corresponding to the training videolength. However, adding the MD improves the 50-frame generations, as they remain grounded to the first stageoutput allowing for consistent videos beyond the training length.
Table 3: Computational costs: We compare the required memory and training time for a a DVD-GAN modeland its SSW-GAN equivalent. Our model takes roughly half of the training time and requires 4x less GPUmemory. Data for DVD-GAN is based in our reimplementation of the model.
Table 4: Per category scores for classes with different amounts of motion (Kinetics-600) We report per-class IS and FID scores for 5 randomly selected categories with high motion and 5 categories with low motion.
