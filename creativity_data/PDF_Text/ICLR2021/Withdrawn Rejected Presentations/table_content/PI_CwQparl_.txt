Table 1: Configurations and parameters of different DCGMM architectures.
Table 2: Two metrics, Dunn index (higher is better) and Davies-Bouldin (DB) score (smaller isbetter), evaluated for all tested DCGMM architectures on MNIST and FashionMNIST. Best resultsare marked in bold. The given numbers are Worst Cases over 10 independent runs.
