Table 1: Validation accuracy comparison. “Prune” refers to the pruned-and-retrained network and“Small” refers to the small network trained from scratch. Note that the aggressive channel pruningwith fine-tuning shows the low performance, where it often collapsed to 10% accuracy.
Table 2: Validation accuracy comparison. “prune” refers to the pruned-and-retrained network, and“small” refers to the small network with the same number of weights as that of the pruned network,which is trained from scratch.
