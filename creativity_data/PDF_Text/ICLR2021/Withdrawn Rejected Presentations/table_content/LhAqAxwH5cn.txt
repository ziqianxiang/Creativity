Table 1: The test accuracy and standard deviation (5 trials) on experiments with loss functions, underdifferent complementary labels’ distribution assumption, for datasets: MNIST, FASHION-MNIST,CIFAR10. We report the last ten percent epochs average test accuracy. For fair comparison, thelast three columns’ data are directly copying from Table.2 in Ishida et al. (2019), where GA Ishidaet al. (2019): Gradient Ascent, PC Ishida et al. (2017): Pairwise Comparison, Fwd Yu et al. (2018b):Forward correction. The top 2 accuracies are boldface.
