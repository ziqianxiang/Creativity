We define all the k-hop neighbor entities of the question entity as the candidate entities forthe question. We also consider a more realistic setting where we simulate an incomplete KG byrandomly dropping a triplet with a probability 50%. This setting is called KG-50%, compared withthe full KG setting KG-Full. For each entity, we randomly sample one question containing it as theentityâ€™s description context. We manually write the description for each relation since the numberof relations is very small. We use the output embedding of [CLS] token from LM as the questionembedding, and then find the entity with the closest context embedding.
