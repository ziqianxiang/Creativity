Table 2: Ablation study of AR-AdaLS on CIFAR-100 and CIFAR100-C (corrupted). We report bothaccuracy and expected calibration error, denoted by Acc and ECE for the clean test set, and cAccand cECE for CIFAR100-C. Arrow indicates the better direction; best calibration of single model isbolded._______________________________________________________________________________________________Method	Vanilla	Label Smoothing	Temperature Scaling	AR-AdaLS (pre-compute)	AR-AdaLS (on-the-fly)	Ensemble of VanillaAcc/cAcc (↑)	79.2/52.0	78.9/51.7	79.2/52.0	79.3/52.2	79.2/52.1	81.8/55.1ECE/cECE (J) 6.1/18.2		2.8/16.3	4.3/14.0	2.6/14.2	2.3/13.2	2.2/10.5Figure 2: Comparison between LS and our AR-AdaLS on the clean test set of CIFAR-10.
