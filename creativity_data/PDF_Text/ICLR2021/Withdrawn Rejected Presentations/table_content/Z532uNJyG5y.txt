Table 1: Graph classification accuracies (%) for kernels and unsupervised methods on 6datasets. We report the mean and standard deviation of final results with five runs. ‘>1 day’represents that the computation exceeds 24 hours. ‘OMR’ means out of memory error.
Table 2: Graph classification accuracies (%) of semi-supervised experiments on 4 datasets. Wereport the best results on test set in 300 epochs.
