Table 2: Sample Complexity Results as discussed in Section 5.1 and Figure 2.
Table 3: Parameter Error Results as discussed in Section 5.1 and Figure A.6.
Table 4: The effect of jitter on a given algorithm for a given level of jitter as computed in A.10. Theeffect is calculated by dividing the performance with jitter by the mean performance without andsubtracting 1.
