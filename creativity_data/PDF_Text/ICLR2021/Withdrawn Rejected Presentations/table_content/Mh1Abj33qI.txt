Table 1: Dataset statistics, diameter, nodes, edges, and clustering co-efficient averaged over graphs.
Table 2: Mean ± standard deviation test set accuracy on biochemical datasets. Time limit expired(TLE) individual denotes models that did not finish in 10 hours.
Table 3: Train and test set mean squared error onCASP GDT regression task over three seeds.
Table 4: Mean ± std. over fourruns of mean squared error over 19targets for the QM9 dataset, loweris better.
Table S1: Dataset statistics, diameter, nodes, edges, clustering coefficient averaged over all graphs.
Table S2: Mean ± std. over 10 test sets on bio-chemical and social datasets.
Table S3:	Mean ± std. over test set selection on cross-validated LEGS-RBF Net with reducedtraining set size.
Table S4:	Test set mean squared error on CASP GDT regression task across targets over 3 non-overlapping test sets.
Table S5: Quantified distance between the empirically observed enzyme class exchange preferencesof Cuesta et al. (2015) and the class exchange preferences inferred from LEGS-FIXED, LEGS-FCN,and a GCN. We measure the cosine distance between the graphs represented by the chord diagramsin Figure 2. As before, the self-affinities were discarded. LEGS-Fixed reproduces the exchangepreferences the best, but LEGS-FCN still reproduces well and has significantly better classificationaccuracy.
