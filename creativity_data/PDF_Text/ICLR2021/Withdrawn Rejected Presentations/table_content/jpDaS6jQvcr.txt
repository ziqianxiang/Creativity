Table 1: Comparison of RCA against various competing methods in terms of (#win-#draw-#loss)on 18 benchmark datasets with different missing ratios. RCA-E (no ensemble), RCA-SS (no sampleselection), AE (no ensemble and no sample selection) are used for ablation study of our method.
Table 2: Summary of benchmark data, where N is sample size and d is number of features.
Table 3: Performance comparison of RCA against various baseline methods in terms of averageAUC scores and its standard deviation across 10 random seeds.
Table 4: Sensitivity Analysis about , the first number is averaged auc score and the second numberis the standard deviation. All experiments are repeated for 10 random seeds.
