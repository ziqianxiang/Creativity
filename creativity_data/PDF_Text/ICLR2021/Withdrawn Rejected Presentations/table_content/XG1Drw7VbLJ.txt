Table 1: Accuracy and standard deviation (percentage) on the test set for the proposed benchmarks. Best inbold.
Table 2: Dataset comparisons. Details details: number of classes in the whole dataset (#Classes), number ofsamples per class (#Samples), Resolution, Format, Size allocation of RAM for the whole dataset. Suitabil-ity: class diversity (Diversity), enough classes (#Classes), enough samples (#Samples), proper size (Size).
