Table 1: (left) Our Ito ensemble approach outperforms SOTA defenses for the PGD attack onCIFAR-10 with e = 8/255 unless specified otherwise. (right) Ito ensemble outperforms Madrytoolbox (Engstrom et al., 2020) under PGD attack with L2 norm, = 2.0, and L∞ norm = 16/255.
Table 2: Our stochastic Ito ensembles and the standard ResNet neural network architectures havesimilar accuracy on CIFAR-10 test data. Because of its ability to abstain from assigning a labelwhen majority of predictions do not conform, the fraction of data where the Ito ensemble predictsan incorrect label is lower that the fraction of data where the original ResNet model is incorrect.
Table 3: The accuracy of our stochastic Ito ensemble with diffusion term corresponding to ω = 0.2on the PGD attack for different values of under the L2 norm.
Table 4: The accuracy of our stochastic Ito ensemble with diffusion term corresponding to ω = 0.2on the PGD attack for different values of e under the L∞ norm.
Table 5: Accuracy of Ito ensembles on benign data with diffusion corresponding to different ω.
Table 6: Accuracy of our Ito ensemble approach on PGD attack (e = 8/255) with different diffusionparameters ω . Higher values of ω lead to more robust models.
