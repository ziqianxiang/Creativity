Table 1: Comparison of the PSNR (in dB) and SSIM of reconstructed images in the ShaPeNetV2dataset by our GRF, the deterministic GQN (Eslami et al., 2018), TCO(Tatarchenko et al., 2015),WRL (Worrall et al., 2017) and SRNs (Sitzmann et al., 2019). The higher the scores, the better thesynthesized novel views. Note that, our GRF solves a harder problem than SRNs, because GRFinfers the novel scene representation in a single forward pass, while SRNs cannot.
