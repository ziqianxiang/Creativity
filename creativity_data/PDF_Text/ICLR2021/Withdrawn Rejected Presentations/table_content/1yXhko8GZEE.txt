Table 1: Comparison of SN-GAN and PC-GAN, using ResNet With Dit = 1∙ Here Wl is the preconditionedweighted matrix (i.e., after applying preconditioning). “2nd maxL=ι κ(∖Wl)" indicates the second largest con-dition number of all layers. “Avg κ(∖Wl)” indicates the average of all layer condition numbers.
Table 2: Results on LSUN data.					4-6 FID scores in most cases. Also note, the condition numbers of the failure case of SN-GAN aremuch higher than the two normal cases of SN-GAN. In all cases, FPC and APC achieve significantlylower condition numbers than SN-GAN. APC achieves higher condition numbers than FPC, andalso better FID scores. We suspect that FPC over-controls the condition numbers which leads tolower representation power. In contrast, APC strikes a better balance between representation andoptimization than FPC. The generated image samples are presented in Appendix F.5.
