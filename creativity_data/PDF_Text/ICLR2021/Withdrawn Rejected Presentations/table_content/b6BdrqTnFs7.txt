Table 1: Details of accuracy results (%) for experiments. We report mean and standard deviations.
Table 2: Accuracy results (%) for ablation study. The ablation experiments have lower accuracythan the proposed approach. This means all the changes are important for the approach.
Table 3: Grounding accuracy results (%) for the proposed method. Grounding works well in all thetasks.
Table 4: Accuracy results (%) for target length experiments. Seq2seq is from Ruis et al. (2020).
Table 5: Sample size of gSCAN dataset.
Table 6: Accuracy results (%) for feW-shot learning experiments. Seq2seq is from Ruis et al. (2020).
