Table 1: Test-set accuracy of loss functions discovered by TaylorGLO with and without an invariantconstraint on λ. Models were trained on the loss function that had the highest validation accuracyduring the TaylorGLO evolution. All averages are from ten separately trained models and p-valuesare from one-tailed Welch’s t-Tests. Standard deviations are shown in parentheses. The invariantallows focusing metalearning to viable areas of the search space, resulting in better loss functions.
