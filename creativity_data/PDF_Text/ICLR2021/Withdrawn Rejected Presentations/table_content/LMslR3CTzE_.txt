Table 1: Given a neighborhood Gu Of U and query Gq containing q, make binary prediction ofwhether Gu is a subgraph of Gu where node q corresponds to u. We report AUROC (unit 0.01).
Table 2: Given a query Gq and a target graph GT from a dataset, make binary prediction for whetherGq is a subgraph of GÏ‡ (the decision problem of subgraph isomorphism), in AUROC (unit: 0.01).
Table 3: Generalization to new samplingmethods for MSRC dataset. Performancemeasured in AUROC (unit 0.01).
