Table 1: Comparison results of different context modeling approaches on the CIFAR datasets.					including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 (Krizhevsky & Hinton, 2009), ImageNet32×32 (Chrabaszczet al., 2017) and the full ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009), with various network architectures asbackbones, including VGG (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014), ResNet (He et al., 2016) and WideResNet (Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2016) (we refer Wide ResNet with depth i and widening factork as WRN-i-k). We first apply ablation studies on CIFAR datasets due to limited computationalresources, and then report more comparisons with the state-of-the-art methods on the other datasets.
