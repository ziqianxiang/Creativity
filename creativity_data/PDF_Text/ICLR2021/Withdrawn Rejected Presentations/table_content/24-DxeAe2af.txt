This training scheme represents the real data analysis as we will train CNV-Net with CNVs from known genomes and testing it on different genomes. As demonstrated inTable 2, CNV-Net achieves the highest F1-score in CNV detection in the HG002 dataset among allsix methods. It also has the highest recall and the second highest precision. This result shows thatCNV-Net is more accurate in CNV detection than current methods.

CNV-Net issignificantly faster than other methods (Table 3). That is because a fitted convolutional neural net-work is efficient in making predictions, however, it may be time-consuming during model training.
