By comparing to a diverse set of state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, we demonstrate thescalability and accuracy of our 2TS model. See detailed configurations in Appendix C.
Table 1: Overall performance for interaction prediction. The best method in each column is coloredblue and second best is colored light blue . The * symbol indicates thatthe original implementationsreleased by the authors or the proposed methods are not scalable and will not be able to run on theindicated datasets without our modifications to their methods. The ] symbol indicates that the releasedimplementations have been modified by us to better adapt to the dataset and evaluation metric, sothat their results in this table should be expected to be better than the original version. The concretemodifications we made are described in Appendix B.
