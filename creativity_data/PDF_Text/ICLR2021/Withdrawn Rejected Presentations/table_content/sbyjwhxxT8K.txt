Table 1: Summary of the attack performance in terms of test accuracy (%), the lower the betterattack. Bold denotes the best performing strategy in each setup. Underline indicates our strategyoutperforms all the baseline strategies. Asterisk (*) means the difference between our strategy andthe best baseline strategy is statistically significant by a pairwise t-test at significance level 0.05.
Table 2: The test accuracy (%) of models after untargeted attacks (U) vs attacks targeting on the testset (T). The experiment setups are the same as those in the Section 5.2.
Table 3: The test accuracy (%) of GCN model after attacks with 10% threshold on synthetic data.
Table 4: The test accuracy (%) of models when is constructed based on the training partition only.
