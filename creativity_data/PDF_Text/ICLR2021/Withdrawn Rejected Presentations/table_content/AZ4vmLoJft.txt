Table 3: Dataset statistics.
Table 4: Test Accuracy of MISIM-GNN Trained on Different Subsets of the Training Set. The resultsare shown as the average and min/max values relative to the average over 3 runs.
Table 5: Code similarity system accuracy. Results are shown as the average and min/max values,relative to the average, over 3 runs. We had to make a few modifications to adapt code2vec, code2seq,NCC and Aroma to our experimental settings. Please refer to Appendix C.2 for details.
