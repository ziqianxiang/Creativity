Table 1: Performance of PCCoder trained using Restricted Domain, Salient Variables, Non-UniformSampling, and our adversarial method. The worst accuracy of each training method for each programlength is bolded.
Table 2: Performance of the four approaches on test sets generated using our evolutionary algorithm.
Table 3: Performance of the three approaches (Bunel et al.â€™s original approach, salient variables, andour adversarial approach) on the 12 test sets proposed by Shin et al. We describe these test sets inAppendix D.
