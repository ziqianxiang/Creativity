Table 1: Performance on the predicate detection task [Lu et al. (2016)]. We report Recall@N averaged (withstandard deviation) across 10 random subsets. We report the statistical significance between “baseline” andcorresponding knowledge augmented model ("+ Knowledge")(p-value < 0.01 as ** and p-value < 0.05 as *).
Table 2: Shows class-wise results (Top-1 accuracy) for top performing predicates from the predicate detectiontask. “Baseline” refers to VGG (baseline) and “+ Knowledge” refers to the knowledge augmented model (seeTable 1). (R) means that the predicate was included in one of the rules.
