Table 1: Divergences written in terms of witness functions. Closed-form solutions denoted ω*.
Table 2: Relationship between scalar discrepancy δ, divergence D between continuous μ, V anddiscrete measures μ, V, operator dissimilarity d, max-sliced dissimilarity, and kernel max-sliceddivergence for the TV and squared Bures divergences (squared Bures is twice the squared Hellinger).
Table 3: Unsupervised covariate shift outlier detection on MNIST. The goal is to identify instancesassociated with an over- or underrepresented class l ∈ {0, . . . , 9}. Values are AUC where positivesare instances from class l. We report the mean and standard deviation and the number of times eachmethod has the highest AUC (including ties) across 100 trials (10 for each case l ∈ {0, . . . 9}).
Table 4: Frechet Inception distances (FID) between CIFAR10 test set images in each class andreweighted sample of synthetic images from AutoGAN. The second column shows the FID to thecorresponding training set. The third column is a uniform weighting over all 50,000 synthetic im-ages. The reweighting that minimizes the max-sliced Bures distance (MSB) to the subset of trainingimages performs the best on average. Using the W2 distance—estimated through 10 mini-batchesof 100 images on each iteration—performs best only on one-class. The max-sliced W2 (MSW2)distance also uses mini-batches. The realism scores R of the 20 images with the highest weight foreach class (200 images for each method) are summarized by the median and range.
