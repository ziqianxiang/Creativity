Table 1: QA results (EM and F1) on Jericho-QA test set and averaged asymptotic scores on games bydifferent methods across 5 independent runs. For KG-A2C and Q*BERT, we present scores averagedacross the final 100 episodes as well as max scores. Methods using exploration strategies show onlymax scores because Episode Average Score (Eps.) conflates forward progress and backtracking.
