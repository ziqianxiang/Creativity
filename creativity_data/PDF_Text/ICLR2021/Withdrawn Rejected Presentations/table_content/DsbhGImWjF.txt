Table 2: The detailed configurations of six searchspaces with different sets of active operators. S0is contains two operators thought to be most use-ful, while skip-connect is missing in S2 and sep-conv-3x3 missing in S3 and S4 .
Table 1: Comparison to state-of-the-art NAS methods on CIFAR10. The architectures A-F are thePareto-optimal obtained from a single search procedure (μ = 1, better efficiency), and G-L fromanother procedure (μ = 0). The search cost is for all six architectures sharing the same μ. Eachsearched architecture is re-trained three times individually.
Table 3: Comparison with state-of-the-arts on ImageNet-1K, un-der the mobile setting. t these architectures are searched onImageNet, while others searched on CIFAR10.
Table 4: Results of five extended search spaces. We have used a fixed rule to choose representa-tive architectures, so the numbers of architectures may vary among different search spaces and/orprocedures.
