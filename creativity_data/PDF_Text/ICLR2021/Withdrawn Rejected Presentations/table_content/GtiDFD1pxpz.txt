Table 1: Comparison of classification performance on image recognition datasets. We comparethe M-layer to fully-connected ReLU nets, RBF-SVM, NODE (Chen et al., 2018), and ANODE(Dupont et al., 2019). The ReLU net has 2 hidden layers of size (100, 50) for MNIST and (50, 50)for CIFAR-10 and SVHN. For NODE and ANODE, we report numbers from Dupont et al. (2019).
