Table S1: Internal models versus DNI. The properties of the forward model of the cerebellum canbe set against those of backward DNI (blue); similarly, the properties of the inverse model of thecerebellum can be set against those of forward DNI (red). Notation is largely consistent with section2 of the main text: hm , hs denotes the hidden activity of a motor area and sensory area, respectively;CB, CF denotes the computation of backward DNI and forward DNI, respectively; L denotes the lossfunction. In addition, the inverse model of the cerebellum traditionally also has access to a desiredstate ds (in particular, one can consider this a special case of “context” provided to the synthesiser;cf (Jaderberg et al., 2017)). There are no explicit equations for the computational processes of theforward and inverse models, and both are thus represented by the unknown function funk .
