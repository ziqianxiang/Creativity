Table 1: Comparison with the state of the art methods in SSL. We note that using Anisotropicdiffusion with MoCoV2 improves performance on VOC detection and Semantic Segmentation (SS).
Table 2: Transfer learning across different datasets. Note that our approach leads to improvementsin both supervised and self-supervised learning set-up.
Table 3: Experiments with Sketch-ImageNet. Use of Anisotropic ImageNet shows that our methodis better at capturing representation that are less dependent on texture.
Table 4: Comparison using different texture removing methods, with different hyper-parameters forAnisotropic diffusion methods. We observe that the most simple (Perona & Malik, 1990) performsthe best and removing more texture from images does not improve performance.
