Table 1: Comparison of the axis-alignment and scalability of the disentangled representation learnedby different approaches. ADIS-GAN is the only algorithm that generates disentangled representa-tions with both useful properties.
Table 2: Disentanglement scores on the dSprites dataset. The reference values are from Lin et al.
