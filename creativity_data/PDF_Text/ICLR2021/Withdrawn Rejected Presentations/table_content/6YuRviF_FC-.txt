Table 1: The table shows the performance of the extremely randomized tree algorithm as the bestmethod in predicting the amplitude and phase gain solutions for both H and V polarization as shownin figures 3. The values shown represents the uniform average of all KAT-7 antennas, i.e., all outputmeasures are averaged with uniform weight. Most of the predictions stay near the ideal truth valueswith RMSE and RMAE â‰ˆ< 0.5, R2 and explained variance V are converging to 1.
