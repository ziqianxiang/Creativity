Table 1: Comparison of peak per-task accuracy, forgetting,and training time for the same epochs between baselinesand LASEM on Office-Home, ± 95% confidence interval.
Table 2: Parameters of the lifelong learning experiments. We used the notion of task type (e.g.
Table 3: Comparison of test accuracy and training time for the same epochs to brute-force config-uration search, ± 95% confidence interval. Training time shown above is ratio to training time ofLASEM. Relative time greater than 1.0 means that training the model is slower than our approach.
