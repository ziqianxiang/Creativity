Table 1: Results on tabular datasets. We report average and standard deviations over 4 runs of MSE forregression datasets: Year, Microsoft and Yahoo, and error rate for classification datasets: Click and Higgs. Bestresult, and those within a standard deviation from it, for each family of algorithms (single tree or ensemble) arein bold. Dashes ‘-’ indicate that the method cannot be run (i.e., a method is designed only for classification).
Table 2: Results on the Mushrooms tabular dataset. We report average training time (s), and average andstandard deviations of test error rate over 4 runs for binary classification datasets. We bold the best result (andthose whose standard deviation overlaps the mean of the best result). Experiments are run on a machine with 16CPUs and 63GB RAM. We limit the training time to 3 days.
Table 3: Results for hierarchical clustering. We reportaverage and standard deviations of dendrogram purityover four runs. Best results and all within a standarddeviation from it are in bold.
