Evaluating the transitive closure of X directlyevaluates the model’s performance on each hierarchy, denoted as TC(X). This can be furtherdivided into three categories: dataset that evaluates model ability to capture transitive closure of X1,TC(X 1), dataset that evaluates model generalization ability on missing edges X - X1, and datasetthat evaluates model’s extended generalization ability on TC(X) - TC(X 1).
