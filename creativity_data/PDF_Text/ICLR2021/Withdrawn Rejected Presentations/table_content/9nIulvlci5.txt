As in the previous experiments we obtained a much smaller dimension8Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2021of the representation (31 vs 29k) and drastically reduced the time for vectorization and the timeto measure the similarity of objects (kNN prediction time). It should be noted that we noticeablyimproved the quality of similarity measurement in comparison to the source space (61.1 vs 79.6) ascan be seen also in Fig. 4. We also reduced correlation in comparison of the Model A and Model B,however it did not help us to obtain more quality representaions. This result can be explained by the

Especially for the small dimension of the last hidden layer. This maybe due to the fact that if the layer size is insufficient, there are not enough dimensions to describethe variability of the data, even if the data is not highly correlated.
