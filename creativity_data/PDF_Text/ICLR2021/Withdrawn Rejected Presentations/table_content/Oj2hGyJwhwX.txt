Table 1: mCE (%) comparison of CIFAR-10-C and CIFAR-100-C. SelfNorm&CrossNorm (SNCN)obtains lower errors than most previous methods with different backbones. Albeit some higher errorsthan AugMix, it is totally domain agnostic without relying on the image primitives, e.g., rotation, inAugMix. As SNCN and AugMix are orthogonal, their joint usage brings new state-of-the-art results.

Table 3: Segmentation results (mIoU) on GTAV-Cityscapes domain generalization using aFCN withResNet50. SelfNorm (SN) and CrossNorm (CN) are comparable with IBN and domain randomiza-tion (DR) on the target domain. Combining SN and CN can achieve state-of-the-art performance.

Table 5: Order of SelfNorm and CrossNorm. In this experiment, they both are at the post-additionposition in a residual cell.
Table 6: Block choices of SelfNorm and CrossNorm. We compare the mCEs (%) when applyingSelfNorm and CrossNorm to image space or different blocks in a WideResNet-40-2. The choice ofall blocks gives the lowest errors for both of them.

Compared with SIN, CN holds a better balancebetween clean and corruption errors. SN also works well in decreasing the corruption error whilemaintaining low clean error. Combining SN and CN can further lower both errors.
