Table 1: Performance on two sequential data and M=500. We present the mean value of √∈peheand ATE on test sets from two datasets. The standard deviations are tiny. Lower is better. Underno domain shift scenario, the three strategies and CERL have the similar performance, becausethe previous and new data are from the same distribution. Under substantial shift and moderateshift scenarios, CFR-A performs well on previous data, but significantly declines on new dataset;straxtegy CFR-B shows the catastrophic forgetting problem; CERL has a similar performance tostrategy CFR-C, while CERL does not require access to previous data. Besides, the larger domainshift leads to worse performance of CFR-A and CFR-B. CERL has remained stable against shift.
Table 2: Performance on two sequential data and M = 10000. We present the mean value of √ePEHEand eATE on test sets from two datasets. The standard deviations are tiny. Lower is better.
