Table 1: On the image generation task, latentGA seems the best performer and latentRS matchessato with a significantly reduced inference cost (by an order of 20). ± is 97% confidence interval.
Table 2: Performance of the latentRS method on the estimation of 2D mixtures of Gaussians withrespectively 4, 9, 16 or 25 components. Each mode has a variance σ2 = 0.025 is separated by adistance d = 5. As expected the latentRS method removes data points that are off the target manifoldand therefore significantly improves the Hausdhorff metric.
Table 3: Comparison of latentRS with concurrent methods on two synthetic datasets in the samesetting as Tanaka (2019). Our method enables a consistent gain in EMD, surpassing other methodson Swiss Roll and slightly behind DOT on Mixture of 25 Gaussians.
Table 4: Comparing latentRS and latentGA with previous works (DRS, MH-GAN, SIR-GAN, DOT)on the image generation task. Interestingly, latentGA seems the best performer and latentRS matchessato with a significantly reduced inference cost (by an order of 20). ± is 97% confidence interval.
