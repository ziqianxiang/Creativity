Table 1: Dataset statistics.
Table 2: (Left) The performance of the converged model of our algorithm on the test set measured with Chamferdistance to the power of 20 and IoU. (Right) Supervised training results.
Table 3: Empirical comparison of pretrained model, fine-tuned model and our model on 2D CAD dataset withChamfer distanceFigure 6: Compare the entropy estimation following the Equation 14 as a weighted sum of stepwise entropyversus taking the average of the sequence log probability. The number of samples, or beam size, varies from 2 to80 on the x-axis. The shaded area represents the standard deviation of each estimator. From left to right, wedemonstrate the result on datasets of three program lengths.
