Table 1: Three point-wise measures for different threat models. All threat models use the '∞ distancefunction, but differ in choice of perturbation threshold (denoted by ε). Each row contains the robusttest errors for one point-wise measure. Each column contains the robust test errors for one model,trained with a specific training method (marked by column title). The lower the number, the betterthe robustness for the specific threat model. Each point-wise measure results in a different relativeordering of the classifiers based on the errors. The order is visualized by different tones of gray in thebackground of the cells.
Table 2: Smallest and largest inter-class distances for subsets of several data sets, measured in l∞,l2, and l1 norm, together with basic contextual information about the data sets. All data has beenbeen normalized to lie within the interval [0, 1], and duplicates and corrupted data points have beenremoved. Apart from HAR, all data sets contain images - the dimensionality reported specifies theirsizes and number of channels.
