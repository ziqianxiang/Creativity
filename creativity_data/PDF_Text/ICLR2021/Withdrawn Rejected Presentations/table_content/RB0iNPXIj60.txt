Table 1: mAP [IoU=0.50:0.95] performance of original and refined predictions on the COCOdataset. The table shows accuracy in the form of IOU of a generic detector when its official, pre-trained model is used - marked as a baseline. The right part shows IOU accuracy when the samepre-trained model is coupled with BBRefinement. All BBRefinement versions are trained only once,and the same trained version is used for all multiple detectors. For the training of BBRefinement,we use the same split as it is common and has also been used by the authors of the generic detectors.
