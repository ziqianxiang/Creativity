Table 1: Weighted mean squared error ρ as defined in (6) for the considered models on differentdata sets. The GP model is grayed out since it does not scale towards larger data sets. To prevent thescaling of the epistemic uncertainty to the unit interval from deteriorating the performance of GPmodel, BNN and Dropout We minimize P for the evaluation over a factor α ∈ [0,1], η = αη to	1D Center	1D Split	2D Square	2D Gaussian	PMSM temperature	SarcosGPmodel	0.1660	0.1207	0.0655	0.0342	0.0007	4.8150BNN	1.4177	0.5889	1.1953	0.8830	0.0101	21.9015Dropout	0.7904	0.6181	1.0681	0.4468	0.1490	21.3842EpiOut	0.0480	0.1125	0.1893	0.0056	0.0024	14.25371D split and the true underlying function f(x) = sin(πx) are shown on the left.
