Table 1: Non-dominated sorting of combination of DEL, qParEGO and qEHVI Pareto fronts.
Table 2: Performance of FragVAE in comparison with existing methods.
Table 3: Running time of DEL and MOBO. Since both methods involve training FragVAE, theFragVAE training time was not counted in this table. Format: Hours:Minutes:Seconds. Note: whenβ is annealed to 0.4 in DEL, α is annealed from 1 to 4. All experiments were carried out on a DellPrecision 5820 Workstation equipped with an Intel Xeon W-2255 CPU (10C), RAM of 128GB, anda Nvidia Quadro RTX 6000 (24GB) GPU.
Table 4: Non-dominated sorting of combination of Pareto fronts from DEL with and without prop-erty prediction (PP) component as latent space regularization.
Table 5: Non-dominated sorting of combination of Pareto fronts from DEL with and without DGMfinetuning (FT) phrase.
Table 6: Non-dominated sorting of combination of Pareto fronts from DEL with linear or discretecrossover operation. Note: when β is annealed to 0.4, α is annealed from 1 to 4.
Table 7: Non-dominated sorting of combination of Pareto fronts from DEL with population sizes of20K and 100K. Note: when β is annealed to 0.4, α is annealed from 1 to 4.
Table 8: Non-dominated sorting of combination Pareto fronts from DEL with different values of β.
Table 9: Numbers of novel molecules that satisfy properties QED ≥ 0.88, SAS ≤ 3, and logP ≤ 1in the 1st, 5th and final (10th) generations of DEL. Numbers of training molecules satisfying sameconditions are also given. Note: when β is annealed to 0.4, α is annealed from 1 to 4.
