Table 1: Spearman’s rank coefficient for the correlation between MSD and corruption error. Correlations arehigh for most corruptions, including those in all four categories in ImageNet-C. However, brightness, pixelate,and JPEG compression show poor correlation.
Table 2: Test error for several data augmentation methods on CIFAR-IO-C and ImageNet-IO-C. Every methodperforms worse on these new datasets than on ImageNet-C or CIFAR-10-C. Example corruptions and descriptionsof the abbreviations are given in Appendix E, and standard deviations for individual corruption are given inTable 5 in Appendix D.2. ‘Baseline’ refers to default augmentation only. *ANT uses the single pre-trained modelprovided with the paper and has slightly different training parameters.
Table 3: Spearman’s rank coefficient for the correlation between MSD and corruption error for two architecturesin the feature extractor: WideResNet-40-2 and VGG-19-BN. While WideResNet has slightly better correlationsoverall, the relative behavior across corruptions remains the same for the two architectures.
Table 4: Comparison between performance on ImageNet/CIFAR10-C and ImageNet/CIFAR10-C. Standarddeviations are over 10 runs for CIFAR-10 and 5 runs for ImageNet. *ANT results use the pre-trained modelprovided with the paper and thus has slightly different training parameters and only one run.
Table 5: Breakdown of performance on individual corruptions in ImageNet/CIFAR10-C. Standard deviations areover 10 runs for CIFAR-10 and 5 runs for ImageNet. Examples and full names of each corruption are given inAppendix E. *ANT results use the pre-trained model provided with the paper and thus has slightly differenttraining parameters and only one run.
