Table 1: Accuracy (%) on Digits-Five dataset. SYNTH denotes Synthetic Digits (Ganin & Lempitsky(2014)). The baseline results for the Digits-Five dataset were taken from (Peng et al. (2019)).
Table 2: Accuracy (%) on Office-31 dataset.
Table 3: Accuracy (%) on Office-Home dataset.
Table 4: Experimental setup. The batch size for each domain is reported.
Table 5: Hyper parameters configuration. Annealing-β is not adopted in the Digits-Five experiment.
Table 6: Ablation study of decaying batch spectral penalization and annealing information regulariza-tion (Office-31). For accurate assessment of extent to which performance improvement is causedby each strategies, γ is fixed as 0 in Annealing-β, and β is fixed as 0.1 in Decaying-γ. Results fromAnnealing-β are reported in main paper.
Table 7: Accuracy (%) on Office-Home dataset. Results from MIAN are reported in main paper.
