Table 1: Comparison of our different modules with and without the proposed fusion strategy.
Table 2: Quantitative comparison with other recent methods. All methods just use KITTI trainingsplit for a fair comparison. We compare with both supervised and unsupervised methods takingsingle images (Eigen et al. (2014) Liu et al. (2016) Garg et al. (2016) Godard et al. (2017) Godardet al. (2017) Poggi & et al. (2018) Luo & et al. (2019) Godard & et al. (2019)) or monocular video(Zhou et al. (2017) Mahjourian et al. (2018) Zou & et al. (2018) Ranjan & et al. (2019)) or imagepair Pilzer & et al. (2018) as input.
Table 3: Quantitative comparison with other neighbor view synthesis methods. Higher meanSSIM/PSNR and lower MAD means better performance in synthesising.
