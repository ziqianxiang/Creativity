Table 4: Comparison with baselines. We compare our NLMPC (with surrogate model for predic-tions) with baselines. In the pendulum, our approach is second to the demonstrator for less than1%margin. In the car task, NLMPC performs better than all baselines and improves convergence fromthe demonstrator, while it is nearly on par with the latter on constraints.
