Table 1: Success rates of different models trained by behavior cloning with expert supervision.
Table 2: Evaluation on success rates of two strategies of using goals in RL with DDPG.
Table 3: Ablation studies on different components in our method with grasping success rates.
Table 4: Real-world grasping results. The numbers of successful grasps among trials are presented.
Table 5: Evaluation on grasp prediction performanceTable 5 shows the grasp prediction results. We use the target goals from the expert planner asthe ground truth, and compute translation errors in meters, rotation errors in degrees and the pointmatching distances in meters as used in the loss function in Eq. (2). We compute both the meanerror and the minimum error along the trajectories from the expert.
