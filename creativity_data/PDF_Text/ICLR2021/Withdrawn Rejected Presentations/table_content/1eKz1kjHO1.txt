Table 1: Context Errors (CE) on the Cityscapes (Cordts et al., 2016) validation set. We observe PSS performsbetter in every category and reduces 13.7% relative context errors.
Table 2: Experimental results on the Cityscapes validation set. Our proposed framework PSS achieves com-petitive performance in PQ and outperforms all the other methods in PQSt. * denotes retraining the model usingreleased code; other results are copied from the published papers and ‘-’ denotes missing metrics.

Table 4: Ablation study on hybrid scale exemplarsand dynamic partition. ‘Hybrid’ denotes enabling hy-brid scale exemplars during training and ‘dynamic’denotes enabling dynamic partition during inference.
Table 5: Ablation study on seeds and segment soft-max classifier. Two convolutional layers (and a soft-max classifier) to map the features onto semantic la-tent space are still necessary to produce good predic-tions (+7% in PQ). We also observe the seed predic-tions help the merging process and boost the perfor-mance (+2% in PQ).
