Table 1: Statistics of the nine datasets used in our experiments. The definition of H(G) is providedin Section 4.1. H(G) can be used to distinguish assortative and disassortative graph datasets.
Table 2: Comparisons between MLP and common GNNs. These analytical experiments are used todetermine the two categories of disassortative graph datasets, as introduced in Section 4.3.
Table 3: Comparisons between our NLMLP and strongbaselines on the four disassortative graph datasets be-longing to the first category as defined in Section 4.3.
Table 4: Comparisons between our NL-GCN, NLGAT and strong baselines onthe two disassortative graph datasetsbelonging to the second category as de-fined in Section 4.3.____________________Datasets	Chameleon	SquirrelGCN	67.6±2.4	54.9±1.9GAT	65.0±3.7	51.3±2.5Geom-GCN	60.9	38.1Geom-GCN-g	68.0	46.0NLGCN	701±2.9	59.0±1.2NLGAT	65.7±1.4	56.8±2.5We provide the results of all the models on all datasets in Appendix A.2 for reference.
