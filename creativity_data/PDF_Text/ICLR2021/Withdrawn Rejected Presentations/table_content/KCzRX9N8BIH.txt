Table 1: MSE, Time, and Memory increase (compared to standard normal likelihood) for reconstruc-tion by variational auto-encoders with different parameterizations of the robust loss, œÅ. Predictedlikelihood parameters yield more accurate reconstruction models.
Table 2: Median outlier detection performanceof several methods across 22 benchmark datasetsfrom ODDS.
Table 3: Comparison of calibration methods by ECE for ResNet-50 (RN50) and DenseNet-121(DN121) architectures on test data. Our predicted likelihood parameter methods: Linear Scaling(LS) and Linear Feature Scaling (LFS) outperform other approaches. In all cases our methodsreduce miscalibration with comparable computation time as GS.
Table 4: Comparison of regression calibration methods as evaluated by their calibration error asdefined in (Kuleshov et al., 2018). Predicted likelihood parameters often outperform other methods.
