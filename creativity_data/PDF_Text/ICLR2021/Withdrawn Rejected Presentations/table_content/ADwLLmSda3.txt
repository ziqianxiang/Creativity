Table 1: Relative reconstruction loss, Crel, on a synthetic dataset for Neural NCPD, Standard HNCPD,and HNTF with two different levels of noise. We list the loss of the approximation r(1) = 3. Theresults of HNTF are similar for all orderings of the modes, so we list only one.
Table 2: Relative reconstruction loss, Crel, on the Twitterpolitical dataset for Neural NCPD, Standard NCPD,Standard HNCPD, and HNTF at ranks r = 8, r(0) = 4,and r(1) = 8. For HNTF we display the loss given thethree possible arrangements of the tensor.
