Table 2:	FID score comparison generated with 10000 samples (lower is better)SWAE EPSWAE (bl) EPSWAE (FSC only) EPSWAE (NSW only) ESPWAE (FSC + NSW)178.04	161.55	162.14	161.06	157.86For completeness, in Table 4.3 we present Frechet Inception Distance (FID) (Salimans et al., 2016)scores with 10000 images with Ïƒ = 1 (code from Seitzer (2020)). It is important to note that onecan have good generation, despite learning a poor latent representation (and vice-versa), so scoreslike FID may not be the best way to evaluate the latent structure. However, comparison betweenSWAE and EPSWAE-baseline(bl) indicate that the prior-encoder significantly improves generation.
