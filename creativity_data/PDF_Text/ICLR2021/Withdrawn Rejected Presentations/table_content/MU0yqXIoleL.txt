Table 1: State-of-the-art KGE models with training strategies. e denotes embeddings, e ∈ Cdcorresponds to the complex conjugate of e.. * denotes a 2D convolution operation with ω kernel. fdenotes a non-linear function. The tensor product along the n-th mode is denoted by ×n and thecore tensor is represented by W.私◦, ∙ denotes the Hamilton, the Hadamard and an inner product,respectively. H corresponds to scoring function of ComplEx and V corresponds to convolutionoperation followed by linear classifier. hx, y, zi = Pi xiyizi denotes the tri-linear dot product.
Table 2: Number of entities, predicates, and triples in each split for the benchmark datasets. GTrainand GTest indicate the train and test split of the benchmark datasets.
