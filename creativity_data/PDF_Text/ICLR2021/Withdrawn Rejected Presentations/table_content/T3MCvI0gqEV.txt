We visualize the visual concepts learned from SPLs. InFigure 6, we show some examples of SPL classes along with attention maps of the model trained us-ing SPL. Attention maps are obtained using Grad-CAM (Selvaraju et al., 2017) to show the model’sfocus when making predictions. It is interesting to observe some meaningful “middle ground” con-cepts can be learnt by SPL, such as mixing the eggs and flour, using the abseiling equipment.
Table 5: Results on the SoccerNet dataset. “Baseline” represents the ImageNet pre-training.

Table 7: More complete comparisons on HMDB-51 and UCF-101 benchmarks. For modality, “V”refers to visual only, “A” represents audio and “T” means text description.
Table 8: ResNet50-G architecture used in our experiments. The kernel dimensions are T × S2 whereT is the temporal kernel size and S is the spatial size. The strides are denoted as temporal stride ×spatial stride2. For res3, res4, and res5 blocks the temporal convolution only applies at every othercell. E.g., ti = 3 when i is an odd number and ti = 1 when i is even.
