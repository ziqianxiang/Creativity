Table 1: Table of Inception and FID scores for generationsof CIFAR-10, CelebA-HQ and LSUN bedroom scenes. *denotes our reimplementation of a SNGAN 128x128 modelusing the torch mimicry GAN library. All others numbers aretaken directly from corresponding papers.
Table 2: Effect of each ablation on overall image generation on CIFAR-10. We further report overall stability oftraining. KL Loss has a significant effect on stability of EBM training.
Table 3: Table of out-of-distribution detection scores on unconditional models trained on CIFAR-10 usinglog(pÎ¸ (x)).. Our approach performs the best out of both likelihood and EBM models. *JEM is not directlycomparable as it uses supervised labels.
