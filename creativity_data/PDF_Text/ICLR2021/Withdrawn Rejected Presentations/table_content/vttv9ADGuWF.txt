Table 1: Worst-case certified accuracy (%), clean accuracy(%), and certification time of the proposedmethod, De-randomized smoothing (Levine & Feizi, 2020), and PatchGuard (Xiang et al., 2020)with De-randomized smoothing and Bagnets as base structure. For each method, we list the worstcertified accuracy under affine transformation of the patch. Note that this is different from results inthe original paper where patch transformations are not considered.

Table 5: Certified and clean accuracy (%) with (R) / without replacement (NR) over CIFAR10 andImageNet vs number of crops without patch transformation. Patch size is 2.4% for CIFAR10 and2.0% for ImageNet and crop size is 10x10 for CIFAR10 and 80x80 for ImageNet. We considerimages with pc ≥ 0.95 to be certified.
