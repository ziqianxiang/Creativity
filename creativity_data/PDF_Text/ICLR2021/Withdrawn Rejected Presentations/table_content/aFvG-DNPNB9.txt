Table 1: Dynamically binarized MNIST Performance for VAEs without ResNet layers. 1000 im-portance samples were used for the estimation of the marginal likelihood. For the Ladder VAEperformance, We refer to TableI in S0nderby et al. (2016). The models were trained with a singleimportance sample unless otherwise noted (IW=1).
Table 2: Dynamically binarized MNIST performance for VAEs with sophisticated layers. 1000importance samples were used for the estimation of the marginal likelihood. All performanceslisted here are taken from Maal0e et al. (2019) and DUrkan et al. (2019). All models were trainedwith a single importance sample.
