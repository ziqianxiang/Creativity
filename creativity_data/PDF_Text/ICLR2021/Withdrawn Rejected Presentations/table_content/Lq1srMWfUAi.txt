Table 1: Timesteps to attain a target average reward (over 10 seeds) for RL tasks. For each environmentthe timestep for the best performing blackbox method is displayed in bold. Hyphen (-)is used forthe method that failed to achieve the target average reward in 2 × 107 timesteps for Swimmer-v2and 5 × 107 timesteps for all other environments.
