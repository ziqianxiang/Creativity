Table 4: CIFAR-10 standard and robust accuracy on PreAct ResNet-18 under various types ofattacks.	_______________________________________________________Attacks	PGD-10	PGD-50	C&W	FABRobust Accuracy	40.22%	39.41%	41.05%	38.68%The result shows the model recovered from catastrophic overfitting is indeed robust. Note the robustaccuracy is relatively low as we are not using the final model.
