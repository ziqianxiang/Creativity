Table 1: Illustrating how the consistency weight Î± influences the performance The observations areconsistent to the one about the classification loss shown in Figure 3.
Table 2: Comparison of our approach ConIC with recent state-of-the-art solutions. We highlight thebest and second-best scores among the approaches w/o strong setup in red and blue, respectively.
Table 3: Comparison for linear evaluation on ImageNet. Our approach gets comparable results toMoCov2, A-U, and others that train models using similar setup. See Appendix F for more discus-sions.
