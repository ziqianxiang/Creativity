Table 3: PHEW comparisons for differentweight initialization schemes6.2	Are PHEW networks “winning-tickets” ?The lottery ticket hypothesis (Frankle & Carbin (2018)) posits the existence of sparse subnetworksat initialization that are capable, strictly based on their initial weights, to perform almost as well asthe fully-connected architecture. One approach to compute such “winning tickets” is the IterativeMagnitude Pruning (IMP) method (Frankle & Carbin (2018)), which requires a sequence of trainingand pruning cycles. At the end of the process, the weights of the resulting subnetwork are revertedback to their original initialized values. The key question we ask here is whether PHEW networksare also ”winning tickets”, despite the fact that they are constructed in a data-agnostic manner.
