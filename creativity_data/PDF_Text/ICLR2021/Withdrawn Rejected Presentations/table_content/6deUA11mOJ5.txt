Table 1: Training sample memorization methodsMethod	DescriptionMemorization GAN (mgan)	Memorization GANs are purposely trained to memorize THE TRAINING SET WHILE MAINTAINING THE ARCHITECTURE OF A typical GAN by modifying the update policy of the gener- ator and discriminator. The training process is split into two parts: (1) train discriminator only with real training images (degenerates to classifier of training set member- SHIP), (2) train generator only with fixed discriminator.

Each row is a random sample of 10 images from the same team. Visually, the quality ofthe generated images gets lower as the ranks get higher.
