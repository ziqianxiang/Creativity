Table 1: FID â‘· results of various image-to-image translation methods applied on AFD, translatingdogs to wolves in the imbalanced setting. For BalaGAN we use 40 modalities.
Table 2: FID results (1) applied on AFD and CelebA datasets in the imbalanced setting. |B| denotesthe number of images in the target domain that were used during training.
