Table 1: Failure rate and speed of the conventional method and ours. α is the reduction factor definedin (6). The conventional method is tested with various voltage steps. For example, in a case of 0.1V, 22 boundary conditions (11 for the drain sweep and 11 for the gate sweep) are solved. Whenthe failure rate is too high, the second simulation round should start to solve the failed cases with asmaller voltage step, taking overall simulation time even longer. It implies that a high failure rate isnot tolerable.
