Table 1: Reconstruction results for IoU and exact reconstruction at 20 and 100 search steps usingrandom rollouts with different agents. Lower values are better for conciseness.
Table 2: Reconstruction results for multiple agent and search combinations. IoU and exact recon-struction are shown at 20 and 100 search steps. Lower values are better for conciseness.
Table 3: Reconstruction results using random rollouts and gcn agents trained on human-designeddata (real), a mixture of human-designed and semi-synthetic data (aug), semi-synthetic data (semi-syn), and synthetic data (syn).
