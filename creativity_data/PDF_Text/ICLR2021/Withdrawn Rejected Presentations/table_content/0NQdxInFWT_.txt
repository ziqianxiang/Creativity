Table 1: Averaged results over five runs on the hold-out test set for an acceleration factor of 8.
Table 2: Averaged results over five runs on the hold-out test set for an acceleration factor of 16.
Table 3: Student’s t-test performed over the average results of the 5 runs (n = 5), indicating howreliably A-DPS outperforms DPS given a new random initialization.
Table 4: Student’s t-test performed over the average results on each test image (n = 3000), indicatinghow reliably A-DPS outperforms DPS given a new image.
