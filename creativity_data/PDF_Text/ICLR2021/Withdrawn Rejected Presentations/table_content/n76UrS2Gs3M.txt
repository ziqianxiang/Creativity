Table 1: Cross-domain transfer learning of less biased models with GHC and Stormfront as targetdomains. In-domain FPRD, IPTTS FPRD and NYT Accuracy (Acc.) measures prediction bias. Thepreferred outcomes for each metric are marked with arrows.
Table 2: Cross-domain transfer with DWMWas the target domain.
Table 3: Same-domain transfer with the secondhalf of FDCL as the target domain.
Table 4: Transferring from explanation regular-ized models (GHC, Stf) or adversarially debiasedmodels (FDCL) while keeping the encoder frozen(Freeze), fine-tuning with '2-sp regularizer, orvanilla fine-tuning (Fine-tune).
