Table 1: The upper bound of AEs and U-nets. The channels setting means the architecture ofnetworks. For instance, 4-8-16-32 represents an AE which encoder has three down-sampling layersand the channels in different layers are 4, 8, 16, 32 respectively (see details in Appendix A.3.1). Theinput size in the first four experiments is (24 × 24) while the last two is (16 × 16). The upper boundsare listed in the third and fourth column. The former corresponds to U-nets while the latter to AEs.
Table 2: The upper bound of a simple network for the classification task with or without residualstructure. The channels setting represents where main differences in architectures are (see details inAppendix A.3.2). ”p16” means that there is a pooling layer before the convolutional layer with 16channels. And ”r16” represents that a residual structure is added in the convolutional layer with 16channels. The last three columns in this table is similar to Table 1. In this part, the input size in allthe experiments is (24 × 24).
