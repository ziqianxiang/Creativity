Table 1: Average incremental accuracy (%) of four CIL methods with and without our MANetsas a plug-in architecture, and the related methods. Please note (1) Douillard et al. (2020) didn’treport the results for N=25 on the ImageNet, so we produce the results using their public code;(2) Liu et al. (2020) updated the results on arXiv version (after fixing a bug in their code), differ-ent from its conference version; (3) Highway connection blocks are applied in our MANets; and(4) For CIFAR-100, we use “all”+“scaling” blocks. For ImageNet-Subeset and ImageNet, we use“scaling”+“frozen” blocks. Please refer to Section 4.2 Ablation settings for details.
