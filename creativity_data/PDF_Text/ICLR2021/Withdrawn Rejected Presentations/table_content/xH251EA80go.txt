To achieve better generalization ability, Elsayed et al. (2018) proposed a loss function toimpose a large margin of any chosen layers of a deep network. Barron (2019) proposed a generalloss with a shape parameter to cover several robust losses as special cases. For the problems withnoisy input perturbation, several data argumentation-based algorithms and regularization techniquesare proposed (Zheng et al., 2016; Ratner et al., 2017; Cubuk et al., 2020; Elsayed et al., 2018; Zhanget al., 2019). However, the network architecture remains less explored to address the robustness ofthe input perturbation. Guo et al. (2020) employed NAS methods to search the robust architectures.
