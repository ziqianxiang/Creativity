Table 1: The comparison NeuBoots and Baseline (Hendrycks and Gimpel, 2017), ODIN (Liang et al.,2018), and Mahalanobis (Lee et al., 2018) on OOD detection. NeuBoots-FA means feature-adaptiveNeuBoots. We train ResNet-34 on CIFAR-10, and SVHN is used as OOD. All values are percantagesand the best results are indicated in bold.
