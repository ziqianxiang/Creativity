Table 1: Results for the medical image classification tasks: (a) linear classification; (b) fine-tuningsetting. All results are averaged over 5 independent models. Best results for each setting are inboldface. COVIDx 1% setting is omitted due to the scarcity of labels in COVIDx.
Table 2: Zero-shot image-image and text-image retrieval results on the CheXpert 8×200 datasets.
Table 3: Comparisons of ConVIRT to image-only unsupervised image representation learning ap-proaches.
Table 4: Example textual queries for each of the 8 categories in the text-image retrieval task.
Table 5: Evaluation results with different hyperparameters, for the RSNA 1% data linear evaluation,image-image retrieval and text-image retrieval tasks. bs represents batch size and linear proj. rep-resents using linear projection layers for gv and gu. Our default model uses τ = 0.1, bs = 32 andnon-linear projections.
