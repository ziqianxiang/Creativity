Table 2: Network architectures for training UV models with different datasets. convxd(c1, c2, k, p) is x-dimensional convolutional layer with c1 and c2 input and output channels, respectively, kernel size of k andpadding ofp. The default value ofp is 1. GN(G) is group normalization layer with G groups. Scaling layerscales its input to have norm of âˆšc. c is the code length in case of FedUV and the number of users in Softmaxand FedAwS algorithms.
