Table 1: Performance statistics (mean and standard error) of the graphs generated by ShadowCastand the baseline models, computed over five runs. We indicate the mean values of the generatedstatistics closest to the real graphs. ShadowCast most closely matches original graphs in thestatistics when compared with the baseline models.
Table 2: Statistics of datasets. In the largest connected component (LCC) of each dataset, NLCC isthe number of nodes, ELCC the edges, and K number of total classes. The distribution of the classesis shown in the corresponding histograms.
