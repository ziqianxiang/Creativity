Table 1: HyperparametersE Probab ility VisualisationWe visualise the probabilities of each primitive over the time steps in the MuJoCo HalfCheetah-v2environment. As shown in Fig. 8, we found that the probabilities are changed periodically. We alsovisualise the actions at the selected 5 time steps in one period. As shown in Fig. 9, the primitives aredistinguishable enough to develop distinct specialisations.

Table 4: Comparison of the AUC as a function of K for PMOE-SAC algorithm on HumanoidStandup-v2 environment.
Table 5: We test our approach in the Hopper-v2 environment, each column stands for the averagereturn with different variance of the noise distribution, the average return of each methods is averagedover 100 rounds.
