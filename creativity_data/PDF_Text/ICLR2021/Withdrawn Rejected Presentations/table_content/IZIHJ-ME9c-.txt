Table 1: Edge prediction F1 scores compared with several baseline approaches for the entire set ofedges in the test set (Overall) and the average and standard deviation over each DAG individually forboth directed and undirected edge prediction.
Table 2: Mean DAG-level edge prediction performance under ablation experiments with the changefrom the original model shown in parentheses and the largest performance reduction in bold.
