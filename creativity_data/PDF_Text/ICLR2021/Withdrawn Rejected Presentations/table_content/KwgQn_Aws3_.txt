Table 1: Performance of ProtoryNet in comparison with other benchmark models. The mean accuracyand the standard deviation from a 5-fold cross validation are reported in each case. Boldface denotesthe best performing model, excluding the black box model, DistilBERT, which outperformed theothers in all cases. Note each data set had balanced labels.
Table 2: Comparison between ProSeNet and ProtoryNet on text data of different lengths. In the tableare the means and the standard deviations of accuracy over 5-fold cross validation. The two methodsperform similarly on short reviews (â‰¤ 25 words), while ProtoryNet performs better on long reviewsin all data sets. The second column represents the proportion of short reviews in each data set.
Table 3: Performance comparison between non-sparse S and sparse S as the input to the LSTM layer.
Table 4: Performance comparison between the cosine distance and the Euclidean distance. The meanaccuracy and the standard deviation from 5-fold cross validation are reported for each case. Boldfacewas used to indicate the one with a better performance.
