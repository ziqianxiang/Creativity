Table 1: Conceptual difference and domain shift between miniImagenet and the four cross-domaindatasets CropDisease, EuroSAT, ISIC2018, and ChestX. The domain shift is measured using the FID.
Table 2: Comparative results of few-shot learning methods on four proposed cross-domain few-shotchallenges CropDiseases, EuroSAT, ISIC, and ChestX. The average 5-way few-shot classificationaccuracies (%, top-1) along with 95% confidence intervals are reported on the test split of eachdataset.
Table 3: Comparative results of few-shot learning methods on the two benchmark datasetsminiImagenet and tieredImagenet. The average 5-way few-shot classification accUracies (%, top-1)along with 95% confidence intervals are reported on the test split of each dataset.
Table 4: ROC-AUC performance forfew-shot drug discovery. CHEF iscompared to conventional methods(SVM, RF) for the prediction of toxiceffects. Mean and standard deviationare computed across twelve differenteffects and across 100 differently sam-pled training and test sets.
Table 5: Results of our few-shot learning method CHEF on four proposed cross-domain few-shotchallenges CropDiseases, EuroSAT, ISIC, and ChestX. We compare the ResNet-10 architecturepre-trained on miniImagenet to the ResNet-18 architecture pre-trained on Imagenet. The average5-way few-shot classification accuracies (%, top-1) along with 95% confidence intervals are reportedon the test split of each dataset.
Table 6: Hyper-parameter search space for 1-shot and 5-shot learning on miniImagenet andtieredImagenet using Conv-4 and ResNet-12 backbone models. Best hyper-parameters were evaluatedusing a grid-search and the loss on the vertical validation set of miniImagenet or tieredImagenet.
Table 7: ROC-AUC performances for the twelve individual few-shot tasks (rows) of the Tox21Data Challenge. CHEF is compared to conventional methods (SVM, RF). Averages and standarddeviations are computed across 100 differently sampled training and test sets. The last two columnsshow the results of paired Wilcoxon tests with the null hypotheses given that SVM and RF performbetter, respectively.
