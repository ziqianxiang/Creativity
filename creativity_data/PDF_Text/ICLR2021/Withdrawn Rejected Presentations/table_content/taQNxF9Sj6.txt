Table 3: Results on HotpotQA distractor setting development set, using 30,000 randomly selectedtraining examples. Scores are answer only (no supporting fact prediction).
Table 4: Continuations of PG-19 validation set passages using recurrent model (T = 300, disjoint)which display approximate continuation of topic. Contexts are shortened for space, 300 tokens ofcontext were used for each.
Table 5: Continuations of PG-19 validation set passages using recurrent model (T = 300, disjoint)which display continuation of correct pronouns or references to characters from context. Contextsare left-truncated, 300 tokens of context were given for each continuation.
