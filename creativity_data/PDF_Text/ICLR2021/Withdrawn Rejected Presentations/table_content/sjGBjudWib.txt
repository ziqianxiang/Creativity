Table 2: ComParison of FastGAT With GAT (VelickoVic et al., 2018).
Table 3: Transductive learning: While significantly lower training time (in Fig. 1), FastGAT stillhas comParable and sometimes better accuracy than other models. ComPutationally intensiVe modelsParseGAT runs out of memory on the Reddit dataset.
Table 4: Inductive learning on PPI Dataset The training time per epoch for the full GAT methodis around 45.8s, Whereas FastGAT requires only about 29.8s When E = 0.25 and 20s When E = 0.5.
