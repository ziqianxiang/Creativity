Table 1: Statistics information of three datasets. The MSParS dataset (BPE6k) is preprocessed byBPE 6000 operations. Vocabulary size and average length of source (Src) and target (Tgt) side arecomputed on train set.
Table 2: Sentence-level accuracy using exact matching (EM) and logic matching (LM) on twodatasets Atis and MSParS using BPE 6000 operations. The abbreviation Res. implies that we usedresidual connection in Equation 13.
Table 3: Evaluation results using Logic Matching on all datasets. The reported results on Geoare mean and standard deviation values. The values marked (*) mean that the evaluation metric isdenotation match that different from others using sentence-level accuracy. This table contains twoparts, the upper part shows the results of previous works and bellow part present our results. Models4, 5 refer the Id of model in Table 2.
Table 4: Evaluation using Logic Matching forPhraseTransformer in difference layers on Atisdataset. Column Layers indicates the layers ap-plying n_gramLSTM.
Table 5: Comparison of number param-eters (M=million) and training speed (to-kens per second, K=thousand) on MSParSdataset.
Table 6: Examples that frequent incorrect predictions of Transformer, are improved in PhraseTrans-former on the Atis test set.
