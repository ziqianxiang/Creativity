Table 1: Comparison with state-of-the-art methods on CIFAR datasets with label noise. Numbers indicateaverage test accuracy (%) over last 10 epochs. We report results over 3 independent runs with randomly-generatedlabel noise. Results for previous methods are copied from Arazo et al. (2019); Li et al. (2020a). We re-runDivideMix (without ensemble) using the publicly available code on the same noisy data as ours.
Table 2: Comparison with state-of-the-art methods on datasets with label noise and input noise. Numbersindicate average test accuracy (%) over last 10 epochs. We report results over 3 independent runs with randomly-generated noise. We re-run previous methods using publicly available code with the same noisy data and modelarchitecture as ours.

Table 5: Effect of the proposed components. We show the accuracy of the classifier (knn) on four benchmarkswith different noise. Note that DivideMix (Li et al., 2020a) also performs mixup.
