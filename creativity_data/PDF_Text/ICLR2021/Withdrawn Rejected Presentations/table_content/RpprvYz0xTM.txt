Table 1: Ablation study on image and video benchmarks. MSE: consistency constraint; CE: crossentropy loss; BCE: binary cross entropy loss; NCE-I: NCE for instance discrimination; NCE-C: NCEfor category discrimination. Results on CIFAR-10/CIFAR-100 are averaged over 10 runs.

Table 5: Replacing ranking Statistics in Han et al.(2020) by WTADataset	RS Han et al. (2020)	RS w/ WTACIFAR-10	90.4	90.1CIFAR-100	73.2	67.3B	Parameter analysis for WTAWe obtain the two hyperparamters of WTA, i.e. threshold μ and window size k, by examiningdifferent values on the labelled data. We further split the labelled data into a smaller labelled subsetand an unlabeled subset (i.e. pretending part of the labelled data to be Umabelled), and find μ and kthat give the best results on the unlabelled subset. More specifically, for Kinetics-400, we split 350-class labelled set into a 300-class labelled subset and a 50-class unlabelled subset. For VGG-Sound,we split the 270-class labelled subset into 231-class labelled subset and 39-class unlabelled subsetrespectively. The number of unlabelled classes used here are the same as the unlabelled classes in themain experiments.

We find that the k = 4 andk = 8 perform comparably well, and they are both better than k = 2 and k = 16. Hence, we simplyuse the k = 4 in our experiments.
