Table 1: A comparison of the four post-processing methods on two datasets with four differentoriginal classifiers. Only the proposed algorithm and the algorithm of Hardt et al. (2016) eliminatebias in all cases whereas ROC can fail in kNN (e.g. ADULT dataset) because debiasing kNN canrequire randomization at the thresholds. Bias here is the absolute difference in mean outcomesacross the sensitive attribute (Definition 1).
