Table 1: Model performance of our method compared to the state-of-the-art VAE-GAN (21) andthe eigenface approach (3) is assessed in terms of the feature similarity (column 2) and structuralsimilarity (column 3) between stimuli and reconstructions (mean ± std error). The first columndisplays latent similarity which is only applicable to the HYPER method because the true andpredicted latent vectors are known. Because of resolution differences, all images are resized to 224 ×224 pixels and smoothed with a Gaussian filter (kernel size = 3) for a fair comparison. In addition,statistical significance of the HYPER method is evaluated against randomly generated latent vectorsand their reconstructions.___________________________________________________________Lat. sim. ∣ Feat. sim. ∣ Struct. sim.
