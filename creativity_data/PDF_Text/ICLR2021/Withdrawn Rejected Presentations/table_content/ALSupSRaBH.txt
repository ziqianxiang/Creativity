Table 1: Test clustering accuracies onthe Pacman datasetModels	Test Clustering AccuracyVaDE	50.4% ± 0%NN-DGC	81.6% ± 5.3%AUG-SS	82.3% ± 4.6%	一DGC	93.5% ± 3.9%The generated samples from DGC substantiate the model’s ability to appropriately learn and use theside-information provided by the response values to obtain a sensible clustering strategy. Unlikemost previously discussed methods, DGC can work with continuous response values. This is highlyattractive, as it lends itself to any general regression setting in which one would believe the desiredclustering strategy should be informed by the regression task.
