Table 1: Conditional prevalences of the respective classes in the correlated (left) and uncorrelated(right) datasets. We control for the total number of positive and negative samples to be equal in bothdatasets, so both datasets are balanced with regard to sentiment and with regard to genre. We use thecorrelated dataset for training, but evaluate on the uncorrelated dataset, to ensure that the predictionof the model reflects the aspect of interest, rather than correlations between aspects.
Table 2: Performance on sentiment and genre prediction. We report accuracy on the main task(â†‘ higher is better) as well as leakage to the non-targeted task (] lower is better).
