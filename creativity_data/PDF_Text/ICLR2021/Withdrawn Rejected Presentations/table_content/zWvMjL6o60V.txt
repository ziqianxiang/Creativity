Table 2: Peak averaged accuracy and corresponding number of features required for MRwMR-BURbased algorithms (with β = 0.1) using Random Forest. The algorithm with an extension of CLFindicates that the algorithm uses the classifier based approach to estimate UR.
Table 3: Redundancy Experiment Results on the Gas Sensor DatasetA.2 Scoring Functions of the Five MRwMR Algorithms with/without BURIn this subsection, we follow the same notation as in Section 2. Namely, Xi, Y , S, and S are thefeature, the label, the set of selected features, and the set of unselected features, respectively. JUR(Xi)denotes the unique relevance of feature Xi (i.e., JUR(Xi) = I(Ω; Y) - I(Ω∖(Xi); Y)). The fiverepresentative MRwMR algorithms are: MIM Lewis (1992), JMI Yang & Moody (2000), JMIMBennasar et al. (2015), mRMR Peng et al. (2005) and GSABrown et al. (2012). The scoring functionsfor these algorithms with and without BUR are shown below.

For MRwMR-BUR based algorithms, thealgorithm with an extension of CLF indicates that the algorithm uses the classifier based method toestimate UR. Otherwise, the algorithm estimates UR using the KSG estimator.
