Table 1: Results on UCI HAR4.2.2	Classification performance on UCI HARWe now present classification results on UCI HAR using 3 metrics : accuracy, F1 score Macroaveraged and Mean Average Precision (MAP), similarly to Su & Wu (2019). The first two arecomputed by classifying the test samples using 1-nearest neighbor from training samples. The MAPis computed by querying the training set with a test sequence to retrieve all training samples of thesame class. The value is averaged for all test sequences. This metric shows the ability of the algorithmto bring close every sequence of each class and not just few references to be used as nearest neighbors.
