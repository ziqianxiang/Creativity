Table 1: Experimental results withthe F1 score for the e-commerceKB completion task. The results inthe first block are taken from Zhuet al. (2020).
Table 2: Experimental results with the ROUGE score for the abstractive product summarizationtask. The results in bold are the best performances among the models taking only texts as the input,and * denotes the model taking both product images and texts as the input. The results in the firstand second blocks are taken from Li et al. (2020).

Table 7: Case study for the e-commerce KB complete task. The product attribute and the corre-sponding attribute value is presented as [attribute value]product attribute. The K-PLUG model accu-rately complete the e-commerce KB, while the E-PLUG model sometimes fails. The translationtexts are given below the original examples.
