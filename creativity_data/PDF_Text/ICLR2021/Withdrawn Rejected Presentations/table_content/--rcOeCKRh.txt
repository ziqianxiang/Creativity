Table 1: Object Detection performance (mAP %) on PASCAL VOC 2007 test set. * indicatesusing the structure of OICR in the recognition head. ”MSD-Ens” is the ensemble of AlexNet andVGG16. ”MSD-Ens+FRCN” indicates using an ensemble model to predict pseudo ground truthsand then learn a Fast-RCNN (Girshick (2015)) using VGG-16.
Table 2: The results on COCO. We compare our method with several strong baselines in § 3.1and competitors. Our method significantly outperforms these approaches, showing that our cross-supervised object detector is capable of detecting novel objects in complex multi-object scenes.
