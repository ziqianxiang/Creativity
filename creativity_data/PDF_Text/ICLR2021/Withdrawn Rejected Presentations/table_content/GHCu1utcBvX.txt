Table 1: Evaluation accuracy (%). We see that the proposed method has significant improvementover the standard DNN on three datasets and outperforms human on overlapping digit dataset.
Table 2: Examples of compound word experi-ments. The output labels align with correspondinghidden words. Upper is train, lower is test.
