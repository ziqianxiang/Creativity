Table 1: Datasets.
Table 2: Performance of AUBER and competitors on 4 GLUE tasks. The performance after fine-tuning is measured. AUBER gives the best performance for the same number of pruned heads. Boldfont indicates the best accuracy among competing pruning methods.
Table 3: We compare AUBER with four variants: AUBER-Query, AUBER-Key, AUBER-L2,and AUBER-Reverse on four GLUE datasets. AUBER-Query and AUBER-Key use the queryand key matrices respectively, and AUBER-L2 uses the L2 norm of the value matrix to obtain theinitial state. AUBER-Reverse processes BERT starting from the final layer (e.g. 12th layer forBERT-base). Bold font indicates the best accuracy among competing pruning methods.
