Table 1: OOD Detection results. Calibrated scores do not detect OOD samples well, especiallysamples from SVHN. On the other hand, our detection method using a GMM on the feature spaceis able to reliably detect out-of-distribution samples and performs better than the class-dependentMahalanobis score even on fully-supervised models. PixelCNN assigns higher likelihoods to OODsamples that diverge clearly from the original training set and fails to detect them.
Table 2: OOD Detection results for CIFAR-10 model. Calibrated scores do not detect OOD sampleswell, especially gaussian noise samples. PixelCNN assigns higher likelihoods to OOD samples thatdiverge clearly from the original training set and fails to detect them.
Table 3: Out-distribution detection results for CIFAR-100 models on Gaussian Noise. Calibratedscores is the only method failing at detecting gaussian noise inputs.
Table 4: Validation and test classification accuracy obtained after purification for DenseNet-100,Wide Resnet-28 and TE-Wide Resnet-28. Purification increases the test accuracy by up to 0.6% onthe DenseNet model.
