Table 2: The overall leaderboard. The win percentage is calculated among all 7396 graphs in thedataset. The ARI column shows the mean ARI across the dataset.

Only sixmeasures keep their positions: SCCT, NHeat, logComm, Comm, logDF, and RSP. This means thatthese measures do have zones of leadership, otherwise they would be filtered out. We can plot theentire feature space colored by the leadership zones of the measures (Fig. 5). As the resulting spaceis 3D, we show slices of it by each of the three coordinates.
Table 4: Mean ARI of the LFR recommended strategies for datasets. Top6 stands for the set ofmeasures that have their zones in the LFR parameter space.
