Table 1: Performance on DROP (pruned): Us-ing our paired objective with all different kindsof paired-data leads to improvements in NMN.
Table 2: Faithfulness scores: Using the paired objective significantly improves intermediate outputpredictions. tdenotes the average of find-num & find-date and find-min-num & find-max-num.
Table 3: Measuring compositional-generalization: NMN performs substantially better whentrained with the paired objective and performs even better when gold-programs are used (w/ G.P).
Table 4: Using constructed paired examples for allthree types of questions—min, max, and count—leadsto dramatically better count performance. Without allthree, the model finds shortcuts to satisfy the consistencyconstraint and does not learn correct module execution.
