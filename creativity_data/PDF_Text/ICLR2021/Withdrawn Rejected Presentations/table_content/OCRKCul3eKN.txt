To do so, We have created another set of datasets which is gener-ated by using a fixed R2D2 snapshot with different noise levels when evaluating the trained snapshotin the environment for Seekavoid_arena_01 level. We have used different es in the e-greedyalgorithm to create datasets with different noise levels. The also effects the coverage of the dataset.

Table 3: DeepMind Lab dataset details. For training data, reward is measured as the maximum over trainingof the average reward over runs for the same task. For snapshot data, reward is just an average over all episodesrecorded using the same level of noise.
