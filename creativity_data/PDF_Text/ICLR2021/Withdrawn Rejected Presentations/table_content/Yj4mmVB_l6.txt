Table 1: The best Inception Score (IS) and Frechet Inception Distance (FID). The column denotedby WGAN, WGAN-L1 and WGAN-GP refers to the standard formulation with weight clipping, ourregularized implementation using the 1-norm and the formulation with gradient penalty and spectralnormalization, respectively.
Table 2:	DCGAN architecture used for the CIFAR10 experiments.
Table 3:	ResNet architecture used for the CIFAR10 experiments.
Table 4: Hyperparameters used for the WGAN formulation (with weight clipping).
Table 5: Hyperparameters used for the WGAN-L1 formulation (with soft thresholding).
Table 6: Hyperparameters used for the WGAN-GP formulation (with spectral normalization).
