In Figures 2(b) and2(c), each figure represents a traversal for a dimension in the shared mechanism subspace and eachrow in the same figure represents a traversal of a fixed dimension with different zC . Due to thelimited space, we report more visualization results in the Appendix.

Table 5.3 further shows that although there are methods that perform slightly better thanour method on MNIST (W&R), our method still performs better before the noise becomes too largeand decrease the accuracy by a high percentage. We further show the results under uniform noiseUniform(0, I) in Appendix D.3.
