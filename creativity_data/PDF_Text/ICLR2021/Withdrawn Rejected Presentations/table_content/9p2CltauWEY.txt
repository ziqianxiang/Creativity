Table 1: Test accuracy of compared methods in binary classification tasks. The Pattern task withpretraining achieves the highest accuracy in most tasks and has 4% higher average accuracy than thesecond-best method. High variance is due to the domain shift between the source and target domain.
Table 2: The difference is the predicted max clique size under size generalization domain shift. Thetrain domain graphs were constructed by drawing n ∈ [40, 50] points uniformly in the unit square,and connecting two point if their distance is less than ρtrain = 0.3. The test set domain graphscontain n = 100 nodes, effectively increasing their density by 2. We tested with two differentvalues of Ptrain/ρtest, the ratio between the train and test connectivity radius. A proper scaling thatkeeps the expected degree of each node is P = √2. Here, although proper scaling does not helpsolve the problem completely, it does improve performance.
