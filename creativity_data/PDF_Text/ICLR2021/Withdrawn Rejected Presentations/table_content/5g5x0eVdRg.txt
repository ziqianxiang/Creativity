Table 1: Test set results on all datasets, taken from papers where possible. Results with * are from(Ji et al., 2019). NMI(z, y) is between remapped predicted label assignments and class targets, y.
Table 2: NMI between representations of augmentations for the training dataset, evidencing thatcross-head MI minimisation does indeed aid in avoiding local optima of this objective function.
