Table 1: Baseline distance analysis comparing the average intra-class distance (Dintra, sampled) and the averageinter-class distance (Dinter, sampled), with the average distance from the instance to the baseline input generatedby GANMEX (GAN), MDTS, random selection (RAND), and zero inputs (Zero).
Table 2: Additional metrics for attribution methods using the zero baseline (Zero), MDTS, and GANMEX(GAN).
Table 3: Run Time Analysis comparing the attribution computation time for IG, expected gradient (EG),DeepLIFT (DL) and Occlusion (Occ), as well as the baseline generation time for EG, GANMEX (GAN),and MDTS. The computation was performed on a single Tesla V100 GPU, and the compute time was measurein seconds on calculation over all samples for the dataset, and the baseline generation time is the additionalcompute time on top of the attribution methods. (ยง) We selected the same sampling number for IG and EG, andthe baseline selection time of EG was estimated by the complexity difference of EG and IG.(f) The attributioninference time for CIFAR10 was measured in 10 separate batches due to the memory constraint. โด MDTSsearch was performed on CPU instead of GPU.
