Table 1: Results on the property prediction datasets. Best model is in bold, SeCond best is underlined.
Table 2: The Spearman and Pearson correlationcoefficients on the ESOL dataset for the GNNand ProtoW-L2 model w.r.t. the pairwise dif-ference in embedding vectors and labels.
Table 3: Training times for each model and dataset.
Table 4: Number of parameters per model. Corresponding hyperparameters are in appendix D.1.
Table 5: The parameters for our models (the prototype models all use the same GNN base model),and the values that we used for hyperparameter search. When there is only a single value in the searchlist, it means we did not search over this value, and used the specified value for all models.
