However, Figure 6(b) suggests that close-to-zero or even zero βS alsowork effectively. To further explore this hypothesis, We examined the decomposition tables (similarto Figure 4) of H-VAE-CI for extreme configurations with β = 0 and observed that they were alleffective at decomposing the underlying factors Γ, ∆, and Y (similar to the performance reported inthe green table in Figure 4). Figure 9 shows several of these tables.
