Table 1: Clustering results for the MNISTdataset, over 10 runs with 15K trainingiterations. For InfoGAN, we used thesame network and the same parametersreported in the original paper by Chenet al. (2016). For CascadeVAE, all Joint-VAEs, and cpl-mixVAE models, we used|c| = 10, |s| = 10, and τ = 0.67. Forcpl-mixVAE models, the coupling factoris set to λ = 1.
Table 2: Categorical assignment accuracies (ACC) and disentanglement scores (DS) for the dSprites dataset,over 10 randomly initialized runs with |c| = 3, |s| = 6, τ = 0.67, and λ = 10.
