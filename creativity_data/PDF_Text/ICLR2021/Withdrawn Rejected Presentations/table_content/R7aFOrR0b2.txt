Table 1: Calibration error for various mitigation strategies used in imbalanced datasets. We give thecalibration error for the class with the most/fewest labels (referred to as min/max), and the ratio ofthese two errors. Two types of imbalance are considered, exponential and step. While improving insome cases, classwise imbalance remains even when mitigation strategies are used.
Table 2: Standard deviations corresponding to Table 1. We round to two digits.
Table 3: Hyper-parameters for computer vision.
Table 4: Hyper-parameters used for Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017). The architecture is”transformer-iwslt-de-en” of Fairseq (Ott et al., 2019).
