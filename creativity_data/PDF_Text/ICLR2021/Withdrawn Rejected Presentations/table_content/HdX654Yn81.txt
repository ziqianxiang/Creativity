Table 1: Comparison between the proposed VAE ensemble, the original VAE, and the current state-of-the-art disentangled VAE models. We report the mean and standard deviation of the FactorVAEmetric and and DCI Disentanglement scores over 10 runs trained on the dSprite data.
Table 2: The comparison between individual models in the same ensemble. We report the averageof the standard deviation of the metrics by individual models in the ensemble across 10 runs.
Table 3: Encoder and Decoder architecture, d: dimension of the latent representation; nc: numberof input image channel (For dSprites dataset nc = 1, for CelebA dataset nc = 3).
Table 4: Hyperparameters setting.
