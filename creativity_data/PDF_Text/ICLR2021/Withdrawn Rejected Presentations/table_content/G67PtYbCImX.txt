Because we are interested in rare concepts, we kept the number of initial pos-itive examples small. We evaluated three settings, with 5, 20, and 50 positives, but only includedthe results with the smallest size in this section. The others are shown in Appendix A.1. For eachsetting, negative examples were randomly selected at a ratio of 19 negative examples to every posi-tive example to form the seed set Lr0. The slightly higher number of negatives in the initial seed setimproved average precision on the validation set across all three datasets. The batch size b for eachselection round was the same as the size of the initial seed set. For the seed set of 5 positive and 95negative examples shown below, b was 100, and the labeling budget T was 2,000 examples.
Table 2: Wall clock runtimes for varying selection strategies on ImageNet and OpenImages. The last3 columns break the total time down into 1) the time to apply the selection strategy to the candidatepool, 2) the time to find the k nearest neighbors (k-NN) for the newly labeled examples, and 3)the time to train logistic regression on the currently labeled examples. Despite using a simple LSHindex for similarity search, SEALS substantially improved runtimes across datasets and strategies.
