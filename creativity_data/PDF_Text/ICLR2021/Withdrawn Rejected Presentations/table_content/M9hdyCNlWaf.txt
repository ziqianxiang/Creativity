In Appendix D we present a generative approach to do so by extendingprobabilistic PCA (Tipping & Bishop, 1999) to matrix normals: P(Uc) = Rp(Uc∣U)p(U)dU, wherethe projection’s parameters are {Zr, Dr}, andp(Uc, U) matches the marginals of (5). This means Ucan be viewed as the “noisy projected inducing output” of the GP whose corresponding “inducinginputs” are Zc> (see the red bar in the 1st column of Figure 2). Similarly the column vectors in UrXcan be viewed as the noisy projections of the column vectors in F.
