The benefit of theuncertainty based adaptive margin is that it reduces the bias towards seen classes. To evaluate the ef-fect of uncertainty based adaptive margin on the quality of generated pseudo-labels during training,we compare the accuracy of adaptive margin to baseline approach with zero margin and fixed nega-tive margin adaptation on the CIFAR-100 dataset. We report accuracy of generated pseudo-labels inFigure 4, following the same setting as in Figure 3. This analysis additionally confirms that adaptivemargin increases the accuracy of the estimated pseudo-labels.
