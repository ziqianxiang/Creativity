Table 1: Computation timeResults. We observe in Fig. 2 the re-construction error is monotonically de-creasing. However, the approximateorthogonalization constraint becomesmore challenging to satisfy when in-creasing the DS input matrixâ€™s dimen-sionality. Table 1 shows the the compu-tation time for each parameter.
