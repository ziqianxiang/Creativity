Table 1: Mean GED and HM-IoU scores on LIDC. Top section: approaches using the original data splitsdefined by Kohl et al. (2018), which we also adhere to; middle: approaches using random data splits;bottom: the Lce-regularised baseline and our Lcal-regularised cGAN. The three central columns showthe GED score computed with 16, 50 and 100 samples, respectively. The rightmost column shows theHM-IoU score, computed with 16 samples. The arrows ↑ and ] indicate if higher or lower score is better.
Table 2: Mean GED scores on the modi-fied Cityscapes. Top section: competingmodel; middle: Lcal-regularised cGAN andLce -regularised baseline; bottom: groundtruth calibrated cGAN. The GED scores arecomputed using 16 samples.
Table 3: Mean GED and HM-IoU scores on LIDC for the Lcal-regularised cGAN with 1, 5, 10, 15and 20 samples. The number of samples used to compute the GED score is denoted in the parenthesesin the header of each column. The arrows ↑ and J denote if higher or lower score is better.
Table 4: GED and H-IoU scores on LIDC. The top section shows the Lce-regularised baseline andthe Lcal-regularised cGAN; the bottom section shows baseline and Lcal-regularised cVAE-GANs. AllLcal-regularised models are trained using 20 samples. The three central columns show the GED scorecomputed with 16, 50 and 100 samples, respectively. The last column shows the HM-IoU score,computed with 16 samples. The arrows ↑ and ] indicate whether higher or lower score is better.
