Table 1: Binary AUC optimization results on four benchmark datasets.
Table 3: Multiclass AUC optimization results on STL10 and CIFAR100.
Table 5: Table showing the general LP coefficients for each model. *: length based on problemsetting; *: fij = dij(f(xi,ye®)) - f(Xj,y*)) + f(Xj,ycg)) - f(Xi,yc(χj))); §: oneblockfor each i ∈ [1, ..n]. We do not include NMF in this table, as its formulation as a general LP is moreverbose including vectoriZation of matrices and kronecker product calculations.
