Table 5: List of ResNet34 top-1 test accuracy using various optimizers and applied to various datasets. Note that each cell reports the average accuracy over eachexperimental trial, sub-scripted by the standard deviation over the trials. Values on the left are from trials trained using the initial learning rate as generated byautoHyper. Values on the right are from trials trained using the suggested initial learning rate. Note a ’*’ indicates that early-stop has been activated.
