Table 1: Hyperparameters and perturbation ranges on different datasets.
Table 2: Testing accuracies of NAL (CIFAR-10, ResNet-18) on a variety of r and K. Under each setting, themodel with the highest clean accuracy (`2 attack radius = 0) is chosen for testing. Numbers in bold representthe best performance in defending the attack.
Table 3: Baseline hyperparameter settings. γ and ε is chosen from Table 1.
Table 4: Different methods with different levels of noise on CIFAR-10, ResNet-18, γ = 1.5 and (K, r) =(4, 4). The best performance at the same noise level is in bold.
Table 5: NAL with different σs and (K, r) on CIFAR-10, ResNet-18 when γ = 1.16. The best performanceunder the same noise level is in bold.
