Table 1: Comparison of inference results for the toy physics problem. Mean absolute errors forinferred parameters are shown as percentages relative to respective uniform prior distribution widths.
Table 2: Comparison of inference results and distribution similarity for the MRI physics problem.
Table 3: Hyperparameters tested for traditional GAN, MMD GAN, and hybrid-trained GAN adver-sarial models for both the toy and MRI experiments. Parameters for which multiple values weretested are listed within curly braces; the best model corresponds to the bolded value within the list.
Table 4: Hyperparameters tested for CVAE models for both the toy and MRI experiments. CVAEmodels are trained on (θ, Y) pairs where Y 〜 G(X(θ)) are sampled from pre-trained MMD GANgenerators G. Parameters for which multiple values were tested are listed within curly braces; thebest model corresponds to the bolded value within the list. Both toy and MRI experiments sweptover the same CVAE parameters.
