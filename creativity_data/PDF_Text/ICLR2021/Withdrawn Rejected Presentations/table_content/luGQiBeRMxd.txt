Table 1: Success rate and average queries of un-targeted attack on 1000 samPles of ImageNet. ε = 0.05. Since BayesOPt and Bayes-Attack needs thousands of hours to run all samPles, we only test 20 samPles, which are marked as *, the comPlexity and running time could be referred to C.6.

Table 3: Success rate and average queries of un-targeted attack on defended model. Since BayesOptand Bayes-Attack take thousands of hours to run, we only tested on 10 samples from ImageNet withε = 0.05 and 1000 query limit, which are marked as *.

The query limit is also reducedto 1000 as the time for BayesOpt and Bayes-Attack quickly increases as more samples add into theGaussian distribution. The time comparison between three models is shown in Appendix C.6.

The process of Bayesian optimization helps to accelerate the optimization. As targetedattack is more complicated and requires larger number of queries, CorrAttack has more advantage inthis scenario.
