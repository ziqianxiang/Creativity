Table 2: 5-way accuracy results on FC100.
Table 3: 5-shot, 5-way accuracy results ofdifferent methods on Mini-Imagenet. Archi-tectures searched without CAML are derivedby updating φ and θ by one backpropagation.
Table 4: Comparison of 5-way 5-shot accuracy bythree pruning strategies of CAML. SLC means thelayer confidence. In progressive connection con-solidation, we prune the layers of the supernet indescending order of SLC.
