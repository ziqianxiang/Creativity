Table 1: Results comparing the uncompressed NeRF model,cNeRF and HEVC + LLFF baseline.
Table 2: PSNR values from compressing and reconstructing a set of images from the Fern scene,with two different orderings on the images.
Table 3: PSNR values comparing cNeRF to HEVC + LLFF. The images are rendered in the YUVcolor encoding and the PSNR is computed in the Y channel and average of the UV channels. cNeRFis superior to HEVC + LLFF in PSNR(Y) and PSNR(UV) for all scenes except PSNR(UV) for Micand Ship. Note that the bitrates are the same as for Tab. 1.
Table 4: MS-SSIM and LPIPS values comparing cNeRF to HEVC + LLFF. MS-SSIM is given inboth the Y channel (from the YUV color encoding) and RGB. LPIPS is given for RGB, as it is onlydefined for such. In all cases, cNeRF is superior to HEVC + LLFF in MS-SSIM and LPIPS. Notethat the bitrates are the same as for Tab. 113Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2021Entropy weight λ	Rate (KB)	Overhead (KB)1 × 10-2	119	231 × 10-3	293	271 × 10-4	673	341 × 10-5	1061	42Table 5: Breakdown of the cNeRF size across four entropy weights trained on the Lego scene.
