Table 1: Comparison of the problem setting we consider to other common settings.
Table 2: Comparison of faithfulness weighted variance of the samples generated by our method(HyperRIM) and the baselines. Higher value shows more variation in the generated samples thatare faithful to the observed output. Ïƒ is the bandwidth parameter for the Gaussian kernel used tocompute the faithfulness weights.
