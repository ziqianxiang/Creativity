Table 1: Statistics of Question Answeringdatasets. #train: number of questions in the train-ing set. #test: number of questions in the test set.
Table 2: Results on Quasar-T, SearchQA test sets and NQ dev set. #C: number of clusters.
Table 3: Results on Natural Questions (NQ) leaderboard (test set). We show two published resultshere from over 40 submissions. And our model achieves No.1 for long answer and No.4 for shortanswer.
Table 6: An example from Natural Question dataset. The rows in the middle section show thecorresponding words of the clustered hidden states, and the bottom row shows the positions of theclustered hidden states. “<s>” refers to start token of long answer candidate.
