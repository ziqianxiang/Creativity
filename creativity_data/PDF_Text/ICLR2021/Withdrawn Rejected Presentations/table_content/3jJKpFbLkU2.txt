Table 1: Comparative results for ACNML on MNIST using aposterior obtained via Bayes by Backprop.
Table 3: In-distribution comparative results We see that for in-distribution performance, ACNMLvariants perform comparably to other methods, without large separations between most methods. Resultsfor SWA-Temp and SGD are taken from Maddox et al. (2019).
