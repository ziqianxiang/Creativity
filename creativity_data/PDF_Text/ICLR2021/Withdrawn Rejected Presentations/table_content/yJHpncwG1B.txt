Table 1: Our convergence results for FedAvg and accelerated FedAvg in this paper. Throughout the paper, N isthe total number of local devices, and K ≤ N is the maximal number of devices that are accessible to the centralserver. T is the total number of stochastic updates performed by each local device, E is the local steps betweentwo consecutive server communications (and hence T/E is the number of communications). t In the linearregression setting, we have K = κι for FedAvg and K = Kfκιfo for momentum accelerated FedAvg (FedMaSS),where κι and 7κιK are condition numbers defined in Section G. Since κι ≥ K, this implies a speedup factor of∖J~^o for accelerated FedAvg.
Table 2: A high-level summary of the convergence results in this paper compared to prior state-of-the-art FL algorithms. This table only highlights the dependence on T (number of iterations), E(the maximal number of local steps), N (the total number of devices), and K ≤ N the number ofparticipated devices. κ is the condition number of the system and β ∈ (0, 1). We denote Nesterovaccelerated FedAvg as N-FedAvg in this table.
