To minimise the computational cost, we started bysetting λ and N while maintaining β = 1. We employed a coarse grid of λ ∈ {0., 0.05, 0.1} andN ∈ {2, 3, 5}. Figure 8 summarises the results in terms of the mean Human Normalised Scores(HNS) across the set. We see that the performance depends on the type of games being evaluated.
