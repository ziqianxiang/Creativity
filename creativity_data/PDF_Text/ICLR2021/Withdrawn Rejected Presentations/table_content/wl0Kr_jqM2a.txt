Table 1: Clean Accuracy, UAR, and mUAR scores for models adv trained against L∞ and L2 attacks.
Table 2: Clean Accuracy, UAR, and mUAR scores for models jointly trained against (L∞, L2). Jointtraining does not provide much additional robustness.
Table 3: Non-adversarial defenses can noticeably improve ImageNet-UA performance. ResNeXt-101 (32×8d) + WSL is trained on approximately 1 billion images Mahajan et al. (2018). StylizedImageNet is trained on a modification of ImageNet using style transfer Geirhos et al. (2019). PatchGaussian augments using Gaussian distortions on small portions of the image Lopes et al. (2019).
