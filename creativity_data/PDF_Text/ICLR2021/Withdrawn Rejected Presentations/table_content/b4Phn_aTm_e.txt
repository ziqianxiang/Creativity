Table 6: Quantitative results of monocular depth estimation using the improved ground truth depthmaps made available at (Uhrig et al., 2017) for the KITTI dataset. Numbers in bold and underlinedrepresent 1st and 2nd ranking, respectively. The methods used in evaluation are EPC++ (Luo et al.,2020), Monodepth2 (Godard et al., 2019), Uncertainty (Poggi et al., 2020), Packnet-SfM (Guiziliniet al., 2020a), UnRectDepthNet (Kumar et al., 2020), and Choi et al. (Choi et al., 2020).
