Table 1: Average & worst-class clean error, boundary error and robust error for various algorithms.
Table 2: Average & worst-class clean, boundary and robust error for various algorithms in GTSRB.
Table 3: Adversarial training algorithms on CIFAR10 dataset (ResNet18 (above) andReNet34(below)). We report the average clean accuracy and adversarial accuracy (under PGD attackby 8/255), as well as the worst / best clean accuracy and adv. accuracy among all classes.
Table 4: Adversarial training algorithms on GTSRB dataset (on a 3-layer CNN model). We reportthe average clean accuracy and adversarial accuracy (under PGD attack by 12/255), as well as theworst / best clean accuracy and adv. accuracy among all classes.
