Table 1: Results from MNIST experiments.
Table 2: Results from CIFAR experiments. FF refers to the feed-forward convolutional network.
Table 3: A list of common activation functions σ(x) and associated convex proper f (z) whoseproximal operator is σ(x). For z ∈/ dom f, we have f(z) = ∞. In the case of Softplus activation,Lis (z) is the polylogarithm function.
