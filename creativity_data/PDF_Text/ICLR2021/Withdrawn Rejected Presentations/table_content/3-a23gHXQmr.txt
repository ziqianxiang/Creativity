Table 1: Results on energy selected track image datasets, comparing our method with the current state of theart and including an ablation study. Lower FoM is better. PL1 and PL2 are power law datasets with rangespanning 2.0 — 8.0keV (PL1 dN/dE (X E-1, and PL2 dN/dE (X E-2). All test datasets have 360 thousandtracks each to enable comparison with KitaguChi et al. (2019). All methods have RMSEφ ≤ 0.5°. Confidenceintervals (CI 68%) are calculated using the non-parametric bootstrap - note these are not the standard errors onFoM values, standard errors are CI/√200, except in the case of Kitaguchi et al. (2019). For FoMs only theupper CI bound is necessary, since this represents the worst case signal to noise ratio. IW stands for importanceweighted. All of our method results use the Gaussian loss, (5), except for the final column which uses the vonMises loss. All ensembles have M = 10 NN members.
