Table 1: Comparison of our ensembles with state-of-the-art models that were proposed in [Biettiet al., 2019] and [Arora et al., 2020], and evaluated on sub-sampled versions of CIFAR-10.
Table 2: Comparison between deep networks, wide networks and ensembles of less complex models.
Table 3: Computational complexity of single networks in terms of MFLOPs.
Table 4: Comparison between deep, wide and ensembles of ResNets on CIFAR-10 using moreaggressive data augmentation (see Appendix B). Means and standard deviations are obtained fromfive independent runs.
Table 5: This table provides a different view of Figure 3 reporting the exact means and standarddeviations obtained on 5 independent runs. The comparison is made at different computationallevels between deep, wide and ensembles using the chosen ResNet architectures on CIFAR-10 andCIFAR-100 datasets.
