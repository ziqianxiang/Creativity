Table 1: Data utility (accuracy). Vanilla is equivalent to (λ = 0, β = 0). Two MixCon “default” settings bothuse λ = 0.1 but vary in β = 0.01 and β = 0. “Deeper”/“Wider” indicate increasing the depth / width of layersin the network on server side g(x).
Table 2: Inversion results on synthetic dataset re-ported in mean(worst) format for the 200 testing sam-ples. Higher MSE or lower MCS indicates a worse in-version. (λ, β) denoted in header.
Table 3: Quantitative evaluations for image recovery results. For fair evaluation, we match the data utility(accuracy) for Vanilla and MixCon.Structural similarity index metric (SSIM) and perceptual similarity (PSIM)are measured on 100 testing samples. Those scores are presented in mean ± std and worst-case (in parentheses)format. Lower scores indicate harder to invert.
Table 4: Quantitative evaluations for image recovery results. For fair evaluation, we match the data utility(accuracy) for Vanilla and MixCon. SSIM and PSIM are measured on 100 testing samples. Those scoresare presented in mean ± std and worst-case (in parentheses) format. The smaller scores indicate harder datarecovery.
