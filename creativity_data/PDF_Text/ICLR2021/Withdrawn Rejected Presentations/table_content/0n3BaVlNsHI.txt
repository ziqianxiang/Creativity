Table 1: Test error rates (J) comparison on clean test sets (CIFARI 0 and CIFARI0 0) and corruptedsets (CIFAR10-C and CIFAR10 0-C). AugMix w/o GT is a variant of AugMix without usingGTs. DJMix+RA is a variant of DJMix with random data augmentation.
Table 2: Test error rates (J) on ImageNet and Corruption Error (J) on ImageNet-C usingResNet-50. DJMix works on ImageNet and improves the robustness.
Table 3: DJMix improves the performance of semantic segmentation when input images are cor-rupted. We present mIoU (↑) on PASCAL-VOC (Clean) and Segmentation-C (the rest).
Table 4: DJMix improves the performance of detection when input images are corrupted. Wepresent mAP (↑) on PASCAL-VOC (Clean) and Detection-C (the rest). * indicates that augmen-tation without geometric transformations is used.
Table 5: Test error rates (average / standard deviation, J) on CIFAR10 and CIFAR10-C withvarious ablation settings.
