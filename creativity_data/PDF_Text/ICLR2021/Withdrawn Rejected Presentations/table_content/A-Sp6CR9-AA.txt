Table 1: The best Inception Scores (“IS”，↑) and FIDs (J)achieved by conditional SNGAN, BigGAN, and AutoGAN-top1,using CCBN and SaBN on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet (dogs & cats).
Table 2: The searched results top-1 accuracy of the four meth-ods on NAS-Bench-201. Our proposed approach achieves thehighest accuracy, with the lowest standard deviation.
Table 3: Performance (SA) of different BN settings on clean branch.
Table 4: Performance (SA&RA) of different BN settings. During evaluation, only the adversarial path isactivated in AuxBN and SaAuxBN.
Table 5: Comparison of four variants of GDAs on NAs-Bench-201. our GDAs-saBN achieves the highest top-1 ac-curacy.
