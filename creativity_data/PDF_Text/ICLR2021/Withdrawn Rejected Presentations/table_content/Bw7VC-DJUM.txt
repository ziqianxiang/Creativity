Table 1: Ablation study on UCF101 by fine tuning a pre-trained CPD model from Kinetics-210k.
Table 2: Evaluation on weakly-supervised representation learning without fine-tuning. Top-1classification accuracy is reported on Kinetics-400 validation set.
Table 3: Evaluation on representation transfer by fine-tuning. We compare our CPD model withother methods trained on different type of supervision.
Table 4: Results of classification with small amount of labeled data on Kinetics-400 validation set(showing top-1 accuracy). We utilize 3D ResNet34 as backbone and pre-train it on Kinetics-210kand Instagram-210k.
Table 5: Top-1 accuracy of zero-shot classification on UCF-101 and Kinetics-400. We outperformother methods without any extra labeled data and training procedure after pre-training on Kinetics-210k.
Table 6: Analyze text information of Kinetics-210k datasets. At Least One: The proportion of textinformation that contains at least one word in action classes of Kinetics-400. All: The proportion oftext information that contains the entire action class. Rel: The proportion of word in text informationthat is relevant to action classes.
