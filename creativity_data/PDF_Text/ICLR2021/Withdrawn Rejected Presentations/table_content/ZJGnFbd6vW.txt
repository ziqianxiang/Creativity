Table 1: Validation AUC as a function of thecoreset strategy. We use an SVM for the Chap-man and PTB-XL datasets, and a Random Forestfor the PhysioNet2020 dataset given its multi-label classification formulation. In all experi-ments, the coreset size is equal to the number ofPCPs. Results are an average across five seeds.
Table 2: Validation AUC after training an SVMon a different fraction of available PCPs (E =32). By training on 100% of PCPs (N = 6387),we achieve similar performance to when trainingon the full training set (N = 76644), illustrat-ing the dataset distillation capabilities of PCPs.
