Table 1: CIFAR-10 validation accuracies of DCN models, averaged over 3 runs, compared to base-line models. ODE-Net and ResNet-blocks baselines are as introduced in Chen et al. (2018). DCNsperform on par with spatially and/or temporally discrete baselines, despite having a lower numberof trainable parameters.
Table 2: (a) Validation accuracies on a subset of CIFAR-10 (small-data regime) for the DCN-ODEmodel versus baselines when the training data is limited. The DCN model outperforms spatially and/or temporally discrete baselines as parameter efficiency leads to data efficiency. (b) DCNs achievelower MSE loss in the reconstruction task than baselines on the CIFAR-10 validation set, despiteusing a smaller number of parameters. All results are averaged over 3 runs.

Table 5: CIFAR-10 validation accuracy (averaged over 3 runs) in the control experiments testing theeffect of DCN model design choices on the baseline ODE-Net.
