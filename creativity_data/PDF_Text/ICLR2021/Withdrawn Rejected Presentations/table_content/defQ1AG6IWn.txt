Table 3: Experiment results on Office-31 classification using ResNet-50performance substantially on difficult transfer tasks such as A→ W, D→ A and W→ A. Notably,comparing to state-of-the-art self-training (Zou et al. (2019)) and entropy minimization methods (Xuet al. (2019)) based on class-wise pseudo supervision, NC-SP outperforms them by 4.6% and 3.9%respectively, and it demonstrates that following the relatively clean neighborhood pseudo supervi-sion can alleviate the error accumulation problem from self-training.
