Table 3: Densities for each mode for generator with 3-layer fully connected networks. Samples areclassified as belonging to the closest real data mode ifit is within 3 standard deviations of any mode,otherwise as belonging to no mode.
Table 4: FFHQ FID values using StyleGAN, comparing results from retraining the original imple-mentation on 4 GPUs at full and lowered resolution, with results obtained by replacing NS loss withMM-nsat without any additional tuning. Cross-reference with figure 25 showing samples.
