Table 1: Experiment results of CIFAR-10, SVHN, and Aircraft as a target dataset on VGGNet. Training Timeconsists of time to search for pruned network, and finetuning. Expense is computed by multiplying the trainingtime by 146 ¢, which is cost of using GPU (Tesla P100) on Google Cloud. The methods are sub-divided into thefull network without pruning, unstructured pruning methods, structured pruning methods and STAMP. P denotesthe ratio of non-zero parameters. We report the mean ± std values over three runs of experiments.
Table 2: Experiment results of CIFAR-10 on ResNet18. Other details are same with the Table 1. More resultsare in the Table 3 of the Appendix.
Table 3: Experiment results of SVHN on ResNet-18. Training Time consists of time to search for the prunednetwork and finetuning (20 epochs). Expense is computed by multiplying the training time by 1.46 ¢, whichis the cost of using GPU (Tesla P100) on Google Cloud. The methods are sub-divided into the full networkwithout pruning, unstructured pruning methods, structured pruning methods, and STAMP (STAMP-Structure isa variation of STAMP, which re-initializes the pruned architecture). P is the remaining parameter ratio. We runeach experiment 3 times and report the mean ± std values.
