Table 1: Statistics of voice-face cross-modal datasets.Vox-VGG-n represents the combined datasetof the VoxCeleb (Nagrani et al., 2017; Chung et al., 2018) and VGGFace (Cao et al., 2018; Parkhiet al., 2015) and n denotes the version. The number of images refers to the number of all imagesremaining after MTCNN (Zhang et al., 2016) face detection.
Table 2: Comparison of the proposed method with other models on the 1:2 matching task andretrieval task.“ACC” is accuracy.
Table 3: Performance of 1:2 joint matching and joint retrieval using mean face and mean voiceembeddings. Here, mf and mv denote the number of face images and audio segments, respectively,used to calculate the averages. The values of mv and mf are 1 by default.
Table 4: Effect of training set scale. “TriNet” used the default configuration. “TriNet-train1000”was trained on 1,000 and tested on 189 identities.__________________________________Method	#Train Identities #Test Identities #Test Triplets			ACC(%)	mAP(%)TriNet	5994	1251	30M	84.48 ± 0.01%	11.48%TriNet-train1000	1000	189	3M	83.55 ± 0.55%	9.61%5.4	Test Confidence of Datasets with Different ScalesFigure 4b shows the fluctuations in the estimated accuracies of TriNet on the 1:2 matching taskwhen 30 repeated random tests were conducted. The numbers of sampled identities for each curveare 100, 189, 500, and 1,000. For a determined dataset scale (such as 100 identities), instead oftesting the model on a single dataset with 100 identities, 30 randomly sampled sets of data with100 identities were used for testing. As shown in the figure, when a small-scale dataset is used, theaccuracy of different runs fluctuates substantially. For large datasets, fluctuations in test accuraciesalso exist; however, in general, the test results are more generalized; therefore, large datasets arestrongly recommended for evaluation.
Table 5: Ablation study of TriNet. 1:2(%) and 1:3(%) denote accuracy for 1:2 and 1:3 matchingtasks, and Male(%) and Female(%)denote accuracy on all male triplets and female triplets, respec-tively. __________________________________________________________________Settings	1:2(%)	1:3(%)	Male(%)	Female(%)	mAP(%)TriNet (Default)	84.48	73.50	69.85	71.04	11.48Detect Scale	Audio Crop					Without Scale	Whole	83.04	71.13	66.99	69.69	8.221.1 Scale	Whole	84.27	73.28	70.03	71.65	10.421.0 Scale	Crop 2.5 s	83.11	70.49	61.41	69.45	9.09Face Backbone					VGG-M	81.30	68.95	64.90	64.84	8.06Face Backbone of DIMNet	83.88	72.06	62.93	68.98	10.05SE-ResNet50	84.0	72.62	69.22	69.49	9.40Face Frozen	Voice Frozen					N	N	84.43	73.56	68.27	68.85	9.77YN	81.68	68.52	64.87	66.76	8.33Metric Space	Metric Scale					Euclidean	128	82.19	69.29	69.38	64.97	8.44L2	1	81.71	69.09	62.62	67.49	7.58L2	512	84.27	72.48	69.43	71.77	10.02
