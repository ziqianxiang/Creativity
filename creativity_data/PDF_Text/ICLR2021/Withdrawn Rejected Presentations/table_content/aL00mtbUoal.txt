Table 2: Robustness to the representation extraction approach on CIFAR-10: Here we show theresults of using a simple representation extraction for each approach. This task is to use only the lastfeature map from the encoder for contrastive learning. The success of AMDIM depends heavily onthe particular task, whereas YADIM does not.
