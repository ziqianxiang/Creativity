Table 1: AUCCESS and success percentageof our Dec [Joint] agents using τ0 = 0(no roll-out, frame-level model) and τ0 = 10(full roll-out) compared to current state-of-the-art agents (Bakhtin et al., 2019) on the PHYREbenchmark. In contrast to prior experiments, allagents here are conditioned on τ = 1 initial frame.
