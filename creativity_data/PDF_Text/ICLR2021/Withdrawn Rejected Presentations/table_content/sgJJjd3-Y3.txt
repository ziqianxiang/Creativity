Table 1: Comparisons of RMSE of different regression models. Unbiased data: Trained with fully labeledunbiased dataset, Skewed data: Trained with skewed dataset, Only AAE based regularization: Trainedwith skewed dataset and AAE based regularization, Only forcing output distribution: Trained with skeweddataset and forcing output distribution, Proposed approach (20 samples): Proposed approach is applied withthe estimated true distribution from random 20 samples, Proposed approach (Full data): Proposed approachwas applied with the estimated true distribution from full data.
