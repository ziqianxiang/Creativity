Table 1: Wall-clock time (averaged over multiple runs) saved for IWSLT for different model typesand encoder depths. Max BLEU is for validation. Number of layers is for encoder, decoder depth iskept fixed at 2. Ratio is computed compared to comparable number of layers in the normal case.
Table 2: Wall-clock time (averaged over multiple runs) saved for IWSLT for different model typesand encoder depths. Max BLEU is for validation. Number of layers is for encoder, decoder depth iskept fixed at 6. Ratio is computed compared to comparable number of layers in the normal case.
Table 3: Wall-clock time (averaged over multiple runs) saved for WMT for different model typesand encoder depths. Max BLEU is for validation. Number of layers is for encoder, decoder depth iskept fixed at 1. Ratio is computed compared to comparable number of layers in the normal case.
Table 4: Wall-clock time (averaged over multiple runs) saved for IWSLT/WMT for different modeltypes and encoder depths. 95% Max BLEU is for validation.
Table 5: Wall-clock time (averaged over multiple runs) saved for IWSLT/WMT for different modeltypes and encoder depths. 99% Max BLEU is for validation.
