Table 1: Summary of CCE, LS, CP and LC.
Table 2: Instantiating ProSelfLC under different cases. For all terms, we use concrete values forconcise interpretation. We bold the special case when the semantic class is changed.
Table 3: Test accuracy (%) in the standard setting. We report three settings of hyperparameters.
Table 4: Accuracy (%) on the CIFAR-100 clean test set. All compared methods use ResNet-44.
Table 5: The results of different hyperparameters on CIFAR-100 using ResNet-44. Under differentnoise rates, the best instantiation of each approach is bolded except for CCE.
Table 6: Test accuracy (%) on the real-world noisy dataset Clothing 1M.
