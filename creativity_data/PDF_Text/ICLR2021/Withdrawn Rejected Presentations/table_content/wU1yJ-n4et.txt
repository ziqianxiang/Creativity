Table 1: Classification accuracy of the DomainNet dataset (%) for one-shot and three-shot on 4domains (R: Real, C: Clipart, P: Painting, S: Sketch). f denotes that We reproduced the baseline.
Table 2: Classification accuracy of the Office-Home dataset (%) for one-shot on 4 domains (R: Real,C: Clipart, P: Product, A: Art).
Table 3: Classification accuracy of the DomainNet dataset (%) in the UDA setting.
Table 4: Comprehensive ablation study of PSD on DomainNet dataset (%) for one-shot setting.
Table 5: Hyper-parameter search on DomainNet using ResNet34. We choose Real to Clipart three-shot and Real to Sketch one-shot scenarios. We measure the test accuracy at the maximum validationaccuracy.
