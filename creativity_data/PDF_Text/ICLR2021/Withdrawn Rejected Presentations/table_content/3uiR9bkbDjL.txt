Then we create positive edge samples of theset of cold nodes by parsing all links in and out of the cold nodes and every other non-links becomenegative samples. Whole positive and negative edge samples are used as test sets for the cold startlink prediction task and are hidden in the training stage along with the class labels of cold nodes.
Table 2: Results of link prediction on cold nodes in area under the ROC curve (AUC) scores. Boldscore indicated the best AUC score. In every methods, adding our learning strategy generally in-creased performance.

Table 4: Average number of generated edges for each cold node by two different training strate-gies. Edges per node represents ground truth number of edges per each node. By using additionallink prediction loss, ColdExpand-Unfreeze decreased at most 26.5% of new edges compared toColdExpand-CLS which is closer to the ground truth amount.
