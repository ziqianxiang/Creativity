Table 1: Performance of Meta-Semi and state-of-the-art SSL algorithms with the CNN-13 network. We reportthe average test errors and the standard deviations of5 trials. In each setting, the best two results are bold-faced.
Table 2: Performance of Meta-Semi with the WRN-28 network. Average test errors and standard deviations of5 trials are reported. “#HPs” refers to the number of tunable hyper-parameters. The best results are bold-faced.
Table 3: Test errors on STL-10. We adopt thesame experimental setups as (Berthelot et al.,2019). The best result is bold-faced.
Table 4: Test errors on SVHN with varying amount of labeleddata. We report the average results and the standard deviationsof 5 independent experiments. All results are based on CNN-13.
Table 5: Performance of Meta-Semi v.s. baselines with fixed amount of training time. We report themean test errors of both networks on CIFAR-100 with 10,000 labels. The best results are bold-faced.
Table 6: Ablation study results. We report the testerrors on CIFAR-100 With 4,000 and 10,000 labels.
