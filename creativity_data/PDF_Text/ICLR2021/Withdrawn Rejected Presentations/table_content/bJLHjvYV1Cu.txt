Table 1: Test-set accuracy of loss functions discovered by TaylorGLO compared with that of thecross-entropy loss. The TaylorGLO results are based on the loss function with the highest validationaccuracy during evolution. All averages are from ten separately trained models and p-values are fromone-tailed Welchâ€™s t-Tests. Standard deviations are shown in parentheses. TaylorGLO discovers lossfunctions that perform significantly better than the cross-entropy loss in almost all cases, includingthose that include Cutout, suggesting that it provides a different form of regularization.
Table 2: Performance of Taylor approximations of the cross-entropy loss function on AllCNN-Cwith CIFAR-10. Approximations of different orders, with a = h0.5, 0.5i, are presented. Presentedaccuracies are the mean from ten runs. The baseline is the standard cross-entropy loss. Higher-orderapproximations are better, suggesting a potential (although computationally expensive) opportunityfor improvement in the future.
Table 3: Estimated TaylorGLO experiment durations and total emissions. The estimates assumepopulations of 20 concurrent candidates and 50 generation runs. Emission values are upper boundsreported in equivalent kilograms of carbon dioxide, thus accounting for other gases of interest.
