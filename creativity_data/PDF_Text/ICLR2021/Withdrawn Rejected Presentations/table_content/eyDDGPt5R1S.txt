Table 1: Quantitative comparison of the sample quality be-tween traditional LD and our ALD. The mean squared errorFigure 2:	Groud truth posteriors (left) (MSE) between the true mean and the sample average, theand their samples by ALD (right) in bi- effective sample size (ESS), and the Monte Carlo standardvaiate Gaussian examples.	error (MSCE) are provided as evaluation metrics.
Table 2: Quantitative results of the image generation for BMNIST, MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR-10, andCelebA. We report the reconstruction error (RE) for test sets and the Frechet Inception Distance(FID) as evaluation metrics. The RE is calculated as the binary cross entropy for BMNIST and themean squared error for the others between the original image and the reconstructed image. Our LAEand CLAE are compared with three baseline methods, VAE, ABP and DLGM.
Table 3: Evaluation of the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) on anomaly detection taskfor MNIST. Our LAEs and CLAEs are compared with autoencoders (AEs) and VAEs. The top rowshows which digit class is dealt as normal examples.
