Table 1: Classification accuracy on bioinformatics datasets4.2 Node classificationDatasets: For node classification we conduct our experiments on three real-world datasets, Cora,citeseer and Pubmed. They are three citations networks where nodes are articles that are linkedtogether by an edge if there exists a citation between them. All datasets contain attributes on nodesthat are extracted from the title and the abstract. Attributes represent sparse bag-of-word vectors.
Table 2: Statistics on node classification datasets. The classification is made with 20 nodes per classin the training set.
