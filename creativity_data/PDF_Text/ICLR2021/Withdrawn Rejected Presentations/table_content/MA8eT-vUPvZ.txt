Table 1: Worst case (WC) and average (Avg) top 1 accuracy on rotated MNIST, FEMNIST, CIFAR-10-C, andTiny ImageNet-C across all methods, where means and standard errors are reported across three separate runs ofeach method. ARM methods consistently achieve greater robustness, measured by WC, and Avg performancecompared to prior methods. * The UW baseline is equivalent to ERM for CIFAR-IO-C and Tiny ImageNet-C.
Table 2: Using learned groups,ARM-CML outperforms ERMand matches the performanceof TTT on rotated MNIST. Thisresult may be improved by tech-niques for learning more di-verse groups for meta-training.
