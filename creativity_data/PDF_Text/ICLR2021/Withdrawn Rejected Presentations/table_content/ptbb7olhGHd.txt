Table 1: Different forecasting models on a 90 day rolling window testing set. The target has a binary distri-bution of 54.95%, Sharpe ratio of 9.04% and passive gain of $ 245.3. DeepAR-G is the best performing modelacross every metric except our portfolio methods. CRPS values are not available for multivariate models asthey were aggregated for all time series.
Table 2: Performance of crafting algorithm on different distributions and directions d. Every type of perturba-tion resulted into larger error over all error metrics. Note that some experiments resulted in similar performanceSuCh as V J and Student-t σ ↑, likely due to the same perturbations.
