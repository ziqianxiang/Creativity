Table 1: Model classification accuracy and standard deviation over 20 random seeds, on Mul-tiMNIST development and test sets, for single task and standard multitask baselines, DiscriminativeImportance Weighting, and αVIL. Results in bold indicate best overall approach.
Table 2: Average classification accuracy on the 5 tested NLU development datasets over 4 randomseeds per task (left column per task), as well as GLUE / SuperGLUE test accuracy for ensembles(right column), for single task and standard multitask baselines, Discriminative Importance Weight-ing, and αVIL. Results in bold indicate best overall training approach. For space constraints, weshow only average development accuracy and final enemble test scores.
