Table 1: Zero-shot transfer results on hierarchical navigation4.3	Perturbation of Abstract 2-D MapsTo further study the importance of the abstract map input, during evaluation on 13 Ã— 13 maps, weperturb the task context input c = (m, g) and provide an disrupted version to agents. We examineseveral perturbation strategies: zero, flip, shuffle, and original accurate map input. (1) In zero mode,we give a tensor of zeros as abstract map and start/goal inputs to agents. In this case, the model maymalfunction and rely on its policy and value prediction function to provide rough estimations. (2)In shuffle mode, we sample another map and start/goal pair within the set of evaluation maps. Thus,the entire structure should be entirely different and may largely affect the decision. (3) In flip mode,we randomly change the value of a cell with probability p = 80% (from wall to navigable space orvice versa). Note that flipping only changes the map m but not the goal g, thus the agent can stillcapture a rough direction in local navigation. We evaluate on distances between 1 and 8.
