Table 1: Results on synthetic pseudocode-to-code task. Proportion of generatedcode (%) resulting in a compilation error,execution-time error, or correct code.
Table 2: Results on SPOC pseudocode-to-code testsets, showing proportion of outcomes of generated code(%). Direct-scaled has the same number of total layersas the composed model, but roughly double the numberof trainable parameters.
Table 3: Results of scaled-up baselines and baselines with a denoiser on synthetic pseudocode-to-code task.
