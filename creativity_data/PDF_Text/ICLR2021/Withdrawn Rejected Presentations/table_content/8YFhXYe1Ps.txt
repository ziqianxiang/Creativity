Table 1: Model Performances on the different datasets. Negative Log Likelihood in bits/pixels.
Table 2: Bias in the Black Mice dataset. The post-surgical/-anesthetic effects label is unevenlydistributed across the bins (0-2) for the amount of yellow bedding material present in an image. Theclassifier’s probabilties are correlated negatively with (0) fewer bedding material and positively withmore (2). When we account for the effect of unequal label distribution using partial correlation, theoutput probabilities and bins (0 & 2) are still correlated.
