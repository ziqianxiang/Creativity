Table 1: Accuracy comparison of S2ConvSCN and Robust S2ConvSCN trained and tested on fullCOIL20, COIL100, and Extended YaleB datasets. BD and L2 stand for block diagonal and `2regularization of representation matrix, respectively.
Table 2: Accuracy comparison of S2ConvSCN and Robust S2ConvSCN trained and tested on in-dependent folds for each dataset. BD and L2 stand for block diagonal and `2 regularization ofrepresentation matrix, respectively. The best mean accuracy for each dataset is bolded.
Table 3: Settings of the baseline S2ConvSCN and Robust S2ConvSCN per each dataset. T-maxrepresents maximum number epochs and T0 stands for the number of epochs after which pseudo-labels are refined. Warm-up represents the number of epochs without the refinement of pseudo-labels, LR stands for starting learning rate, and Min LR represents the minimum learning rate.
Table 4: S2ConvSCN and RS2ConvSCN hyperparameters. λ1 to λ5 are regularization constantsfrom total loss Eq. 11 while the trade-off constant γ depends on usage of BD (Eq. (5) or `2 (Eq. (6))regularization.
