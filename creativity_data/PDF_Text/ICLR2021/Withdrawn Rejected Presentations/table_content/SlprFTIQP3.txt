Table 1: Region Metrics: We show both set representation and Boolean representation. TP, FN andFP stand for true positive, false negative and false positive respectively. The subscript c means thatthe metrics are calculated for each class.
Table 2: We compare the recall loss with other losses on the Synthia dataset using two differentbackbone networks. Recall loss improVes accuracy significantly while offers competitiVe IOU.
Table 3: We compare recall loss with other losses on the Cityscapes dataset with real images usingdifferent backbones. Recall loss yields the best accuracy and maintains a competitive IOU. Thisdemonstrates its robustness to label noise in real datasets.
Table 4: To study sensitivity of EMA on different datasets, we experimented with different α valuesand report the validation accuracy. We use α =0.9 and α = 0.001 for Place365 and iNaturalist2018respectively in subsequent comparison with other methods.
Table 5: Test Accuracy on Place-LT. f denotes results from LiU et al. (2019) and 去 denotes resultsfrom Kang et al. (2020). We follow previous works to report performance on many (more than100 images), medium (20 to 100 images) and few-shot (fewer than 20 images). Our method yieldsoverall best performance. We highlight the Best and Second BeSt baseline method.
Table 6: Validation Accuracy on iNaturalist2018. f denotes results from Zhou et al. (2020) and 能denotes results from Kang et al. (2020).
