Table 1: The success rate of our method to fool a fixed classifier for the sensitive attributes smiling,gender, lipstick, and age. This was measured as the accuracy of f iχ(s∣∙) for each censored attributein the censored data {(x0i0, s0i)}im=1. Higher is better. Average and standard deviation of five runs.
Table 2: The results of evaluating the adversarially trained classifiers adv(s∣∙) on the held out testdata censored with the baseline, only the generator, and our method for varying distortion for thesmiling attribute. Closer to 50 means more privacy. Only using the generator does not privide anyprivacy, but using it together with the filter provides the best privacy. Lower is better.
Table 3: The value of each cell denotes the Pearson’s correlation coefficient between predictions froma classifier trained to predict the row attribute and a classifier trained to predict the column attribute,given that the column attribute has been censored.
Table 4: Pearson correlation coefficient between the smiling attribute and 37 other attributes in theCelebA training dataset, ordered from high to low absolute correlation.
