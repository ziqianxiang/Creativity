Table 1: Element-wise test accuracy (average of 5 runs) on algorithmic tasks on matrices dependingon input length. Both models are trained using curriculum learning on matrices up to size 32 Ã— 32.
Table 2: Element-wise test accuracy (average of 5 runs) on algorithmic tasks on graphs depending onvertex count. Both models are trained using curriculum learning on graphs with UP to 32 vertices.
Table 3: Comparison of different neural Sudoku solvers. Sudoku puzzles with fewer givens are harder.
