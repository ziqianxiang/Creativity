These cases correspond to βt = ∞ and β = 0, respectively. Thereward function is given as rt = r + KB X g(βt) where KB = 0.5; and g(βt) = -1 for βt = 0, and0 otherwise. In the implementation, We have mapped ∞ to 1, i.e. the decision variable is βt ∈ {0,1},hence βt = 1 corresponds to not obtaining a sample in Scenario B.

We choose Q1 = 0.1 and Q2 = 0.2 for the PendUlUm-v0, Qi = 0.2 forthe CartPole-v1, and Qi = 0.1 for the MountainCarContinuous-v0. The ordering of the observationsis the same with the ones provided in OpenAI Gym (Brockman et al., 2016). For instance, forMoUntainCarContinUoUs-v0, position and velocity correspond to o1 and o2, respectively. Note thatindices start with i = 0 in OpenAI Gym whereas here we start with i = 1.
