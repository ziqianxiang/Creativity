This complements the results presented in ยง3. We compare the impact ofcorrecting labels only on the cross entropy term (ce only), only on the reverse cross entropy term(rce only), or both. Table 3 and Table 4 show the achieved accuracy for CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100,respectively, under two noise rates, 30% and 60%, three different noise types, symmetric, bimodal
