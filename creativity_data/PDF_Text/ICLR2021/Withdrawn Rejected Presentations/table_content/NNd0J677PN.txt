Table 1: Agent-level DP Evaluation. We compare the state-of-the-art DPFL methods with ours onthe Digit and CelebA datasets. For (, δ)-DP setting, we set δ = 10-3 across all the methods.
Table 2: Instance-level DP on Office-Caltech using different backbones.
Table 3: Instance-level DP on DomainNet. We compare our method with DP-FedSGD and thenon-private baseline FedAvg. Total number of local agents is 5. We set δ = 10-4.
