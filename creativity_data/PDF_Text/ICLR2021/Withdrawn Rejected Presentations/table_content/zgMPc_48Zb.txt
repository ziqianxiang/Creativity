Table 1: Comparison of DP image generation results on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST at (, δ) =(10, 10-5)-DP. Results for other methods (G-PATE (Long et al., 2019), DP-MERF & DP-MERF AE(Harder et al., 2020), DP-CGAN (Torkzadehmahani et al., 2019), GS-WGAN (Chen et al., 2020))are from Chen et al. (2020). Results averaged over 5 runs of synthetic dataset generation.

Table 4: Comparison of training DP-Sinkhorn with various optimizers and learning rates on MNIST.
Table 5: Comparison of training DP-Sinkhorn with various batch sizes and noise scales (σ) onMNIST. We use an Adam optimizer with learning rate 1e-5, and DP = 10 is used as target todetermine the number of epochs. The first row corresponds to the configuration used in resultsreported in Table 1.
