Table 1: Applying ALFA with different step sizeα to the feature embeddings from the last blockof ResNet-20s/56s on CIFAR-10. Larger α indi-cates stronger feature perturbations.
Table 2: Standard testing accuracy (%) on CIFAR-10 dataset. Standard Training stands for thetraditional training with only clean data. We utilize PGD-5 to generate the adversarial perturbationson the feature embeddings from the last residual block of ResNets. is unbounded here. Step sizeα = 0.5/255 for ResNet-20s, α = 1.0/255 for ResNet-18 and ResNet-101, and α = 1.5/255 forResNet-56s and ResNet-50. ↑ indicates the improvement over SA compared to the correspondingbaseline in standard training.

Table 5: Standard testing accuracy (%) on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. For CIFAR-10, weperturb the feature embeddings in the last block of ResNet-18, via PGD-1/3/5/7/10 with step sizeα = 1.0/255. As a reference, the SA of standard trained model is 94.30%. As for ImageNet, wealso perturb the last block features of ResNet-18 via PGD-1/3/5 and step size α = 0.5/255. Thereference SA is 69.38%.
