Table 1: Results on ImageNet with ResNet-50 as backbone. The Top-1 and Top-5 accuracy areUnder linear evaluation i.e. by a linear Classfier for final Classfication (the Same as in SimCLR).
Table 2: Results of different K and batch sizes. When K = 0, AdaCLRpre degenerates to SimCLR.
Table 3: Results with different batch sizes. It involves all different ways of augmentation.
Table 4: Results with different augmentations functions. Note R-Color, R-Gray, R-Flip means theremoval of color, gray scale, and horizontal flip, respectively. Here the batch size is set 4096.
