For safe spot-aware adversarial training experiments, we utilize “fast” adversarial training(Wong et al., 2020) and train the safe spot-aware model S-FGSM+Fast to reduce the training cost.

Here, we consider the'2 threat model, where E = 0.5 for CIFAR-10 and E = 3.0 for ImageNet. We run experiments onthe smoothed classifiers based on the natural and the Gaussian-noise augmented model, which areconsidered certifiably robust (Lecuyer et al., 2019; Cohen et al., 2019). We measure empirical robust-ness against the randomized PGD on both models and measure certified robustness on the Gaussianmodel. Detailed settings such as noise level σ and randomized PGD are listed in supplementary C.2.
