Table 1: Depiction of the cosine similarity summed over pairwise different columns of Aω (0 means orthog-onal basis vectors, improving disentanglement from Prop. 5)), the maximum (first row) and average (secondcolumn) are presented, computed over 10000 sampled regions ω. We see that training increases disentangle-ment, and fully connected models offer increased disentanglement as compared to convolutional models.
