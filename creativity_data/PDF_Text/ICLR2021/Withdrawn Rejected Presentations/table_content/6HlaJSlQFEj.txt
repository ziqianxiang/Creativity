Table 1: Comparison of clean accuracy. For randomization-based methods, We denote mean andstandard deviation of clean accuracy in 5 repetitive experiments With different random seeds.
Table 2: Evaluation of attack success rates (%) on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
Table 3: Evaluation of attack success rates against defenses on the ImageNet dataset. We denote theaverage `2 norm of perturbations in the parenthesis.
Table 4: Evalutation of SND with different T .
Table 5: Evaluation of P (h(x) 6= h(x + η)).
Table 6: Evalutation of the adaptive attack against SND with T =10.
Table 7: Experimental results of varying σ with the CIFAR-10 dataset. We evaluate mean andstandard deviation of clean accuracy in 5 repetitive experiments on the original test dataset.
Table 8: Evaluation of attack success rates of Subspace Attack against defenses on the ImageNetdataset. We also calculate the attack success rate without initially misclassified images and denoteit in the parenthesis.
