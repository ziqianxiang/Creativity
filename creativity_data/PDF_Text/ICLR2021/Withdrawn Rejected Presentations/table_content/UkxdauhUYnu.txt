Table 1: Accuracy and robustness of each part of our model alone compared to TRADES on Cifar-103.2	Performance against adversarial attacksWe test our model with a reweighting module under the white-box attack, which is the most difficultthreat model and no effective defense exists yet. The model of Hendrycks et al. (2019) is based onImageNet adversarial pretraining and is less directly comparable to ours due to the differences inexternal data and training methods. Finally, we perform standard self-training using the unlabeleddata, which offers a moderate 0.4% improvement in standard accuracy over the intermediate modelbut is not adversarially robust.
Table 2: Accuracy and robustness of each part of our model alone compared to TRADES on Cifar-103.3	Explainable Image Generative ModelUnder review as a conference paper at ICLR 2021Many of the modern image generative models, such as WGAN, BIGGAN etc. , can produce high-quality novel images from datasets at one hand, while on the other hand, can be tricky to train andoften require intense computation.
