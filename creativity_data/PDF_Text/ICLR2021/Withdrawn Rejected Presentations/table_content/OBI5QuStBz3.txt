Table 1: Comparison of existing lower bounds on total communication required to solve (1). ‘BC’denotes results for broadcast model, and ‘MP’ denotes results for message-passing model. Note thatlower bounds for the broadcast model also apply to the message-passing model.
Table 2: Upper bounds for distributed optimisation over β-smooth, α-strongly convex input functionswith condition number κ. ‘BC’ denotes results for broadcast model, and ‘MP’ denotes results formessage-passing model. Note that upper bounds for the message-passing model also apply to thebroadcast model, but not vice versa.
