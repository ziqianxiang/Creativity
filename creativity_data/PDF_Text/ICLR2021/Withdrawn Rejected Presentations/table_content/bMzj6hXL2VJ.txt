Table 1: Empirical results for ER and SF graphs of 30 nodes with LG data.
Table 2: Empirical results for ER and SF graphs of 100 nodes with LG data.
Table 3: Empirical results of CORL-2 with different choices of encoder and decoder on 30-node LGER2 datasets. The smaller SHD the better, the higher TPR the better.
Table 4: Total number of iterations (Ã—103) before RL converge on LG data.
Table 5: Empirical results for ER and SF graphs of 50 nodes with LG data. The higher TPR the better,the smaller SHD the better.
Table 6: Empirical results of ICA-LiNGAM, GraN-DAG and CAM (against CORL-2 for reference)for ER and SF graphs with LG data. The higher TPR the better, the smaller SHD the better.
Table 7: Empirical results on 30-, 50- and 100-node LiNGAM ER2 datasets. The smaller SHD thebetter, the higher TPR the better.
Table 8: Empirical results on 20-node GP ER1 datasets with different sample sizes. The smaller SHDthe better, the higher TPR the better.
