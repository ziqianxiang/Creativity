Table 1: Comparison. We evaluate DORP in k-object-rearrangement tasks by measuring successrates across 50 sample tasks3. DORP is able to successfully solve most of the tasks as we increasethe number of objects. We observe that other methods’ performances degrade rapidly. We denote‘max’ when the agent has reached the limit on the number of steps without reaching the goal in5-object-rearrangment this limit is 1400.
