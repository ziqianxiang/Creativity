Table 1: Means and standard errors for the ablation study using the TVAESynth dataset. Here, ‘oos’means out-of-sample, ‘ws’ means within sample. ‘+zo’ indicates the introduction of the miscella-neous factors, '+zO ' indicates the introduction of miscellaneous factors but without changing thedimensionality of Zc thereby increasing total latent capacity, '+ξ' indicates our targeted regulariza-tion (with selected backpropagation), '+ξ*' indicatest targeted regularization equivalent to the oneused by Shi et al. (2019) (i.e. with gradients applied to all upstream parameters), the ξ subscriptindicates its weight in the loss.

Table 3: Means and standard errors for evaluation on the real-world Jobs dataset (LaLonde, 1986;Smith & Todd, 2005; Shalit et al., 2017; Yoon et al., 2018). Results taken from: (Louizos et al.,2017; Zhang et al., 2020). Here, ‘oos’ means out-of-sample and ‘ws’ means within sample. ‘+ zo’indicates the introduction of the miscellaneous factors, and '+ ξ' indicates targeted regularizationwith subscript indicating its weight in the loss.
