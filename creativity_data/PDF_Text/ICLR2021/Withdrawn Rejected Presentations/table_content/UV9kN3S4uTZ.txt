Table 1: Inference accuracy (%) of nri trained with trajectory lengths. Note that the performancedeteriorates significantly when the output length decreases. For nri++, we added two more hiddenlayers to the MLP encoder of nri.
Table 2: Performance comparison for ours and the baselines in both the periodic (40,20,8,4) andadditive (Add) dynamic scenarios. MSE is for trajectory prediction and Accuracy quantifies thedynamic relational inference performance.

Table 4: Performance comparison for dyari and baselines on the real-world basketball trajectorydataset with different inference periods 40, 20, 8 and 4.
Table 5: Qualitative results for stochastic dynamics. Accuracy improves by increasing the modelcapacity. In the training, The inference period of the two dyari match with the dynamic period.
