Table 1: Comparison of training objective and test output for standard risk minimization learningscheme, N&P and adversarial trainnng; ∕* is the minimizer of the training objective.
Table 2: Malware Detection: False Negative Rate (FNR) and False Positive Rate (FPR) onSleipnir.
Table 3: Image Classification: Classification accuracy on CIFAR10, same relation in training andtesting. Thefirst column specifies the attack parameters used in test-time. The parameters are in theform of (∞-norm, PGD step size, PGD steps, number of hue-shifts). The models are adversariallytrained using(4/255,2/255,3,20).
Table 4: Image Classification: Classification accuracy on CIFAR10, relation in training is a subset ofrelation in testing. The attacker uses a 15-step PGD attack with ∞-norm 4/255 and step size 2/255,and randomly samples500combinations of hue, brightness and constrast adjustment factors.
