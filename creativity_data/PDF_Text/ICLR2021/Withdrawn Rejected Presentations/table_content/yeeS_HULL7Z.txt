Table 1: Possible implementations of the compatibility function. act is any elementwise activationfunction, such as tanh or sigmoid.
Table 2: Comparative results on Omniglot. The table presents results for known and unknownnumber of clusters. Where the architecture relies on knowning a (maximum) number of clusters,such as KLC, that maximum is set to 100. The first four entries are copied from Hsu et al. (2018) astheir methods are most relevant in comparison to ours. The table is split up as explained in the maintext.
Table 3: Clustering results on embedded Ima-geNet. The cited scores are copied from Leeet al. (2019b).
Table 4: Clustering results on CIFAR-100. Thecited scores are copied from Han et al. (2019).
Table 5: Average NMI scores for 1000 random instances, each of size 100, for each alphabet inthe evaluation set. The number of clusters varies uniformly up to the maximum available for eachalphabet, Which is 47 for Malayalam. ‘Mul’ refers to multiplicative attention, While ‘Add’ meansABC With additive attention.
