Table 1: Quantitative evaluation on undistorted Taskonomy and Replica datasets. Results arereported for depth, reshading, and normal using direct and perceptual error metrics. The perceptual metricsevaluate the target prediction in another domain. `1 losses are reported, multiplied by 100 for readability. Ourproposed method outperforms on the perceptual metrics while being comparable in the direct metrics, showingthat the performance does not decrease on undistorted data while being robust against distribution shifts.
