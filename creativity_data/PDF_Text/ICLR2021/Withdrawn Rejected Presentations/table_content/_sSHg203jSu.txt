Table 1: The experimental results of natural language inference tasks on Glue dataset.
Table 2: The detailed average inference time of each component in the model by retrained DRONEmethod. The unit is in millisecond.
Table 3: The average inference time of comparison to distilled models. The unit is in millisecond.
Table 4: The average inference time of comparison to distilled models on GPU. The unit is inmillisecond.
Table 5: The average inference time of each component in the model of 2-layer LSTM model. Bothproposed methods and SVD use same ranks so the inference time is approximately the same. Theunit is in millisecond and the number in parenthesis shows the ratio respective to the overall inferencetime.
Table 6: Illustration of SVD fine-tuning. Using the same rank as the proposed method, SVD accuracywill drop significantly. After fine-tuning on the SVD-based approximation, the accuracy could berecovered. But itâ€™s still less competitive than the proposed method.
