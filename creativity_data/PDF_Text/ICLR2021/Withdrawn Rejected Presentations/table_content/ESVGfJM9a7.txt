Shared decoders input the sampled z to one decoder and partition its outputto generate model parameters.(2) Separate process: We assume that each of the {wi, βi, γi} followsa separate latent process and we sample them separately. Separate processes use three sets of meansand variances to sample {wi , βi , γi } separately. (3) LSTM encoder: We replace the Transformerencoder with a LSTM module.

Parameter SettingsFor the synthetic dataset, we pre-specified both the STSCP’s and the STHP’s kernels g0 (s) andg2(s, sj) to be Gaussian:g0(S) := 2∏%0|-2eχp (-2(S- [0,0Dς-1(S- [0,0])T)g2(s, Sj ) := 2∏ %2|T eχp -- 2(s - Sj)ς-I(S - Sj)T)The STSCP is defined on S = [0, 1] × [0, 1], while the STHP is defined on S = R2. The STSCP’skernel functions are normalized according to their cumulative probability on S . Table 5 shows thesimulation parameters. The STSCP’s spatial domain is discretized as an 101 × 101 grid during thesimulation.
