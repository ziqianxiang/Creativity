Table 1: Performance on OpenAI Gym at 200K timesteps. The results show the mean and standarddeviation averaged over ten runs, and the best results are indicated in bold. For baseline methods,we report the best number in prior works (Wang & Ba, 2020; Wang et al., 2019).
Table 2: Performance on DeepMind Control Suite at 100K and 500K environment steps. The resultsshow the mean and standard deviation averaged five runs, and the best results are indicated in bold.
Table 3: Performance on Atari games at 100K interactions. The results show the scores averagedthree runs, and the best results are indicated in bold. For baseline methods, we report the bestnumbers reported in prior works (Kaiser et al., 2020; van Hasselt et al., 2019).
Table 4: Hyperparameters used for DeepMind Control Suite experiments. Most hyperparametersvalues are unchanged across environments with the exception for action repeat, learning rate, andbatch size.
