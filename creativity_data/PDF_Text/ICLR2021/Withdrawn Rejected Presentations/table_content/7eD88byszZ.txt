It reportsrelative errors between the exact solution and the solution calculated by the proposed solver withand without smoothing. It shows that errors can be dramatically reduced after smoothing, and ourproposed solver can well approximate the true solution of LGX = b16Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2021Figure 8: The correlation of PageRank between itself and its sparsifier for graph ibm_32 (left),mathworks_100 (middle) and gre_1107 (right) after smoothing7.5.2 Iterative method for directed Laplacian solverFigure 7 shows the relative residual plot (versus GMRES iteration number) when no preconditioneris applied, Incomplete LU factorization (ILU) as the preconditioner is applied, and the directedsparsifier Laplacian LS as the preconditioner is applied for graph pesa and big. We can conclude thatGMRES with directed sparsifiers as preconditioners has faster convergence rate than the other twomethods. It is also observed that the number of nonzeros (nnz) in the preconditioner matrix createdby the directed sparsifier is the lowest.
