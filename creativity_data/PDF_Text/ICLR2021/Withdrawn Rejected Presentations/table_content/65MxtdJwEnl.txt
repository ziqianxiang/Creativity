Table 1: Mean and standard deviation of test set accuracy (in %) over three repeats, as well asmemory usage and training time, on the EigenWorms dataset for depths 1-3 and a small selectionof step sizes. The bold values denote that the model was the top performer for that step size.
Table 2: Mean and standard deviation of the L2 losses on the test set for each of the vitals signsprediction tasks (RR, HR, SpO2) on the BIDMC dataset, across three repeats. Only mean timesare shown for space. The memory usage is given as the mean over all three of the tasks as it wasapproximately the same for any task for a given depth and step. The bold values denote the algorithmwith the lowest test set loss for a fixed step size for each task.
Table 3: Hyperparamter selection results for the EigenWorms dataset. The blue values denote theselected hyperparameters.
Table 4: Hyperparameter selection results for each problem of the BIDMC dataset. The bold valuesdenote the selected hyperparameters for each vitals sign problem. Note that RR and SpO2 had thesame parameters selected, hence why only two lines are given in bold.
Table 5: Mean and standard deviation of test set accuracy (in %) over three repeats, as well asmemory usage and training time, on the EigenWorms dataset for depths 1-3 and a small selectionof step sizes. The bold values denote that the model was the top performer for that step size.

Only mean timesare shown for space. The memory usage is given as the mean over all three of the tasks as it wasapproximately the same for any task for a given depth and step.
