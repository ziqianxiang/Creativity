Table 1: Validation accuracy and robustness of ResNet50 on ImageNet. We report average over thefinal 3 runs. The maximum perturbation of all the attackers is ε = 4/255. The best results are inred While the second best results are in blue. Our ATCD achieves a trade-off betWeen efficiency andaccuracy.

Table 6: Effectiveness verification of the CD loss and the M-H resampling on CIFAR10. We useWide ResNet34 as the target model and the baseline method is Free-8A.3.4 Different numbers of Attack IterationsTo analyze the influence of the number of attack iterations on different adversarially trained models,we range the number of iterations of PGD attacker from 10 to 200. Figure 4 shows the robust accuracyof different adversarially trained models. We fix ε = 8/255 and ε = 2/255, and change the iterationnumber ranging in {10, 20, 50, 100, 200}. From the plots, we see that no matter how larger the attackiteration is, the checkpoint which achieves the high robust accuracy under one certain configurationstill has higher accuracy than other models in different iteration configurations.
