Table 1: Number of successful adversarial attacks for different neural network implementations. Thenumber of quasi-adversarial images in the first column corresponds to the cases where the solverdoes not time out at the initialization step. For each implementation, we try to find adversarialimages by applying random perturbations on each quasi-adversarial image and report the number ofsuccessfully found adversarial images here.
