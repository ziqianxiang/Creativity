Table 1: The best accuracies found bydifferent search algorithms on NAS-Bench-IOl without weight sharing.
Table 2: The average statistics of the best cells found on NAS-Bench-IOl without weight sharing,averaged over 10 runs (with std shown). Note that we set the number of queries (Q) for RandomSearch to be the same as the average number of queries incurred by GA-NAS.
Table 3: Searching on NAS-Bench-IOl with weight-sharing, with the mean true test accuracy of the bestcells from 10 runs, and the best accuracy/rank foundby a single run. â†‘: taken from (Yu et al., 2019)the 2nd best in 5 runs and the 3rd best in the other 5 runs.
Table 4: Searching on NAS-Bench-201 without weight sharing, with the mean accuracy and rank of the bestcell found reported. #Q represents the average number of queries per run. We conduct 20 runs for GA-NAS.
Table 5: Constrained search results on NAS-Bench-IOL GA-NAS can find cells that are superior to theResNet and Inception cells in terms of test accuracy, training time, and the number of weights.
