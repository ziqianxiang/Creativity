Table 1: Performance comparison of different methods in four scenarios against the baseline perfor-mance, using the maximum MA improvement in percentage (denoted as MMAI), the average MAimprovement in percentage (denoted as AMAI), and mean corruption errors in percentage (mCE).
Table 2: Comparison on Honda dataset. In "Method" column, "N" means Nvidia backbone network,"C" means comma.ai backbone network. Our method outperforms AugMix in most cases.
Table 3: Comparison on Audi dataset. In "Method" column, "N" means Nvidia backbone network,"C" means comma.ai backbone network. Our method outperforms AugMix in most cases.
