Table 1: Depth Estimation: KITTI dataset. Only monocular estimation methods are reported.
Table 2: Semantic Segmentation on PASCAL-Context. D-ResNet-101 denotes Dilated ResNet-101.
Table 3: Semantic Segmentation: results on both Cityscapes validation and testing set (trained onthe standard training set) (left) and on PASCAL VOC 2012 validation set (right). D-ResNet-101means Dilated-ResNet-101. (*) indicates COCO pretrained weights.
Table 4: Semantic segmentation results on Cityscapes test set (learned on the train+val set, multi-scale and flipping). D-ResNet-101 is short for Dilated-ResNet-101.
