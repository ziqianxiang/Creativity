Table 1: Evaluation of various criteria for different σx2: the expected value of kx0 - xk22 (MSE),KL divergence, the converged value of σz2 , the upper bound of the MI I(x0 ; z), the expected gap(perturbation variance sz2 are set to 10-2 and 10-3) and expected local smoothness (ELS).
Table 2: Parameterizations of posterior variance in X and corresponding reconstruction objectives.
Table 3: Numerical evaluation on MNIST and CelebA. The MSE of sample reconstruction is evalu-ated on the test set. The quality of generated samples is measured by FID for three cases: samplingthe latent variables from the prior and from the estimated posterior by 2nd VAE and GMM.
Table 4: Evaluation of FID scores of interpolated images on MNIST and CelebA. The interpolationratio for each image pair is designated as (i) the mid-point; and (ii) a random-point between the two.
Table 5: Evaluation of various criteria for different σz2 . These criteria are the expected value ofkx0-xk22 (MSE), KL divergence, the upper bound ofMII(x0, z), the expected gap (the perturbationvariance sz2 is set to 10-2 and 10-3) and expected local smoothness (ELS).
