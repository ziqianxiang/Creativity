Table 1: Ablation studies on Kinetics-400. All models use ResNet50 as backbone.
Table 2: Study on the effectiveness of TAM. All models use ResNet50 as backbone and take 8frames with sampling stride 8 as inputs. To be consistent with testing, the FLOPs are calculatedwith spatial size 256 × 256. All methods share the same training setting and inference protocol.
Table 3: Extending to other backbones. All models share the same inference protocol, e.g., 10 clips× 3 crops.
Table 4: Comparisons with the state-of-the-art methods on Kinetics-400. As described in Feichten-hofer et al. (2019), the GFLOPs (ofa single view) × the number of views (temporal clips with spatialcrops) represents the model complexity. The GFLOPs are calculated with spatial size 256 × 256.

Table 6: Comparisons with the state-of-the-art methods on Sth-Sth V1. The models only takingRGB frames as inputs are listed in table. To be consistent with testing, we use spatial size 224×224to compute the FLOPs.
