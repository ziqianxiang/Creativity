Table 1: Attack performance comparison on various datasets.
Table 2: Attack performance comparison on various models trained on CelebA.
Table 3: Attack performance comparison where there is large distributional shift between public andprivate data. A â†’ B represents the setting when the target network is trained on dataset B and theGAN is trained on dataset A to distill a generic prior for reconstructions.
Table 4: Ablation study of ideas introduced in this paper, including soft-label discrimination (SD),entropy minimization (EM), and distributional recovery (DR).
