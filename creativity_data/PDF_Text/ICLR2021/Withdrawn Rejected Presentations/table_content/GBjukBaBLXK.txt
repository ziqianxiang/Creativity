Table 1: Evaluation metrics of different models on benchmark datasets. The CP values are markedin blue if they meet the 95% prediction level. The best IW results, marked in bold, are achievedby models with the smallest IW value among those that meet the 95% prediction level. Our modeloutperforms the baseline algorithms on high-quality PI generation. Meanwhile, it provides accuratecoverage estimation on real-world datasets.
