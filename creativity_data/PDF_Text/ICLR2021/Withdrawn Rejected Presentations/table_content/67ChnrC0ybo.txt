Table 1: The performance of DARTS, P-DARTS, PC-DARTS and our approach af-ter 200 search epochs on CIFAR10. ‘#P’means the number of parametric operators(any convolution) in the final normal cell.
Table 2: Comparison with the state-of-the-arts on CIFAR10. *: Edge search, the (optional) first stepof our approach, takes 2.1 out of 3.1 GPU-days (please refer to Appendix B.3 for details).
Table 3: Comparison with the state-of-the-arts on ILSVRC2012, under the mobile setting. t thesearchitectures are searched on ImageNet.
Table 4: Comparison among NAS approaches on PennTreebank. * Results borrowed from (LiU et al., 2019).
Table 5: Comparison between DARTS (early termination), R-DARTS (Dropout) and our approach inthe reduced search space of S3 with different SeedsJ: We borrow the experimental results from (Zelaet al., 2020).
Table 6: Results of architecture search with different seeds in S1, S2, and S3 on CIFAR10.
Table 7: Transferring some of the searched architectures on CIFAR10 to ILSVRC2012. The mobilesetting is used to determine the basic channel width of each transferred architecture.
