Table 1: Classification accuracy on our ImageNet test set for various class ranges. Images to beclassified are always compared against all thousand classes. We report mean accuracy and standarddeviation of five trials. Pretrained embeddings are from the ResNet-18 trained on 800 classes andfine-tuned embeddings from the ResNet-18 trained with our class homogeneity task.
Table 2: Classification accuracy on our ImageNet test set for various class ranges. This time, imagesto be classified are only compared against classes in the respective range. We report mean accuracyand standard deviation of five trials. Pretrained embeddings are from the ResNet-18 trained on 800classes and fine-tuned embeddings from the ResNet-18 trained with our class homogeneity task.
Table 3: Classification accuracy on the test set of several out-of-distribution datasets. The firstreported ResNet-18 was independently trained on each dataset. For all other methods, models weretrained on ImageNet. We report mean accuracy and standard deviation of five trials. Pretrainedembeddings are from a ResNet-18 trained on 800 ImageNet classes and fine-tuned embeddingsfrom the ResNet-18 trained with our class homogeneity task.
Table 4: Clustering accuracy on our ImageNet test set. For each class range, the set of samples tocluster was all 50 test samples of each class in the range. We report mean accuracy and standarddeviation of five trials. The first two methods used embeddings from a ResNet-18 trained on allImageNet classes. Pretrained embeddings are from a ResNet-18 trained on 800 ImageNet classesand fine-tuned embeddings from the ResNet-18 trained with our class homogeneity task. We usedk-means with k set to the number of classes in each respective range. For PCA, we reduced thedimensionality to 2.
