Table 1: ImageNet validation accuracy (%) and inference cost. DG-Nets improve the accuracy of allbaseline architectures with small relative increase in the number of parameters and inference cost.
Table 2: COCO object detection minival performance. APs (%) of bounding box detection arereported. DG-Nets brings consistently improvement across multiple backbones on all scales.
Table 3: Compared with InstaNAS under com-parable latency in ImageNet.
Table 4: Compared with RandWire undersmall computation regime in ImageNet.
Table 5: Comparision with NAS methods under mobile setting. Here we train for 250 epochs similarto (ZoPh et al., 2018; Real et al., 2019; Xie et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2018; 2019), for fair comparisons.
Table 6: Ablation study on different connectivity methods. Experiments are conducted in ImageNetand Top-1 accuracy are reported. Results show that the proposed dynamic graph outperforms staticnetworks with/without learnable weights of edges in large marigins.
