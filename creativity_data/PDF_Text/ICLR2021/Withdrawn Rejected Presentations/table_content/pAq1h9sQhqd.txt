Table 1: Results of Yger et al. (2012) (on CIFAR-10, our imple-mentation of Yger et al. (2012) faces convergence issues).
Table 2: Results of feature learning on MNIST.
Table 3: Fairness results on CelebA. We appliedCCA on three different layers in Resnet-18 respeC-tively. See A.8 for positions of Conv 0, 1, 2.
Table 4: Explicit forms for some operations we need. Π(X) returns X's column space; Π* is Π's differential.
Table 5: Wallclock runtime of one pass through the data of our RSG+ and MSG on MNIST, Mediamilland CIFAR (average of 5 runs).
