Table 1: Average atom-wise L2 error, bond length error on the training and test sets, as well asRMSD between reconstructed and true structures, using ProGAE. The L2 error is within the resolu-tion of the associated PDB files, even achieving sub-Angstrom performance on human ACE2.
Table 2: The leading canonical correlation between the learned intrinsic and extrinsic latent spaces,as well as the performance of a linear model trained on disentangled latent spaces of ProGAE forbound drug classification, are shown.
Table 3: Results of linear regression on the extrinsic latent space for predicting physical and chem-ical properties of the drugs that a protein is bound to. Error is normalized for interpretability. Forcomparison, performance of linear regression on the PCA embeddings of the orientation of thebackbone bonds is reported. This embedding is restrained to the same dimension as the latent space.
Table 4: The percentage of backbone covalent bonds that are 10% shorter than the minimum seen intraining data. The difference (Diff) between the intrinsic+extrinsic ProGAE and the extrinsic onlyProGae is also reported; negative difference indicate higher bond-length error in the later model.
Table 5: Average atom-wise L2 error in reconstruction (A) on the test dataset after transferring atrained model to other protein structures. These simulations correspond to two different states of theentire S protein and of the main protease of SARS-CoV-2. We retrain only the dense layer mappingto the decoder. For comparison, we train the same layer for a randomly initialized model (Baseline).
