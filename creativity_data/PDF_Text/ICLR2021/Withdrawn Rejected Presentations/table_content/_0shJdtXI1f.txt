Table 1: Comparison results on LFW, CFP-FP, CALFW and CPLFW. The results of base embed-dings (ArcFace and CosFace) are successfully replicated as reported in the ArcFace officially re-leased repository: https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface/wiki/Model-Zoo.
Table 2: Comparison results on MegaFace. Modelsare trained on MS1MV2. “Ver.” refers to face verifica-tion TAR(@FAR=1e-6). “Id.” denotes rank-1 identifi-cation accuracy.
Table 3: Comparison results on IJB-C. Models withdifferent backbones are trained on MS1MV2. Theevaluation metric is 1:1 verification TAR@FAR at 1e-4 and 1e-5, respectively.
