Table 1: Companion to Figure 1. The learning coefficient is the slope of the linear fit 1/n versusEnG(n) (no intercept since realisable). The R2 value gives a sense of the goodness-of-fit.
Table 2: RLCT estimates for ReLU and SiLU networks. We observe the RLCT increasing as m increases, i.e.,the true distribution becomes more “complicated” relative to the supposed model.
Table 3: Companion to Figure 3.
Table 4: Companion to Figure 4. The learning coefficient is the slope of the linear fit 1/n versusEnG(n) (with intercept since nonrealisable).
Table 5: Companion to Figure 5. The learning coefficient is the slope of the linear fit 1/n versusEnG(n) (with intercept since nonrealisable).
