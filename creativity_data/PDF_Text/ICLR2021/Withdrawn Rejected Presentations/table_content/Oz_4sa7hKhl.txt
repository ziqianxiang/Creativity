Table 1: Datasets details: description, number of classes, the split to train/dev/test sets and whetherthe dataset is topical or not (see details in text).
Table 2: Classification accuracy for BERT andBERTIT:CLUST when using 64 samples for fine-tuning, the accuracy gain relative to BERT’s ac-curacy and the reduction in error (1-accuracy) rel-ative to the BERT error.
Table 3: Paired t-test p-values (after Bonferroni correction) of classification accuracy forBERTIT:CLUST compared to BERT (top row) and to BERTIT:MLM (bottom row). Symbols indicatethe setting which achieved better performance. -- denotes insignificant results (p ≥ 0.05).
