Table 1: Linear evaluation results of transferable robustness. URRL combines the advantages ofAugMix and MoCo v2 to improve on all of the proposed linear evaluation metrics.
Table 2: Transferable adversarial robustness results. The highest accuracy is marked with bold. Ourfull approach URRL-SR has the highest robust accuracy for most of the datasets among represen-tation learning approaches, while losing much less clean accuracy than adversarial training. This isachieved without adversarial training and further data augmentation.
