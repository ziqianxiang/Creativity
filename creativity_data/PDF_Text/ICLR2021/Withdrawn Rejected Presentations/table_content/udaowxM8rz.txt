Table 1: Upper Table: the CE scores of mINOC on ImageNet-C (the lower is the better).
Table 3: ImageNet-C (IC) and ImageNet-NOC (INOC) mCE obtained with several pretrained classifiers.
Table 4: ImageNet-NOC CE ScoreS obtained for Several data augmentation StrategieS. The two laSt columnScontain the ImageNet-NOC and ImageNet-C mCE ScoreS, and the aSSociated rankS written in bracketS.
Table 5: The ImageNet-C CE scores obtained with several pretrained torchvision classifiers.
Table 6: The ImageNet-NOC CE scores obtained with several pretrained torchvision classifiers.
Table 7: CE scores computed with models trained with a data augmentation with one corruption ofImageNet-C. Each line refers to one model trained with one corruption of ImageNet-C and each column refersto one corruption of ImageNet-C.
