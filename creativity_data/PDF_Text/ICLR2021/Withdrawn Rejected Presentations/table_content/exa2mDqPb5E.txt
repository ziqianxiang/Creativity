Table 1: Invariant clustering accuracy (%). The mean and SD over 10 model instances are shown.
Table 2: One-shot classification accuracy (%). The mean and SD over 10 model instances are shown.
Table 3: Quality of shape-view disentanglement, measured as neural network classification accuracy(%) for object identity from the shape (top rows) or view variable (bottom rows); weighted averageover categories. The mean and SD over 10 model instances are shown.
