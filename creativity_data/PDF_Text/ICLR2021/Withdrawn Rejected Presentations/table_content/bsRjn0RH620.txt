On the other hand, we use disagreement definedin Eqn. 6 to measure classifier discrepancy.

Table 4: Changes of classifier discrepancy on novel classes. Columns of Stage 1 show discrepancyon novel classes after the fist conventional training stage. Columns of Stage 2 show discrepancy onnovel classes after the second training stage with auxiliary constraints disMSE or disKL . Differ-ences are highlighted by green and red respectively. Green/red means reduced/enlarged discrepancy.
