Table 1: Popular f -divergences, their conjugate functions and choices of g. We take l(a, b) = g(bargmax a).
Table 2: Comparison vs previous unsupervised domain adaptation approaches on the Office-31 benchmark.
Table 3: Accuracy (%) on Office-Home for unsupervised DA. Impressively, our approach achieves SoTA with-out additional techniques (i.e. CDAN), or additional hyperparameters (i.e. MDD).
Table 4: Popular f -divergences, their conjugate functions and choices of g. We take l(a, b) = g(bargmax a).
