Table 1: Comparison of sampling methods for GANs in terms of three effective sampling mechanisms.
Table 2: Inception Scores (IS) of different sampling methods on CIFAR-10 and CelebA. * For GAN,DRS and MH-GAN, we report the results in Turner et al. (2019). ] The results are given by ourimplementation.
Table 3: Ablation study of our REP-GAN with Inception Scores (IS) and acceptance ratios (Accept)averaged over five adjacent checkpoints. IND refers to the independent proposal of MH-GAN. REPrefers to our REP proposal. MH denotes the MH rejection step of the corresponding sampler.
Table 4: Frechet Inception Distance (FID) of different MCMC sampling methods on CIFAR-10 andCelebA based on our re-implementation.
Table 5: Comparison of computation cost (measured in seconds) of gradient-based MCMC samplingmethods of GANs. We report the total time to sample a batch of 500 samples with DCGAN on aNVIDIA 1080 Ti GPU. We initialize the chain with GAN samples and run each chain for 640 steps.
