Table 1: Comparison results on CIFAR-10 dataset with ResNet-56 and MobileNetV2. ∆-Accrepresents the performance changes before and after model pruning. +/- indicates increase or decreasecompared to baseline results.
Table 2: Comparison results on ImageNet dataset with ResNet-34, ResNet-50, ResNet-101 andMobileNetV2. ∆-Acc represents the performance changes before and after model pruning. +/-indicates increase or decrease compared to baseline results.
Table 3: The structure of HSN used in our method.
Table 4: Choice of p for different models. p is the remained FLOPs divided by the total FLOPsIn Tab. 4, we list the choices of p for different models and datasets used in our experiments.
