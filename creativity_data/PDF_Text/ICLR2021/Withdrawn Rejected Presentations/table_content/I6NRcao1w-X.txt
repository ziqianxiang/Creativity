Table 1: Average reward and % change from vanilla PPO (0 Adv) for Ant, Hopper, and Cheetahenvironments across ten seeds and across the validation (left) or holdout test set (right). Across allenvironments, we see consistently higher robustness using RAP than the minimax adversary. Mostrobust adversarial approach is bolded as domain randomization is an oracle and outside the class ofperturbations that our adversaries can construct, and best result overall is italicized.

For the Mujoco holdout transfer tests we pick a subset of thehopper ‘geom’ elements and scale the contact friction values by maximum friction coefficient, 1.3.
