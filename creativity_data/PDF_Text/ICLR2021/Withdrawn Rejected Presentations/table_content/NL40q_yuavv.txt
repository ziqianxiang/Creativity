Table 1: Symbols for few-shot classification and 3D reconstructionare given a collection of tasks, the meta-training set Dmeta-train = {Dttrain, Dttest}tT=1, on whichwe train a meta-learner which produces a predictor on every task {Dttrain , Dttest} and generalizeswell on the meta-testing Dmeta-test = {Dstrain, Dstest}sS=1.
Table 2: Reconstruction results on ShapeNet. We compare our results with P2M (Wang et al.
Table 3: Ablation study. This table shows results given different N (16, 32 and 64) and the kernel(isotropic or anisotropic). The best model are shown in light gray.
Table 4: Ablation study. This table shows results (volumetric IoU) given different N (4, 8, 16, 32and 64), the kernel (isotropic or anisotropic) and with/without embedding network.
