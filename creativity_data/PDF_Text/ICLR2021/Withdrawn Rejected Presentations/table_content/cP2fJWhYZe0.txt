Table 1: Accuracy of CIFAR-10 classifiers trained and evaluated on full images, 5% backwardselection (BS) pixel-subsets, and 5% random pixel-subsets. Where possible, we report accuracy asmean ± standard deviation (%) over five runs. For training on BS subsets, we run BS on all imagesfor a single model of each type and average over five models trained on these subsets.
Table S1: Accuracy of CIFAR-10 classifiers trained and evaluated on full images, 5% backwardselection (BS) pixel-subsets, and 5% random pixel-subsets with data augmentation (+). Accuracy isreported as mean ± standard deviation (%) over five runs.
Table S2: Accuracy of CIFAR-10 classifiers trained and evaluated on 5% backward selection (BS)pixel-subsets from different architectures. Accuracy is reported as mean ± standard deviation (%)over five runs.
Table S3: Human classification accuracy on a sample of CIFAR-10 test image pixel-subsets of varyingsparsity (see Section 3.4). Accuracies given as mean ± standard deviation.
Table S4: Accuracy of models on ImageNet validation images trained and evaluated on full imagesand 10% BS pixel-subsets. Accuracy for training on 10% BS Subsets is reported as mean ± standarddeviation (%) over five training runs with different random initialization. For training/evaluationon BS pixel-subsets, we run backward selection on all ImageNet images using a single pre-trainedmodel of each type, but average over five models trained on these subsets.
