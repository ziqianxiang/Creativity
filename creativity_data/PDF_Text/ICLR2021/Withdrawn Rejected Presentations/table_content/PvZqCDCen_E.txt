Table 1: Comparison of the mean testing accuracy among FsNet, supervised CAE, HSIC Lasso(HSIC), and mRMR with K = 10 and K = 50. Moreover, We report SVM and Diet Networks. *The pyMRMR package, which is a wrapper of the original code, returns a memory error, and weCoUld not execute the models on these datasets.
Table 2: Model-size comparison between supervisedCAE and FsNet 2 (in KBs) at K = 10. Because FsNetpredicts the model parameter by using a fixed-sized neu-ral network, its model size is the same for all the datasets.
