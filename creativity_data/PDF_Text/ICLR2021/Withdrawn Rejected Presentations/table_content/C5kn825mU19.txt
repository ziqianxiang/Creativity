Table 1: Generalization performance on unseen environments with more agents and dynamic teamcomposition. Results are computed from 5 models trained with 5 different seeds. Communicationfrequency is compared to communicating with all agents at every step.
Table 2: Average episodic reward over the same 500 Rescue games. Results are averaged overthe same algorithm trained with 3 different seeds. For COPA (x), x denotes the communicationfrequency. Greedy algorithm matches the k-th skillful agent for the k-th emergent building.
Table 3: Hyper-parameters in our experiments.
