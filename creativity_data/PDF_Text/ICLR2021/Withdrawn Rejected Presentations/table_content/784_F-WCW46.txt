Table 1: Evaluating the discriminating power of the discriminators against clustering artifacts andsutble change in sampling patterns along with their empirical sampling sensitivity (ESS). In each cellof the top two rows, the left shows the training accuracy while the right shows the test accuracy.
Table 2: Examining sampling sensitivity of evaluation metrics.
Table 3: Evaluating PointNet-based discriminators with different generators. We observe thatPointNet-Mix can significantly improve all sampling-aware/sensitive metric, including FPD-Mix,FGD, MMD-EMD, COV-EMD for all the generators. When paired with FC generator, PointNet-Mixachieves the best performance. We include PointFlow(Yang et al., 2019) and Oracle for a comparison.
Table 4:	Quantitative evaluation for the diagnostic "no generator" experi-ments. We see that PointNet-Max/Mix/Attention are successful while PointNet-Avg/PointNet++/DGCNN/KPConv/PointConv fail.
