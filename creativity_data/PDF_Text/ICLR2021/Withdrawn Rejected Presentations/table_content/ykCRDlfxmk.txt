Table 1: Benchmark datasets - ImageNet and Places365 are two commonly used large-scale datasetsfor image classification, while the other five are small-scaled datasets.
Table 2: AutoHAS improves ResNet-50 and EfficientNet-BO on ImageNet - For each training, Werepeat the training three times and the variance is less than 0.16.
Table 3: Differentiable Search vs. AUtoHAS REINFORCE Search - Both are applied to the samebaseline model with the same hyperparamter and architecture search space. Baseline model has nosearch cost, bUt we list its standalone training cost as a reference. Compared to the differentiablesearch, oUr AUtoHAS achieves slightly better accUracy with mUch less search memory cost.
Table 4: AutoHAS Accuracy for Different Search Space on five Datasets - Weight decay and MixUPare for hyperparameters, and Arch is for architectUres. joint indicates the joint search; phaseindicates the phase-wise search. Each experiment is repeated three times and the average accuracy isreported (standard deviation is about 0.2%).
