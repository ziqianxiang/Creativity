Table 1: Summary of methods for DRE(SUgiyama et al., 2011b). For PULogLoss, We use C â€¹ R.
Table 2: Average AUROC curve (Mean) with the standard deviation (SD) over 5 trials of anomalydetection methods. For all datasets, each model was trained on a single class and tested against allother classes. The best figure is in bold.
Table 3: Experimental results (MSEs and SDs) of DRE using synthetic datasets.
Table 4: Average area under the ROC curve (Mean) of anomaly detection methods averaged over 5trials with the standard deviation (SD). For all datasets, each model was trained on the single class,and tested against all other classes. The best performing method in each experiment is in bold. SD:Standard deviation.
Table 5: Average PD (Mean) with standard deviation (SD) over 10 trials with different seeds permethod. The best performing method in terms of the mean PD is specified by bold face.
Table 6: Average PD (Mean) with standard deviation (SD) over 10 trials with different seeds permethod. The best performing method in terms of the mean PD is specified by bold face.
