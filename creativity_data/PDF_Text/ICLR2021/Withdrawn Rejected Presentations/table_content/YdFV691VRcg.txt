Table 1: Adversarial robustness evaluation in term of accuracy (%) considering PGD and FGSMattackers under L∞ budgets of 0.3 and 蔡 for the cases ofMNIST and CIFAR-10, respectively. Thenumber of steps employed for each attack is represented within parenthesis. We consider evaluationsobtained with the similarity classifier as indicated by SIM as well as utilizing the auxiliary outputlayer which we indicate by DOL.
