Table 2: Our method achieves similar accuracy to SurReal on most of the training data splits. Thetable shows overall test accuracy on the MSTAR dataset while training on different portions of thetraining set. The columns referring to ”X% Train” describe the mean test accuracy and standard de-viation computed over 5 different runs. SurReal+TReLU suffers catastrophic failure, but HyperNet,which combines these elements with the Division Layer, is able to converge to a good solution.
