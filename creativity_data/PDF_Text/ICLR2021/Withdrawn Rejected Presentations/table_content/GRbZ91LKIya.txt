Table 1: Comparing with previous works and baselines under task-specific setting. R-152, I-101 andI-152 are in short of Resnet-152, I3D-Resnext101 and I3D-Resnet152, respectively.
Table 2: A complete comparison of ToCo under Zero-Shot(X) and fine-tuned(∕) evaluationparadigms, with (λ = 0.5) and without (λ = 0) token-NCE, using three video representations,on both the YoUCook2 and MSR-VTT retrieval benchmarks. For completeness, We also includecomparisons to work with larger models and compute in gray.
