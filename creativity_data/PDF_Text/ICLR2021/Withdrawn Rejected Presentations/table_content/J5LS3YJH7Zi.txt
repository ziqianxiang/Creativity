Table 1: Comparison of model performance (R2 mean+sem) on synthetic Lorenz datasets generatedwith 15 different seeds. A hyphen indicates that the variable cannot be compared, as the model doesnot infer it. The top row is italicised as the performance of LFADS on this task is considered theupper limit, having no additional observation noise from fluorescence. Results of paired t-tests fortesting significance of differences in performance between OASIS+LFADS and CaLFADS withinseeds for a) linear calcium model: Lorenz state - t14 = 2.85, p = 0.013; Spike Counts - t14 = 20.67,p < 0.001; Rates - t14 = 4.81, p < 0.001; Fluorescence - t14 = 16.2, p < 0.001. b) nonlinearcalcium model: Lorenz state - t14 = 3.29, p = 0.005; Spike Counts - t14 = 17.16, p < 0.001;Rates - t14 = 6.35, p < 0.001; Fluorescence - t14 = 11.16, p < 0.001.
