For the RFAin (Pillutla et al., 2019), maximum iteration is set to 10. In this setup, the learning rate is decayed forall three schemes (Sself, RFA, FedAvg).

Local batch size is set to 64and the number of poisoned images is 20. In this experiment, we additionally compared our schemewith the norm-thresholding strategy (Sun et al., 2019) where the threshold value is set to 2. Thehyperparameter details for Sself are shown in Table 3.
