Table 1: Sample Pearson correlation with generalization on double descent for ResNet18s of varyingwidth on CIFAR-100 with a training loss below 0.1.
Table 2: Sample Pearson correlation with generalization for CNNs of varying width and depth onCIFAR-100 with a training loss below 0.1.
Table 3: Sample Pearson correlation between generalization measures and the test loss, test error, andgeneralization gap for ResNet18s of varying width trained on CIFAR-100 with 20% corruption thatachieve a training loss below 0.1. Among these models effective dimensionality and path-norm aremost correlated with test loss, test error, and the generalization gap.
