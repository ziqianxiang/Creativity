The results in Table1 show the classification accuracy of the clean test data and the ASR of the adversarial examplesgenerated by FCRs attack on different models. Figure 3 shows the perturbations and adversarialexamples generated by the global attacks and FCRs attack. These are randomly selected from theexamples that can be successfully attacked. It can be seen that the FCRs attack not only generatesperturbations in the FCRs but also the adversarial examples are very close to the corresponding im-ages. However, the images of global attacks are distorted greatly. When we use the same constraintof the `2 distortion, we observe that the ASR of PGD is 74.33% and 56.50% on the two datasets;the ASR of C&W is 72.11% and 45.00%. In contrast, FCRs attack can still have powerful attackperformance when it only attacks the local semantics.

Obviously, our proposed method only destroys critical semantics andreduces image distortion. (Our constraint on the `2 norm of the three methods is 2 and 45.)
