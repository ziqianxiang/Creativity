Table 1: Hyperparameters used to train the neural networks and their errors on the unmodifiedCIFAR-10 datasetResNet18: We use a modification of ResNet18 He et al. (2016) adapted to CIFAR-10 image sizes.
Table 2: ImageNet classifiers are calibrated with respect to dogs: All classifiers predict terrier forroughly ã€œ22% of all dogs (last row), though they may mistake which specific dogs are terriers.
