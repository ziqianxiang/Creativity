Table 1: RMSEs for all the users (All), query users (Query) and new users (New) in different datasets.
Table 2: RMSEs (resp. AUCs) Table 3: RMSEs onon query users in ML-10M (resp. cold-start users in ML-Amazon-Books).	1M using features.
Table 4: Statistics of five datasets used in our experiments. Amazon-Books dataset has implicit userfeedbacks while other four datasets have explicit feedbacks. Explicit feedbacks mean user’s ratingvalues range within [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and implicit feedbacks mean we only know whether a user has ratedon an item or not. f A dataset has both user/item features, only user or item features, or no feature.
Table 5: RMSEs on all the users (ALL), query users (Query) and new users (New) of IRCF-NN inMovielens-1M using different configurations for support and query users. The results calibrate withIRCF-NN in Table 1 where we consider threshold split with δ = 30 in ML-1M.
