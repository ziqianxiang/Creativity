Table 1: Architectures of the neural networks used in the experiment section for the high-level valueand prior. For each convolutional layer we report kernel size, number of filters and stride. LN standsfor Layer normalization, FC for fully connected,. All convolutions are preceded by a 1 pixel zeropadding.
