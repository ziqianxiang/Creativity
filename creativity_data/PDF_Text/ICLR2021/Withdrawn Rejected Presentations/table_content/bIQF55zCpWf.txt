Table 1: Classification errors (%) of compared methods on CIFAR-10 dataset without data augmen-tation. The results of our Pani methods are the average ones under 4 runs.
Table 2: Test error in comparison with ERM, MixUp and Pani MixUp (input) across three deep neu-ral network architectures with and without data augmentation. All results are the average ones under5 runs. Results of MixUp on the settings without data augmentation are based on our implementationon the original code from MixUp.
Table 3: Performance of our Pani MixMatch in semi-supervised setting on CIFAR with 4000 labels. The reportedresult of MixMatch(ours) and Pani MixMatch is under thesame random seed, coming from the median of last 20 epochwhile training. The results of MixMatch(ours) and PaniMixMatch are the average ones under 4 runs.
