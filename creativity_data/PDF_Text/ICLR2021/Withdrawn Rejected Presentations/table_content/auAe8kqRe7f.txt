Table 1: Results of CIFAR-10 compared to other methods. Results of TRADES, Fast and Free areproduced with their open source code. Scores of (AT+) SAD that are better than other methods arehighlighted.
Table 2: Results of CIFAR-100 compared to baseline methods. Scores of (AT+) SAD that are betterthan other methods are highlighted.
Table 3: Results of Black-Box Attacks. OnePixel means one pixel attack, ZOO means ZOO attack,and WRN means the adversarial samples are generated by WideResNet-32-10.
Table 4: Effect of hybridization ratio on CIFAR-100 WRN-32-10.
Table 5: Result of SAD without updating statistics of BN on CIFAR10 with ResNet-18.
