Table 1: Comparisons on the BFM dataset. We report SIDE andMAD errors. ‘Symmetry’ indicates whether the symmetry assump-tion on object shape is used. We outperform others on both metrics.
Table 2: Effects of different shape prior. We report results of the original ellipsoid shape, asym-metric shape with ellipsoid for the left half and sphere for the right half, shape with its positionshifted by 1/6 and 1/4 image width, weaker shape prior whose height is half of the original one, andno shape prior. Qualitative results can be found in Fig.14 in the Appendix.
Table 3: Identity-preserving face rotation. Wecompare with HoloGAN, GANSpace, and SeFa.
Table 4: Effects of dataset size. We report quantitative results on the BFM dataset with differentnumber of training samples.
Table 5: Network architecture for view-point net V and lighting net L. The outputchannel size cout is 6 for V and 4 for L.
Table 6: Network architecture for depth net D andalbedo net A. cout is 1 for D and 3 for A.

For 642 Table 8: Network architecture for theresolution input, the last ResBlock is removed and ResBlock(cin, cout) in Tab.7. The output ofthe following channels are cut down by a half. Residual path and Identity path are added as---------------------------------------------- the final output.
