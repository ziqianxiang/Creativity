Table 1: Difference in entropy vs. a Random policy(SMiRL*=SMiRL-Random and RND*=RND-Random,Relative=RND*+SMiRL*). More negative values in-dicate more unstable environments. Note the negativerelative entropy gap on our tasks and for Assault andSpaceInvaders.
Table 2: Estimated entropies for three of our tasks, and an example Atari games studied by Burda et al.
