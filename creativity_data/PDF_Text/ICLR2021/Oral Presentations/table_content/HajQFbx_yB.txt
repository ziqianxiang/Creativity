Table 1: Algorithm complexities for several DPP models. Our model and the symmetric DPP model(Gartrell et al., 2017) can perform both tasks in time linear in the size of ground set M, but ours is amore general model that can capture positive as well as negative item correlations.
Table 2: Average MPR, AUC, and test log-likelihood for all datasets, for the low-rank symmetricDPP (Gartrell et al., 2017), low-rank NDPP (Gartrell et al., 2019), and our scalable NDPP models.
Table 3: Average relative error and 95% confidence intervals of MAP inference algorithms onNDPPs learned from real-world datasets. For all datasets, we evaluate 10 kernels learned withdifferent initializations, and run 100 random trials for stochastic greedy (Mirzasoleiman et al., 2015)and MCMC sampling (Li et al., 2016). All errors are relative to greedy local search (Kathuria &Deshpande, 2016).
