Table 1: Our estimator (GR-MCK) facilitates training at lower temperatures with improved perfor-mance on the latent parse tree task. Best test classification accuracy on the ListOps dataset selectedon the validation set. Best estimator at given temperature in bold, best estimator across temperaturesin italics. Higher is better.
Table 2: Our estimator (GR-MCK) outperforms other straight-through estimators for discrete-latent-space VAE objectives on the MNIST dataset and is competitive with the Gumbel-Softmax (GS)at large arities. Best bound on the test negative log-likelihood selected on the validation set. Beststraight-through estimator in bold, best estimator in italics. Lower is better.
