Table 1: The model hyperparameters, model footprint, and 5-scale Mean Opinion Score (MOS) with95% confidence intervals for WaveNet, ClariNet, WaveFlow, WaveGlow and the proposed DiffWaveon the neural Vocoding task. ↑ means the number is the higher the better, and ] means the number isthe lower the better.
Table 2: The automatic evaluation metrics (FID, IS, mIS, AM, and NDB/K), and 5-scale MOS with95% confidence intervals for WaveNet, WaveGAN, and DiffWave on the unconditional generationtask. ↑ means the number is the higher the better, and ] means the number is the lower the better.
