Table 1: Number of parameters transmitted relative to one round of FedAvg to reach target testaccuracy for moderate and large number of devices in IID and Dirichlet .3 settings. SCAFFOLDcommunicates the current model and its associated gradient per round, while others communicateonly the current model. As such number of rounds for SCAFFOLD is one half of those reported.
Table 2: Number of parameters transmitted relative to one round of FedAvg to reach target testaccuracy for 100% and 10% participation regimes in the IID, non-IID settings. SCAFFOLD commu-nicates the current model and its associated gradient per round, while others communicate only thecurrent model. As such number of rounds for SCAFFOLD is one half of those reported.
