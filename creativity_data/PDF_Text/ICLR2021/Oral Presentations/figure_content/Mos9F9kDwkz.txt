Figure 1: Examples of First-Order Logical Queries using existential quantification (∃), conjunction(∧), and disjunction (∨) operators — their dependency graphs are D J P J {t1,t2}, and D JA J {Oscar, Emmty}, respectively.
Figure 2: Query structures considered in our experiments, as proposed by Ren et al. (2020) - thenaming of each query structure corresponds to projection (p), intersection (i), and union (u), andreflects how they were implemented in the Query2Box model (Ren et al., 2020). An example of aPi query is ?T : ∃V.p(a, V), q(V, T),r(b, T), where a and b are anchor nodes, V is a variable node,and T is the query target node.
