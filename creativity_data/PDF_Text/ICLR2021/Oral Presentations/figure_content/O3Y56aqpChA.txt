Figure 1: Problem setup. In the representation learning phase (left), the learner has access to alarge labeled “base dataset” in the source domain, and some unlabeled data in the target domain, onwhich to pre-train its representation. The learner must then rapidly learn/adapt to few-shot tasks inthe target domain in the evaluation phase (right).
