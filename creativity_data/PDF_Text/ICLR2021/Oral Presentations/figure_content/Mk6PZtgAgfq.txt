Figure 1: Our estimator (GR-MCK) effectively reduces the variance over the entire simplex and isparticularly effective at low temperatures. Contours for the quadratic programme in three dimensions(1a) and difference in log10-trace of the covariance matrix between ST-GS and GR-MC1000 atdifferent temperatures (1b, 1c, 1d). Warmer means difference is larger.
Figure 2: Our estimator (GR-MCK) effectively reduces the variance over the entire training trajectory(2a), achieves a lower mean squared error at a lower temperature (2b) and converges faster than STand ST-GS on the discrete VAE objective (2c). Log10-trace of the covariance matrix over a trainingtrajectory (2a) and log10-MSE (2b) at different temperatures during training, average number ofiterations and standard error to reach various thresholds of the objective on the validation set (2c).
