Figure 1: Statistics of Natural Transitions. Thehistograms show distributions over transitions ofsegmented object masks from natural videos forhorizontal and vertical position as well as objectsize. The red lines indicate fits of generalizedLaplace distributions (Eq. 2) with shape valueα. Data shown is for object masks extractedfrom YouTube videos. See Appendix G for 2Dmarginals and corresponding analysis from theKITTI self-driving car dataset.

Figure 3: SlowVAE illustration. The priorand posterior for a two-dimensional latentspace. Left to right: Normal prior for t - 1,posterior for t - 1, conditional Laplace priorfor t, and posterior for t. The blue cross inthe right three plots indicates the mean of theposterior for t - 1.
Figure 4: KITTI Masks (mean(∆t) = 0.15s). (Left) MCC correlation matrix of the top 3 latentscorresponding to y-position, x-position and scale. (Right) Images produced by varying the SlowVAElatent unit that corresponds to the corresponding row in the MCC matrix.
Figure 5: DSprites Latent Representations: (Top) shows absolute MCC between generative andmodel factors (rows are rearranged for maximal correlation on the main diagonal). The columnscorrespond to generative factors (shape, scale, rotation, x/y-position) and the values correspond topercent correlation. A more diagonal structure in the upper half corresponds to a better one-to-onemapping between generative and latent factors. (Bottom) shows individual latent dimensions (y-axis)over the matched generative factors (x-axis). Colors encode shapes: heart/yellow, ellipse/turquoise,and square/purple.

Figure 8: Number of changing factors in LAP dataset. For each dataset we sample 10,000transitions and record the number of changing factors. These are indicated in the histograms. λ = 1,see Appendix D.
Figure 9: KITTI Masks. Each row corresponds to sequential frames from random sequences inthe KITTI Mssks dataset. Above each image we denote measured object properties where x, ycorrespond the center of mass position and ar corresponds to the area.

Figure 11: Statistics of Natural Transitions. Left) Distribution over transitions for horizontal (∆x)and vertical (∆y) position as well as mask/object size (∆area) for both datasets. Orange linesindicate fits of generalized Laplace distributions (Eq. 2). Right) 2D marginal distribution over pairsof factor transitions (blue) and permuted pairs (orange) that indicate the marginal distributions whenmade independent.
Figure 12: KITTI Masks Latent Representations. We show axis latent traversals along eachdimension for the β-VAE (top) and SlowVAE (bottom). Here, the latents zi are sorted from topto bottom in ascending order according to the mean variance output of the encoder. With MCCcorrelation (see e.g. Fig. 20) the known ground truth factors are matched as following: β-VAE:Scale〜z2, X-Position〜zι and y-position〜z3; SloWVAE: Scale〜zo, X-Position〜zι and y-POSitiOn〜z3. With these latent visualizations alone, there is no significant difference visible betweenβ-VAE and SloWVAE. HoWever, We see a quantitative difference With the MCC score (see Table 2)and a qualitative difference when directly observing latent embeddings (see Fig. 20).

Figure 14: KITTI Masks Sparseness. We show the sparseness over time of the transitions forhorizontal (∆x), vertical (∆y) as well as mask/object size (∆area) in KITTI Masks by plotting the αof a generalized Laplace fit for different mean(∆t) (top). To display the quality of the fits, we showtwo exemplary fits at mean(∆t) = 0.63 (bottom-left) and mean(∆t) = 1.02 (bottom-right).
