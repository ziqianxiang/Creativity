Figure 1: Training a classifier from few-shot features makes the classifier overfit to the few examples (Left).
Figure 2: t-SNE visualization of our distribution estimation. Different colors represent different classes. ’★’represents support set features, 'x' in figure (d) represents query set features, ‘▲' in figure (b)(c) representsgenerated features.
Figure 3: Left: Accuracy when increasing the power in Tukey's transformation when training with (red) orwithout (blue) the generated features. Right: Accuracy when increasing the number of generated features withthe features are transformed by Tukey,s transformation (red) and without Tukey,s transformation (blue).
Figure 4: The effect of different values of k.
Figure 5: The effect of different values of α.
Figure 6: We show the feature distribution of 5 base classes, and the feature distribution of 5 novel classesbefore/after Tukey's Transformation.
