Figure 1: The negative log-likelihood of the training set for Gartrell et al. (2019)’s NDPP (blue,dashed) and our scalable NDPP (red, solid) versus wall-clock time for the (a) Amazon: 3-categoryand (b) UK Retail datasets.
Figure 2: Approximation ratios of greedy with respect to different values of log(σmɑχ∕σma) fromCorollary 1 under (a) symmetric DPP and (b) nonsymmetric DPP. (c) The singular values of thekernels learned for the “Amazon: 3-category” dataset. We construct 10,000 random P0 matricesL ∈ R5×5, with rank K = 3, whose singular values are from the learned kernels.
