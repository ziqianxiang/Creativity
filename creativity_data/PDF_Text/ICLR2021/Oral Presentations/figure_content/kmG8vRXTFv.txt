Figure 1: Predicted dynamics for the damped pendulum vs. ground truth (GT) trajectories d2θ/dt2 +ω0 sin θ + αdθ∕dt = 0. We show that in (a) the data-driven approach (Chen et al., 2018) fails toproperly learn the dynamics due to the lack of training data, while in (b) an ideal pendulum cannottake friction into account. The proposed APHYNITY shown in (c) augments the over-simplifiedphysical model in (b) with a data-driven component. APHYNITY improves both forecasting (MSE)and parameter identification (Error T0) compared to (b).
Figure 2: Comparison of predictions of two components u (top) and v (bottom) of the reaction-diffusion system. Note that t = 4 is largely beyond the dataset horizon (t = 2.5).
Figure 3: Comparison between the prediction of APHYNITY when c is estimated and Neural ODEfor the damped wave equation. Note that t + 32, last column for (a, b, c) is already beyond thetraining time horizon (t + 25), showing the consistency of APHYNITY method.
Figure 4: Diffusion predictions using coefficient learned with (a) incomplete physical model ParamPDE (a, b) and (b) APHYNITY-augmented Param PDE(a, b), compared with the (c) true diffusion5 ConclusionIn this work, we introduce the APHYNITY framework that can efficiently augment approximatephysical models with deep data-driven networks, performing similarly to models for which theunderlying dynamics are entirely known. We exhibit the superiority of APHYNITY over data-driven,incomplete physics, and state-of-the-art approaches combining ML and MB methods, both in termsof forecasting and parameter identification on three various classes of physical systems. Besides,APHYNITY is flexible enough to adapt to different approximation levels of prior physical knowledge.
