Figure 1: An estimation of the eigenvalues of Σ∞ using two-layer ReLU networks with a width ofM = 2 × 104. The number of uniformly randomly generated samples on the unit sphere is n = 104and the dimensionality of the input space is d ∈ {5, 10, 100}.
Figure 2: Top: Estimation of kΣ-rgρkL2(ρX) (r ∈ [0.5, 1]) for integral operators Σ ∈{Σa,∞ , Σb,∞ , Σ∞} of two-layer ReLU networks. Bayes rules gρ are set to the average eigen-functions of Σa,∞ (left), Σb,∞ (middle), and Σ∞ (right). Bottom: Learning curves of test errors forAlgorithm 1 with two-layer swish networks.
