Figure 1: Meta-learning 1D-regression: The parameters of a 1D regression model are fitted from asmall support set. The training distributions (P1, P2, P3) give a useful inductive bias for fitting P4using only 5 points. The MLE solution on the novel task for those 5 points is also displayed.
Figure 2: The expected error rate of the hierarchical MAP estimator, GM +1, over different environ-ment hyperparameter settings. A) The novel task observation noise is increased, making the noveltask harder to learn. B) We increase the size of the dataset, in one case adding new tasks (M) and inthe other adding new novel task data samples (k).
