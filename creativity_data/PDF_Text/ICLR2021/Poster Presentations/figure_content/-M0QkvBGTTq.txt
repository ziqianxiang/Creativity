Figure 1: Problem of randomly selecting image patch and mixing labels according to it. When theselected source patch does not represent the source object, the interpolated label misleads the modelto learn unexpected feature representation.
Figure 2: The proposed SaliencyMix data augmentation. We first extract the saliency map of thesource image that highlights the regions of interest. Then we select a patch around the peak salientpixel location and mix it with the target image.
Figure 3: The effect of using different saliency detection methods in the proposed data augmentationon (a) CIFAR10 and (b) Tiny-ImageNet classification tasks. Different ways of selection and mixingof the source patch with the target image and their effects on (c) CIFAR 10 and (d) Tiny-ImageNetclassification tasks. Performance is reported from the average of five and three runs for CIFAR10and Tiny-ImageNet, respectively.
Figure 4: Class activation map (CAM) for models that are trained with various data augmentationtechniques. The images are randomly taken from ImageNet (Olga et al., 2015) validation set.
