Figure 1: Dynamics of a bouncing ball can be recovered by a Neural Event ODE. Meanwhile, anon-linear Neural ODE has trouble modeling sudden changes and performs poorly at extrapolation.
Figure 2: We learn continuous switching linear dynamical systems with Neural Event ODE to modeland predict the trajectory of a particle traveling on a loop with discontinuous changes in dynamics.
Figure 3: Test-set motion predictions of two bouncing balls with collisions. The dashed black circleindicates the initial positions of the balls and the solid black circle indicates the final positions. TheNeural Event ODE model is able to recover realistic event and state updates that exhibit floatingbehavior (a-c) and straighter paths (d-e) than a RNN baseline. (c) shows a failure mode of the RNNand Neural Event ODE models where the first collision is not correctly predicted.
