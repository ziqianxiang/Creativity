Figure 1: (a) The relationship between prediction uncertainty and expected calibration error (ECE). In alldatasets, as the unCertainty of the seleCted pseudo-labels deCreases, the ECE of that seleCted subset deCreases.
Figure 2: Robustness to uncertainty threshold. Thresh-olds below 0.1 lead to similar test error on CIFAR-10(1000 labels), showing that UPS is not reliant on asingle threshold.
Figure 3: (a) The distribution of correct and incorrect pseudo-labels with respect to the confidence on a 1000sample CIFAR-10 validation set. (b) The distribution of correct and incorrect pseudo-labels with respect to theuncertainty on a 1000 sample CIFAR-10 validation set. (c) The distribution of correct and incorrect pseudo-labelswith respect to the confidence on the set of unlabeled samples. (d) The distribution of correct and incorrectpseudo-labels with respect to the uncertainty on the set of unlabeled samples. Both the full unlabeled set and thesmall validation have similar skewed confidence and uncertainty distributions.
Figure 4: CIFAR-10 samples with incorrect high confidence predictions, that are filtered out by UPS whenprediction uncertainty is leveraged.
