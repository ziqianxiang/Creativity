Figure 1: The IOT framework. Pred means the light predictor introduced in 3.1 for order selection.
Figure 2: BLEU scores of three subsets (divided by predicted decoder) on all decoders.
Figure 3: Comparison of training/validation loss curves along the model training on IWSLT De→Entranslation. ‘IOT’ is IOT (N = 3) and ‘Baseline’ is Transformer. Figure 3(c) is the same curve as3(b), except the value of y-axis in Figure 3(c) is between 3.9-4.1, while 4.9-9.0 for Figure 3(b).
Figure 4: Comparison of validation/test BLEU curves along the model training on IWSLT De→Entranslation. ‘IOT’ is IOT (N = 3) and ‘Baseline’ is Transformer. Figure 4(c) is the same curve as4(b), except the value of y-axis in Figure 4(c) is between 33-36, while 0-36 for Figure 4(b).
