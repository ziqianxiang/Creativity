Figure 1: Various estimates and bounds for ENoise relative to ENoise for PZ = U(Sp-1), usingVar(y |z) = 1 and P = 30. The optimized curves correspond to multi-layer NN feature maps whoseparameters were trained to minimize ENoise for n = 15 or n = 60. More experiments and detailson the setup can be found in Appendix C. We do not plot estimates for n âˆˆ {28, . . . , 32} since theyhave high estimation variances.
