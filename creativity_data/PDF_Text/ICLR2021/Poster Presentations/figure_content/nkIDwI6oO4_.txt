Figure 1:	Convergence curves on the ablation study of Twin-L2O design options.
Figure 2:	Convergence comparison of variable x between Twin-L2O and state-of-the-art analyticalminimax optimizers (GDA, OMD, GD-Anchoring, and K-beam), for three test problems. For resultsof y variable, please see the Appendix A2.
Figure 3: Evaluation of Safe-Twin-L2O.
Figure A4: Architecture of Twin-L2O. We let LSTM-Min and LSTM-Max, parameterized by φminand φmax , update x and y respectively. As shown by curved dashed lines, Twin-LSTM keeps beingupdated about the latest variable values of x and y when computing input information and the reward.
