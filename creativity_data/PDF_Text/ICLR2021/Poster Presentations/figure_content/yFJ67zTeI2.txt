Figure 1: Our semi-supervised keypoint localization system learns a list of heatmaps and a listof semantic keypoint representations for each image. In addition to a supervised loss optimizedon the labeled subset of the data, we propose several unsupervised constraints of transformationequivariance, transformation invariance, and semantic consistency.
Figure 2: Semantic consistency criteria. Keypoint representation is defined for each keypoint bymultiplying a corresponding predicted heatmap hi with intermediate features F . Keypoint repre-sentations are classified with a shared network Ï† and the feedback is added to the total loss.
