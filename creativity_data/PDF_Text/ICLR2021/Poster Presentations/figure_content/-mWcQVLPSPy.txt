Figure 1: t-SNE (Maaten & Hinton, 2008) of the prototypes produced by IPN on AWA2. Blue/redpoints represent unseen/seen classes.
Figure 2: LEFT: The pipeline of IPN. First, we initialize the visual and semantic prototypes fromseen classes’s data and class attributes. Then, prototype propagation in each space can be per-formed over multiple steps. Finally, the concatenated prototypes form the support set of a distancebased classifier. RIGHT: Isometric propagation. we propagate prototypes of each class to otherconnected classes on the graph using attention module. The attention score is regularized to beisometric.
Figure 3: Ablation study of IPN on AWA2 (generalized ZSL setting). “S”, “U” and "H” are thesame notations used in Table 2. (a) Only one of the dual prototypes are used to generate classifiers.
