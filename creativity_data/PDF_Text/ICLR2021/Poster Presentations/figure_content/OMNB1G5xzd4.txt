Figure 1: Performance of MBOP on various RLU and D4RL datasets. For each of the above taskswe have sub-sampled subsets of the original dataset to obtain the desired number of data points. Thesubsets are the same throughout the paper. The box plots describe the first quartile of the dataset,with the whiskers extending out to the full distribution, with outliers plotted individually, using thestandard Seaborn (more info here).
Figure 2: The above figures describe performance of MBOP on constrained & goal-conditioned tasks. Fig.
