Figure 1: Layer-wise unsupervised STS performance on the STS-b test set. X-axis denotes the layersof the depicted model and the Y-axis denotes the Spearman correlation (x100). Color is a redundantindicator of the Spearman correlation and the value 50 is included for visual comparison.
Figure 2: Layer-Wise STS performance on the STS-b test set throughout training with CT. X-axisdepicts the layers of the model, Y-Axis depicts the Spearman correlation (x100) and the Z-Axisdepicts the progression of time. Color is a redundant indicator of the Spearman correlation.
Figure 3: Predicted similarities for sentence pairs in the STS-b training set. Sentence pairs arechunked into 20 buckets by their labels, each bucket covering a label range of 0.25. Opaque linedenotes the mean and the transparent area denotes the standard deviation.
Figure 4: CT follows an architecture similar to a siamese network, but with independent models.
Figure 5: Layer-wise unsupervised STS performance on the STS-b test set. X-axis denotes the layersof the depicted model and the Y-axis denotes the Spearman correlation (x100). Color is a redundantindicator of the Spearman correlation and the value 50 is included for visual comparison.
Figure 6: Layer-wise unsupervised STS performance on the STS-b test set. X-axis denotes the layersof the depicted model and the Y-axis denotes the Spearman correlation (x100). Color is a redundantindicator of the Spearman correlation and the value 50 is included for visual comparison.
