Figure 1: Comparison of different anchor-free object detection methods. Red dots denote positivekeypoints and grey dots denote negative keypoints.
Figure 2: (a) and (b) show the comparison of Cartesian coordinates and Polar coordinates. (c) and (d)show the heatmap of learned offsets in training FCOS and PolarNet. In (c), the majority of keypointslearned by FCOS have large scale variance, indicating the necessity to suppress the poor qualitykeypoints during training. In (d), the scale variance of keypoints in PolarNet is much smaller thanFCOS, and thus more high quality keypoints can be learned during training.
Figure 3: The architecture of our PolarNet detector. Following the CNN backbone, we also applythe Feature Pyramid Network (FPN). The objectness prediction module is a pixel-wise prediction topredict the likelihood of a relevant object in the location of the pixel. Each keypoint is represented bypolar coordinates which points to corners. The optimal coordinates are selected for training and thefeatures of corners are also used for training detectors.
Figure 4: (a), (b) and (c) show the comparison of three keypoints selection strategies. The model istrained on COCO train2017 and tested on COCO val2017. All the models are based on ResNet-50without corner feature enhancement.
Figure 5: (a) shows the heatmap of CenteSample, and (b)-(f) show the heatmaps of AutoSamplebased on different Î³ .
