Figure 1: Empirical evidence towards the compu-tational benefits of our method we present train-ing wall time analysis on the SST-2 dataset. Eachmethod includes a violin plot for 10 random runs.
Figure 2: We show the results of our method against Standard++ fine-tuning and SMART across 3tasks. Across 10 random seeds both max and median of our runs were higher using our method thanboth SMART and Standard++.
Figure 3: Results from our probing experiments comparing our proposed algorithms R3F, R4F tostandard fine-tuning. Variants of our method consistently outperform past work.
Figure 4: We show the results of the chained prob-ing experiments. We do not show the distribu-tional properties of the runs because there wasminimal variance in the results.
Figure 5: We present the results of cyclical sequential probing for 3 cycles.
