Figure 1: VIBERT compresses the encoder's sentence representation fφ(χ) into representation Z with meanμ(χ) and eliminates irrelevant and redundant information through the Gaussian noise with variance Σ(χ).
Figure 2: Expected test performance (solid lines) with standard deviation (shaded region) over the numberof random seeds allocated for fine-tuning. Our VIBERT model consistently outperforms BERT. We reportthe accuracy for RTE and MRPC and the Pearson correlation coefficient for STS-B.
Figure 3: Validation and training losses of VIBERT for varying β and a fixed bottleneck size on GLUE.
