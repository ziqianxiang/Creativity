Figure 1: Our classification pipeline described synthetically to explain how we build the representationΦ(x) of an input image x.
Figure 2: An example of whitened dictionary D with patch size P = 6 from ImageNet-128 (Left),ImageNet-64 (Middle), CIFAR-10 (Right). The atoms have been reordered via a topographicalgorithm from Montobbio et al. (2019) and contrast adjusted.
Figure 4: (Top) Spectrum of Σ1/2 on CIFAR-10 (top-left) and ImageNet-64 (top-right) using smallpatch sizes in dark-brown to larger patch sizes in light-brown. Covariance dimension (bottom-left)and nearest neighbor dimension (bottom right) as a function of the extrinsic dimension of the patches.
Figure 5: CIFAR-10 ablation experiments, train accuracies in blue, test accuracies in red.
