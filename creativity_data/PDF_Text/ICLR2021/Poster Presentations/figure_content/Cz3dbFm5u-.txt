Figure 1: (a) The secure inference scheme of CNN-7 on CIFAR-10. (b) Latency breakdown underactivation approximation at a minimum of 84.5% accuracy. XL(Y %) means X -layer activation orY %-channel activation are approximated, e.g. 4L(32%) means 4-layer activation is approximatedwhich equals 32% activation channels are approximated in the network.
Figure 3: The overview of SAFENet working scheme. SAFENet is used to search optimal αtand βt to get best score in the training. αt decides the approximation channels in the t-th layer,βt ∈ {0, 2, 3} is the polynomial degree in the Approx() function.
