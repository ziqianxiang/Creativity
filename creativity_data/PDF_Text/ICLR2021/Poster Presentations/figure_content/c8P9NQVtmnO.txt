PCANN: an operator method using PCA as an autoencoderon both the input and output data and interpolating the latent spaces with a neural network (Bhat-tacharya et al., 2020). GNO: the original graph neural operator (Li et al., 2020b). MGNO: themultipole graph neural operator (Li et al., 2020a). LNO: a neural operator method based on thelow-rank decomposition of the kernel κ(x, y) := jr=1 φj (x)ψj (y), similar to the unstacked Deep-ONet proposed in (Lu et al., 2019). FNO: the newly purposed Fourier neural operator.
