Figure 2: Scheme showing the important variables for the decoding step.
Figure 3: Bijection between learned statespace Sbh and the statemaps every state in Sh to aunique state in Sh . However Shspace at time step h. The bijectionalso contains learned states that do notcorrespond to a reachable state at this time step. This happens due to error in the decoder.
