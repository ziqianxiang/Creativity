Figure 1: Overview of our EM-like evolution-by-explanation algorithm. Left: climbing UP theenergy landscape J(θ,p(s)) by alternatively taking an E-step and M-step. Right: illustrations forthe E-step and M-step. In the E-step of time t, We draw samples from Q(P(S) ∣θt-1) to approximateQ(θ∣pt (S)) using rationales extracted from the seed molecules via an explainable model. Then in theM-step, we optimize Q(θ∣pt(S)) w.r.t. θ, i.e. pushing the graph completion model pθ(∙∣s) towardsgenerating higher scoring molecules conditioned on the rationale samples.

Figure 3: Property score distribution of the generated molecules. Left: the evolution of the f -scoredistribution of MolEvol over the number of iterations. Right: the distribution of four propertyscores of our generated molecules, the ground truth molecules in the reference set, and the moleculesin ChEMBL. The higher the better for JNK3∕GSK-3β∕QED, the lower the better for SA.
