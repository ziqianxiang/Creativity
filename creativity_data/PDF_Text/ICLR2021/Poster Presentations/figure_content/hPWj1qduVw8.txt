Figure 1: Sequential reasoning approaches fail to detect long-distance dependencies between the current turnand the 2nd turn. Graph-based reasoning approaches signals from all turns are directly forwarded to the currentturn but the 1st and 3rd contain little lexical overlap to the current question.
Figure 2: An overview of our PDC method.
Figure 3: Example outputs of reasoning paths and dialogue responses. We demonstrate 4 cases of reasoningpaths with 2 to 3 hops and with varied distances between two ends of the reasoning path.
