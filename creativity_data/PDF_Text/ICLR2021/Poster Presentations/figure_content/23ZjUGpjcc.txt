Figure 1: Transfer Learning with Per-Task Routing of Experts. Step 1. A single baseline model Bis trained on the entire upstream dataset. Step 2. The upstream data is divided in semantic subsets(possibly overlapping). One expert is trained on each subset using the weights from B as initialization.
Figure 2: Summary of results on the VTAB-Ik benchmark, combining experts with different architec-tures trained on two different data sources (JFT,ImageNet21k). In each of the 19 datasets, We usethe median accuracy over 30 runs. The average of the accuracies in each group is shown, as well as(percentile) bootstrap confidence intervals at the 95% level.
Figure 3: (a) ResNet with expert adapters before all blocks. A layer of experts is placed before everyblock. (b) Each individual adapter including the overall skip connection. N, A, C stand for (Group)Normalization, (ReLU) Activation, and Convolution layers, respectively.
