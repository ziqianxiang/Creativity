Figure 1: Schematic of the Latent-CCM rationale. If X[t] causes Y [t], there exists a continuousmap (dotted line) from the latent process of Y (HY ) to the latent process of X (HX).
Figure 2: Pearson correlation of the reconstructions in function of the proportion of data used forthe Latent-CCM. Solid line represent the mean over the 5 repeats and the shaded area the rangeof values. For both experiments, only the true causal directions show a convergent reconstruction.
Figure 3: Graphical model representation of both cases considered in the main body of the paper.
