Figure 1: Illustration of the effect of different training augmentations. While both style-based(Geirhos et al., 2019) and edge-based augmentation (this paper) reach the same validation accuracy,edge-based augmentation shows a stronger increase in shape bias as evidenced by lower accuracyon patch-shuffled images and higher rate of classifying according to the shape category for texture-shape cue conflicts. Nevertheless, only style-based augmentation shows a considerable improvementagainst common corruptions such as Gaussian blur. This challenges the hypothesis that increasedshape bias causes improved robustness to corruption.
Figure 2: Overview of content and stylization variants used in this paper: Content is a natural image(IN) or an edge map (E). Content is stylized in three different ways: No stylization, style transferwith Painter by Numbers as style source as proposed in Geirhos et al. (2019) (SIN and SE),style transfer with a different in-distribution image as style source (I-SIN and I-SE). Additionally,we show a superposition (SE+IN) between natural (IN) and stylized edge image (SE).
