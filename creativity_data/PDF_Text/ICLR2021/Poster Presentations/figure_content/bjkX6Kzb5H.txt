Figure 1: Left: Proposed pipeline (blue) and challenges (red). Multiple LFs noisily label data; alabel model (LM) then aggregates the LF labels into weak labels that can be used to train a CNN. Twokey challenges: how to build LFs that inject knowledge and how to correctly model LF accuracies.
Figure 2: Example latent variable models. (a) A simple PGM with one latent variable Y and severalobserved labeling functions Î»i . (b) Conventional segmentation grid. (c) The PGM used in this work,where all nodes in a grid of latent variables are weakly labeled by labeling functions.
Figure 3: Details of proposed workflow. In Step 1, each manually-annotated image is used to train aone-shot model, which in turn produces a noisy label for all unlabeled training images. In Step 2, theoutputs from the FSL LFs are aggregated via a PGM, the parameters of which are learned withoutaccess to any ground truth labels . In Step 3, the PGM outputs are used to train an end model.
Figure 4: Example results. The left of each pair is the ground truth, the right of each pair is producedby the proposed method. Left: orange is endocardium, pink is myocardium, yellow is right ventricle.
Figure 5: Comparisons for different amounts of unlabeled data (left) and image crops (right).
