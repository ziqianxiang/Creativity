Figure 1: Evolution of E(V*) - E(Vt) as a function of training time, for experiments (a) and (b) as describedin the main text. Different lines correspond to different random initializations of reward function and learningmodel. We see that the training error decreases monotonically (but with different rates) during trainig.
