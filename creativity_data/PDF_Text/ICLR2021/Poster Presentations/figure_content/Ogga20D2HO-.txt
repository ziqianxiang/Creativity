Figure 1: Brief comparisons of Mixup strategies in FL and MAFL. (a) Global Mixup: Raw data is exchangedand directly used for Mixup between local and received data, which violates privacy. (b) Local Mixup: Mixupis only applied within clientâ€™s local data. (c) NaiveMix: Under MAFL, Mixup is performed between local dataand received averaged data. (d) FedMix: Under MAFL, our novel algorithm approximates Global Mixup usinginput derivatives and averaged data.
Figure 2: Learning curves for various algorithms on benchmark datasets. Learning curves correspondto results in Table 1. (For simplicity, we only show key algorithms to compare.)Table 1: Test accuracy after (target rounds) and number of rounds to reach (target test accu-racy) on various datasets. Algorithms in conjunction with FedProx are compared separately (bot-tom). MAFL-based algorithms are marked in bold.
