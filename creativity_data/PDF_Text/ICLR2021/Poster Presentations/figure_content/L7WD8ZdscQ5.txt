Figure 6: Convergence of the function value when T = 1000 and T = 5000Obviously, the minimum value of f on the unit ball is non-positive because f (0) = 0. It can beproved f (WT) ≥ 3og√τ. Set C = 2, the function value f (Wt) v.s. iteration is illustrated in Figure 6,where the step size of GD is √ct and the parameters of the constrained HB (7) (α = 8) and AdaHB(12) (α = 0.08, γ = 0.9, δ = 10-8) are selected according to Theorem 3 and Theorem 5. Asexpected, the individual convergence of HB is much faster than that of PSG. We thus conclude thatHB is an effective acceleration of GD in terms of the individual convergence.
