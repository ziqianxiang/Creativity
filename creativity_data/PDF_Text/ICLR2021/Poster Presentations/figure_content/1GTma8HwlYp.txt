Figure 1: Example gradient manipulation in the 2-D x - y plane with ATTITUD. ATTITUD canoperate in any n-dimensional subspace. Left: Primary task gradient gprim decomposed along the3 Dimensions x, y and z . Mid: Decomposed Auxiliary task gradient gaux . We label the x com-ponent of gaux as positive since it agrees (in direction) with the x component of gprim . Since they component of gaux is in the opposite direction as that of gprim , this is assigned a negative label.
Figure 2: Averaged across 5 random initializations. Left We vary the number of samples used toestimate a 5-d subspace up to a maximimum of 100 (the total number of training examples in thislow-resource setting). Right. We compare the effect of the dimensionality of the subspace in thelow-resource (50 examples each for Cat, Dog classes) and high-resource (1000 examples each perclass).
Figure 3: Experiment conducted on Cat-vr-Dog Cifar10 dataset. Left Averaged accuracy across 5seeds of different choices of basis. Our choice, randomized_svd performs best. Right We look atthe fraction of the norm of gaux within each subspace (dashed line). We also do so for a randomlysampled mini-batch of the primary task (solid line).
