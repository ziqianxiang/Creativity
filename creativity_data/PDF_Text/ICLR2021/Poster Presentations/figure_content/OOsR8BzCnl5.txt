Figure 1: Illustration of our algorithm. (a) The evidence of each view is obtained using neuralnetworks (①).The obtained evidence parameterizes the Dirichlet distribution (②)to induce theclassification probability and uncertainty (③).The overall uncertainty and classification probabilityare inferred by combining the beliefs of multiple views based on the DST (④).The combinationrule and an example are shown in Definition 4 and (b), respectively. Given two sets of beliefs (blueand green blocks), we recombine the compatible parts of the two sets (brown blocks) and ignore themutually exclusive parts (white blocks) of the two sets to obtain the combined beliefs.
