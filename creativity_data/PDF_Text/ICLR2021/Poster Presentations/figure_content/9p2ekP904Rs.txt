Figure 1: (a) Causal graph formalizing assumptions about content and style of the data and therelationship between targets and proxy tasks. The dashed arrows are not causal and represent learning,while the dashdotted lines denote that Y R is a refinement Yt â€™s. All other arrows are causal. (b)ReLIC objective. KL refers to the Kullback-Leibler divergence, while x-entropy denotes crossentropy.
