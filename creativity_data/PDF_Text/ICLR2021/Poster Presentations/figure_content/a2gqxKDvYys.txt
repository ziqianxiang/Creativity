Figure 2: Posterior-predictive check of prefix-sampling on the Blackbird data set. Possible futuresare sampled from the model after having observed a prefix x1:t. The state at the end of the pre-fix is inferred with a bootstrap particle filter. Each plot shows a kernel density estimate of thedistribution over the final location xT , once for the semi-conditioned model in green and for thefully-conditioned in blue. The true value is marked as a vertical, black line. The fully-conditionedmodel assigns higher likelihood in almost all cases and is more concentrated around the truth.
Figure 3: Left: Class distributions of the respective image distributions induced by a state-of-the-artclassifier. The data distribution is close to uniform, except for 5. The fully-conditioned model yieldstoo few 5â€™s and is close to uniform for the other digits. The partially-conditioned model only capturesthe right frequencies of 1 and 3. Right: Comparison of generative sampling on row-wise MNIST.
Figure 4: Comparison of prefix-sampling. Possible futures xk+1:T (coloured lines) are sampledfrom the model after having observed a prefix x1:k (solid black line) and then compared to the truesuffix xk+1:T (dashed line). The state at the end of the prefix is inferred with a bootstrap particlefilter. Left: UAV data, top-down view. Right: Traffic flow data, time-series view.
