Figure 1: An illustration of refinement us-ing DGflow, with the gradient flow in the2-Wasserstein space P2 (top) and the corre-sponding discretized SDE in the latent spaceZ (bottom). The image samples from thedensities along the gradient flow are shownin the middle.
Figure 2: Qualitative comparison of DGf low(KL) with DOT and DDLS on synthetic 2D datasets.
Figure 3: Improvement in the quality of samples generated fromthe base model (leftmost columns) over the steps of DGf low forSN-ResNet-GAN and SN-DCGAN on the CIFAR10 and STL10datasets respectively.
Figure 4: Qualitative comparison of DGflow with different f -divergences on the 25Gaussians and 2DSwissrolldatasets.
Figure 5: A vector plot showing the deterministic component of the velocity, i.e., the drift -Vxf 0(ρ0/μ)(x0),for different f -divergences on the 25Gaussians and 2DSwissroll dataset.
Figure 6: Latent space recovered byDGflow (right) for the 2D datasets is sameas the one derived by Che et al. (2020) (left).
