Figure 1: Heatmaps of the test statistic Tn (3.10) for a logistic regression classifier on a grid ofcoefficients (θ1, θ2). Individually fair classifier corresponds to θ1 close to 0 and any θ2. Black line ineach plot represents the null hypothesis rejection decision boundary Tn > 1.25. Blue color representsacceptance region, whereas the red corresponds to unfair coefficients regions. The true fair metricdiscounts any differences along the first coordinate (left); (center,right) are results with misspecifiedfair metric, i.e. discounting direction is rotated by 5。and 10。respectively.

We see that our test fails to reject SenSR, theclassifier we found individually fair, for any value of T verifying our Type I error guarantees in prac-tice. Rejection of the unfair classifiers requires sufficiently large T , supporting our recommendationfor Type II error control in practice.
Figure 3: Simulated data for synthetic experiment. We have two groups; group 1 being the minoritygroup. The features for these two groups differ mainly by first co-ordinate. So, the discountedmovement direction is (1, 0)T .
