Figure 1: Four steps of (non-parallel) MCTS, with simulation for molecular design.
Figure 2:	(a) parallel UCT using UCB1 (failed) (b) parallel UCT with virtual loss, and the searchpaths of three parallel workers shown in solid circles, (green, red, and blue, from left to right).
Figure 3:	Hash-driven parallel search distributes the nodes to workers based on a hash function. Thehome worker of the nodes are defined by the trailing 2 bits.
Figure 4: The trajectory of a message in (a) TDS-UCT (b) TDS-df-UCT and (c) MP-MCTS. TDS-df-UCT has the history table only in the messages and MP-MCTS stores it in the nodes also.
Figure 5: (a) Number of back-propagation (BP) messages received by each of 256 workers. (b)Box-whisker plot showing the depth of the search tree for different parallel MCTS variants.
Figure 6: Top molecules designed by MP-MCTS (a) Top 3 molecules with highest penalized logPscore. (b) Top 3 molecules with highest wavelength/nm property.
