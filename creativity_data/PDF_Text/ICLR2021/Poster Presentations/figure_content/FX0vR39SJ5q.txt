Figure 1: Schematic diagrams of (a) rank-1 ten-sor field H(I) with the number of features equal-ing 2 and (b) the simplest case of Gj；；： =δilδjk AijI(Xk ― Xl) = Aij (Xj - xi ).
Figure 2: (Top) the gradient field and (bottom) the error vector between the prediction and the groundtruth of a test data sample. The error vectors are exaggerated by a factor of 2 for clear visualization.
Figure 3: (Top) the temperature field of the ground truth and inference results and (bottom) the errorbetween the prediction and the ground truth of a test data sample. The error is exaggerated by afactor of 2 for clear visualization.
Figure 4: The ISOGCN model used for (a) the scalar field to the gradient field, (b) the scalar field tothe Hessian field, (c) the gradient field to the Laplacian field, (d) the gradient field to the Hessian fieldof the gradient operator dataset. The numbers in each box denote the number of units. Below theunit numbers, the activation function used for each layer is also shown. 0 denotes the multiplicationin the feature direction.
Figure 5: The process of generating the dataset. A smaller clscale parameter generates smallermeshes.
Figure 6: The IsoGCN model used for the anisotropic nonlinear heat equation dataset. The numbersin each box denote the number of units. Below the unit numbers, the activation function used foreach layer is also shown. 0 denotes multiplication in the feature direction, Θ denotes the contraction,and ㊉ denotes the addition in the feature direction.
Figure 7: Comparison between (left) samples in the training dataset, (center) ground truth computedthrough FEA, and (right) ISoGCN inference result. For both the ground truth and inference result,|V| = 1,011, 301. One can see that IsoGCN can predict the temperature field for a mesh, which ismuch larger than these in the training dataset.
