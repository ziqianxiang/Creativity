Figure 1: Experiments of OGDA and OMWU with different learning rates for a matrix gamef(x, y) = x> Gy. “OGDA/OMWU-eta=n” represents the curve of OGDA/OMWU with learningrate η. The configuration order in the legend is consistent with the order of the curves. For OMWU,η ≥ 11 makes the algorithm diverge. The plot confirms the linear convergence of OMWU andOGDA, although OGDA is generally observed to converge faster than OMWU.
Figure 2: Experiments of OGDA and OMWU with different learning rates on a matrix gamef(x, y) = x>Gy, where we generate G ∈ R32×32 with each entry Gij drawn uniformly at randomfrom [-1,1] and then rescale G's operator norm to 1. “OGDA/OMwU-eta=n"represents the curveof OGDA/OMWU with learning rate η. The configuration order in the legend is consistent with theorder of the curves. For OMwU, η ≥ 11 makes the algorithm diverge. The plot confirms the linearconvergence of OMwU and OGDA, although OGDA is generally observed to converge faster thanOMwU.
Figure 3: Experiments of OGDA on matrix games with curved regions where f (x, y) = x2y1 -x1y2, X = Y，{(a, b), 0 ≤ a ≤ 2,0 ≤ b ≤ 击,an ≤ b}, and n = 2, 4, 6, 8. This figure isa log-log plot of ∣∣zt - z*k versus t, and it indicates sublinear convergence rates of OGDA in allthese games.
Figure 4: Experiments on a strongly-convex-strongly-concave game where f(x, y) = x21 - y12 +2xιyι and X = Y，{(a, b), 0 ≤ a, b ≤ 1, a + b = 1}. The figure is showing ln ∣∣zt - /"versusthe time step t. The result shows that OGDA enjoys linear convergence and outperforms OMWUin this case.
Figure 5: Experiments of OGDA on a set of games satisfying SP-MS with β > 0, where f (x, y) =x21n - x1y1 - y12n for some integer n ≥ 2 and X = Y , {(a, b), 0 ≤ a, b ≤ 1, a + b = 1}. Theresult shows that OGDA converges to the Nash equilibrium with sublinear rates in these instances.
Figure 6: Experiments of OGDA and OMWU with different learning rates on a matrix game withmultiple Nash equilibria. "OGDA/OMWU-eta=n" represents the curve of OGDA/OMWU withlearning rate η. We observe from these plots that both OGDA and OMWU enjoy a linear con-vergence rate, even though we are only able to show the linear convergence of OMWU under theuniqueness assumption.
