Figure 1: The overall structure of HamNet.
Figure 2: Visualized conformations at different steps of the Hamiltonian Engine.
Figure 3: Effects on conformation prediction of hyperparameters in the Hamiltonian Engine. Dis-tance losses and running time versus (a) the engine depth T ; (b) the dimensionality of the general-ized space df; and (c) the step size Î· of discretization are plotted.
