Figure 1: Illustrative example of exact (L) and robust (R) alignments. The robust alignment can droppotential outliers and only match data points close to each other.
Figure 2: Unlabeled sensing. Results are the mean over 10runs. SNR= ∣∣wk2/pnoise is the signal-to-noise ratio.
Figure 3:compute yi = f ([xi , zi]; w) + εi . Next, we randomly permute the order of {zi} so that we losethe data correspondence. Here, D1 = {(xi, yi)} and D2 = {zj} mimic two parts of data collectedfrom two separate platforms. Since we are interested in the response on platform one, we treat alldata from platform two, i.e., D2, as well as 80% of data in D1 as the training data. The remainingdata from D1 are the test data. Notice that we have different number of data on D1 and D2, i.e., thecorrespondence is not exactly one-to-one.
