Figure 1: Histograms of MARS distances between pre-trained and pets dataset fine-tuned weights forthe specified regularisation strategies. MARS-PGM successfully constrains weight distances to beless than Î³j, indicated by the dashed line. Top: ResNet101, Bottom: EfficientNetB0.
Figure 2: Sensitivity of the regularisation methods to the choice of hyperparameters. Measurementsare taken on the pets dataset, and c is a factor applied to the hyperparameters found during tuning.
Figure 3: An empirical comparison of the tightness of our bounds on the Rademacher complexity, andthat of Long and Sedghi (2019). The (a) and (b) plots demonstrate the empirical value of the boundsas a function of the regularisation parameters: the vertical axes correspond to the model complexitiesfor each of the three measures considered, and the horizontal axes represents the regularisationstrength for '2-PGM (a) and MARS-PGM (b). The plot in (C) shows how the model complexitymeasures change throughout the training of an unregularised model, and (d) shows the training andtest set performance throughout training for the same unregularised model.
