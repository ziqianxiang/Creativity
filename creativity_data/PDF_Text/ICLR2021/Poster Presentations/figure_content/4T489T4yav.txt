Figure 1: Example segmentation function ζ(t) and warping functions γi (u). The shaded regions arepiecewise constant in γ1 and γ2 , respectively; γ3 is strictly increasing.
Figure 2: Three-parameter variant of the two-sided power distribution TSP(m, w, n) on the interval[0, 1]. Dashed lines denote the modes m, arrows the widths w; shaded regions have probability zero.

Figure 5: Classification performance on the insect stream benchmark of Souza et al. (2020).
Figure 6: Ablation study for TSPb hyperparameters (segmented Poisson regression); default valuesfor the fixed hyperparameters are: 2048 integer epochs, w = .5, and n = 16, respectively.
