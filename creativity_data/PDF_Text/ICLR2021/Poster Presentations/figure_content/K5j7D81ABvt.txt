Figure 1: An STEX Example: The OMDOC corresponds to the symbolic expression X ∙ 0 = 03	State of the ArtVarious papers over the last years have - explicitly or implicitly - attempted to extract formalinformation from informal documents using machine learning. These fall into two categories:Firstly, there are projects that attempt to fully formalize informal mathematical documents usingmachine learning techniques, using the surface language of some theorem prover system directlyas a target. In Kaliszyk et al. (2017a; 2015; 2014), the Flyspeck project (Hales et al., 2017) - theformalization of Kepler,s theorem - was used as a basis for a parallel dataset in order to translate frominformal mathematics to HOL Light (Harrison, 1996) syntax. Kaliszyk et al. (2017b); Wang et al.
