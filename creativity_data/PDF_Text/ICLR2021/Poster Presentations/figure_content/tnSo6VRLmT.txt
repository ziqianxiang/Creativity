Figure 1: A demonstration of our conformalized cascade for m-step inference with set-valued outputs,here on an IR for claim verification task. The number of considered articles is reduced at everylevel—red frames are filtered, while green frames pass on. We only care about retrieving at least oneof the admissible articles (starred) for resolving the claim.
Figure 2: Does calibrating using minimal admissible nonconformity scores (§4) improve predictiveefficiency? We show predictive efficiency and success rates as a function of . The efficiency ofthe min-calibrated CPs (both cascaded and non-cascaded) is significantly better (i.e., lower) thanstandard CP across all tasks, especially at critical values of . The min-calibrated CP’s accuracy hugsthe diagonal, allowing it to remain valid, but be far less conservative (resulting in better efficiency).
Figure 3: How effective is cascaded conformal prediction (§5) at pruning the candidate space?Incorporating early rejection via the CP cascade reduces the fraction of required p-value computations.
