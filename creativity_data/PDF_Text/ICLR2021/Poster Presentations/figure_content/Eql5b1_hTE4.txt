Figure 1: Illustration of robustness to the estimation result of noise rate. For each estimated noise rate,we report experimental results over five trials. The blue dots represent the result of each experiment.
Figure 2: Illustration of the experimental results on noisy CIFAR-100. We can clearly see that theproposed method (CDR) can reduce the side effect of noisy labels at the early training stage, whichimproves generalization (red line vs. green line).
Figure 3: Illustration of the experimental results on noisy MNIST. The noise rate is set to 20%.
