Figure 1: A clustering example of facial photos, which are ordered according to ages. Without anysupervision, the proposed algorithm can obtain meaningful clusters using identity features.
Figure 3: MORPH II images in setting A are divided into two clusters.
Figure 4: The balanced dataset is divided into three clusters, which are mostly composed of AFAD,UTK, and MORPH II images, respectively.
