Figure 1: Two example of long-term dynamics prediction tasks. Left: three-cushion billiards. Right:PHYRE intuitive-physics dataset (Bakhtin et al., 2019). Our proposed approach makes accuratelong-term predictions that do not necessarily align with the ground truth but provide strong signal forplanning.
Figure 2: Our Region Proposal Interaction Network. Given N frames as inputs, we forward them toan encoder network, and then extract the foreground object features with RoIPooling (different colorsrepresent different instances). We then perform interaction reasoning on top of the region proposalfeatures (gray box on the bottom right). We predict each future object feature based on the previous ktime steps. We then estimate the object location from each object feature.
Figure 3: We show the qualitative comparisons between our method and other baselines in the PHYREbenchmark. Our model can accurately infer objects’ interactions and collisions with the environmentover a long-range (10s), while the baseline methods cannot (the balls sometimes penetrates otherobjects). In this visualization, only the moving objects’ location and masks are predicted (the color istaken from the simulator). Static environment parts (with black color) are rendered from the initialimage.
Figure 4: We show the qualitative results of our predicted trajectories in the other three (RealB, SimB,and SS) datasets. Our model could produce accurate and plausible predictions on different scenarios.
