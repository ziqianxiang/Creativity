The horizontalaxis corresponds to time-steps and the vertical to the one-dimensional spatial domain of the problems ∈ [-1, 1]A more detailed view on the predictive results with snapshots of the particle density at selectedtime instances is presented in Figure 9. We emphasize again the stable convergence of the learneddynamics to the steady state as well as the accuracy in capturing, propagating and dissipating theshock front.
