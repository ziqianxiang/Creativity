Figure 1: Illustration of our method: Initially, the points are transferred via the auxiliary transformation ρ andthe parameterization φ to the Poincare ball B, where learnable parameters θ are added. Then, the logarithmicmap is used for transforming the points to the tangent space Tx0 B. Finally, the resulting vectors are added andtransformed back to the manifold via the exponential map. Note that the persistence diagram is mapped to asingle point on the Poincare ball (i.e., Φ(D, θ) ∈ B).
Figure 2: Left: Example graph from the IMDB-BINARY dataset. Middle: Persistence diagrams extracted usingthe Vietoris-Rips filtration. The dashed line denotes features of infinite persistence, which are represented bypoints of maximal death value equal to 90 (i.e., by points of finite persistence). Right: Equivalent representationon the 2-dimensional Poincare ball. Features of infinite persistence are mapped infinitesimally close to theboundary. Therefore, their distance to finite persistence features approaches infinity (d 〜e-2).
