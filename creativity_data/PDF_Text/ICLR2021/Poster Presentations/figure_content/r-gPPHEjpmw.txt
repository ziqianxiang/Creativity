Figure 2: The four tasks we evaluate on. From left to right: 7-DOF Pusher, 7-DOF Reacher,GoalTask, and KickBall. The first two tasks simulate a one-armed PR2 robot environmentwhile the last two are in the S ocialRob ot environment. The final picture shows a closeup of thePioneer2dx robot used in SocialRobot.
Figure 3: Comparison of all discriminator features against each other across the four environments.
Figure 4: Comparisons of the mean success rates of three features of HIDIO (Action,StateAction, StateDiff; solid lines) against other methods (dashed lines).
Figure 5: Two example options from the StateAction instantiation on KickBall (top) andPusher (bottom). The top option navigates directly to the goal by bypassing obstructions along theway and the bottom option sweeps the puck towards one direction.
Figure 6: Pretraining baseline comparisonat fractions {表,1, 4} of the total numberof training time steps.
Figure 7: Comparisons of the mean success rates of three features of HIDIO (Action,StateAction, StateDiff at different option lengths K. Dotted lines indicate K = 1, solidlines indicate K = 3, and dashed lines indicate K = 5. K = 3 was used across all environmentsfor the results in the main text.
Figure 8: Trajectory distributions compared for different option lengths K for the StateActionHIDIO instantiation in both SocialRobot environments. These are obtained by randomly sam-pling an option uniformly in [-1, 1]D and keeping it fixed for the entire trajectory. 100 trajectoriesfrom each option are visualized and plotted in different colors.
