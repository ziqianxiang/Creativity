Figure 1: Volume expansionof MWU in the bimatrix game(∖ 0.95 0.03 Γ-1.05 0.03 ]、[ 0.03 0.95] , 0.03 -1.055 Conclusion and Future WorksIn this paper, we analyze the volume-changing behavior of several well-known learning algorithms(MWU, OMWU, FTRL) on general bimatrix games and multi-player games, which leads to a Lya-punov chaos analysis. For bimatrix games, we do this by decomposing a game into the zero-sumpart and the coordination part. This decomposition turns the volume analysis into comparing thestrengths of volume-expansion (zero-sum part) and volume-contraction (coordination part) of theMWU dynamics. The comparison of strengths is made via the notion of matrix domination andthe use of a linear program. For multi-player games, by the local equivalence, we show that thevolume-changing behavior of MWU and OMWU are opposite to each other even in multi-playergames. We also show, for a general multi-player potential game, the key function CG is equal to acorresponding multi-player coordination game, which implies it is not positive.
