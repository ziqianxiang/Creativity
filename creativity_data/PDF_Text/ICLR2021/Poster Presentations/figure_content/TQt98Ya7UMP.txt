Figure 1:	MetaL performance using different outer losses (left) and comparison with D4PG andRC-D4PG (right).
Figure 2:	Performance as a function of safety coefficient.
Figure 3:	Performance per domain. MetaL compared to baselines in terms of average reward andpenalized reward across the highest safety coefficient and largest thresholds for each domain.
Figure 4: The learning progress of MetaL for solvable (left) and unsolvable (middle) constrainttasks. In both cases, MetaL attempts to try and maximize the return (right).
