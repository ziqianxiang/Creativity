Figure 1: Relationships between PMI vectors (black rectangles) of subject/object words for different relationtypes. PMI vectors capture co-occurrence with every dictionary word: strong associations (PMI > 0) are shaded(blue define the relation, grey are random other associations); red dash = relatedness; black dash = context sets.
