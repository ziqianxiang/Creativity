Figure 8: GPT-3â€™s confidence is a poor estimatorof its accuracy and can be off by up to 24%.
Figure 9: On the left are GPT-3 few shot accuracies for all of the 57 tasks. On the right are UnifiedQAtransfer accuracies for all of the 57 tasks. For both models, capabilities are lopsided.
Figure 10: As the number of few-shot instructionexamples increases, the accuracy monotonicallyincreases. Notably, zero-shot performance is onlysomewhat lower than 5-shot accuracy.
Figure 11: While models are more calibrated ina few-shot setting than a zero-shot setting, theyare still miscalibrated, with gap between accuracyand confidence reaching up to 14%. Here thecorrelation between confidence and accuracy isr = 0.81, compared to r = 0.63 in the zero-shotsetting.
Figure 12: Figures on the relation between question difficulty and question length. For questionslonger than a tweet (280 characters), the correlation between question length and true label confidenceis slightly positive. This shows that longer questions are not necessarily harder.
Figure 13: The average log probability of the question (without answer) is not strongly positivelycorrelated with accuracy, all else equal. Each point corresponds to a task. Higher log probabilityindicates higher compression, and especially high log probability would suggest memorization. Inthe zero-shot question prompt, the correlation between average log probability and accuracy isr = -0.43, and for the few-shot setting the correlation is r = -0.56.
