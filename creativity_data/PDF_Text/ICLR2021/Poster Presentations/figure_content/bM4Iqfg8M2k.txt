Figure 1: Illustration of the proposed graph information bottleneck (GIB) framework. We employa bi-level optimization scheme to optimize the GIB objective and thus yielding the IB-subgraph.
Figure 2: The molecules with their interpretable subgraphs discovered by different methods. Thesesubgraphs exhibit similar chemical properties compared to the molecules on the left.
Figure 3: We use the bi-level objective to minimize the mutual information of two distributions. TheMI is consistent with the loss as LMI declines.
Figure 4: The histgram of absolute bias between the property of graphs and subgraphs.
Figure 5: The molecules with its interpretation found by GIB. These subgraphs exhibit similarchemical properties compared to the molecules on the left.
Figure 6: We show the blindly denoising results on permuted graphs. Each method operates on theline-graphs and tries to recover the true topology by removing the redundant edges. Columns 4,5,6shows results obtained by different methods, where “miss: m, wrong: n” means missing m edgesand there are n wrong edges in the output graph. GIB always recognizes more similar structure tothe ground truth (not provided in the training process) than other methods.
Figure 7: From (a) to (d), we show the loss in the training process on QED, DRD2, HLM-CLint andMLM-CLint respectively.
