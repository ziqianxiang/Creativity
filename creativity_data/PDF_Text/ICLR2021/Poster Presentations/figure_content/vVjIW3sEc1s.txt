Figure 1: Learned quadratic function v/s log partition function on various datasets for features com-puted from pre-trained GPT-2 to verify Assumption 4.1. We also plot the y = x line for reference.
Figure 2: Fit of the learned quadratic function to the log partition function on various datasets forfeatures computed by the full, pre-trained GPT-2. We also plot the y = x line for reference. Theseplots are meant to verify Assumption 4.1.
Figure 3: Logistic loss of conditional mean features on the SST-2 task for various checkpoints of aGPT-2 architecture trained on IMDb and Amazon. The reported cross-entropy is measured on thevalidation set. The red trend shows the fit of a square-root function, which is what the upper boundin Theorem 4.2 looks like.
