Figure 1: a) The 10 largest singular values of the first-layer weight matrix W after training. Each dotrepresents one singular value. b) Neurons (rows ofW) projected on the top two singular dimensions.
Figure 2: a-c) The 10 largest singular values of the first-, second- and third-layer weight matrixWl after training. Each dot represents one singular value. d-f) Neurons (rows of Wl) projected onthe respective top two singular dimensions. g) Histogram of correlations between each first-layerneuron and the closest max-margin direction. (There are 100 neurons in total).
