Figure 1: Left: Performance of various models on an image representation task (top row) and threeframes from a video representation task (remaining rows). Leftmost column shows ground truth.
Figure 2:	Image generalization samples from the Natural and Text datasets.
Figure 3:	Poisson Image Reconstruction: In the left and right figures, an image on the left is recon-structed using gradients and Laplacians respectively; the top row depicts the reconstructed images,while the bottom row indicates the fitted gradients and the fitted Laplacians.
Figure 5: Shape representations from fitting signed distance functions (a). 2D rendered photographsfrom view synthesis experiments (b).
Figure 4: Solving Helmholtz equation for a single pointsource placed at the center of a medium with uniform wavepropagation velocity. The top row presents the magnitude,while the bottom row presents the phase.
