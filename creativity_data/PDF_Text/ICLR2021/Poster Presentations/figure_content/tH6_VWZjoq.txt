Figure 1: Objective value error vs rank in the problem of Section 3.1.
Figure 2: Foreground-background separation from video. From left to right: Fast Greedy withrank=3 and Huber loss with δ = 20. Standard PCA with rank=1. Principal Component Pursuit(PCP) with λ = 0.002. Both PCA and PCP have visible ”shadows” in the foreground that appear as”smudges” in the background. These are less obvious in a still frame but more apparent in a video.
Figure 3: Test error vs rank in the matrix completion problem of Section 4.2. Bands of ±1 standarderror are shown. Note that SoftImpute starts to overfit for ranks larger than 12 in (a). The “jumps”at around rank 5-7 happen because of overshooting (taking too large a step) during the insertion therank-1 component in both Fast Greedy and Fast Local Search. More specifically, these implemen-tations only apply 3 iterations of the inner optimization step, which in some cases are too few toamend the overshooting. However, after a few more iterations of the algorithm the overshootingissue is resolved (i.e. the algorithm has had enough iterations to scale down the rank-1 componentthat caused the overshooting).
Figure 4: One of the splits of the Movielens 100K dataset. We can see that for small ranks theFast Local Search solution is better and more stable, but for larger ranks it does not provide anyimprovement over the Fast Greedy algorithm.
