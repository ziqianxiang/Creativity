Figure 1: AudioScope separating on-screen bird chirping from wind noise and off-screen soundsfrom fireworks and human laugh. More demos online at https://audioscope.github.io.
Figure 2: AudioScope system diagram with 2 input mixtures and 4 output sources.
Figure 3: Scatter plots of input SI-SNR versus on-screen SI-SNR for on-screen evaluation examples,and mixture power in dB versus OSR. The settings for the models are SOff 0% and exact CE loss,and colormap indicates density of points.
Figure 4: Best cases for AudioScope separation of on-screen sounds under various SNR conditions.
Figure 5: Failure cases for AudioScope separation of on-screen sounds under various SNR conditions.
Figure 6: Comparison of random examples of separating on-screen sounds under various SNRconditions using either exact cross entropy (4) or active combinations cross entropy (6) as theclassification loss.
Figure 7: Comparison of examples with maximum absolute performance difference under variousSNR conditions using either exact cross entropy (4) or active combinations cross entropy (6) as theclassification loss.
Figure 8:	Distribution plots for the performance obtained by the best model in terms of on-screenSI-SNR (Figure 8a) and SI-SNRi (Figure 8b) reconstruction and off-screen power suppression (Figure8c). The settings for the models are SOff 0% and active combinations (AC) cross-entropy loss.
Figure 9:	Distribution plots for the performance obtained by the best model under different ranges ofinput SI-SNR and input mixture powers, for both unsupervised and semi-supervised settings. Foreach distribution plot, we depict the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles with dashed lines. The settingsfor the models are SOff 0% and active combinations (AC) cross-entropy loss.
