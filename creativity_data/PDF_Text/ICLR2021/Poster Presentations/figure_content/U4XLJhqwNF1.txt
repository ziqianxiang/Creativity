Figure 1: Illustration of (a) instance discrimination and (b) our consistency regularization term. qis a query and p is a positive key, both are encoded from crops of the same image. {nk}kK=1 arenegative keys, encoded from random crops. In (a), the similarities are softmax cosine distancesbetween q and each key. (p and {nk}kK=1). These similarities are optimized towards an artificialone-hot label which identifies p among all keys. However, some negatives can be semanticallysimilar but not reflected by the one-hot label (e.g., the one rounded by a red box). In (b), ourproposed consistency regularization encourages the agreement between P , the positive-negativesimilarities, and Q, the query-negative similarities, reflecting the heterogeneous similarities betweenthe query/positive and the negatives.
