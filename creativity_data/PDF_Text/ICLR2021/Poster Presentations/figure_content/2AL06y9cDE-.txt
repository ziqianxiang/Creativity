Figure 1: The structures of feed-forward neural network (black) and the proposed method (blue).
Figure 2: (a) and (b) show the states of clean data (red and blue) and of perturbed data (black andgray) at the initial and hidden layers respeCtively. The yellow and green baCkgrounds represent thetwo Classes prediCted by the network. Some of the perturbed data are mis-Classified. (C) and (d)show the adjusted states after the proposed Close-loop Control. The baCkground lightness from lightto dark represent the inCreasing reConstruCtion loss kEt(xt) - xtk22.
