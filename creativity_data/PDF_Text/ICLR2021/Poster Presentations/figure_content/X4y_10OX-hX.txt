Figure 1:	TWo binary networks consisting of three neurons σ1,σ2,σ3 = {±1}. On the left isthe classical Hopfield network (Hopfield, 1982) with the matrix Tij = Pμ ξμiξμj being the outerproduct of memory vectors (see section 2 for the definitions of notations). In this case the matrixTij is interpreted as a matrix of synaptic connections between cells i and j. On the right is a DenseAssociative Memory network of (Krotov & Hopfield, 2016) with cubic interaction term F(x)=x3. In this case the corresponding tensor Tijk = Pμ ξμiξμjξμk has three indices, thus cannot beinterpreted as a biological synapse, which can only connect two cells.
Figure 2:	An example of a continuous network with Nf = 5 feature neurons and Nh = 11 complexmemory (hidden) neurons with symmetric synaptic connections between them.
