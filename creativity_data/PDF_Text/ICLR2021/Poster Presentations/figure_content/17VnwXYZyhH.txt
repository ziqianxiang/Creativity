Figure 1: Visualization of different spaCes. (A, B) Comparison between trees embedded in Eu-Clidean spaCe and hyperboliC spaCe. We use geodesics, the analogy of straight lines in hyperboliCspaCes, to ConneCt nodes in (B). Line/geodesiC segments ConneCting nodes are approximately of thesame length in their Corresponding spaCes. Intuitively, nodes embedded in EuClidean spaCe lookmore “Crowded”, while the hyperboliC spaCe allows suffiCient CapaCity to embed trees and enoughdistances between leaf nodes. (C) A syntax tree embedded in a Poincare ball. Hierarchy levelsCorrespond to syntaCtiCal depths. The higher level a word is in a syntax tree, the Closer it is to theorigin. (D) Sentiment words embedded in a PoinCare ball. Hierarchy is defined as the sentiment Po-larity. We assume two meta [POS] and [NEG] embeddings at the highest level. Words with strongersentiments are closer to their corresPonding meta-embeddings.
Figure 2: Comparison between the two probes. (A) Middle layered embeddings show richer syntac-tic information. (B) All probes recover syntax best at approximately rank 64 and Poincare probesare especially better at low ranks. (C) Poincare probes recover syntax better for longer sentences.
Figure 3: Left: comparison of edge length distributions. Distribution of the PoinCare probe alignsbetter with the ground truth than the Euclidean probe. Right: edge prediction recall of top longestedge types. The Poincare probe is especially better at recovering edges of longer average length.
Figure 4: PCA projection of dependency trees for the sentence it was a pretty wild day. Yellowlines/geodesics denote the ground truth and blue dashed lines/geodesics are predicted by the probe.
Figure 5: (A, B) PCA projection of sentence a good-looking but ultimately pointless politicalthriller with plenty of action and almost no substance. Words are connected to closer meta-embeddings. Words with dashed lines mean that the differences between their distances to twoembeddings are not significant (neutral words). (C) Layerwise accuracy. Sentiment emerge at deeperlayers (aroung layer 9) than syntax (around layer 7).
