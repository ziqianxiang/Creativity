Figure 1: An illustration of models that can be sampled from a Dirichlet distribution (Equation 7). (a) Athree-class toy data with three clients, each has non-i.i.d. imbalanced data. (b) We show the sampled model’scorresponding γ (position in the triangle) and its test accuracy (color). FEDAVG is at the center; clients’models are at corners. The best performing model (star) is not at the center, drifting away from FedAvg. (c)Histograms of (in)correctly predicted examples at different confidences (x-axis) by sampled models and clients.
