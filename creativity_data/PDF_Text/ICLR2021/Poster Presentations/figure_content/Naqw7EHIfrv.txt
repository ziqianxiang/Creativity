Figure 1: The overall framework of DAPC.
Figure 2: Left panel. Top: the ground-truth 3D Lorenz attractor. Middle: the 30D non-linearlylifted trajectory. Bottom: corrupted 30D trajectory by white noise with SNR=0.3. Right Panel. 3Dtrajectories extracted by different methods for three SNR levels: 0.3, 1.0, 5.0.
Figure 3: Different models’ R2 score improvements over PCA for three forecasting tasks, each withthree different lag values. Left: temperature. Middle: dorsal hippocampus. Right: motor cortex.
Figure 4: Recovery of 3D trajectory of noisy Lorenz attractor by different methods.
Figure 5: Illustration of how PI can improve both full reconstruction and masked reconstruction(MR). We can observe that PI can greatly improve the recovery quality, especially when SNR is low(very noisy).
Figure 6: Qualitative recovery results by CPC w.r.t. different temporal lags (k).
Figure 7: Different models’ R2 score improvements over PCA: Left) temperature, Middle) dorsalhippocampus and Right) motor cortex datasets. Lag is the number of time steps the future event isahead of the current latent state.
Figure 8: On temperature dataset, we analyze the performances of different latent dimensions (di-mension of zi ): 5, 10, 15, 20. ∆R2 corresponds to R2 score improvement over PCA.
