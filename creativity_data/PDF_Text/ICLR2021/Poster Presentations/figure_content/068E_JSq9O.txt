Figure 1: (a) Empirical values of JDV, JNWJ, JCPC and JRPC performing visual object recognition onCIFAR-10. JDV and JNWJ soon explode to NaN values and stop the training (shown as early stopping in thefigure), while JCPC and JRPC are more stable. Performance comparison of JCPC and JRPC on (b) CIFAR-10and (c) LibriSpeech-100h with different minibatch sizes, showing that the performance of JRPC is less sensitiveto minibatch size change compared to JCPC .
Figure 2: Heatmaps of downstream task performance on CIFAR-10, using different α, β and γ in the JRPC.
Figure 3: Mutual information estimation performed on 20-d correlated Gaussian distribution, with the corre-lation increasing each 4K steps. JRPC exhibits smaller variance than SMILE and DoE, and smaller bias thanJCPC.
Figure 4: Mutual information estimation by RPC performed on 20-d correlated Gaussian distribu-tion, with different sets of relative parameters.
Figure 5: Mutual information estimation by DoE performed on 20-d correlated Gaussian distribu-tion. The figure on the left shows parametrization under Gaussian (correctly specified), and thefigure on the right shows parametrization under Logistic (mis-specified).
