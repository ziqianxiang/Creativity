Figure 1: BLEU and speed comparisons with varying numbers of encoder and decoder layers onthe test data. 12-1 denotes 12 encoder layers and 1 decoder layer. AR deep-shallow (12-1) finds abalanced middle ground in the tradeoff. Knowledge distillation is applied to all models (§3.1). SeeTable 5 in Appendix for more results.
Figure 2: WMT14 EN→DE test results under various conditions. Left: varying depths of the en-coder under the Si speed constraint of AR 12-1 ■. Middle: varying allocation of a total of 12transformer layers over the encoder and decoder. Right: varying inference batch sizes.
Figure 3: Test BLEU and target length comparisons for the AR 6-6 and deep-shallow 12-1 models.
