Figure 1: AUROC along individual prin-ciple eigenvector with CIFAR-10 as in-distribution and CIFAR-100 as OOD.
Figure 2: Ablating across different training parameters in SSD under following setup: In-distributiondataset = CIFAR-10, OOD dataset = CIFAR-100, Training epochs = 500, Batch size = 512.
Figure 3: AUROC over the courseof training with CIFAR-10 as in-distribution and CIFAR-100 as OOD set.
Figure 4: Existing superviseddetector requires fine-grainedlabels. In contrast, SSD canachieve similar performancewith only unlabeled data.
Figure 6: Using extra unla-beled training data can helpto further improve the perfor-mance of SSD.
Figure 5: Relationship of AU-ROc with clusters depends onwhich block we use as the fea-ture extractor.
