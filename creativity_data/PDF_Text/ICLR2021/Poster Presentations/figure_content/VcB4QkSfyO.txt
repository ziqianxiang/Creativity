Figure 9: Adversarial robustness of monDEQs as compared to CNNsWe run the same experiments that we ran in Section 5.3 on the CIFAR-10 dataset. We train singleconvolution monDEQs (128 channels) with a range of m values, as well as 3 CNN models: CNNsm, CNN med and CNN lg whose architectures are described in Appendix F above.
