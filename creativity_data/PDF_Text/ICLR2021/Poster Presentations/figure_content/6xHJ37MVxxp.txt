Figure 1: 2-D t-SNE (Maaten & Hinton, 2008) visualization of the style statistics (concatenation ofmean and standard deviation) computed from the first residual block's feature maps of a ResNet-18(He et al., 2016) trained on four distinct domains (Li et al., 2017). It is clear that different domainsare well separated.

Figure 3: (a) Coinrun benchmark. (b) Test performance in unseen environments. (C) Differencebetween training and test performance.
Figure 4: 2-D visualization of flattened feature maps (top) and the corresponding style statistics(bottom). res1-4 denote the four residual blocks in order in a ResNet architecture. We observe thatres1 to res3 contain domain-related information while res4 encodes label-related information.
