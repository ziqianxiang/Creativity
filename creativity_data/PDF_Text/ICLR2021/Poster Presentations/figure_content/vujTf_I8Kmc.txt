Figure 1: Illustration of our ConstellationNet pipeline where the bottom part is the network architecturebased on Conv-4 backbone, and the top part shows the constellation model. Our proposed ConstellationNetconsists of “Constell.” modules that perform explicit cell feature clustering with self-attention for joint relationmodeling.
Figure 2: Modules analysis. (a, b, c, d) We study the effectiveness of changing the number of clusters, thenumber of heads in attention layer, and the layer indices with constellation based on Conv-4, (e) We demonstratethe performance gain of our ConstellationNet is unmatched by increasing the model complexity of our baselines.
Figure 3: Visualization of cluster centers. (Upper) We visualize four cluster centers in each layer by showingpatches associated with cell features that have the nearest distance to the clustering center. (Lower) Identifyingparts from two cluster centers in layer 4: Left one with green box represents various types of legs. Right onewith red box mostly shows beetles and bird’s head, sharing a dotted structure.
Figure 4: Visualization of the cells assignment and attention maps. (Left) Each color represents a cluster,and each point, marked as "∙", represents a cell assigned to a cluster center. We demonstrate 6 samples for eachclass (bird, dog and tank). (Right) We visualize attention maps of one query feature (at the location of red pointin left part) with all key features. The middle part shows the attention maps corresponding to 8 heads in themulti-head attention. The right part shows an overlapped map of all attention maps.
