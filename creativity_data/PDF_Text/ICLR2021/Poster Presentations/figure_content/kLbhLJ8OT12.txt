Figure 1: This diagram demonstrates the overall architecture for modelling the hierarchical struc-ture between dialogue policy (i.e. high-level policy) and NLG (i.e. low-level policy) as an optionframework. The text in gray represents the concepts for a traditional task-oriented dialogue systemwhereas the text in red matches the concepts for the option framework.
Figure 2: These diagrams demonstrate latent dialogue acts of HDNO and LaRL clustered in 8categories on a 2-D plane. Clustering is conducted with k-means algorithm (Arthur and Vassilvitskii,2006) on the original dimensions whereas dimension reduction is conducted with T-SNE algorithm(Maaten and Hinton, 2008). We randomly show 3 turns of system utterances for each cluster.
Figure 3: (a) This figure shows the statistical results of human evaluation, where 30 people partici-pated in this human evaluation and the questionnaire is constituted of 31 randomly selected turns ofdialogues. (b) This figure shows the example generated responses from the questionnaire.
