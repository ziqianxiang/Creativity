Figure 6: Trace plots and KDEs of β(1)with long enough iterations. In Figs 6(a) and 6(b), we observe that, even though the distribution ofinterest has a pickier density, our proposed algorithm VR-reSGLD was able to detect both modesand acceptably jump between them. On the other hand, the competitor algorithm SGLD was trappedin the first mode visited and never escaped. reSGLD was able to jump some times between modesonly after considering a substantial factor F = 500 which, according to the theory, introduces bias.
