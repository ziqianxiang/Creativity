Figure 1: Schematic diagram for label vector construction (on the right) and the training process (onthe left). Each label vector is B × K dimensional divided into K components of length B . Eachvector is K -sparse with exactly one non-zero index in each component (colored on the right). Thecomponents are separated by dotted vertical lines. For a given input, we perform an ‘OR’ operationover the true label vectors and feed the resultant pieces to independent small classifiers.
Figure 2: Inverted-Index construction forthe label vectors shown in figure 1. We con-struct one index for each of the K chunks.
Figure 3: Schematic diagram for Inference. We first get K prob-ability vectors of B dimensions each. Then we only retain thetop-m buckets after sparsification (m=1 in above figure. For ourexperiments, m varies among 50 and 100). We accumulate thecandidate labels based on inverted-index for these top-bucketsand aggregate their scores and identify the best labels.
