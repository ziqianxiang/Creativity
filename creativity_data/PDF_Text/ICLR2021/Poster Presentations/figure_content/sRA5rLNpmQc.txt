Figure 1: Decomposition of accuracy and verified accuracy on CIFAR-10 dataste: the detectioncapability of the network can increase robustness by adaptively abstaining on adversarial inputswhile also abstaining on some natural images rather than misclassifying them.
Figure 2: Naural versus robust error tradeoff for IBP (位1 = 0) and IBP-with-detection (位1 > 0)on CIFAR-10 dataset for various perturbation sizes = 8/255, 12/255, 16/255. Lower curve isbetter. IBP-with-detection is effectively utilizing its detection capability to adaptively trade naturaland robust performance, leading to improved certified robustness against adversarial perturbations.
Figure 3: Naural versus robust error tradeoff for IBP (位1 = 0) and IBP-with-detection (位1 > 0) onMNIST dataset for various perturbation sizes = 0.3 and = 0.4. Points closer to the origin arebetter. IBP-with-detection is effectively utilizing its detection capability to adaptively trade naturaland robust performance, leading to improved certified robustness against adversarial perturbations.
