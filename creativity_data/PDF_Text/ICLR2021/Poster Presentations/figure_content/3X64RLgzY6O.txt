Figure 1: Illustration for the 2-D example studied in Section 3. Here κ = 4 and w0 = (0.6, 0.6). (a): Smalllearning rate regime. The small learning rate is 0.1∕κ. In this regime SGD and GD behave similarly and theyboth converge along e2. (b): Moderate learning rate regime. The initial moderate learning rate is η = 1.1/κand the decayed learning rate is η0 = 0.1∕κ. In this regime GD converges along e2 but SGD converges alonge1 , the larger eigenvalue direction of the data matrix. Please refer to Section 3 for further discussions.
Figure 2: Comparison of the (relative) Rayleigh quotients. (a): A linear regression example. We randomlydraw 100 samples from a 10, 000-dimensional space as described in Section 4, where Z 〜U([0.5,1]). Thesmall learning rate scheme is specified by(η0, k2) = (0.2, 104), and the moderate learning rate scheme isspecified by (η, η0, k1 , k2) = (1.05, 0.1, 2 × 103 , 3 × 103). Numerical results show the Rayleigh quotientconverges to its maximum for SGD with moderate learning rate, and converges to its minimum for GD and SGDwith small learning rate, which verifies Theorems 1, 2 and 3. (b): A neural network example. The plots areaveraged over 10 runs. We randomly draw 2, 000 samples from FashionMNIST as the training set. The model isa 5-layer convolutional neural network. The small learning rate scheme is specified by(η0 , k2) = (10-3 , 104),and the moderate learning rate scheme is specified by (η, η0, k1 , k2) = (10-2, 10-3, 2.5 × 103, 104). Sinceneural network is non-convex, we compare the relative Rayleigh quotient of the concerned algorithms, i.e., theRayleigh quotient of the convergence directions divided by the maximum absolute eigenvalue of the Hessian(see Appendix D.3).
Figure 3: The test accuracy of a neuralnetwork on a subset of FashionMNIST. Theplots are averaged over 10 runs. The exper-imental setting is identical to that in Figure2(b). The plots show that SGD with moder-ate learning rate achieves the highest test ac-curacy, and GD and SGD with small learn-ing rate perform similarly, but are worse thanthe former.
Figure 4: Test accuracy vs. number of iteration for algorithms with increasing learning rates. The modelis a 5-layer convolutional neural network, and the dataset is a subset of FashionMNIST dataset. Details aredescribed in Appendix D.3.
