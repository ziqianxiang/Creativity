Figure 1: The negative correlation between the transfer utility and the interaction. The correla-tion is computed as the Pearson correlation. The blue shade in each subfigure represents the 95%confidence interval of the linear regression.
Figure 2: Visualization of interactions between neighboring perturbation units generated with andwithout the interaction loss. The color in the visualization is computed as color [i] 8 Ej∈Ni [Iij (δ)],where Ni denotes the set of adjacent perturbation units of the perturbation unit i. Here, We ignoreinteractions between non-adjacent units to simplify the visualization. It is because adjacent unitsusually encode much more significant interactions than other units. The interaction loss forces theperturbation to encode more negative interactions.

Figure 4: (a) Histograms of the value of the Hessian element Hab(x) w.r.t. different values ofa, b. (b) Histograms of the value ofgbHbbpn=ι gaHabw.r.t. different values of b. Because the Hessianof the DNN with the ReLU activation is not well defined, we replace the ReLU activation with theSoftplus activation f(x) = 1 log(1 + e-βx). We train VGG-16, ReSNet-32, and DensetNet-121 onthe CIFAR-10 dataset (Krizhevsky et al., 2009), and use the cross-entropy loss as the classificationloss.

Note that A is the sum ofn terms (n is large). In comparisons, Bis just a single term in A. Therefore, the sign of A - B is usually dominated by the term A. In thisway, we get Prob [sign(A - B) = sign(A)] ≈ 1. Therefore, Prob [(A - B)A ≥ 0] ≈ 1. We verifythis assumption by measuring the value ofgbHbbpn=ι gaHab. If P rob h|gbHbbpn=ι gaHab|	1 ≈ 1, then we
