Table 1: The two main layers in an N -point Fourier flow, their inverses, and the corresponding log-determinant-Jacobian. The input to the flow, x, is a D × T matrix comprising a set of D time-series each of length T , andthe output, Y , is a 2 × D × N/2 tensor comprising the filtered spectral representation of x. Here, we showthe application of the Fourier transform layer to a given feature dimension d—the same operation is appliedindependently to all feature dimensions. The vector Xc-d is the reversed conjugate of Xcd, and H = [Hi,j]i,j.
