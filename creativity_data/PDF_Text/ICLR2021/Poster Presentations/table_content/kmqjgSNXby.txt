Table 1: Summary of the offline datasets used. Dataset size indicates the number of (s, a, r0 , s0) tuples.
Table 2: Negative log-likelihood on heldout validation sets for different RL Unplugged tasks (lower is better).
Table 3: Spearman’s rank correlation (ρ) coefficient (bootstrap mean ± standard deviation) between differentOPE metrics and ground truth values at a discount factor of 0.995. In each column, rank correlation coefficientsthat are not significantly different from the best (p > 0.05) are bold faced. Methods are ordered by median.
Table A.1: Normalized Regret@5 (bootstrap mean ± standard deviation) for OPE methods vs. ground truthvalues at a discount factor of 0.995. In each column, normalized regret values that are not significantly differentfrom the best (p > 0.05) are bold faced. Methods are ordered by median.
Table A.2: Average absolute error between OPE metrics and ground truth values at a discount factor of 0.995.
