Table 1: Mean return with 95% confidence interval of 20 epochs after completing 20% of the totaltraining and for the last 20 epochs. We trained 40 different seeds for each experiment and com-puted five evaluation rollouts per epoch. The projections with (-E) and without entropy control areconsidered separately, therefore, each column may have up to two best runs (bold).
