Table 1: Each row corresponds to a layer of our generalized model. Convolutional layers are spec-ified with the “Conv” prefix followed by the kernel size, number of output channels and downsam-pling stride (e.g. the first layer of the encoder uses 5×5 kernels with 192 output channels and a strideof 2). The “Deconv” prefix corresponds to upsampled convolutions, while “Masked” corresponds tomasked convolution as in Van den Oord et al. (2016). GSDN stands for generalized subtractive anddivisive normalization, and IGSDN is inverse GSDN. The three parameter networks share a similararchitecture.
