Table 1: Quantitative ablation study of our loss function.
Table 2: Quantitative comparison to Pixel2Mesh. We report Chamfer distance (CD) and degrees offreedom in the representation (DOF). We obtain comparable Chamfer distance using a representationthat is an order of magnitude more compact and without non-manifold artifacts.
