Table 1: Bayesian recovery from noisy data with different percentages of missing entries. Tableshows the ELBO assigned by the retrieved posteriors to the ground truth clean data. Our TAE modelconsistently returns higher ELBO values compared to the competing variational methods, as it is ableto retrieve rich posteriors that adequately sample the solution space. More values in supp. D.3.
