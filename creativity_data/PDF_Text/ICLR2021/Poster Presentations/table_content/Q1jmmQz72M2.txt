Table 1: The test accuracies with their standard deviations over 5 realizations on the three imagedatasets. In the first column, p (=1, 2, or 4) in Ap means the number of the channels of zeros into theinput image during the augmentation of the image space Rc×h×w → R(c+p)×h×w (Dupont et al.,2019). For each model, the initial (resp. final) time is set as 0 (resp. 1), and the delays of the NDDEsand its extensions are all set as 1, simply equal to the final time.
Table 2: The number of the filters and the whole parameters in each model used for CIFAR10,MNIST, and SVHN. In the first column, Ap with p = 1, 2, 4 indicates the augmentation of theimage space Rc×h×w → R(c+p)×h×w .
