Table 1: Comparison to prior work on mini-ImageNet. Average 5-way classification accuracies (%) onmini-ImageNet meta-test split are reported with 95% confidence intervals. Results of prior works are adoptedfrom Lee et al. (2019) and original papers. t used extra cross-modal information.
Table 2: Comparison to prior work on FC100 and CIFAR-FS. Average 5-way classification accuracies (%)on CIFAR-FS and FC100 meta-test split are reported with 95% confidence intervals. Results of prior works areadopted from Lee et al. (2019) and original papers.
Table 3: Effectiveness of modules. Average classification accuracies (%) on mini-ImageNet meta-test split.
Table 4: Ablation study on the number of clusters for random and similar classes. We investigate howsimilarities of images in the training dataset affect the optimal number of clusters. The first group of experimentsuse training dataset with 30 similar classes while the second group use 30 random classes from FC100 dataset,all of which performed on ResNet-12 with Constellation module.
Table 5: Additional experiments with the use of negative margin. Average classification accuracies (%) onmini-ImageNet meta-test split. We compare our ConstellationNet and baseline with and without the negativemargin loss based on Conv-4.
