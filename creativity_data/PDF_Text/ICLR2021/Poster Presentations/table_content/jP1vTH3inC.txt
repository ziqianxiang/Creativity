Table 1: Results of MS-COCO, Django, Gigaword, and WMT with fixed orders (L2R, Random,Common, Rare) as baseline. Here, R-1, R-2, and R-L indicate ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L, respectively. For TER, lower is better; for all other metrics, higher is better. “一” = not reported.
Table 2: Normalized Levenshtein Distance betweenthe ordering learnt by the encoder and the groundtruth ordering, under different positional encodings(enc) and modeling distributions of qφ (distrib).
Table 4: NLTK Universal Tagset.
