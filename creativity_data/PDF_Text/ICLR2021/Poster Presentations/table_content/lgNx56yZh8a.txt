Table 1: Average accuracy and standard deviation (percentage) on 5-way FSC. Baseline results(through DKT) are from Patacchiola et al. (2020). Evaluation is performed on 3,000 randomlygenerated test episodes. Standard deviation for the remaining methods are computed by averagingover 5 batches of 600 episodes with different random seeds. The best results are highlighted in bold.
Table 2: Average accuracy and standard deviation (percentage) on 5-way cross-domain FSC, withthe same experimental setup as in Table 1. Baseline results (through DKT) are from (Patacchiolaet al., 2020).
Table 3: Likelihoods used in Section F.
Table 4: Specification of Conv4 architecture. Conv2d layers are 3 × 3 with stride 1 and samepadding. MaxPool2d layers are 2 × 2 with stride 2 and valid padding.
Table 5: Classification accuracy for Polya-Gamma OVE GPs (our method) using different kernels.
Table 6: Cross-domain classification accuracy for Polya-Gamma OVE GPs (our method) using dif-ferent kernels. The experimental setup is the same as Table 5.
Table 7: Accuracy (%) and Brier Score when applying Gaussian noise corruption of severity 5 toboth the support and query set of test-time episodes. Results were evaluated across 1,000 randomlygenerated 5-shot 5-way tasks.
Table 8: Accuracy (%) and Brier Score when applying impulse noise corruption of severity 5 toboth the support and query set of test-time episodes. Results were evaluated across 1,000 randomlygenerated 5-shot 5-way tasks.
Table 9: Accuracy (%) and Brier Score when applying defocus blur corruption of severity 5 toboth the support and query set of test-time episodes. Results were evaluated across 1,000 randomlygenerated 5-shot 5-way tasks.
