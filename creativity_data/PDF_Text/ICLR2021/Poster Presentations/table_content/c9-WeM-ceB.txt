Table 1: X-Ray Cardiomegaly test results for the best valid epoch over 100 epochs on the X-Raydataset with and without a site-pathology correlation (SPC). Results averaged over 10 seeds with thestandard deviation. Bold indicates better than Classification baseline and chance. IoU scores werecalculated on 100 randomly-selected test-set images for each seed (total of 1000).
Table 2: RSNA Pneumonia test results for the best valid epoch over 100 epochs on the RSNAdataset with and without a view-pathology correlation (VPC). Results averaged over 10 seeds withthe standard deviation. Bold indicates better than both the Classification baseline and chance. IoUscores were calculated on 100 randomly-selected test-set images for each seed (total of 1000).
Table 3: Best hyperparameters found using for each hyperparameter search. Discriminator iterationratios presented as the update ratios of the discriminator : encoder.
Table 4: Hyperparamaters and Test AUC (mean Â± standard deviation) for the actdiff models with awide hyperparameter search range on the X-Ray SPC and RSNA VPC datasets across 10 seeds.
Table 5: Mean and standard deviation Valid and Test AUC for all methods tested on the X-Ray SPCand RSNA VPC datasets across 5 seeds.
