Table 1: Quantitative results. For all experiments, we compare all results in terms of mean Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR in dB) and ±1 standard error over 5 runs. Overall best performance indicated by beingunderlined, best unsupervised method in bold, and best fully unsupervised method in italic. For many datasets,DivNoising is the unsupervised SOTA, typically not being far behind the supervised CARE results.
Table 2: Comparison of Self2Self with DivNoising. We train Self2Self (S2S) on a random single image perdataset and compare it with DivNoising trained on the same single image (DivN.1) and DivNoising trainedwith the full dataset (DivN.all). All methods are tested on the selected single image. Overall best method isindicated in bold. For all datasets, DivNoising leads to best performance while being orders of magnitudefaster and needing significantly less GPU memory.
Table 3: Sampling times with DIVNOIsing. Average time (± SD) needed to sample 1000 denoised imagesfrom a trained DivNoising network (evaluated over all test images of the respective dataset).
