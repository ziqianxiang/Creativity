Table 1: Fine-tuning BERTBASE that is pre-trained using different LR schedules on 4 downstream tasks. Wereport the accuracy on the Dev set of MRPC, MNLI, and CoLA, and F1 scores on the Dev set of SQuAD v1.1.
Table 2: Performance comparison with LR schedules searched by prior solutions on CIFAR-10 training withVGG-16 (batch size = 128). Note that the hand-tuned LR schedule can achieve 93.70% top-1 test accuracy in350 epochs. The Runtime column shows how long each method takes on one NVIDIA Titan RTX GPU to findthe LR schedule shown in the previous column. The runtime of HD and MARTHE include trying the guidelinevalues of their hyperparameters to get a decent LR schedule.

Table 4: The accuracy information of tuning the regular LR and the hypergradient LR of SGD-HD for CIFAR-10training with VGG-16 (batch size = 128). We train the model for 500 epochs using SGD-HD with each suggestedvalue for the regular LR and the hypergradient LR, and report the best top-1 test accuracy it can achieve, itscorresponding training accuracy, and the epoch number. Note that a hand-tuned LR schedule can achieve 93.70%top-1 test accuracy in 350 epochs.
Table 5: The accuracy information of tuning the regular LR and the hypergradient LR of SGD-HD for CIFAR-10training with ResNet-50 (batch size = 128). We train the model for 500 epochs using SGD-HD with eachsuggested value for the regular LR and the hypergradient LR, and report the best top-1 test accuracy it canachieve, its corresponding training accuracy, and the epoch number. Note that a hand-tuned LR schedule canachieve 95.56% top-1 test accuracy in 350 epochs.

Note that a hand-tuned LR schedule can achieve 93.70% top-1 test accuracy in 350 epochs. We reportthe top-1 accuracy achieved within 350 epochs for each trial, and the mean and standard deviation of the top-1accuracy achieved by AutoLRS over 5 trials for each τmax.
