Table 1: Comparison between our work and other conversion methods. The conversion loss isreported as the accuracy difference (accAN N - accSNN) between the source ANN with regularReLU and threshold ReLU (in brackets) and the converted SNN. Ourwork-X-TS denotes the SNNconverted from the source ANN with both threshold (T) ReLU and shift (S).
Table 2:	Performance of the converted SNN on CIFAR-10 (averaged on simulation length 400-600).
