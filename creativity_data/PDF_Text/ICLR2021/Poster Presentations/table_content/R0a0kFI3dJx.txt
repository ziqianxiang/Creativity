Table 1: Overview of related work. For the purposes of this table, “parameter-agnostic” means that the method does notrequire prior knowledge of the parameters of the problem it was designed to solve (Lipschitz modulus, domain diameter, etc.);“rate interpolation” means that the algorithm,s convergence rate is O(1 /T) or O(1 / VT) in smooth/non-smooth problemsrespectively; “unbounded domain” is self-explanatory; and, finally, “singularities” means that the problem’s defining vectorfield may blow up at a boundary point of the problem’s domain.
