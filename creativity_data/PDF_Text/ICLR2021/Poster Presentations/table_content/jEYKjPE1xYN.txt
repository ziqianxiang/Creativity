Table 2: Model architecture for actor and Critic networks.
Table 3: Hyperparameters for Cormorant (Anderson et al., 2019) used in all experiments.
Table 4: Hyperparameters for the single-bag, multi-bag and stochastic-bag tasks. Values in paren-theses were only used for the single-bag task. For further details on how the PPo hyperparametersare defined, please refer to Schulman et al. (2017).
