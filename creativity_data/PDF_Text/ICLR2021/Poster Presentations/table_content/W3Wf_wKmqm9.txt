Table 1: Comparison of C -Learning against relevant benchmarks in three environments, averaged across fiverandom seeds. Runs in bold are either the best on the given metric in that environment, or have a mean scorewithin the error bars of the best.
Table 2:	Relevant metrics for the Mini maze environment, stratified by difficulty of goal (see Figure 5 (left)from appendix F). Runs in bold are either the best on the given metric in that environment, or have a meanscore within the error bars of the best.
Table 3:	Relevant metrics for the Dubins’ car environment, stratified by difficulty of goal (see Figure 5 (right)from appendix F). Runs in bold are either the best on the given metric in that environment, or have a meanscore within the error bars of the best.
