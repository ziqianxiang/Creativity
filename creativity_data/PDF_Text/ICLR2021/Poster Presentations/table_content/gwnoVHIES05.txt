Table 3 shows the number of sketches contain-ing each of the parts. Notice that each part in Creative Creatures has significantly fewer examples (inthe extreme case, only 302 for paws.) than most parts in Creative Birds, making Creative Creaturesadditionally challenging. Most parts in Creative Birds are present in more than half the sketchesexcept for the mouth, which we find is often subsumed in beak. For Creative Creatures, the numbersof sketches containing different parts has higher variance. Common parts like body and head havesimilar occurrence in both datasets. Example parts are shown in Figures 10 and 11. Note that theinitial stroke can be used as any (entire or partial) part, including body but will not be annotated assuch. This means that sketches without an annotated body likely still contain a body.
