Table 1: Robust accuracy on the ANLI dataset. Models are trained on the benign datasets (MNLI +SNLI) only. ‘A1-A3’ refers to the rounds with increasing difficulty. ‘ANLI’ refers to A1+A2+A3.
Table 2: Robust accuracy on the ANLI dataset. Models are trained on both adversarial and benigndatasets (ANLI (training) + FeverNLI + MNLI + SNLI).
Table 3: Robust accuracy on the adversarial SNLI and MNLI(-m/mm) datasets generated byTextFooler based on blackbox BERT/RoBERTa (denoted in brackets of the header). Models aretrained on the benign datasets (MNLI+SNLI) only.
Table 4: Robust F1/EM scores based on RoBERTaLarge onthe adversarial SQuAD datasets (AddSent and AddOne-Sent). Models are trained on standard SQuAD 1.0 dataset.
Table 5: Robust accuracy on the ANLI dataset. Here we refer “Standard Datasets” as training onthe benign datasets (MNLI + SNLI) only. “Vanilla” refers to the vanilla BERT trained withoutInformation Bottleneck Regularizer.
Table 6: Robust accuracy on the ANLI dataset. Here we refer “Standard Datasets” as training onthe benign datasets (MNLI + SNLI) only, and “Standard and Adversarial Datasaets” as training onthe both benign and adversarial datasets (ANLI(trianing) + MNLI + SNLI + FeverNLI). “Vanilla”refers to the vanilla RoBERTa trained without Information Bottleneck Regularizer.

Table 8: Robust accuracy on the ANLI dataset. Models are trained on the benign datasets (MNLI +SNLI). Here we refer “IBR only” as training with Information Bottleneck Regularizer only. “AFRonly” refers to InfoBERT trained with Anchored Feature Regularizer only. “Both” is the standardInfoBERT that applies two regularizers together.
