Table 1: Architecture of the studied network. By conv(n, k, s, p) we denote a convolutionallayer with n kernels of size k Ã— k with stride s, where the input to the layer is padded by p rows orcolumns on each margin. By fc(n, o) we denote a fully-connected layer whose input dimensionis n and whose output dimension is o.
