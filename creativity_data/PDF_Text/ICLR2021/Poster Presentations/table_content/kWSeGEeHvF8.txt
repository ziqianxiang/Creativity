Table 1: Task statistics for RLUnplugged tasks (top) and D4RL tasks (bottom). Dataset size is the numberof (s, a, r, s0) tuples. For each dataset, we note the properties it possesses: high dimensional spaces (H), longtime-horizon (L), sparse rewards (R), temporally extended control (T).
Table A.1: Average absolute error between OPE metrics and ground truth values at a discount factor of 0.995In each column, absolute error values that are not significantly different from the best (p > 0.05) are bold faced.
Table A.2: Spearman’s rank correlation (ρ) coefficient (bootstrap mean ± standard deviation) between differentOPE metrics and ground truth values at a discount factor of 0.995. In each column, rank correlation coefficientsthat are not significantly different from the best (p > 0.05) are bold faced. Methods are ordered by median.
Table A.3: Normalized Regret@5 (bootstrap mean ± standard deviation) for OPE methods vs. ground truthvalues at a discount factor of 0.995. In each column, normalized regret values that are not significantly differentfrom the best (p > 0.05) are bold faced. Methods are ordered by median.
