Table 1: Unifying existing literature through symmetry. Here we provide references to existingliterature describing geometric properties of either the gradient or Hessian introduced by a networkâ€™sarchitecture. All of these properties can be unified as consequences of either a translation, scale, orrescale symmetry in the training loss.
Table 2: Geometric properties of the gradient. The gradients of a neural network with eithertranslation, scale or rescale symmetry observe certain geometric properties no matter the dataset orstep in training.
Table 3: Geometric properties of the Hessian. The Hessian matrix of a neural network with eithertranslation, scale or rescale symmetry observe certain geometric properties no matter the dataset orstep in training.
