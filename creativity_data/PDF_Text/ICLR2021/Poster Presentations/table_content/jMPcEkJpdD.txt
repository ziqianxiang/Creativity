Table 1: Results from the supervised setting. Column OF indicates results using optical flow duringtraining. Column Pretrain indicates datasets used for supervised pretraining. *: published results.
Table 2: Runtime analysis of per-frame speed (ms) and FLOPs. The number of input frames aredifferent across models: * 1 frame (since it is a 2D CNN), f 16 frames, ^ 25 frames.
Table 3: Results from the self-supervised setting. Column Compressed indicates the methodsthat learn directly from compressed videos without decoding them. Modality indicates whethera method used only visual (V) modality or audio-visual modalities (A+V). Pretrain indicatesdatasets used for self-supervised pretraining. t based on an official implementation by the authors.
Table 4: IMRNet architecture details. We show two versions of IMRNet with different backbones:3D ResNet-18 and 3D ResNet-50. We denote the input dimensions by {temporal size, spatial size2},kernels by {temporal size, spatial size2, channel size} and strides by {temporal stride, spatial stride2}.
