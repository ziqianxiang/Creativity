Table 1: Experiment results on the synthetic data under setting (c) as described in Sections 3.2 and3.3. The average test R2 from 100 trials is reported (the larger the better). The asterisk markers, *,**, and ***, indicate the difference between a variant of CopulaGNN and its GNN base model isstatistically significant by a pairwise t-test at significance levels of 0.1, 0.05, and 0.01, respectively.
Table 2: Experiment results on regression tasks of the U.S. Election dataset (with continuous out-come variables). The average test R2 from 10 trials is reported (the larger the better). The asteriskmarkers and the (±) error bar indicate the same meaning as in Table 1.
Table 3: Experiment results on regression tasks with count outcome variables. The average test R2(deviance) from 50 trials is reported (the larger the better). The asterisk markers and the (±) errorbar indicate the same meaning as in Table 1.
