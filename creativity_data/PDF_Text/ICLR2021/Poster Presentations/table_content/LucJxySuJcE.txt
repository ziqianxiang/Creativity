Large perturbations increases the likelihood that inputs map to different indices. Averaging overa a large set of such perturbed inputs improves the estimation of the average prediction. We evaluatethe efficacy of such an adaptive attack empirically. We perform an adaptive version of KnockoffNetsattack by using the average predictions over K = 5 perturbed inputs to train the clone model. Notethat such an averaging attack requires a 5-fold increase in the query budget to carry out. We use acombination of random affine transforms (rotation, translation, scaling, shear) and random changesto brightness, contrast, color and hue of an image to obtain the perturbed inputs {x0j}jk=1from theoriginal input x. Our results comparing the clone accuracy obtained from this adaptive attack com-pared to the non-adaptive attack on EDM and the single undefended model are shown in Table 5.
Table 6: Evaluation of EDM against KnockoffNets with a larger clone model. Using a larger clonemodel yields similar clone accuracies as the original clone model.
Table 7: Evaluations with a higher attack query budget of 100K queries. EDM continues to producelower clone accuracy compared to the undefended baseline even with a higher query budget.
