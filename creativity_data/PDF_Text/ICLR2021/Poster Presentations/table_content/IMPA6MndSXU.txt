Table 1: Comparison with the baselines. Domain translation accuracy and FID obtained on MNIST(M) rSVHN (S) for the different methods considered. The last column is the test classificationaccuracy of the classifier used to compute the metric. *: Using weak supervision.
Table 2: Comparison with the baselines. Comparing the FID obtained on Sketch→Real for thebaselines and our method. We compute the FID per class and over all the categories.
Table 3: Studies on the effect of the translation accuracy on Sketches→Reals on (a) Ablating each lossby setting their coefficient λ =0. (b) Methods to condition the translation network on the semantics:Not conditioning, conditioning the content representation with categorical semantics, conditioningthe content representation with VGG, and conditioning the style with categorical semantics.
Table 4: Additional quantitative comparisons with the baselines. We qualitatively compare thebaselines using all the Sketches→Reals categories using LPIPS (higher is better), NBD and JSD(lower is better).
