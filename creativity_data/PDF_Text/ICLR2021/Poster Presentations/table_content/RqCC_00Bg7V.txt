We ensure that the same start states aresampled at every validation iteration by setting the seed value to a pre-defined validation seed, which is keptconstant across different runs of the algorithm with different training seeds. This helps ensure consistencyin evaluating different runs of the algorithm. For all our experiments we set N =40 and Neval =30.
