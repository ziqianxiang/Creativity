Table 1: Performance evaluation of popular keypoint based detectors and two anchor-baesd detectors.
Table 2: Ablation study on different components in PolarNet. Models are trained on COCO train2017and tested on COCO val2017 with ResNet-50.
Table 3: Comparison of PolarNet with other state-of-the-art two-stage or one-stage detectors (single-model results). All models were trained on COCO train set and tested on test-dev set. The “++”means the improved inference version of the proposed algorithm, i.e., inference with multi-scale andaspect-ratios, which is widely used in literature.
