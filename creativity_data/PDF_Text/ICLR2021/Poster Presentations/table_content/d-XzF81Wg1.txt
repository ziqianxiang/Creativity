Table 1: Accuracy on CIFAR-10 dataset for Wide-Resnet-28-10.
Table 2: Accuracy on Imagenet dataset for Resnet-50. Functional L2 with proper initialization allowsus to match the generalization of networks trained with batch normalization.
Table 3: Accuracy drop from 50% Dropout at test time for Resnet-50 models trained without Dropouton Imagenet. Networks regularized with BatchNorm or embedding L2 are considerably more robustto Dropout than the baseline.
Table 4: Accuracy on Imagenet dataset for Efficienet-B8.
