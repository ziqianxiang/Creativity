For TSP and CVRP instances with 95, 100 and 105 nodes there is no notable performancedifference, which shows the ability of our model to generalize well to instances that are slightlydifferent than the training instances. This is an important aspect for the application of our method inpractice. For instances with 125 and 150 nodes the performance is significantly worse. We note thatimpaired performance on instances that differ substantially from the instances seen during trainingis to be expected. However, this does not severely limit the applicability of our method because thereare many scenarios in which the distribution of encountered instances does not change frequently.
