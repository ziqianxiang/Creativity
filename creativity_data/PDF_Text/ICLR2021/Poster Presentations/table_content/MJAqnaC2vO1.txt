Table 1: Revisiting mainstream metrics for semantic segmentation. The metrics with f measure thesegmentation accuracy on the whole image. The metrics with * focus on the boundary quality.
Table 2: Performance of different losses on PASCAL VOC and Cityscapes segmentation. The resultsof each loss function's target metrics are underlined. The scores whose difference with the highestis less than 0.3 are marked in bold.
