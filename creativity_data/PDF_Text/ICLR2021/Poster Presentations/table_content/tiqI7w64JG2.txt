Table 1: The number of equivalence classes of rooted graphs induced by GNN and GA-MLP on node classification datasets with node features removed.
Table 2: MSE loss divided by label variance or counting attributed walks on the Cora graph and RRG. The models denoted as “+” contain twice as many powers of the operator.
Table 3: The number of equivalence classes of graphs induced by GNN and GA-MLP on real datasets with node features removed. The last row gives the ground-truth number of isomorphism classes of graphs computed from the implementation of Ivanov et al. (2019).
