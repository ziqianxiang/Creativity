Table 1: Counter-balancing of conditions in Experiment II. In total, 13 naive and 10 lay partic-ipants are tested. Each “batch block” contains 20 feature maps (sampled from five layers and allInception module branches). Batches indicate which batch number the natural query (and referenceimages) are taken from.
Table 2: Feature maps analyzed in Experiment I. For each of the 9 layers with an Inception module,one randomly chosen feature map per branch (1 × 1, 3 × 3, 5 × 5 and pool) and one additionalhand-picked feature map (highlighted with *) are used.
Table 3: Feature maps analyzed in Experiment II. Four sets of feature maps (batch blocks A to D)are sampled: For every second layer with an Inception module (5 layers in total), one feature mapis randomly selected per branch of the Inception module (1 × 1, 3 × 3, 5 × 5 and pool). For thepractice, catch and intuitiveness trials additional randomly chosen feature maps are used.
