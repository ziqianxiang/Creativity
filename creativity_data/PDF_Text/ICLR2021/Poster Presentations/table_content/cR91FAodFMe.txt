Table 1: AudioGoal navigation results. Our audio-visual waypoints navigation model (AV-WaN) reaches thegoal faster (higher SPL) and it is more efficient (higher SNA) compared to the state-of-the-art. SPL, SR, SNAare shown as percentages. For all metrics, higher is better. (H) denotes a hierarchical model.
Table 2: Ablation study for AV-WaN. Results are averaged over 5 test runs; all standard deviations are â‰¤ 0.5.
Table 3: Summary of methods. I(A, B) denotes the intersection of A and B. The DoA predictor and thestopping function in the Direction Follower and Frontier waypoints are trained but their waypoints are computedanalytically. In constrast, Supervised Waypoints trains its waypoint predictor with supervised learning (SL).
