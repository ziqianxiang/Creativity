We directly take a well-trained Twin-L2O model formatrix game in Section 4.2, where the matrix A ∈ R5×5 and A%,j 〜 BernOUlli(0.5) ∙ U[—1,1],and the coordinates of initial optimization variables x and y are independently sampled fromU [—1, 1]. During testing, in addition to testing the Twin-L2O model on the testing data from this seendistribution, we also evaluate it on unseen data, whose A is now sampled from an intentionally verydistinct distribution: A%,j 〜Bernoulli(1.0) ∙ U[—8,8]. X and y are initialized in the same manner.
