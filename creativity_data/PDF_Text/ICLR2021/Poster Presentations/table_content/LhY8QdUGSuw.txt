Table 1: Task Semantics and forgetting in ImageNet Here a ResNet50 is first trained (task 1) to classifyeither 10 animals, 10 artifacts or 10 animals and artifacts (chosen randomly from ImageNet). The network isthen trained (task 2) to either classify 10 different animals or 10 different artifacts. The table shows performancedrop on Task 1 after Task 2 training. Similar to Figure 8, when Task 1 is either animals or artifacts (top partof table), similar tasks forget less, while when Task 1 is both animals and artifacts, similar tasks show greaterforgetting (bottom part of table).
