Table 1: Merge operations (N(X), Amax) 7→ (N(X), Amax), according to type of layer `. Ak denotesthe slice of A corresponding to data point k. ' denotes all of the network UP to and including '. Readexpressions like A — K + aW as A+ — K + A+W; A- - K + A-W for all i.
Table 2: Results on test data after extraction of linear terms. Column 1: Agreement of network Nwith extracted function N(X). Columns 2&3: Multi-class accuracy for N and N(X). All values areaverages over 5 runs and over each of the architectures in table 3 in section D of the appendix.
