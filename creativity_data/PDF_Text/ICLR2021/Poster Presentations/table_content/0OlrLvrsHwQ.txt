Let a GNN model bedenoted by M(φ(A), X), taking as input a non-parametrised function of the adjacency matrixφ(A) : [0, 1]n×n → Rn×n and an attribute matrix (in case of an attributed graph) X ∈ Rn×d. Fur-ther, let K denote the number of aggregation layers that M consists of. The Parametrised GraphShift Operator (PGSO) formulation transforms the GNN model M(φ(A), X) into the GNN-PGSOmodel M0(γ(A, S), X). Moreover, we define the GNN-mPGSO model M00(γ[K] (A, S[K] ), X),where γ[K] (A, S[K]) = [γ(A, S1), ..., γ(A, SK)], i.e., we assign each GNN layer a different param-eter tuple Sl for l ∈ {1, . . . , K}.
