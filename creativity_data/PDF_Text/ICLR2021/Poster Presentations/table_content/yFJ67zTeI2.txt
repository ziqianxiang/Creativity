Table 1: PCK@0.1 score for keypoint localization with different percentage of labeled images. Wereport mean and standard deviation from three runs for different randomly sampled labeled subsets.
Table 2: Ablation study on LSP. We isolate gains from each unsupervised loss to evaluate the con-tribution of each constraint. SC - semantic consistency TE - transformation equivariance and TI -transformation invariance. TE is not evaluated separately because it does not optimize both repre-sentations. Results are reported on one run.
Table 3: Influence of the amount of unlabeled data. We train our model with the fixed 5% oflabeled data and vary the amount of unlabeled data. Results are reported on one run. The results arecompared with the supervised baseline (SB) trained with the same labeled data.
