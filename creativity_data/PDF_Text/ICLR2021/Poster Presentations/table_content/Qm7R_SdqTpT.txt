Table 1: Quantitative results on KTH, BAIR, Human3.6M datasets. For the FVD Score, all methods use thebest matching sample out of 100 random samples and lower numbers are better. For the Diversity Score, wecompute the score across 50 generated samples, for 500 starting sequences, and higher numbers are better.
