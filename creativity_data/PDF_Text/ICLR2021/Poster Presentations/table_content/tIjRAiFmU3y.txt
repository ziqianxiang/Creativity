Even though our method is designed for the real-world imagedenoising, we evaluate the performance of this method on synthetic noises. We test two differentGaussian denoising methods, NLM and BM3D. Two datasets are used, one is the Set 9 (Ulyanovet al., 2018) with 9 classic color images and the other is BSD 68 (Krull et al., 2019a) with 68 gray-scale images. We test four noisy levels: σ = 25, 50, 75, 100, and all noisy images are quantized into8-bits for simulating the common JPG images. The results are given in Table 3 we find even thoughthe noise distribution is Gaussian, two denoising methods can benefit from our approach more orless.
