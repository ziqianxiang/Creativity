Table 1: Results obtained on the QM9 dataset Ramakrishnan et al. (2014) for different design choicesin the TFN architecture. Results are reported for the homo target variable, and are multiplied by103.	_________________________________________________________________________________Model variant	Mean `1 errorOrder 0 irreps	111.2 ± 0.3Order 0-1 irreps	82.1 ± 0.4Order 0-2 irreps	62.1 ± 1.5Order 0-3 irreps	53.2 ± 1.9Order 0-4 irreps	51.2 ± 0.4Order 0-3 irreps without non-linearity	53.1 ± 0.8Order 0-3 irreps + self-interaction only in the final layer	55.2 ± 0.3This section provides an experimental evaluation of different design choices of the TFN architecture,inspired by our theoretical analysis. We study the following questions:1.	The importance of non-linear activation. Our proof shows that using non-linear acti-vation functions is not necessary for proving universality. Here, we empirically test thepossibility of removing these layers.
