Table 1: Low-shot image classification on both VOC07 and Places205 datasets using linear SVMs trained onfixed representations. All methods were pretrained on ImageNet-1M dataset for 200 epochs (except for Jigsawtrained on ImageNet-14M). We vary the number of labeled examples k and report the mAP (for VOC) andaccuracy (for Places) across 5 runs. We use the released pretrained model for MoCo, and re-implement SimCLR.
Table 2: Semi-supervised learning on ImageNet. We report top-5 accuracy on the ImageNet validation set ofself-supervised models that are finetuned on 1% or 10% of labeled data.ä¸ƒ SimCLR, bYoL, and SwAV use alarge batch size of 4096. ^: SwAV uses multi-crop augmentation.
Table 3: Image classification with linear models. We report top-1 accuracy. Numbers with * are from releasedpretrained model; all other numbers are adopted from corresponding papers.
