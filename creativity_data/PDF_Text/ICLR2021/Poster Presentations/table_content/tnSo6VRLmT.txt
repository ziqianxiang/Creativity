Table 1: CP results for specific tolerance levels . Each line shows the empirical accuracy (Acc.) andthe (raw) size of the prediction set for our two methods as compared to regular CP, per target accuracyrate (1 - ). The amortized computation cost of the cascade, a consequence of pruning, is also given.
Table C.1: Nonconformity measures used in our experiments.
Table D.1: CP results on the SQuAD 2.0 dataset.
Table D.2: Non-CP baseline results on the test set for different target accuracy values. We comparethe predictive efficiencies of the CP methods (|Cn | and |Cnmin |) to those of the baseline methods (|B|).
