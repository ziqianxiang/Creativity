Table 1: Performance of RAPID and the ablations on MiniGrid environments. The mean maximumreturns and standard deviations are reported. MR stands for MultiRoom; KC stands for KeyCorridor.
Table 2: Common hyperparameters of the proposed RAPID (top) and the hyperparameters of PPObaseline (bottom).
Table 3: The calculation of local and global scores for all the environments. Note that if the statespace is continuous. We disable the global score since counting continuous states is meaningless. Apossible solution is to use pseudo-counts (Bellemare et al., 2016; Ostrovski et al., 2017).
