We see that our test fails to reject SenSR, theclassifier we found individually fair, for any value of T verifying our Type I error guarantees in prac-tice. Rejection of the unfair classifiers requires sufficiently large T , supporting our recommendationfor Type II error control in practice.
Table 2: Choice of hyperparameters for Baseline and ProjectParameters learning_rate batch_size num_stepsChoice	10-4	250	8KF Additional Adult experiment detailsF.1 Data preprocessingThe continuous features in Adult are: Age, fnlwgt, capital-gain, capital-loss,hours-per-week, and education-num. The categorical features are: work-class,education, marital-status, occupation, relationship, race, sex,native-country. The detailed descriptions can be found in Dua & Graff (2017). We removefnlwgt, education, native-country from the features. race and sex are consideredas protected attributes and they are not included in feature vectors for classification. race is treatedas binary attribute: White and non-White. We remove any data-point with missing entry and end uphaving 45222 data-points.

Examining the trade-off between individual and group fairness, we see that both SenSR and Reductions improve allfairness metrics in comparison to the baseline. However, improvement of individual fairness withReductions is marginal. SenSR provides a sizeable improvement of gender AOD, but only a marginalimprovement of race AOD.
