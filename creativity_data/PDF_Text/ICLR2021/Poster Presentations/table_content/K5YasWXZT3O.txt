Table 1: TERM is competitive with robust regres- Table 2: TERM is competitive with robust classificationsion baselines, particularly in high noise regimes. baselines, and is superior in high noise regimes.
Table 3: Hierarchical TERM can address both class imbalance and noisy samples.
Table 4: Applications and their correspondingsolvers.
Table 5: An alternative noise setup involving both feature noise and label noise. Similarly, TERM with t V 0significantly outperforms several baseline objectives for noisy outlier mitigation.
Table 6: A complete comparison including two MentorNet variants. TERM is able to match the performance ofMentorNet-DD, which needs additional clean labels.
Table 7: Both q-FFL and TERM can encourage more uniform accuracy distributions across the devices infederated networks while maintaining similar average performance.
Table 8: TERM (t “ 0.1) is competitive with strong baselines in generalization. TERM (t “ 50) outperformsERM` (with decision threshold changed for providing fairness) and is competitive with RObUStRegRiSk' withno need for extra hyperparameter tuning.
