Table 1: Mass estimation: ▽ Sim obtains precisemass estimates, comparing favourably even with ap-proaches that require 3D supervision (diffphysics).
Table 2: Rigid-body parameter estimation: ▽ Sim esti-mates contact parameters (elasticity, friction) to a highdegree of accuracy, despite estimating them from video.
Table 3: Parameter estimation of deformable objects: We estimate per-particle masses and material properties(for solid def. objects) and per-particle velocities for cloth. In the case of cloth, there is a perceivable performancedrop in diffphysics, as the center of mass of a cloth is often outside the body, which results in ambiguity.
Table 4: (Left) Impact of imperfect models: The accuracy of physical parameters estimated by ▽ Sim isimpacted by the choice of dynamics and graphics (rendering) models. We find that the system is more sensitiveto the choice of dynamics models than to the rendering engine used. (Right) Timing analysis: We report runtimein simulation steps / second (Hz). ▽ Sim is significantly faster than real-time, even for complex geometries.

Table 6: An overview of optimizable parameters in ▽ Sim. Table columns are (in order, from left to right):Initial particle positions (pos), Initial particle velocities (vel), Per-particle mass (mass), Initial object orientation(rot), Spring rest lengths (rest), Spring stiffnesses (stiff), Spring damping coefficients (damp), Actuationparameters (actuation), Gravity (g), Friction parameters μ, Elasticity parameters (e), External force parameters(ext forces).
