Table 1: Testing accuracy of different models on RAVEN and neutral regime of PGM. Aux meansauxiliary annotations. Avg represents the average accuracy, DCNet-RC denotes removing the rulecontrast module and DCNet-CC denotes removing choice contrast module in our method. “-” indi-cates the results are not reported in the published papers. “#” represents the result is obtained fromZhuo & Kankanhalli (2020). “*” represents the result is obtained by running the released code ofJahrens & Martinetz (2020) with its default parameters.

Training Set Size	CoPINet	DCNet658 (1.57%)	44.48	60.09 (+15.61)1, 316 (3.13%)	57.69	71.91 (+14.22)2, 625 (6.25%)	65.55	79.75 (+14.20)5, 250 (12.5%)	74.53	84.42 (+9.89)10, 500 (25.0%)	80.92	87.95 (+7.03)21, 000 (50.0%)	86.43	91.31 (+4.88)42, 000 (100%)	91.42	93.87 (+2.45)Table 3 shows the comparison results of CoPINet and DCNet on the RAVEN dataset. It can be seenthat DCNet performs better than CoPINet on all subsets. Especially, when half the training samplesare provided, DCNet achieves a comparable accuracy to CoPINet that trains on the full dataset, i.e.
