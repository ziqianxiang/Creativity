Table 1: Natural, adversarial and certifiable accuracy for various ACE models. The training methodsCOLT, LiRPA with loss fusion, IBP and CROWN-IBP (C-IBP) used for the training of certification-(CERT) and selection-networks (SELECT) are indicated separately.
Table 2: Certifiable accuracy of the certification-network depending on selection decision using aCOLT trained Conv3 selection- and certification-network for CIFAR-10 at âˆž = 2/255.
Table 3: Network architectures of the certification- and selection-networks used for CIFAR-10 andImageNet200 (Conv3 (IN)). All layers are followed by a ReLU activation. The last fully connectedlayer is omitted. For Conv3 (IN) a global average pooling layer precedes this last linear layer.
