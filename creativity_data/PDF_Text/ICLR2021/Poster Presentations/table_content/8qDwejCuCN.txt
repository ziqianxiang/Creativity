Table 3: Signal distributions for each time series feature of the simulated datasetIn the state 1, the correlated features are generated by a Gaussian Process (GP) with a periodic kernel.
Table 4: Downstream classification performance for different window size δ on the simulated datasetA.5 Clustering metricsMost cluster validity measures assess certain structural properties of a clustering result. In ourevaluation, we have used two measures, namely the Silhouette score and Davies-Bouldin index, toevaluate the representations’ clustering quality. Davies-Bouldin measures intra-cluster similarity(coherence) and inter-cluster differences (separation). Let C = {C1, ..., Ck} be a clustering of a set Dof objects. The Davies-Bouldin score is evaluated as follows:DB1kk∑Smaxji=1S(C) + S(C)δCi Cj-(4)Where S(C) measures the scatter within a cluster, and δ is a cluster to cluster distance measure. Onthe other hand, the silhouette score measures how similar an object is to its cluster compared to otherclusters. Both measures are commonly used for the evaluation of clustering algorithms. A comparisonof 2 metrics has shown that the Silhouette index produces slightly more accurate results in some cases.
