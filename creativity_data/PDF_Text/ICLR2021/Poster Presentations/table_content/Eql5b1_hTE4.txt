Table 1: Mean and standard deviations of classification accuracy (percentage) on synthetic noisydatasets with different noise levels. The experimental results are reported over five trials. The bestmean results are bolded.
Table 2: The located constant on synthetic noisy datasets with different noise levels. The result withan Underline means that the located constant and the noise rate are numerically equal.
Table 3: Classification accuracy (percentage) on Food-101 dataset. The best result is in bold.
Table 4: Top-1 validation accuracies (percentage) on clean ILSVRC12 validation set of Inception-ResNet v2 models trained on WebVision dataset, under the “Mini” setting in (Jiang et al., 2018; Chenet al., 2019; Ma et al., 2020). The best result is in bold.
