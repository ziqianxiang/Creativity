Table 1: An observational study with 60 users inthe handwriting recognition domain that addresses Q3:does X2T personalize the interface to different inputstyles? We measure action prediction accuracy across1000 interactions, and randomly sample users 1-4 fromthe pool of 60 users. The interface trained on user i issubstantially more accurate when evaluated on inputsfrom user i than on inputs from user j, suggesting thatthe learned interface is personalized to each individualuser.
Table 2: Subjective evaluations from the 12 participants in the online user study. Means reported below forresponses on a 7-point Likert scale, where 1 = Strongly Disagree, 4 = Neither Disagree nor Agree, and 7 =Strongly Agree. p-values from a one-way repeated measures ANOVA with the presence of X2T as a factorinfluencing responses.
