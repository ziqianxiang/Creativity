Table 1: VTAB-1k results of different selection algorithms, using full experts trained on JFT. Theaverage accuracy across each group of tasks and across all VTAB is reported. In each dataset, themedian accuracy over 30 runs is used. Bootstrapped confidence intervals at 95% level are included.
Table 2: VTAB-1k results of the baseline models and different expert architectures using kNNselection, pre-trained on ImageNet21k (IN21k) and JFT. The average accuracy across each group oftasks and across all 19 tasks is shown. In each dataset, the median accuracy over 30 runs is used.
