Table 1: Datasets Statistics. CUB, AWA2 and aPY are three standard ZSL benchmarks, whiletieredImageNet-Segregated/Mixed are two new large-scale ones proposed by us with different dis-crepancy between seen and unseen classes. “Tr-S”, “Te-S” and “Te-U” denote seen classes in train-ing, seen classes in test and unseen classes in test.
Table 2: Performance of existing ZSL models and IPN on five datasets (generalized ZSL setting),where “S” denotes the per-class accuracy (%) on seen classes, “U” denotes the per-class accuracy(%) on unseen classes and “H” denotes their harmonic mean.
Table 3: Per-class accuracy (%) on unseen classes achieved by existing ZSL models and IPN on fivedatasets (the ZSL setting).
Table 4: Top-k accuracy for the different models on the ImageNet dataset. Accuracy when onlytesting on unseen classes. Results are taken from (Kampffmeyer et al., 2019).
