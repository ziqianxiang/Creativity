Table 1: Evaluation accuracy on ordered and permuted pixel-by-pixel MNIST.
Table 2: Evaluation on TIMIT using 1 layer models. The mean squared error (MSE) is computes thedistance between the predicted and actual log-magnitudes of each predicted frame in the sequence.
Table 3: Summary of Hessian-based robustness metrics and resilience to adversarial attacks.
Table 4: Sensitivity to random initialization evaluated over 10 runs.
Table 5: Evaluation accuracy on pixel-by-pixel CIFAR-10 and noise padded CIFAR-10.
Table 6: Evaluation accuracy on PTB for character-level prediction for different sequence lengthsT. The * indicate results that were adopted from Kerg et al. (2019).
Table 7: Evaluation accuracy on PTB for word-level prediction. The * indicate results adopted fromKusupati et al. (2018). Note that here the parameters for the hidden-to-hidden units are reported.
