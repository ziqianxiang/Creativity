Table 1: Comparison of different methods on the COV and MAT scores. Top 4 rows: deep generative modelsfor molecular conformation generation. Bottom 5 rows: different methods that involve an additional rule-basedforce field to further optimize the generated structures.
Table 2: Comparison of distances density modeling with different methods. We compare the marginal distri-bution of single (p(duv |G)), pair (p(duv, dij |G)) and all (p(d|G)) edges between C and O atoms. Moleculargraphs G are taken from the test set of ISO17. We take two metrics into consideration: 1) median MMDbetween the ground truth and generated ones, and 2) mean ranking (1 to 3) based on the MMD metric.
Table 3: Conformation Diversity. Mean and Std represent the corresponding mean and standard deviation ofpairwise RMSD between the generated conformations per molecule.
Table 4: Comparison of different methods on the JUNK scores. Top 4 rows: deep generative models formolecular conformation generation. Bottom 5 rows: different methods that involve an additional rule-basedforce field to further optimize the generated structures.
