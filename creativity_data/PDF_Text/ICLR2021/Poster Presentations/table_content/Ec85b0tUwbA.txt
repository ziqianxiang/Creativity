Table 1: Test F1 scores for four sub-trees of the WordNet noun hierarchy. The first column indicatesthe number of nodes in each sub-tree for the training and test times. For each setting, we reportthe 95% confidence intervals for three different trials. Note that the number of parameters of theEuclidean MLR and our approach is D + 1, whereas for the MLR layer of HNNs, it is 2D.
Table 2: Negative log-likelihood on the test set. For each setting, We report the 95% confidenceintervals for five trials. The numbers in brackets indicate the diverged trials, the final scores of WhichWere higher than 10.0, and those trials are not accounted into the reported scores.
Table 3: BLEU-4 scores (Papineni et al., 2002) on the test sets neWstest2013. The target sentencesWere decoded using beam search With a beam size of five. D indicates the dimensions of tokenembeddings and the final MLR layer.
