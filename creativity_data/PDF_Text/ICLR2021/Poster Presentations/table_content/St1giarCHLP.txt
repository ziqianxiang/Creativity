Table 1: CIFAR10 and CelebA image generation measured in FID. η = 1.0 and σ are cases ofDDPM (although Ho et al. (2020) only considered T = 1000 steps, and S < T can be seen assimulating DDPMs trained with S steps), and η = 0.0 indicates DDIM.
Table 2: Reconstruction error with DDIM on CIFAR-10 test set, rounded to 10-4.
Table 3: LSUN Bedroom and Church image generation results, measured in FID. For 1000 stepsDDPM, the FIDs are 6.36 for Bedroom and 7.89 for Church.
