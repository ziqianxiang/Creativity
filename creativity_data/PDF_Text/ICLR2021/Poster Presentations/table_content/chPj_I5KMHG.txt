Table 1: L→G phase. Metrics are averaged over 10 seeds,stdev < 0.06 and 0.07 respectively.
Table 2: L→G→B phase. Mean ± stdevover 10 seeds.
Table 3: LGB-C performance in the L→G phase. Mean over 10 seeds. Stdev < 0.003 and 0.008 respectively.
Table 4: Sensorimotor learning hyperparameters used in decstr.
Table 5: List of instructions. Each of them specifies a shift of one predicate, either from false to true (0 → 1)or true to false (1 → 0). block A and block B represent two different blocks from {red, blue, green}.
Table 6: lgg hyperparameter search. In bold are the selected hyperparameters.
