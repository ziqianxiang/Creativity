Table 6: Reduction of time cost for a batch on ICEWS14Segment Sum Given a vector x ∈ Rd and another vector s ∈ Rd that indicates the segmentindex of each element in x, the segment sum operator returns the summation for each segment. Forexample, we have x = [3, 1, 5]T and s = [0, 0, 1]T, which means the first two element of x belongto the 0th segment and the last elements belongs to the first segment. The segment sum operatorreturns [4, 5]T as the output. It is realized by creating a sparse matrix Y ∈ Rn×d, where n denotesthe number of segments. We set 1 in positions {(s[i], i), ∀i ∈ {0, ..., d}} of Y and pad otherpositions with zeros. Finally, we multiply Y with x to get the sum of each segment.
