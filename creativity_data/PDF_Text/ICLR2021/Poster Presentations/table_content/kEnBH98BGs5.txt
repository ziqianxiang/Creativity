Table 1: Pearson correlations of weight change kw - w-i k22 and validation prediction changekfw(Xval) - fw-i (Xval)k22 norms computed with influence functions and linearized neural networkswith their corresponding measures computed for standard neural networks with retraining.
Table 2: Details of experiments presented in Table 1. For influence functions, we add a dumpingterm with magnitude 0.01 whenever `2 regularization is not used (i.e. Î» = 0).
