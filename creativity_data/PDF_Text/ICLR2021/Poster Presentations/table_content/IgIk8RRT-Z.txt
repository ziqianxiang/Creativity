Table 1: Training schedule, duration, and GPU hour comparisons for OFA and CompOFA. Com-pOFA reduces the training time of OFA by 50% with a fixed kernel space. The columns K, D, Wrepresent the sets of possible model dimensions (as in Section 3.1). While CompOFA allows allsub-networks to be trained after the teacher network, OFA progresses to the full search space withmultiple phases of similar duration.

Table 2: Comparing OFA and CompOFA on training monetary cost, CO2 emission and averagesearch duration. Monetary cost is based on hourly price of 1 NVIDIA V100 on Google Cloud. CO2emission estimation is based on Strubell et al. (2019). Search time is reported for an average overlatency targets, without the use of latency estimatorsMethod	Cost	CO2 emission	Avg.

OFA runs NAS with a settingof N = 500 iterations for a population of size |P | = 100. Figure 9 demonstrates that the searchtime of NAS could further be reduced by reducing the number of iterations to N = 300 and N = 50for CompOFA Elastic-Kernel and CompOFA Fixed-Kernel respectively, without losing out on theirPareto-optimality. Coupled with the removal of the latency predictor, these CompOFA-specificoptimizations to the search are effective in reducing the search time and improving direct usabilityof CompOFA.
