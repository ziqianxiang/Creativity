Table 1: Final policy performances on the various drone reacher (DR) and manipulator reacher (MR)tasks, from egocentric acquired (Ego Acq) or freeform acquired (Freeform Acq) cameras, with thenetwork conditioned on either target color or shape. The values indicate the mean number of targetsreached in the 100 time-step episode, and the standard deviation, when averaged over 256 runs.
Table 2: Targets reached and number of collision for the obstacle avoidance drone task. Full detailsof this experiment are provided in Appendix A.2.
Table 3: Reacher performances both with and without camera transfer, using the same notation andsetup as described in Table 1. Successful transfers are highlighted in bold.
