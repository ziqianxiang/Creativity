Table 1: Comparisons between our method of estimating concentration with '∞ -norm distance andthe method proposed by Mahloujifar et al. (2019b) for different settings. For N (0, I784) with α = 0.5and = 1.0, the previous method is unable to produce nontrivial estimate. Results for the previousmethod are taken directly from the original paper (except for the Gaussian results).
