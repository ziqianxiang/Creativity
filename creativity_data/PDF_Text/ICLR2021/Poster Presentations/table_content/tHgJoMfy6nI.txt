Table 1: PG experiment results on few-shot CIL CUB200 measuring (a) PG-ACC (%) and PG-BWT (%) and(b) precision and recall averaged over all tasks. P ri,i and Rei,i evaluate the pointing game on each task tidirectly after the model has been trained on ti. PrT,i and ReT,i are obtained by the evaluation for task ti usingthe model trained for all T tasks.

Results for iTAML (Rajasegaran et al., 2020), BiC (Wu et al., 2019), andEEIL (Castro et al., 2018) are produced with their original implementation while EWC (Kirkpatricket al., 2017) and LwF (Li & Hoiem, 2016) are re-implemented by us. Results are averaged over 3runs. Figure 3a in the main paper is generated using numbers in this Table.
