Table 2: Results of all attack methods against the models with defense on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet(bold: the best; underline: the second best). The mean and standard deviation of PA-ACC and Nflipare calculated by attacking the 1,000 images. Our method is denoted as TA-LBF. ∆Nflip denotesthe increased Nflip compared to the corresponding result in Table 1.
Table 3: Running time (seconds) of attacking one image for different methods. The mean andstandard deviation are calculated by 10 attacks.
Table 4: Results of all attack methods against models trained with piece-wise clustering on CIFAR-10 (bold: the best; underline: the second best). We adopt different clustering coefficients, including0.0005, 0.005, and 0.01. The mean and standard deviation of PA-ACC and Nflip are calculated byattacking the 1,000 images. Our method is denoted as TA-LBF. ∆Nflip denotes the increased Nflipcompared to the corresponding result in Table 1.
Table 5: Results of all attack methods against models with a larger capacity on CIFAR-10. We adopt3× and 4× width networks. The mean and standard deviation of PA-ACC and Nflip are calculatedby attacking the 1,000 images. ∆Nflip denotes the increased Nflip compared to the correspondingresult in Table 1._________________________________________________________________Model Width	Method	ACC (%)	PA-ACC (%)	ASR (%)	Nflip	∆Nflip	FT		86.96±2.79	100.0	4002.52±281.24	2495.01	TBT		90.67±5.23	74.1	504.70±20.44	258.003×	T-BFA	94.90	92.18±1.14	98.9	30.50±7.52	20.59	FSA		91.40±2.38	99.0	342.20±79.44	156.69	GDA		90.79±2.91	100.0	67.53±27.45	40.70	TA-LBF		91.42±2.81	100.0	12.29±4.18	6.72	FT		86.94±2.78	100.0	4527.68±369.35	3020.17	TBT		85.39±5.08	90.1	625.50±32.38	378.804×	T-BFA	95.02	92.49±i.22	99.4	19.14±5.04	9.23	FSA		91.60±2.42	98.7	338.93±100.12	153.42	GDA		90.76±3.00	100.0	66.92±40.32	40.09	TA-LBF		90.94±3.11	100.0	8.37±2.80	2.80F.2 Resistance to Larger Model CapacityBesides the results of networks with a 2× width shown in Section 4.3, we also evaluate all methodsagainst models with a 3× and 4× width.
