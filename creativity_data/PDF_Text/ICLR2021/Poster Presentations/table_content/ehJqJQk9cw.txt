Table 1: Personalized FL accuracy with pathological non-IID splits. Best results in bold. FedFomooutperforms or is competitive with prior work across settings, especially with larger populations.
Table 2: In-distribution federated accuracy with 15 clients, 100% participation, across heterogeneitylevels (measured by EMD). FedFomo performs better than or competitively with existing methods.

Table 4: In-distribution classification with differentially private federated learning. With DP-SGD,FedFomo maintains high personalization accuracy with reasonable privacy guarantees.
Table 5: In-distribution personalized federated classification on the CIFAR-100 dataset13Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021A.3 Client Weighting with PersonalizationIn-local vs out-of-local distribution personalization Following the visualizations for clientweights in the out-of-local distribution personalization setting (Fig. 4), we include additional visual-izations for the remaining clients (Fig. 6). For comparison, we also include the same visualizationsfor the 15 client 5 non-IID latent distribution setup on CIFAR-10, but when clients optimize for atarget distribution the same as their local training data’s (Fig. 7). In both, we use color to denote theclient’s local training data distribution, such that if FedFomo is able to identify the right clients tofederated with that client, we should see the weights for those colors increase or remain steady overfederation rounds, while all other client weights drop.
