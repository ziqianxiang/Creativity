Table 1: Average test negative log-likelihood (in nats) of tabular datasets in Papamakarios et al. (2017) fordensity estimation models (lower is better). Standard deviation is presented in the appendix E.4.
Table 2: Negative log-likelihood (in bits) on held-out test data (lower is better). * Taken from Durkan et al.
Table 3: Negative ELBO of VAE (lower is better).
