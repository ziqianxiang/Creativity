Table 1: Performance of MoE models with different number of experts and layers.
Table 2: Scalability of partitioned operators. Abbreviation for communication primitives: AR: AllReduce, AG:AllGather, CP: CollectivePermute, AA: AllToAll. *This is the dispatch Einsum in our model, where we setC to O(1/D). **I/O are the input/output feature dimensions, B is the batch dimension, X/Y are input spatialdimensions, and x/y are the kernal spatial dimensions.
Table 3: Dense language models benchmarks on TPU v3-2048. The model parameters are sharded across 2048TPU V3 cores. We measured the TPU matrix unit utilization and throughput for dense models with variousconfigurations.
