Table 1: Standard deviation, mean, and maximum performance on the development set of RTE, MRPC, andCoLA when fine-tuning BERT over 25 random seeds. Standard deviation: lower is better, i.e. fine-tuning is morestable. ? denotes significant difference (p < 0.001) when compared to the second smallest standard deviation.
Table 2: Dataset statistics and majority baselines.
Table 3: Hyperparameters used for fine-tuning.
Table 4: Standard deviation, mean, and maximum performance on the development set of SciTail when fine-tuning BERT over 25 random seeds. Standard deviation: lower is better, i.e. fine-tuning is more stable.
