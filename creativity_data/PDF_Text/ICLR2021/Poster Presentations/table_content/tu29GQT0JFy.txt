The categorical observation model also has a linear mapping to its logits. In bothlatent space and data space, we learn shared variance parameters in each dimension. The missingmodel is a logistic regression for each feature, with a shared weight across features and individualbiases for each feature. We use K = 20 importance samples during training, ReLU activations, abatch size of 100 and train for 10k iterations.
