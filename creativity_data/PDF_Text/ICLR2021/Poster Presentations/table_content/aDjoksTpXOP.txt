Table 1: Test accuracies on MNIST (left) and Fashion-MNIST (right) for RF and NTKkernels with varying numbers of layers L. We use kernel ridge regression on 50k samples,with λ optimized on a validation set of size 10k, and report mean and standard errorsacross 5 such random splits of the 60k training samples. For comparison, the Laplace kernelwith c = 1 yields accuracies 98.39 ± 0.02 on MNIST and 90.38 ± 0.06 on F-MNIST.
