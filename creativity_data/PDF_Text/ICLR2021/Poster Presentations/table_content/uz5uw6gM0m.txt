Table 1: R-Squared for SQL-style aggregation. A single network with one hidden layer gets highR-Squared values, and the error does not increase substantially if the complexity of the aggregation isincreased by increasing the number of columns in the WHERE clause.

In this experiment, the datais drawn from k clusters, and from a mixture of two well-separated Gaussians in each cluster. Datapoints from the two Gaussians within each cluster are assigned two different labels, for 2k labelsin total. Fig. 6a below shows an instance of this task in two dimensions, the red circles representthe clusters, and there are two classes drawn from well-separated Gaussians from each cluster. Inhigh dimensions, the clusters are very well-separated, and doing a k-means clustering to identifythe k cluster centers and then learning a simple linear classifier within each cluster gets near perfectclassification accuracy. Fig. 6b shows the performance of a single neural network trained on thistask (same as Fig. 3a in the main body). We can see that a single neural network still gets goodperformance with a modest increase in the required number of samples.
