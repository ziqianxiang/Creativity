Table 1: Comparison with Related Work. INTERPOLE satisfies our key criteria of (1) transparency by design,(2) partial observability, and (3) offline learning, and makes no assumptions w.r.t. unbiasedness of beliefs oroptimality of policies. Observations, beliefs, (optimal) q-values, actions, and policies are denoted z, b, q*, a, andπ; bold denotes learned quantities, italics are known (or queryable), and “f” denotes jointly-learned quantities.

To begin, we observe for the ADNI settingin Table 2 that Interpole performs first- or second-best across all three action-matching basedmetrics; where it comes second, it does so only by a small margin to R-BC (bearing in mind thatR-BC is specifically optimized for nothing but action-matching). Similarly for the DIAG setting, weobserve in Table 3 that Interpole performs the best in terms of stopping-time error. In other words,it appears that little—if any—imitation accuracy is lost by using Interpole as the model.
