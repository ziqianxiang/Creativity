Table 1: Computational complexity of the client up-dates for methods that use 5 local epochs measured inmilliseconds (% denotes relative increase).
Table 2: Statistics on the data and tasks. The number of examples per client are given with one standarddeviation across the corresponding set of clients (denoted with ±). See description of the tasks in the text.
Table 3: Comparison of FEDPA with baselines. All metrics were computed on the evaluation sets and averagedover the last 100 rounds before the round limit was reached. The “number of rounds to accuracy” was determinedbased on the 10-round running average crossing the threshold for the first time. The arrows indicate whetherhigher (↑) or lower (1) is better. The best performance in each column is denoted in bold.
Table 4: Selected optimizers for each task. For SGD, m denotes momentum. For Adam, β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.99.
Table 5: Hyperparameter grids for each task.
Table 6: The best selected hyperparameters for each task.
