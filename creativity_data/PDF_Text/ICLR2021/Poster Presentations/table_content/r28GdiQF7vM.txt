Table 1: Iteration complexity for different optimization algorithms to achieve a stated generalizationbound under Assumptions 1, 2. In the second column, we present the number of stochastic gradientevaluations to achieve excess generalization bounds O(l∕(nβ)). In the third column, We presentthe number of stochastic gradient evaluations to achieve generalization bounds O() if E[FS] = 0.
