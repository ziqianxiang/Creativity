Ab stract
In many scenarios, named entity recognition (NER) models severely suffer from
unlabeled entity problem, where the entities of a sentence may not be fully an-
notated. Through empirical studies performed on synthetic datasets, we find two
causes of performance degradation. One is the reduction of annotated entities
and the other is treating unlabeled entities as negative instances. The first cause
has less impact than the second one and can be mitigated by adopting pretraining
language models. The second cause seriously misguides a model in training and
greatly affects its performances. Based on the above observations, we propose a
general approach, which can almost eliminate the misguidance brought by unla-
beled entities. The key idea is to use negative sampling that, to a large extent,
avoids training NER models with unlabeled entities. Experiments on synthetic
datasets and real-world datasets show that our model is robust to unlabeled entity
problem and surpasses prior baselines. On well-annotated datasets, our model is
competitive with the state-of-the-art method1.
1	Introduction
Named entity recognition (NER) is an important task in information extraction. Previous methods
typically cast it into a sequence labeling problem by adopting IOB tagging scheme (Mesnil et al.,
2015; Huang et al., 2015; Ma & Hovy, 2016; Akbik et al., 2018; Qin et al., 2019). A representative
model is Bi-LSTM CRF (Lample et al., 2016). The great success achieved by these methods benefits
from massive correctly labeled data. However, in some real scenarios, not all the entities in the
training corpus are annotated. For example, in some NER tasks (Ling & Weld, 2012), the datasets
contain too many entity types or a mention may be associated with multiple labels. Since manual
annotation on this condition is too hard, some entities are inevitably neglected by human annotators.
Situations in distantly supervised NER (Ren et al., 2015; Fries et al., 2017) are even more serious.
To reduce handcraft annotation, distant supervision (Mintz et al., 2009) is applied to automatically
produce labeled data. As a result, large amounts of entities in the corpus are missed due to the
limited coverage of knowledge resources. We refer this to unlabeled entity problem, which largely
degrades performances of NER models.
There are several approaches used in prior works to alleviate this problem. Fuzzy CRF and Au-
toNER (Shang et al., 2018b) allow models to learn from the phrases that may be potential en-
tities. However, since these phrases are obtained through a distantly supervised phrase mining
method (Shang et al., 2018a), many unlabeled entities in the training data may still not be recalled. In
the context of only resorting to unlabeled corpora and an entity ontology, Mayhew et al. (2019); Peng
et al. (2019) employ positive-unlabeled (PU) learning (Li & Liu, 2005) to unbiasedly and consis-
tently estimate the task loss. In implementations, they build distinct binary classifiers for different
labels. Nevertheless, the unlabeled entities still impact the classifiers of the corresponding entity
types and, importantly, the model can’t disambiguate neighboring entities. Partial CRF (Tsuboi
et al., 2008) is an extension of commonly used CRF (Lafferty et al., 2001) that supports learning
from incomplete annotations. Yang et al. (2018); Nooralahzadeh et al. (2019); Jie et al. (2019) use
it to circumvent training with false negatives. However, as fully annotated corpora are still required

to get ground truth training negatives, this approach is not applicable to the situations where little or
even no high-quality data is available.
In this work, our goal is to study what are the impacts of unlabeled entity problem on the models
and how to effectively eliminate them. Initially, we construct some synthetic datasets and introduce
degradation rates. The datasets are constructed by randomly removing the annotated named entities
in well-annotated datasets, e.g., CoNLL-2003 (Sang & De Meulder, 2003), with different probabil-
ities. The degradation rates measure how severe an impact of unlabeled entity problem degrades
the performances of models. Extensive studies are investigated on synthetic datasets. We find two
causes: the reduction of annotated entities and treating unlabeled entities as negative instances. The
first cause is obvious but has far fewer influences than the second one. Besides, it can be mitigated
well by using a pretraining language model, like BERT (Devlin et al., 2019)), as the sentence en-
coder. The second cause seriously misleads the models in training and exerts a great negative impact
on their performances. Even in less severe cases, it can sharply reduce the F1 score by about 20%.
Based on the above observations, we propose a novel method that is capable of eliminating the mis-
guidance of unlabeled entities in training. The core idea is to apply negative sampling that avoids
training NER models with unlabeled entities.
Extensive experiments have been conducted to verify the effectiveness of our approach. Studies on
synthetic datasets and real-world datasets (e.g., EC) show that our model well handles unlabeled
entities and notably surpasses prior baselines. On well-annotated datasets (e.g., CoNLL-2003), our
model is competitive with the state-of-the-art method.
2	Preliminaries
In this section, we formally define the unlabeled entity problem and briefly describe a strong base-
line, BERT Tagging (Devlin et al., 2019), used in empirical studies.
2.1	Unlabeled Entity Problem
We denote an input sentence as X = [xi, χ2, ∙∙∙ , xn] and the annotated named entity set as y =
{y1,y2, ∙∙∙ ,ym}. n is the sentence length and m is the amount of entities. Each member yk
of set y is a tuple (ik, jk, lk). (ik, jk) is the span of an entity which corresponds to the phrase
Xikjk = [xik ,xik+1, •…，Xjk ] and Ik is its label. The unlabeled entity problem is defined as, due to
the limited coverage of machine annotator or the negligence of human annotator, some ground truth
entities ye of the sentence X are not covered by annotated entity set y.
For instance, given a sentence X = [Jack, and, Mary, are, from, New, York] anda labeled entity set
y = {(1, 1, PER)}, unlabeled entity problem is that some entities, like (6, 7, LOC), are neglected
by annotators. These unlabeled entities are denoted as ye = {(3, 3, PER), (6, 7, LOC)}.
2.2	BERT TAGGING
BERT Tagging is present in Devlin et al. (2019), which adopts IOB tagging scheme, where each
token xi in a sentence X is labeled with a fine-grained tag, such as B-ORG, I-LOC, or O. Formally,
its output is a n-length label sequence Z = [z1,z2, ∙∙∙ ,zn].
Formally, BERT tagging firstly uses BERT to get the representation hi for every token xi :
[hl, h2,…，hn]=BERT(x).	(1)
Then, the label distribution qi is computed as Softmax(Whi). In training, the loss is induced as
P1≤i≤n - log qi[zi]. At test time, it obtains the label for each token xi by arg maxqi.
3	Empirical Studies
To understand the impacts of unlabeled entity problem, we conduct empirical studies over multiple
synthetic datasets, different methods, and various metrics.

3.1	Preparations
Synthetic Datasets. We use synthetic datasets to simulate poorly-annotated datasets that contain
unlabeled entities. They are obtained by randomly removing the labeled entities of well-annotated
datasets with different masking probabilities p. The material datasets are CoNLL-2003 (Sang &
De Meulder, 2003) and OntoNotes 5.0 (Pradhan et al., 2013). The probabilities p are respectively
set as 0.0, 0.1, 0.2,…,0.9. In this way, 2 X 10 synthetic datasets are constructed.
Methods. We adopt two models. One of them is BERT Tagging, which has long been regarded
as a strong baseline. The other is LSTM Tagging that replaces the original encoder (i.e., BERT)
of BERT Tagging with LSTM (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997). We use it to study the effect of
using pretraining language model. To explore the negative impact brought by unlabeled entities in
training, we present an adjusted training loss for above two models:
X - logqi[zi] - X X - logqk[zk].	(2)
1≤i≤n	(i0,j0,l0)∈ye i0≤k≤j0
The idea here is to remove the incorrect loss incurred by unlabeled entities. Note that missed entity
set ye is reachable in synthetic datasets but unknown in real-world datasets.
Metrics. Following prior works, the F1 scores of models are tested by using conlleval script2 . We
also design two degradation rates to measure the different impacts of unlabeled entity problem. One
is erosion rate αp and the other is misguidance rate βp :
(3)
For a synthetic dataset with the masking probability being p, fp and fpa are the F1 scores of a model
and its adjusted version, respectively. Note that f0α corresponds to p = 0. Erosion rate αp measures
how severely the reduction of annotated entities degrades the F1 scores of a model. Misguidance
rate βp measures how seriously unlabeled entities misguide the model in training.

3.2	Overall Analysis
The left parts of Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 show the results of empirical studies, where We evaluate the
F1 scores of BERT Tagging and LSTM Tagging on 20 synthetic datasets. From them, we can
draw the following observations. Firstly, the significant downward trends of solid lines confirm the
fact that NER models severely suffer from unlabeled entity problem. For example, by setting the
masking probability as 0.4, the performance of LsTM Tagging decreases by 33.01% on CoNLL-
2003 and 19.58% on OntoNotes 5.0. secondly, in contrast, the dashed lines change very slowly,
indicating that the models with adjusted training loss (see Eq. (2)) are much less influenced by
the issue. For instance, when masking probability is 0.7, adopting adjusted loss preserves the F1
scores of BERT Tagging by 41.04% on CoNLL-2003 and 57.38% on OntoNotes 5.0. Lastly, for
high masking probabilities, even though the negative impact of unlabeled entities is eliminated by
adjusting the training loss, the performance still declines to a certain extent. For example, when
masking probability is set as 0.8, the F1 scores of adjusted LsTM Tagging decrease by 31.64% on
CoNLL-2003 and 17.22% on OntoNotes 5.0.
Reduction of Annotated Entities. From the last observation, we can infer that a cause of perfor-
mance degradation is the reduction of annotated entities. In the middle parts of Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, we
plot the change of erosion rates αp (see Eq. (2)) with respect to masking probabilities. We can see
that its impact is not very serious when in low masking probabilities but can’t be neglected when in
high ones. Besides, using pre-training language models greatly mitigates the issue. As an example,
when the probability is 0.8, on both CoNLL-2003 and OntoNotes 5.0, the erosion rates of adjusted
BERT Tagging are only about half of those of adjusted LsTM Tagging.
Misguidance of Unlabeled Entities. From the last two observations, we can conclude that the
primary cause is treating unlabeled entities as negative instances, which severely misleads the mod-
els during training. To better understand it, in the right parts of Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, we plot the change
of misguidance rates βp (see Eq. (3)) with masking probabilities. These rates are essentially the
percentage decreases of F1 scores. From them, we can see that the impact of misguidance is very
much serious even when in low masking probabilities.
4	Methodology
Motivated by sec. 3.2, we present a model that is robust to unlabeled entities.
4.1	Scoring Model with BERT
Based on the findings in sec. 3.2, we use BERT as the default encoder to mitigate the reduction of
annotated entities. specifically, given a sentence x, we firstly obtain the token representations hi
with Eq. (1). Then, we get the representation for every phrase xi,j as
Si,j = hi ㊉ hj ㊉(hi — hj)㊉(hi Θ hj),	(4)
where ㊉ is column-wise vector concatenation and Θ is element-wise vector product. The design
here is mainly inspired by Chen et al. (2017).

Finally, multi-layer perceptron (MLP) computes the label distribution oi,j for a span (i, j):
oi,j = Softmax(U tanh(Vsi,j)).	(5)
The term oi,j [l] is the predicted score for an entity (i, j, l).
4.2	Training via Negative Sampling
From Sec. 3.2, we know that regarding all the unlabeled spans as negative instances certainly de-
grades the performances of models, since some of them may be missed entities. Our solution to this
issue is negative sampling. Specifically, we randomly sample a small subset of unlabeled spans as
the negative instances to induce the training loss.
Given the annotated entity set y, we firstly get all the negative instance candidates as
{(i,j, O) | (i,j,l) ∈ y, 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n,l ∈L},	(6)
where L is the label space and O is the label for non-entity spans.
Then, we uniformly sample a subset yb from the whole candidate set. The size of sample set yb is
dλ * n∖, 0 <λ< 1, wherede is the ceiling function.
Ultimately, a span-level cross entropy loss used for training is incurred as
X - log(oi,j [l]) + X	- log(oi0,j0 [l0]).	(7)
(i,j,l)∈y	(i0,j0,l0)∈yb
Negative sampling incorporates some randomness into the training loss, which reduces the risk of
training a NER model with unlabeled entities.
4.3	Inference
At test time, firstly, the label for every span (i, j) is obtained by arg maxl oi,j [l]. Then, we select
the ones whose label l is not O as predicted entities. When the spans of inferred entities intersects,
we preserve the one with the highest predicted score and discard the others.
The time complexity of inference is O(n2), which is majorly contributed by the span selection pro-
cedure. While this seems a bit higher compared with our counterparts, we find that, in practical use,
its running time is far less than that of the forward computation of neural networks. The algorithm
for inference is greedy yet effective. In experiments, we find that the probability of our heuristic
selecting a wrong labeled span when resolving the span conflict is very low.
5	Discussion
We show that, through negative sampling, the probability of not treating a specific missed entity in
a n-length sentence as the negative instance is larger than 1---13:

and (1 — z)n ≥ 1 — nz, 0 ≤ z ≤ 1, during the derivation.
Note that the above bound is only applicable to the special case where there is just one unlabeled
entity in a sentence. We remain the strict proof for general cases to future work.

We have conducted extensive experiments on multiple datasets to verify the effectiveness of our
method. Studies on synthetic datasets show that our model can almost eliminate the misguidance

brought by unlabeled entities in training. On real-world datasets, our model has notably outper-
formed prior baselines and achieved the state-of-the-art performances. On well-annotated datasets,
our model is competitive to current state-of-the-art method.
6.1	Settings
The setup of synthetic datasets and well-annotated datasets are the same as what we describe in
Sec. 3.1. For real-world datasets, we use EC and NEWS, both of which are collected by Yang et al.
(2018). EC is in e-commerce domain, which has 5 entity types: Brand, Product, Model, Material,
and Specification. The data contains 2400 sentences tagged by human annotators and are divided
into three parts: 1200 for training, 400 for dev, and 800 for testing. Yang et al. (2018) also construct
an entity dictionary of size 927 and apply distant supervision on a raw corpus to obtain additional
2500 sentences for training. NEWS is from MSRA dataset (Levow, 2006). Yang et al. (2018) only
adopt the PERSON entity type. Training data of size 3000, dev data of size 3328, and testing data of
size 3186 are all sampled from MSRA. They collect an entity dictionary of size 71664 and perform
distant supervision on the rest data to obtain extra 3722 training cases by using the dictionary. Both
EC and NEWS contain a large amount of incompletely annotated sentences, and hence naturally
suffer from the unlabeled entity problem.
We adopt the same hyper-parameter configurations of neural networks for all the datasets. L2 reg-
ularization and dropout ratio are respectively set as 1 × 10-5 and 0.4 for reducing overfit. The
dimension of scoring layers is 256. Ratio λ is set as 0.35. When the sentence encoder is LSTM,
we set the hidden dimension as 512 and use pretrained word embeddings (Pennington et al., 2014;
Song et al., 2018) to initialize word representations. We utilize Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2014) as the
optimization algorithm and adopt the suggested hyper-parameters. At evaluation time, we convert
the predictions of our models into IOB format and use conlleval script to compute the F1 score. In
all the experiments, the improvements of our models over the baselines are statistically significant
with rejection probabilities smaller than 0.05.

6.2	Results on Synthetic Datasets
In this section, our model is compared with BERT Tagging on the synthetic datasets of the masking
probabilities being 0.1,0.2, ∙∙∙ , 0.6. From Table 1, We can get two conclusions. Firstly, our model
significantly outperforms BERT Tagging, especially in high masking probabilities. For example, on
CoNLL-2003, our F1 scores outnumber those of BERT Tagging by 1.88% when the probability is
0.2 and 27.16% when the probability is 0.6. Secondly, our model is very robust to the unlabeled
entity problem. When increasing the masking probability from 0.1 to 0.5, the results of our model
only decrease by 2.35% on CoNLL-2003 and 1.91% on OntoNotes 5.0.
Fig. 4 demonstrates the misguidance rate comparisons between BERT Tagging and our models. The
way to adjust our model is reformulating Eq. (7) by defining the negative term via {(i, j, O) | ∀l :
(i, j,l) / y∪e} rather than the negatively sampled y. The idea here is to avoid the unlabeled entities
being sampled. From Fig. 4, we can discover that, in all masking probabilities, the misguidance rates
of our model are far smaller than those of BERT Tagging and are consistently lower than 2.50%.
These indicate that, in training, our model indeed eliminates the misguidance brought by unlabeled
entities to some extent.
6.3	Results on Fully Annotated Datasets
We additionally apply our model with negative sampling on the well-annotated datasets where the
issue of incomplete entity annotation is not serious. As shown in Table 2, the F1 scores of our model
are very close to current best results. Our model slightly underperforms BERT-Biaffine Model by
only 0.09% on CoNLL-2003 and 0.78% on OntoNotes 5.0. Besides, our model surpasses many
other strong baselines. On OntoNotes 5.0, our model outperforms HCR w/ BERT by 0.32% and
Flair Embedding by 1.44%. On CoNLL-2003, the improvements of F1 scores are 0.41% over
BERT-MRC and 0.35% over Flair Embedding. All these results indicate that our model is still very
effective when applied to high-quality data.
6.4	Results on Real-world Datasets
For two real-world datasets, a large portion of training data is obtained via distant supervision. As
stated in Yang et al. (2018), the F1 scores of string matching through an entity dictionary are notably
declined in terms of the low recall scores, although its precision scores are higher than those of other
methods. Therefore, unlabeled entity problem is serious in the datasets. As shown in Table 3,
the baselines come from three works (Yang et al., 2018; Nooralahzadeh et al., 2019; Jie et al.,

2019). Yang et al. (2018) use Partial CRF to circumvent all possible unlabeled entities and utilize
reinforcement learning (RL) to adaptively skip noisy annotation. Jie et al. (2019) and Nooralahzadeh
et al. (2019) respectively improve Partial CRF and the policy of RL. All the F1 scores of baselines
are copied from Yang et al. (2018); Nooralahzadeh et al. (2019), except for that of Weighted Partial
CRF, which is obtained by rerunning its open-source code3.
Our model has significantly outperformed prior baselines and obtained new state-of-the-art results.
Compared with prior best model (Nooralahzadeh et al., 2019), we achieve the improvements of
3.94% on EC and 6.27% on NEWS. Compared with strong baseline, BiLSTM + Partial CRF, the
increases of F1 scores are 9.20% and 8.21%. To make fair comparisons, we replace BERT with
LSTM. Even so, we still outperform (Nooralahzadeh et al., 2019) by 1.76% on EC and 2.52% on
NEWS. All these strongly confirm the effectiveness of our model.
6.5	RATIO λ IN NEGATIVE SAMPLING
Intuitively, setting ratio λ (see Sec. 4.2) as too large values or too small values both are inappropri-
ate. Large ratios increase the risks of training negatives containing unlabeled entities. Small ratios
reduce the number of negative instances used for training, leading to underfitting. Fig. 5 shows the
experiments on some synthetic datasets with the ratio λ of our method being 0.1,0.2, ∙∙∙ , 0.9. From
it, we can see that all the score curves are roughly arched, which verifies our intuition. Besides, we
find that 0.3 < λ < 0.4 performs well in all the cases.
6.6	Validity of Degradation Rates
As Table 4 shows, we use Pearson’s correlation coefficient (PCC) to measure the statistical corre-
lations between degradation rates (e.g., misguidance rate βp) and the F1 score. We can see that
the correlation scores are generally close to -1. For example, for LSTM Tagging, on the synthetic
datasets built from CoNLL-2003, the correlation score of erosion rate αp is -0.90 and that of mis-
guidance rate βp is -0.96. The results indicate that not only degradation rates quantify specific
impacts of unlabeled entities but also their negative values change synchronously with the F1 score.
We conclude that degradation rates are appropriate metrics for evaluation.

7	Related Work
NER is a classical task in information extraction. Previous works commonly treat it as a sequence
labeling problem by using IOB tagging scheme (Huang et al., 2015; Akbik et al., 2018; Luo et al.,
2020; Li et al., 2020b;c). Each word in the sentence is labeled as B-tag if it is the beginning of
an entity, I-tag if it’s inside but not the first one within the entity, or O otherwise. This approach
is extensively studied in prior works. For example, Akbik et al. (2018) propose Flair Embedding
that pretrains character embedding in large corpora and uses it rather than token representations to
represent a sentence. Recently, there is a growing interest in span-based models (Li et al., 2020a;
Yu et al., 2020). They treat the spans, instead of single words, as the basic units for labeling. For
example, Li et al. (2020a) present BERT-MRC that regards NER as a MRC task, where named
entities are extracted as retrieving answer spans. Span-based models are also prevalent in language
modeling (Li et al., 2020d), syntactic analysis (Stern et al., 2017), etc.
In some practical applications (e.g., fine-grained NER (Zhang et al., 2020)), NER models are faced
with unlabeled entity problem, where the unlabeled entities seriously degrade the performances of
models. Several approaches to this issue have been proposed. Fuzzy CRF and AutoNER (Shang
et al., 2018b) allow learning from high-quality phrases. However, since these phrases are obtained
through distant supervision, the unlabeled entities in the corpora may still be missed. PU learn-
ing (Peng et al., 2019; Mayhew et al., 2019) unbiasedly and consistently estimates the training loss.
Nevertheless, the unlabeled entities still impact the classifiers of the corresponding entity types and,
importantly, the model can’t disambiguate neighboring entities. Partial CRF (Yang et al., 2018; Jie
et al., 2019) supports learning from incomplete annotations. However, because fully annotated cor-
pora are still needed to training models with true negative instances, this type of approach is not
applicable to the situations where no high-quality data is available.
8	Conclusion
In this work, we study what are the impacts of unlabeled entities on NER models and how to ef-
fectively eliminate them. Through empirical studies performed on synthetic datasets, we find two
causes: the reduction of annotated entities and treating unlabeled entities as training negatives. The
first cause has fewer influences than the second one and can be mitigated by adopting pretraining
language models. The second cause seriously misleads the models in training and greatly affects
their performances. Based on the above observations, we propose a novel method that is capable
of eliminating the misguidance of unlabeled entities during training. The core idea is to apply neg-
ative sampling that avoids training NER models with unlabeled entities. Experiments on synthetic
datasets and real-world datasets demonstrate that our model handles unlabeled entities well and sig-
nificantly outperforms previous baselines. On well-annotated datasets, our model is competitive
