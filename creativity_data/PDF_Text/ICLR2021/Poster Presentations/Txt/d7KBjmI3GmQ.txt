We propose a new test to measure a text model’s multitask accuracy. The test
covers 57 tasks including elementary mathematics, US history, computer science,
law, and more. To attain high accuracy on this test, models must possess extensive
world knowledge and problem solving ability. We find that while most recent
models have near random-chance accuracy, the very largest GPT-3 model improves
over random chance by almost 20 percentage points on average. However, on every
one of the 57 tasks, the best models still need substantial improvements before
they can reach expert-level accuracy. Models also have lopsided performance
and frequently do not know when they are wrong. Worse, they still have near-
random accuracy on some socially important subjects such as morality and law.
By comprehensively evaluating the breadth and depth of a model’s academic and
professional understanding, our test can be used to analyze models across many
tasks and to identify important shortcomings.
1	Introduction
Natural Language Processing (NLP) models have achieved superhuman performance on a number of
recently proposed benchmarks. However, these models are still well below human level performance
for language understanding as a whole, suggesting a disconnect between our benchmarks and the
actual capabilities of these models. The General Language Understanding Evaluation benchmark
(GLUE) (Wang et al., 2018) was introduced in 2018 to evaluate performance on a wide range of NLP
tasks, and top models achieved superhuman performance within a year. To address the shortcomings
of GLUE, researchers designed the SuperGLUE benchmark with more difficult tasks (Wang et al.,
2019). About a year since the release of SuperGLUE, performance is again essentially human-level
(Raffel et al., 2019). While these benchmarks evaluate linguistic skills more than overall language
understanding, an array of commonsense benchmarks have been proposed to measure basic reasoning
and everyday knowledge (Zellers et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2019; Bisk et al., 2019). However, these
recent benchmarks have similarly seen rapid progress (Khashabi et al., 2020). Overall, the near
human-level performance on these benchmarks suggests that they are not capturing important facets
of language understanding.
Transformer models have driven this recent progress by pretraining on massive text corpora, including
all of Wikipedia, thousands of books, and numerous websites. These models consequently see
extensive information about specialized topics, most of which is not assessed by existing NLP
benchmarks. It consequently remains an open question just how capable current language models are
at learning and applying knowledge from many domains.
To bridge the gap between the wide-ranging knowledge that models see during pretraining and the
existing measures of success, we introduce a new benchmark for assessing models across a diverse
set of subjects that humans learn. We design the benchmark to measure knowledge acquired during
pretraining by evaluating models exclusively in zero-shot and few-shot settings. This makes the
benchmark more challenging and more similar to how we evaluate humans. The benchmark covers
57 subjects across STEM, the humanities, the social sciences, and more. It ranges in difficulty from
an elementary level to an advanced professional level, and it tests both world knowledge and problem
solving ability. Subjects range from traditional areas, such as mathematics and history, to more

specialized areas like law and ethics (Hendrycks et al., 2020). The granularity and breadth of the
subjects makes the benchmark ideal for identifying a model’s blind spots.
We find that meaningful progress on our benchmark has only become possible in recent months. In
particular, few-shot models up to 13 billion parameters (Brown et al., 2020) achieve random chance
performance of 25% accuracy, but the 175 billion parameter GPT-3 model reaches a much higher
43.9% accuracy (see Figure 1b). On the other hand, unlike human professionals GPT-3 does not
excel at any single subject. Instead, we find that performance is lopsided, with GPT-3 having almost
70% accuracy for its best subject but near-random performance for several other subjects.
Our results indicate that while recent advances have been impressive, state-of-the-art models still
struggle at learning and applying knowledge from pretraining. The tasks with near-random accuracy
include calculation-heavy subjects such as physics and mathematics and subjects related to human
values such as law and morality. This second weakness is particularly concerning because it will
be important for future models to have a strong understanding of what is legal and what is ethical.
Worryingly, we also find that GPT-3 does not have an accurate sense of what it does or does not know
since its average confidence can be up to 24% off from its actual accuracy. We comprehensively
evaluate the breadth and depth of a model’s text understanding by covering numerous topics that
humans are incentivized to learn. Since our test consists in 57 tasks, it can be used to analyze
aggregate properties of models across tasks and to track important shortcomings. The test and code is
available at github.com/hendrycks/test.
2 Related Work
Pretraining. The dominant paradigm in NLP is to pretrain large models on massive text corpora
including educational books and websites. In the process, these models are exposed to information
about a wide range of topics. Petroni et al. (2019) found that recent models learn enough information
from pretraining that they can serve as knowledge bases. However, no prior work has comprehensively
measured the knowledge models have across many real-world domains.
Until recently, researchers primarily used fine-tuned models on downstream tasks (Devlin et al., 2019).
However, larger pretrained models like GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) have made it possible to achieve
competitive performance without fine-tuning by using few-shot learning, which removes the need for
a large fine-tuning set. With the advent of strong zero-shot and few-shot learning, it is now possible
to curate a diverse set of tasks for evaluation and remove the possibility of models on “spurious cues”
(Geirhos et al., 2020; Hendrycks et al., 2019b) in a dataset to achieve high performance.
Benchmarks. Many recent benchmarks aim to assess a model’s general world knowledge and basic
reasoning ability by testing its “commonsense.” A number of commonsense benchmarks have been

proposed in the past year, but recent models are already nearing human-level performance on several
of these, including HellaSwag (Zellers et al., 2019), Physical IQA (Bisk et al., 2019), and CosmosQA
(Huang et al., 2019). By design, these datasets assess abilities that almost every child has. In contrast,
we include harder specialized subjects that people must study to learn.
Some researchers have suggested that the future of NLP evaluation should focus on Natural Language
Generation (NLG) (Zellers et al., 2020), an idea that reaches back to the Turing Test (Turing, 1950).
However, NLG is notoriously difficult to evaluate and lacks a standard metric (Sai et al., 2020).
Consequently, we instead create a simple-to-evaluate test that measures classification accuracy on
multiple choice questions.
While several question answering benchmarks exist, they are comparatively limited in scope. Most
either cover easy topics like grade school subjects for which models can already achieve strong
performance (Clark et al., 2018; Khot et al., 2019; Mihaylov et al., 2018; Clark et al., 2019), or
are focused on linguistic understanding in the form of reading comprehension (Lai et al., 2017;
Richardson et al., 2013). In contrast, we include a wide range of difficult subjects that go far beyond
linguistic understanding.
3 A Multitask Test
We create a massive multitask test consisting of multiple-choice questions from various branches of
knowledge. The test spans subjects in the humanities, social sciences, hard sciences, and other areas
that are important for some people to learn. There are 57 tasks in total, which is also the number
of Atari games (Bellemare et al., 2013), all of which are listed in Appendix B. The questions in
the dataset were manually collected by graduate and undergraduate students from freely available
sources online. These include practice questions for tests such as the Graduate Record Examination
and the United States Medical Licensing Examination. It also includes questions designed for
undergraduate courses and questions designed for readers of Oxford University Press books. Some
tasks cover a subject, like psychology, but at a specific level of difficulty, such as “Elementary,”
“High School,” “College,” or “Professional.” For example, the “Professional Psychology” task draws
on questions from freely available practice questions for the Examination for Professional Practice
in Psychology, while the “High School Psychology” task has questions like those from Advanced
Placement Psychology examinations.
We collected 15908 questions in total, which we split into a few-shot development set, a validation
set, and a test set. The few-shot development set has 5 questions per subject, the validation set may
be used for selecting hyperparameters and is made of 1540 questions, and the test set has 14079
questions. Each subject contains 100 test examples at the minimum, which is longer than most exams
designed to assess people.
Human-level accuracy on this test varies. Unspecialized humans from Amazon Mechanical Turk
obtain 34.5% accuracy on this test. Meanwhile, expert-level performance can be far higher. For
example, real-world test-taker human accuracy at the 95th percentile is around 87% for US Medical
Licensing Examinations, and these questions make up our “Professional Medicine” task. If we take
the 95th percentile human test-taker accuracy for exams that build up our test, and if we make an
educated guess when such information is unavailable, we then estimate that expert-level accuracy is
approximately 89.8%.
Since our test aggregates different subjects and several levels of difficulty, we measure more than
straightforward commonsense or narrow linguistic understanding. Instead, we measure arbitrary

real-world text understanding. Since models are pretrained on the Internet, this enables us to test
how well they can extract useful knowledge from massive corpora. Future models that use this test
could be single models or a mixture of experts model. To succeed at our test, future models should be
well-rounded, possess extensive world knowledge, and develop expert-level problem solving ability.
These properties make the test likely to be an enduring and informative goalpost.
3.1	Humanities
The humanities is a group of disciplines that make use of qualitative analysis and analytic methods
rather than scientific empirical methods. Branches of the humanities include law, philosophy, history,
and so on (Appendix B). Mastering these subjects requires a variety of skills. For example, legal
understanding requires knowledge of how to apply rules and standards to complex scenarios, and
also provide answers with stipulations and explanations. We illustrate this in Figure 2. Legal
understanding is also necessary for understanding and following rules and regulations, a necessary
capability to constrain open-world machine learning models. For philosophy, our questions cover
concepts like logical fallacies, formal logic, and famous philosophical arguments. It also covers
moral scenarios, including questions from the ETHICS dataset (Hendrycks et al., 2020) that test a
model’s understanding of normative statements through predicting widespread moral intuitions about
diverse everyday scenarios. Finally, our history questions cover a wide range of time periods and
geographical locations, including prehistory and other advanced subjects.
3.2	Social Science
Social science includes branches of knowledge that examine human behavior and society. Subject
areas include economics, sociology, politics, geography, psychology, and so on. See Figure 3 for
an example question. Our economics questions include microeconomics, macroeconomics, and
econometrics, and cover different types of problems, including questions that require a mixture of
world knowledge, qualitative reasoning, or quantitative reasoning. We also include important but
more esoteric topics such as security studies in order to test the boundaries of what is experienced and
learned during pretraining. Social science also includes psychology, a field that may be especially
important for attaining a nuanced understanding of humans.
3.3	Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM)
STEM subjects include physics, computer science, mathematics, and more. Two examples are shown
in Figure 4. Conceptual physics tests understanding of simple physics principles and may be thought

also test mathematical problem solving ability at various levels of difficulty, from the elementary to
the college level. College mathematics questions, like those found on the GRE mathematics subject
test, often require chains of reasoning and abstract knowledge. To encode mathematics expressions,
We use LaTeX or symbols such as * and ^ for multiplication and exponentiation respectively. STEM
subjects require knowledge of empirical methods, fluid intelligence, and procedural knowledge.

latter includes statistics about poverty in different countries over time, Which may be necessary for

4	Experiments
4.1	Setup
Assessment and Models. To measure performance on our multitask test, We compute the clas-
sification accuracy across all examples and tasks. We evaluate GPT-3 (BroWn et al., 2020) and
UnifiedQA (Khashabi et al., 2020). For GPT-3 We use the OpenAI API, Which provides access to four
model variants, “Ada,” “Babbage,” “Curie,” and “Davinci,” Which We refer to as “Small” (2.7 billion
parameters), “Medium” (6.7 billion), “Large” (13 billion) and “X-Large” (175 billion). UnifiedQA
uses the T5 (Raffel et al., 2019) text-to-text backbone and is fine-tuned on previously proposed
question ansWering datasets (Lai et al., 2017), Where the prediction is the class With the highest
token overlap With UnifiedQA’s text output. Since UnifiedQA is fine-tuned on other datasets, We
evaluate it Without any further tuning to assess its transfer accuracy. We also fine-tune RoBERTa-base,
ALBERT-xxlarge, and GPT-2 on UnifiedQA training data and our dev+val set. We primarily focus on
UnifiedQA and GPT-3 in the rest of this document, but additional discussion of RoBERTa, ALBERT,
and GPT-2 is in Appendix A.

Few-Shot Prompt. We feed GPT-3 prompts
like that shown in Figure 1a. We begin each
prompt with “The following are multiple choice
questions (with answers) about [subject].” For
zero-shot evaluation, we append the question to
the prompt. For few-shot evaluation, we add up
to 5 demonstration examples with answers to
the prompt before appending the question. All
prompts end with “Answer: ”. The model then
produces probabilities for the tokens “A,” “B,”
“C,” and “D,” and we treat the highest probability
option as the prediction. For consistent evalua-
tion, we create a dev set with 5 fixed few-shot
examples for each subject.
4.2 Results
Model Size and Accuracy. We compare the
few-shot accuracy of each GPT-3 size in Table 1.
We find that the three smaller GPT-3 models
have near random accuracy (around 25%). In
contrast, we find that the X-Large 175 billion
parameter GPT-3 model performs substantially
better than random, with an accuracy of 43.9%.
We also find qualitatively similar results in the
zero-shot setting. While the smaller models
have around 25% zero-shot accuracy, Figure 10
in Appendix A shows that the largest GPT-3
model has a much higher zero-shot accuracy of
about 37.7%. Brown et al. (2020) also observe
that larger GPT-3 models perform better, though
progress tends to be steadier. In Figure 1b we
show that non-random accuracy on the multitask
test emerged with recent large few-shot models
compared to datasets that assess commonsense
and linguistic understanding.
To test the usefulness of fine-tuning instead of
few-shot learning, we also evaluate UnifiedQA
models. UnifiedQA has the advantage of being
fine-tuned on other question answering datasets,
unlike GPT-3. We assess UnifiedQA by evalu-
ating its transfer performance without any ad-
ditional fine-tuning. The largest UnifiedQA
model we test has 11 billion parameters, which
is slightly smaller than GPT-3 Large. Neverthe-
less, we show in Table 1 that it attains 48.9%

accuracy. This performs better than the few-shot GPT-3 X-Large model, despite UnifiedQA have
an order of magnitude fewer parameters. We also find that even the smallest UnifiedQA variant,
with just 60 million parameters, has approximately 29.3% accuracy. These results suggest that while
model size is a key component for achieving strong performance, fine-tuning also helps.
Comparing Disciplines. Using our test, we discover that GPT-3 and UnifiedQA have lopsided
performance and several substantial knowledge gaps. Figure 6 shows the accuracy of GPT-3 (few-
shot) and UnifiedQA for all 57 tasks. It shows the both models are below expert-level performance
for all tasks, with GPT-3’s accuracy ranging from 69% for US Foreign Policy to 26% for College
Chemistry. UnifiedQA does best on marketing, with an accuracy of 82.5%.
Overall, models do poorly on highly procedural problems. Figure 6 shows that calculation-heavy
STEM subjects tend to have low accuracy compared to verbal subjects. For GPT-3, 9 out of the 10

lowest-accuracy tasks are STEM subjects that emphasize mathematics or calculations. We speculate
that is in part because GPT-3 acquires declarative knowledge more readily than procedural knowledge.
For example, many questions in Elementary Mathematics require applying the order of operations
for arithmetic, which is described by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses Exponents Multiplication
Division Addition Subtraction). In Figure 7, we confirm that GPT-3 is aware of the acronym
PEMDAS. However, it does not consistently apply PEMDAS to actual problems. On the other hand,
procedural understanding is not its only weak point. We find that some verbal tasks such as Moral
Scenarios from Hendrycks et al. (2020) and Professional Law also have especially low accuracy.
Our test also shows that GPT-3 acquires knowledge quite unlike humans. For example, GPT-3 learns
about topics in a pedagogically unusual order. GPT-3 does better on College Medicine (47.4%)
and College Mathematics (35.0%) than calculation-heavy Elementary Mathematics (29.9%). GPT-3
demonstrates unusual breadth, but it does not master a single subject. Meanhwhile we suspect humans
have mastery in several subjects but not as much breadth. In this way, our test shows that GPT-3 has
many knowledge blindspots and has capabilities that are lopsided.
Calibration. We should not trust a model’s prediction unless the model is calibrated, meaning
that its confidence is a good estimate of the actual probability the prediction is correct. However,
large neural networks are often miscalibrated (Guo et al., 2017), especially under distribution shift
(Ovadia et al., 2019). We evaluate the calibration of GPT-3 by testing how well its average confidence
estimates its actual accuracy for each subject. We show the results in Figure 8, which demonstrates
that GPT-3 is uncalibrated. In fact, its confidence is only weakly related to its actual accuracy in
the zero-shot setting, with the difference between its accuracy and confidence reaching up to 24%
for some subjects. Another calibration measure is the Root Mean Squared (RMS) calibration error
(Hendrycks et al., 2019a; Kumar et al., 2019). Many tasks have miscalibrated predictions, such as
Elementary Mathematics which has a zero-shot RMS calibration error of 19.4%. Models are only
somewhat more calibrated in the few-shot setting, as shown in Appendix A. These results suggest
that model calibration has wide room for improvement.
5	Discussion
Multimodal Understanding. While text is capable of conveying an enormous number of concepts
about the world, many important concepts are conveyed mainly through other modalities, such as
images, audio, and physical interaction (Bisk et al., 2020). Existing large-scale NLP models, such as
GPT-3, do not incorporate multimodal information, so we design our benchmark to capture a diverse
array of tasks in a text-only format. However, as models gain the ability to process multimodal inputs,
benchmarks should be designed to reflect this change. One such benchmark could be a “Turk Test,”
consisting of Amazon Mechanical Turk Human Intelligence Tasks. These are well-defined tasks that
require models to interact with flexible formats and demonstrate multimodal understanding.
The Internet as a Training Set. A major distinction between our benchmark and previous multitask
NLP benchmarks is that we do not require large training sets. Instead, we assume that models have
acquired the requisite knowledge from reading vast quantities of diverse text from the Internet. This
7
Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021
process is typically called pretraining, but it can be thought of as training in its own right, where the
downstream evaluation is demonstrating whatever knowledge we would expect a human to pick up
from reading the same text.
This motivates us to propose a methodological change so that models are trained more like how
humans learn. While most previous machine learning benchmarks have models learn from a large
question bank, humans primarily learn new subjects by reading books and listening to others talk
about the topic. For specialized subjects such as Professional Law, massive legal corpora are available,
such as the 164-volume legal encyclopedia Corpus Juris Secundum, but there are fewer than 5,000
multistate bar exam questions available. Learning the entire law exclusively through a small number
of practice tests is implausible, so future models must learn more during pretraining.
For this reason we assess pretrained models in a zero-shot, few-shot, or transfer setting and we provide
a dev, val, and test set for each task. The dev set is used for few-shot prompts, the val set could be
used for hyperparameter tuning, and the test set is used to compute the final accuracy. Importantly,
the format of our evaluation is not identical to the format in which information is acquired during
pretraining. This has the benefit of obviating concerns about spurious training set annotation artifacts
(Geirhos et al., 2020; Hendrycks et al., 2019b) and is in stark contrast to the previous paradigm
of identically distributed training and test sets. This change also enables collecting a much more
extensive and diverse set of tasks for evaluation. We anticipate our methodology becoming more
widespread as models improve at extracting information from diverse online sources.
Model Limitations. We find that current large-scale Transformers have wide room for improvement.
They are notably poor at modeling human (dis)approval, as evident by the low performance on the
Professional Law and Moral Scenarios tasks. For future systems tobe aligned with human values, high
performance on these tasks is crucial (Hendrycks et al., 2020), so future research should especially
aim to increase accuracy on these tasks. Models also have difficulty performing calculations, so much
so that they exhibit poor performance on Elementary Mathematics and many other STEM subjects
with “plug and chug” problems. Additionally, they do not match expert-level performance (90%) on
any subject, so for all subjects it is subhuman. On average, models are only now starting to move
beyond random-chance accuracy levels.
Addressing these shortcomings may be challenging. To illustrate this, we attempted to create a better
Professional Law model by pretraining on specialized data but achieved only limited success. We
collected approximately 2,000 additional Professional Law training examples. After fine-tuning a
RoBERTa-base model (Liu et al., 2019) using this custom training set, our model attained 32.8% test
accuracy. To test the impact of additional specialized training data, we also had RoBERTa continue
pretraining on approximately 1.6 million legal case summaries using Harvard’s Law Library case law
corpus case.law, but after fine-tuning it only attained 36.1% accuracy. This suggests that while
additional pretraining on relevant high quality text can help, it may not be enough to substantially
increase the performance of current models.
It is unclear whether simply scaling up existing language models will solve the test. Current
understanding indicates that a 10× increase in model size must be accompanied by an approximate
5× increase in data (Kaplan et al., 2020). Aside from the tremendous expense in creating multi-trillion
parameter language models, data may also become a bottleneck, as there is far less written about
esoteric branches of knowledge than about everyday situations.
6	Conclusion
We introduced a new test that measures how well text models can learn and apply knowledge
encountered during pretraining. By covering 57 subjects at varying levels of difficulty, the test
assesses language understanding in greater breadth and depth than previous benchmarks. We found
that it has recently become possible for models to make meaningful progress on the test, but that
state-of-the-art models have lopsided performance and rarely excel at any individual task. We also
showed that current models are uncalibrated and have difficulty with tasks that require calculations.
Worryingly, models also perform especially poorly on socially relevant subjects including morality
and law. Our expansive test can help researchers pinpoint important shortcomings of models, making
it easier to gain a clearer picture of state-of-the-art capabilities.

Figure 9: On the left are GPT-3 few shot accuracies for all of the 57 tasks. On the right are UnifiedQA
transfer accuracies for all of the 57 tasks. For both models, capabilities are lopsided.
A. 1 Analysis with More Fine-Tuned Models
We primarily analyzed models with more than 10 billion parameters in the main body of the paper.
For this section, we analyze smaller models including RoBERTa-base (125 million parameters) (Liu
11
Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021
et al., 2019), ALBERT-xxlarge (223 million parameters) (Lan et al., 2020), and GPT-2 (1,558 million
parameters) (Radford et al., 2019). Models are fine-tuned to predict one of four classes using the
UnifiedQA MCQ questions and using our dev+val set. We test on our multitask test set.
We observe that these smaller models can attain better-than-random accuracy. RoBERTa-base attains
an overall accuracy of 27.9%, with 27.9% accuracy for the humanities, 28.8% for social sciences,
27.0% for STEM, and 27.7% for other. ALBERT-xxlarge attains an accuracy of 27.1%, with 27.2%
accuracy for the humanities, 25.7% for the social sciences, 27.7% for STEM, and 27.9% for other.
GPT-2 attains an accuracy of 32.4%, with 32.8% accuracy for the humanities, 33.3% for the social
sciences, 30.2% for STEM, and 33.1% for other.
Compare this to UnifiedQA’s smallest variant, which has just 60 million parameters and approximately
29.3% accuracy. It obtains higher accuracy than RoBERTa and ALBERT, even though it has fewer
parameters. This suggests that its larger pretraining dataset enables higher accuracy. Likewise,
UnifiedQA with 3 billion parameters attains 43.7%, while the similarly sized GPT-2 model with 1.5
billion parameters attains 32.4% accuracy. This again suggests that T5’s larger pretraining dataset
size (and therefore UnifiedQA’s pretraining dataset size) can increase accuracy.
A.2 Error Analysis
We qualitatively analyze when GPT-3 makes high confidence mistakes. We find that while many of
these mistakes were clearly wrong, many were mistakes that a human might make. For example,
one question it got wrong was “How many chromosomes do all human somatic cells contain?” The
correct answer is 46, while few-shot GPT-3 predicted 23 with confidence 97.5%. This answer would
have been correct if the question asked about the number of pairs of chromosomes. Similarly, many
of its other high confidence mistakes were also correct answers to slightly different questions.
A.3 Format Sensitivity
While different question formatting choices often lead to similar GPT-3 accuracies, we find that
UnifiedQA is more sensitive. UnifiedQA’s input format is of the form
QUESTION1 \\n (A) CHOICE1 (B) CHOICE2 (C) CHOICE3 (D) CHOICE4</s>
where questions and choices are normalized and made lowercase. If we remove the </s> from the
input, accuracy declines by several percentage points.

Average Question Length (Characters)
Figure 12: Figures on the relation between question difficulty and question length. For questions
longer than a tweet (280 characters), the correlation between question length and true label confidence
is slightly positive. This shows that longer questions are not necessarily harder.
B.2 Exact Question and Answer Contamination
Since language models train on vast text corpora, there is some chance that they have seen the exact
question and answer during pretraining. If they memorized the exact question and answer, then
they would attain higher accuracy than their true ability. Likewise, a question’s entropy would be
especially low if it were memorized. Memorized questions and answers should have low entropy and
13
Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021
high accuracy. However, in Figure 13, we see that accuracy and question entropy are not positively
correlated, suggesting that the test’s low-entropy questions do not correspond to memorized (and
thereby correctly predicted) answers. This suggests that our exact questions were not memorized.
However, during pretraining models encountered text related to our questions through processing
Wikipedia. We also note that most of our questions came from PDFs or websites where questions and
answers are on separate pages.
See Brown et al. (2020) for a previous discussion of contamination showing that the phenomena
hardly affects performance. To reduce the probability that future models encounter exact questions
during test-time, we will provide a list of question sources.
Figure 13: The average log probability of the question (without answer) is not strongly positively
correlated with accuracy, all else equal. Each point corresponds to a task. Higher log probability
indicates higher compression, and especially high log probability would suggest memorization. In
the zero-shot question prompt, the correlation between average log probability and accuracy is
r = -0.43, and for the few-shot setting the correlation is r = -0.56.

Consider a computer design in which multiple processors, each with a private cache memory,
share global memory using a single bus. This bus is the critical system resource. Each processor
can execute one instruction every 500 nanoseconds as long as memory references are satisfied
by its local cache. When a cache miss occurs, the processor is delayed for an additional 2,000
nanoseconds. During half of this additional delay, the bus is dedicated to serving the cache miss.
During the other half, the processor cannot continue, but the bus is free to service requests from
other processors. On average, each instruction requires 2 memory references. On average, cache
misses occur on 1 percent of references. What proportion of the capacity of the bus would a single

Albeit the king’s Majesty justly and rightfully is and ought to be the supreme head of the Church
of England, and so is recognized by the clergy of this realm in their convocations, yet nevertheless,
for corroboration and confirmation thereof, and for increase of virtue in Christ’s religion within
this realm of England, and to repress and extirpate all errors, heresies, and other enormities and
abuses heretofore used in the same, be it enacted, by authority of this present Parliament, that the
king, our sovereign lord, his heirs and successors, kings of this realm, shall be taken, accepted,

title and style thereof, as all honors, dignities, preeminences, jurisdictions, privileges, authorities,
immunities, profits, and commodities to the said dignity of the supreme head of the same Church
belonging and appertaining; and that our said sovereign lord, his heirs and successors, kings of
this realm, shall have full power and authority from time to time to visit, repress, redress, record,
order, correct, restrain, and amend all such errors, heresies, abuses, offenses, contempts, and

This question refers to the following information.
“Society in every state is a blessing, but government even in its best state is but a necessary evil; in
its worst state an intolerable one; for when we suffer, or are exposed to the same miseries by a
government, which we might expect in a country without government, our calamity is heightened
by reflecting that we furnish the means by which we suffer. Government, like dress, is the badge
of lost innocence; the palaces of kings are built on the ruins of the bowers of paradise. For were
the impulses of conscience clear, uniform, and irresistibly obeyed, man would need no other
lawgiver; but that not being the case, he finds it necessary to surrender up a part of his property to
furnish means for the protection of the rest; and this he is induced to do by the same prudence
which in every other case advises him out of two evils to choose the least. Wherefore, security
being the true design and end of government, it unanswerably follows that whatever form thereof
appears most likely to ensure it to us, with the least expense and greatest benefit, is preferable to
all others.”

“The real grievance of the worker is the insecurity of his existence; he is not sure that he will
always have work, he is not sure that he will always be healthy, and he foresees that he will one
day be old and unfit to work. If he falls into poverty, even if only through a prolonged illness, he
is then completely helpless, left to his own devices, and society does not currently recognize any
real obligation towards him beyond the usual help for the poor, even if he has been working all
the time ever so faithfully and diligently. The usual help for the poor, however, leaves a lot to be
desired, especially in large cities, where it is very much worse than in the country.”

The night before his bar examination, the examinee’s next-door neighbor was having a party. The
music from the neighbor’s home was so loud that the examinee couldn’t fall asleep. The examinee
called the neighbor and asked her to please keep the noise down. The neighbor then abruptly hung
up. Angered, the examinee went into his closet and got a gun. He went outside and fired a bullet
through the neighbor’s living room window. Not intending to shoot anyone, the examinee fired
his gun at such an angle that the bullet would hit the ceiling. He merely wanted to cause some
damage to the neighbor’s home to relieve his angry rage. The bullet, however, ricocheted off the
ceiling and struck a partygoer in the back, killing him. The jurisdiction makes it a misdemeanor

The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) prohibited the possession or deployment of chemical
weapons; however it failed to implement stipulations that would require signatories to declare their
existing stocks of chemical weapons, to identify facilities that were once involved in chemical
production, or to announce when their existing stocks would be destroyed.
(A)	The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) prohibited the possession or deployment of
chemical weapons; however it failed to implement stipulations that would require signatories to
declare their existing stocks of chemical weapons, to identify facilities that were once involved in
chemical production, or to announce when their existing stocks would be destroyed.
(B)	The CWC made some important developments regarding the use and possession of chemical
weapons and the destruction of existing stockpiles. However, the treaty failed to establish an
independent body empowered with the capacity to check treaty compliance. Lack of supra-state
authority has undermined the ability to enforce those developments. Given the anarchical nature
of international society it may be in the national security interest to retain stocks.
(C)	Chemical weapons continue to exert a determining influence on international society. As early
as the 1970s military strategists were convinced of the deterrence effects chemical weapons could
have, comparable to the second strike survival logic of nuclear deterrence. The preferences of
strategists resulted in continued manufacture and stockpiling of weapons creating an international
crisis of stability.
(D)	While the CWC has been ratified by the majority of international society, some nations
with a large chemical capability at their disposal have yet to enter into the treaty. However,
to some analysts the destructive military potential would be limited, having a moderate
effect on a well-equipped army in conventional warfare. Chemical arsenal essentially falls
under the category of the "poor mans" weaponry, being simplistic and inexpensive whilst
having limited military utility. However, the concern remains of the prospective impact a
terrorist chemical attack could have on civilian populations.
