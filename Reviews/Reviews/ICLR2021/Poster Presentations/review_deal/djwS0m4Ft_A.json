To estimate the topological similarity between conditional submanifolds, the authors build upon an earlier work of Relative Living Times (RLT). \n\nR5 and R4 had concerns on the paper, particularly about the lack of enough novelty in the actual technique (R5) and about the lack of convincing experiments (R4). One of the concerns raised by R4 was around the discrepancies between MIG and FactorVAE.Â However as noted by other reviewers (R2 and R5), these discrepancies between different popular metrics are well acknowledged in the literature and authors have responded to this point. R2 and R5 also appreciate that avoiding the rotation issue faced by most of these disentanglement metrics is one of the strengths of the proposed metric.\n\nWhile I tend to agree with R5 that the actual technique is inspired from the earlier work on \"Geometry Score\", I also think the application to measuring disentanglement in generative models is a novel contribution in itself, especially because current metrics have issues as pointed out by other reviewers -- the paper provides a fresh conditional sub-manifold perspective on disentanglement and a theoretically sound metric for measuring disentanglement. \n\nConsidering this novel perspective and a resulting theoretically sound metric for measuring disentanglement that addresses some of the issues with current metrics, I recommend accepting the paper. \n"

            "review": "# Synopsis of the paper\n\nThis paper presents a new model for assessing to what extent a deep\ngenerative model is disentangled. In contrast to existing methods, this\npaper proposes an approach founded on topological considerations: by\nassessing the topological dissimilarity of submanifolds of a given model,\nwhich are conditioned on an individual factor. The overarching idea is\nthat a fully-disentangled model should exhibit high topological\ndissimilarity for *different* factors, while exhibiting low topological\ndissimilarity for the *same* factors (but with different values for said\nfactors).\n\nThese topological dissimilarity assessments are achieved by employing\npersistent homology, a method from topological data analysis that\ngeneralises ordinary simplicial homology (i.e. 'counting\nhigh-dimensional holes') to a multi-scale setting (in which point clouds\nare being assessed). Previous work for GAN comparison, viz. the\n'geometry score' is extended by a new internal metric, the Wasserstein\ndistance.\n\nA set of experiments demonstrates the utility of the proposed approach,\nvalidating previous knowledge.\n\n# Summary of the review\n\nThis paper is tackling a highly relevant topic (disentanglement\nanalysis) and provides a novel, fresh perspective that is mathematically\nwell justified. The paper is chock full of excellent ideas that make me\nexcited about their potential; I am sure that this will be shine a light\non the potential of topology-driven methods.\n\nHowever, while the paper is well written for the most part, I cannot\nfully endorse it for publication yet because of two reasons:\n\n1. The paper is missing crucial details about its comparison method.\n   While I know the existing work to piece everything together, I am\n   not sure the method as such is reproducible at the moment.\n\n   I am agreeing with most of the claims in the paper, but I would be\n   hard-pressed to implement exactly the same method in the same\n   fashion, because not all the details are there.\n\n2. While most of the paper flows very well, in an almost conversational\n   style that I very much appreciate, there are also several places at\n   which concepts are not explained correctly or with sufficient\n   precision. There are also some issues with the terminology that make\n   it harder to fully understand what is going on.\n\nIf these two points were to be rectified in a revision of the paper,\nit would definitely strengthen the message of this paper!\n\nPlease see below for detailed comments.\n\n# Detailed comments\n\n- The introduction is really 'on point' and makes an excellent case for\n  requiring more foundational approaches\n\n- The way 'topology' is introduced in the introduction is very\n  imprecise; I find the discussion of 'high-density' and 'low-density'\n  to be problematic here. Algebraic topology, which is where persistent\n  homology originated from, has no notion of density; all considerations\n  of 'holes' are based on purely algebraic arguments. While it is true\n  that you can incorporate density information into persistent homology,\n  this discussion is slightly misleading.\n\n  I would point out rather that holes are typically considered to be the\n  boundaries of these low-density regions (if the 'density argument' is\n  left in there).\n\n- Some of the terms are overloaded and used multiple times: 'latent\n  dimension' is used equivalently to 'latent factor', it seems. I would\n  strongly suggest to use a unified terminology.\n\n- The term 'homeomorphic dimensions' is vague. I also have to point out\n  that the method used in this paper is only *invariant* under\n  homeomorphism! More precisely, two topological objects can have the\n  same homology (or persistent homology, or barcode, etc.) even though\n  they are **not** homeomorphic. This is a crucial detail that is not\n  handled correctly in the paper at present; for example, Figure\n  5 claims that 'homeomorphic groups' are shown, but the approach cannot\n  detect this. If anything, the case should be made for depicting that\n  these groups are 'likely' homeomorphic. Alternatively, one could write\n  that the proposed approach assesses the *topological similarity* of\n  models.\n\n- Often, the term 'topology' is also used as an equivocation.\n  Unfortunately, the term is overloaded in mathematics as well: a space\n  can *have* a topology (i.e. systems of open sets etc.), but I have the\n  impression that the paper often means to say 'shape' or 'topological\n  features' (connected components, cycles, etc.) rather than 'topology'.\n\n- The explanation of a manifold could be improved; why not mention the\n  definition in terms of 'locally looks like some $\\mathbb{R}^d$'? The\n  discussion of 'open discs' might leave some readers baffled.\n\n- I disagree with the sentence 'Under the manifold hypothesis, the latent\n  space of a deep generative model has an extremely dense underlying\n  manifold with few, if any, holes, [...]'. Holes characterise the shape\n  of a manifold; the manifold hypothesis only posits the hypothesis that\n  data originate from a manifold. It does not say anything about the\n  *shape* of the manifold itself, and I do not agree with the notion\n  that having no holes is somehow 'better'.\n\n  A generative model that 'learns' that all samples can be arranged\n  along a cycle in some latent space can be very appropriate depending\n  on the data set.\n\n  (Moreover, Figure 2 in some sense tells the opposite story of this\n  sentence.)\n\n- The definition/introduction of (persistent homology) at the end of\n  Section 2 could be improved: the Vietoris--Rips complex goes back to\n  a 1927 paper by L. Vietoris (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01447877);\n  an excellent introduction to modern topological concepts is provided\n  in the book 'Computational Topology: An Introduction' by Edelsbrunner\n  and Harer.\n\n  I also disagree with homology 'approximating the topology'. Homology\n  is *one* specific invariant in algebraic topology. In this sense, it\n  does not approximate anything but describes a data set in terms of\n  its topological features.\n\n- The term 'symplectic vertex' is not correct here, as far as\n  I understand. Everything is discussed in terms of simplicial\n  complexes; I do not see the connection to symplectic topology here. \n\n- The explanation of the Vietoris--Rips complex could be improved.\n  I feel that the explanation in terms of creating edges based on the\n  proximity criterion will leave most readers baffled. I would suggest\n  adding a brief explanation/illustration about this, maybe using Figure\n  2d.\n\n- What is meant by having a manifold 'assume topology $\\tau$'? Does this\n  refer to the manifold expressing a certain a set of barcodes?\n\n- In Figure 3, I would rather write '[...] the submanifolds conditions on\n  a specific rotation [...]'. Upon first reading the figure,\n  I misunderstood its central point, namely that *if* the rotation is\n  fixed, so that only the scale varies, the resulting submanifold will\n  not have any holes, as the variation in scale provides a simple 1D\n  structure.\n\n- I would not say that submanifolds have different 'topologies' than\n  their super-manifold; rather they might/will have different homology\n  maybe or 'shape'?\n\n- While I fully agree with the thrust of the method, I would need more\n  details on p. 4. How is the partitioning of the manifold achieved in\n  practice? How are the factors chosen? How are their respective values\n  chosen? Is it possible to provide more examples here?\n\n- When discussing conditional submanifold topology, consider mentioning\n  how these manifolds are being obtained in practice, maybe by providing\n  more examples.\n\n- I do not understand the main thrust of the 'Topological asymmetry'\n  section. Is the main argument that manifolds conditioned on the same\n  factor should have the same shape and, moreover, that manifolds coming\n  from the same factor should be more similar to one another than\n  manifolds coming from different factors?\n\n- What does it mean that factors are 'not homeomorphic' in Figure 4? Is\n  the ground-truth topology known?\n\n- The statement '...that best separates similar and dissimilar\n  topologies...' should again be rephrased and made more precise, for\n  example by adding '...topological features, as measured using\n  persistent homology...'.\n\n- In the 'Metric' section, I would caution strongly against this term.\n  The RLT/Wasserstein calculations might result in a metric in the\n  mathematical sense (for sure, the Wasserstein distance constitutes\n  a metric on the space of barcodes, as the paper mentions), but I am\n  not sure whether the *score* calculated in this section constitutes\n  a metric. If anything, this would have to be proven.\n\n- The 'Metric' section is also hard to read because of differences in\n  terminology. Why is $\\xi$ used to represent an index, whereas other\n  Greek letters are used for functions? What is $\\delta$? Is it the\n  proposed measure of disentanglement?\n\n- After the 'Metric' section, I am missing a concluding section, that\n  summarises how the method works in practice. The following questions\n  need to be answered:\n\n  1. How are topological features computed (i.e., which point cloud is\n     being used and which filtration)?\n\n  2. How is the Vietoris--Rips complex computed in practice? How is its\n     scale parameter $\\epsilon$ chosen?\n\n  3. What is the dimensionality used to compute topological features,\n     i.e. are high-dimensional features being used at all?\n\n\n- '...to those of the reals.': what does this mean?\n\n- It seems that $\\tau$ is not used consistently; is $\\rho$ meant in\n  Figure 6?\n\nAll in all, this paper makes me very excited about the potential of\ntopology-based methods, and I envision that, with some changes, this\nwill be a strong publication in the future!\n\n# Style & clarity\n\nThe paper is well-written; here are some additional suggestions for\nfurther improving its clarity: \n\n- 'generated dSprites' --> 'generated from the dSprites data set'?\n\n- 'by composition' --> 'by the composition'\n\n- The term 'group' is unfortunately somewhat overloaded as well; is\n  'factor' more appropriate in some places? Or is the paper actually\n  talking about manifold groups?\n\n- I would strongly suggest to check whether 'persistent homology' might\n  not be ore appropriate in many places instead of 'homology'. The\n  latter should be reserved to the setting of *one* simplicial complex,\n  but the main argument of the paper is that one has to adopt\n  a multi-scale description of the data set. \n\n# Update after initial revision\n\nI have re-read the revised version multiple times now, and I thank the authors for the amount of work they put into their revision. I am raising my score for the next discussion round. That being said, I want to point out why I cannot fully endorse this paper yet. First, from the point of topological data analysis, the central algorithm is a comparatively small extension of the Geometry Score paper. I agree that this is a superb idea, yet the main contribution for me lies in the application of that technique to disentanglementâand for this to be fully understandable, some more work is needed. For example, putting the central algorithmic details into the appendix will make the adoption of the method that much harder. \n\nMoreover, while I appreciate the overall story and description of the method, I do not think that readers will understand how this disentanglement is actually _achieved_ by means of the proposed TDA approach. I would therefore prefer to see a more 'technical' or 'algorithmic' description of the contributions in the main paper, in particular since I think that the ideas of conditional submanifold topology require more attention.\n\nMy expertise is more the topology and less so the application of disentanglement; nevertheless, this paper strikes me as highly ambitious with a lot of potential, yet somewhat unfinished in its present form. I do believe that it has the potential to be extremely impactful with some additional modifications (concerning conciseness, but also experimental details).\n\nI fully realise that this is not yet the desired outcome for the authors; I shall endeavour to discuss this further with my fellow reviewers to see that we can reach a consensus!",

The key insight is that for a disentangled representation, when we fix a certain factor of variation at different values the topology of the conditional sub-manifolds should be similar. Using this insight the paper proposes a metric for disentangling which does not require annotations of the factors of variation and is more general than previous such tests.\n\nStrengths\n+ Having an approach that is general and easy to compute across datasets and models makes a lot of sense\n\nWeaknesses\n\nIt would be nice to further clarify the intuitions for how disentangling relates to the manifold structures using more examples in the paper for people who are not familiar with the manifold topology literature. For example, in Fig. 3 it would be nice to show qualitatively what an entangled model would do for the rotation scale disentangling situation.\n\nIt seems somewhat surprising that \\beta-VAE_{B} does so much worse than \\beta-VAE on CelebA, were the hyperparameters tuned separately for the CelebA dataset?\n",

Iâd still recommend publication, given the novelty and importance of a theoretical sound metric for disentanglement.\n\nComments/questions:\n1. The Introduction, Background and Manifold interpretation sections do a good job of introducing the subject, covering the literature and providing enough background about differential geometry, but I think a clear algorithmic demonstration of steps (d) and (e) of Figure 2 is lacking. \n      1.

Toward this, the paper first assumes disentangled factors reside in different manifolds. These different manifolds are the sub-manifolds of some manifold M for a given disentangled generative model. The paper considers the fact that in an entangled model the sub-manifolds are not homeomorphic and thus similarity across submanifolds can be measured to evaluate a modelâs disentanglement. As such, disentanglement is related to the topological similarity.  For measuring topological similarity, the paper then introduces Wasserstein Relative Living Times.

The paper also includes a supervised variant which can directly assess topological similarity of submanifolds with label-spaces. The paper also introduces a novel variation of RLTs that  employs wasserstein distance instead of euclidean distance. \n\nStrengths:\n* Novel application of topological similarity to unsupervised evaluation of disentangling.\n* Unsupervised and supervised metrics are both in the same units, and can be directly compared.\n* Experimental comparison, using the proposed metric, of many standard disentangling models on challenging datasets.\n\nWeaknesses:\n* The comparison of the proposed metric to mutual information gap and the metric from Kim and Mnih 2018 shown in Figure 7 is not convincing. Not only does the ranking change, but the distributions of scores look wildly different between models (e.g., \\mu has low variance for VAE in both supervised and unsupervised cases, but both MIG and Kim & Minh show relatively high variance for VAE). It is possible that discrepancy is a good thing, and that the proposed model is capturing disentangling even better than the baseline metrics. However, there is not enough experimental validation to know whether this is the case. The paper would be stronger if it had more experimental validation, including a replication of the reported scores from the MIG (Chen et al., 2018) and (Kim and Minh 2018) paper, and deeper analysis explaining the relative differences in scores for models. Without this component, it is difficult to know whether the model comparison results (Table 1) are meaningful.\n* It would be nice to include a discussion of how the proposed metric accounts for âdeadâ units (e.g., Eastwood & Williams 2018)? These might result in topologically similar submanifolds (since the conditional distributions would be nearly identical) and a worse score for the metric, even though the representation is arguably well-disentangled.\n\nClarity:\n* Typo: Page 6, Line 5: âFigure 9â should be âFigure 4â\n\nOther notes:\n* It would be very interesting to see an experiment where the unsupervised metric is used to choose hyper-parameters of a model which is then evaluated in a supervised way, to demonstrate that the unsupervised metric is a valid substitute for a supervised metric.",
