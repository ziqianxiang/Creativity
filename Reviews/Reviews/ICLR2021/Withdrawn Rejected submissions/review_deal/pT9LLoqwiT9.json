            "review": "The paper introduced a novel probabilistic amodal segmentation algorithm. The proposed approach introduced spatial priors that encode the target object's pose and shape, and learns to utilize contextual representations to reason about the correct amodal boundary of objects. Experiments are conducted in a dataset consist of occluded vehicles, and results demonstrate that in several cases, the proposed approach is able to generate better object boundaries when compared to existing approaches.\n\nThe novelty of this paper is that it introduces a nice approach that extended the compositionalNet approach by Wang et al. The formulations of the approach make sense and the introduction of context features, as well as compositional priors, is novel as well. The approach also enables learning in a weaklly-supervised fashion, and experimental results demonstrated some interesting behavior of the proposed approach.\n\nWhile I think the approach is novel and the formulations are very interesting, the experimental results are worse than I expected. While I don't think this is a determinist factor for paper rejection, as a reader I do hope to understand more about why the approach sometimes falls behind in performance:\n- In Tables 1 & 2, the performance was worse when occlusions are small. Could the authors provide a few more visualizations for those cases? The mean IOU may not be a very intuitive factor for determining the visual quality of the segmentation prediction, so I wonder if the proposed approach is actually generating more visually pleasant results though the numbers are worse. \n- The approach was only evaluated on a dataset consists of vehicles, who has a strong geometric prior. I was wondering if authors can comment on the potentials of the approach when facing additional object categories.",

The weakly supervised settings are more realistic than the fully supervised settings. The technical part is somewhat incremental, which extends the compositional CNNs to fulfill instance segmentation and amodal completion. The experimental results were conducted on two datasets and seem to show the advantage of the proposed method.\nThe reviewer has one suggestion: Since amodal instance segmentation remains very difficult, it may be more informative to provide more visual examples showing how difficult the task is and how well the state-of-the-arts perform.",

            "review": "The proposed paper introduces a novel approach for amodal segmentation of objects that is an extension of Context-Aware Compositional Networks. In particular, the paper discusses the following extensions: (1) spatial priors are introduced to explicitly encode prior knowledge of object poses and shape, (2) the implementation of partial classification is discussed, (3) amodal completion from partial bounding boxes is explored, and (4) the implementation of amodal segmentation is explored by classifying visible and invisible regions.\n\nOverall, I have the impression that this is an interesting paper that already has a few things going for it. The proposed extensions to CompositionalNets seem reasonable and are technically sound, the method is evaluated against two other methods, and the results are promising. Furthermore, the paper is mostly well-written and easy to follow. However, I have the following objections and therefore I am not in strong support of this work. In fact, it seems this work would benefit from a thorough revision prior to accepting it for publication: \n\n- Although well-written, the introduction seems convoluted as there is a disconnect between what is discussed in the paragraphs of the introduction and the list of contributions. When reading the list of contributions it felt like these were never mentioned before. \n\n- The contribution of the paper is mostly in exploring a few new strategies for improving upon CompositionalNet. This seems to be successful, but compared to existing work, the technical contributions are somewhat incremental. \n\n- The method does not discuss any limitations. As is, it is not clear in which situations the method fails or what cases the method cannot handle well. \n\n- The method was only evaluated to work on car object instances. So, it is not clear if the method will also work for other object categories; e.g. slender structures, like poles. Testing the method on more complex data would strengthen the paper.\n\n\nAdditional comments: \n\n- The first sentence in the introduction seems somewhat off: what is meant by 'our human visual system can localize and segment the visible part of objects'? This should be rephrased. \n\n- Intro (P3): the discussion on CompositionalNets is not clear. First the text states that CompositionalNets 'can robustly classify and detect objects under partial occlusions' and then it states that 'for obvious reasons, they are not sufficient'. This should be clarified. \n\n- Related Work: To provide a more thorough overview of related work, it may be useful to also discuss top-down (region proposal based) vs bottom-up (per-pixel embedding) instance segmentation approaches. \n\n-  RW (P2): the first sentence states: 'Observed in biological vision, pixel-level annotations are not necessary to accomplish object segmentation ...' What does that mean? \n\n- In Section 3 it is not clear what the contributions of the proposed paper are and what was introduced in previous work (Kortylewsk et al. 2020, Wang et al. 2020). To avoid this, an illustration of the network setup would help that clearly shows which components where introduced by other method and what is new. \n\n- For Figure 1 (b) it is not clear what an iteration is. \n\n- No details on the size of the dataset are provided. \n\n- It would be interesting to see more results (e.g. provided as supplementary material). \n\n- There are a few typos and missing spaces throughout the text (e.g. in front of 3) in the conclusion. \n\n",

            "review": "Summary\n-------------\n\nThe paper addresses the challenging task of amodal instance segmentation which extends the task of instance segmentation by also segmenting invisible, occluded parts of the objects. The paper considers the problem setup of weak supervision where only inmodal bounding box annotations are given.\n\nThe proposed model extends Context-Aware CompositionalNets by allowing them to perform amodal instance segmentation instead of object detection. The model follows two stages by first classifiying a proposed region and its amodal bounding box, then performs per-pixel classification to get the amodal instance segmentation. \n\nEvaluations were performed against two baselines on KINS and OccludedVehiclesDetection using mean-IOU as the performance metric. \n\nStrengths\n-------------\n+ This work is the first to address amodal instance segmentaton using inmodal bounding box labels\n+ The writing is fairly easy to follow except for the methodology.\n+ The experimental results show improvement over PCNet in some cases which requires occluder segmentation masks.\n\nWeaknesses\n-----------------\n- Datasets like COCOA dataset is missing [1] which is important for validating the method on a more challenging dataset.\n\n- mean Average Precision results are missing which is more common for instance segmentation  [1]\n\n- No inmodal instance segmentation and amodal bounding box results. This experiment would help identify whether the model is also SOTA on these tasks.\n\n- It is not clear how the values for the hyperparameters like  gamma1, gamma2, and delta were obtained. Was there early stopping involved? \n\n- The methodology is very hard to follow without a Figure that shows the pipeline, Algorithm or without code available. For example, it is not clear how p(A) was obtained? also it was very difficult to understand how all the components connect all together.\n\n- Although the proposed method has many different components, no ablation studies were provided to study the effect of these components. \n\n- the results were obtained from a single run. It is important to have results from multiple runs showing both the mean and standard deviation which gives us a reliability measure.\n\n- could the authors provide the code in the rebuttal to help us verify the results and identify practical details of the algorithm? since the proposed method looks convoluted it is easy for the code to have a bug, so I would like to run few example experiments to make that verification. \n\n- since the method looks like it has many moving knobs and components it might be slow to traiin. could the authors provide run-time experiments?\n\n- No annotation budget experiments were shown. While acquiring bounding boxes clearly takes less time than instance segmentation, it is important to have an experiment where we fix the annotation budget for labeling and compare a fully supervised model (like [2] )  trained on X instance segmentation labels against the proposed method on Y bounding box labels, where Y>>X.  This experiment tells us whether its worth using weakly supervised methods.\n\n- There are missing references for weakly-supervised instance segmentation like [3,4,5,6].\n\n[1] Self-Supervised Scene De-occlusion.

However many experiments and metrics are missing. Also since the code, the main model figure, and pseudo code  are missing, it makes it very difficult to reproduce the results in the paper. Thus i recommend marginally below acceptance, unless some of these issues are addressed in the rebuttal. II would then raise my score.",

            "review": "Positive:\n\n1.\tThe pipeline built on CompositionalNet by introducing spatial prior for amodal instance segmentation is easy to understand and reasonable. The results show the corresponding performance improvements in Occlusion Vehicle Dataset.\n2.\tThe paper structure and writing are clear.\n\nNegative:\n\n1.\tThe idea of using association between object shape priors and object categories to segment novel objects with only bounding box annotations has already been widely used, such as [1][2], which needs a discussion or comparison on the differences in obtaining spatial prior.\n\n2.\tThe segmentation results shown in paper only covers limited vehicle categories，which is rigid body with very strong spatial prior. I am curious about whether the proposed model can also handle deformable objects very well, such as animals and humans. The obtained spatial prior by averaging foreground segmentation of each training image may have limitations when dealing with those complicated cases. While the compared BBTP can deal with diverse object categories. It is highly suggested that the authors can provide their performance also on the dataset with more diverse categories, such as COCOA [3], and incorporate more qualitative results with different object categories.\n\n3.\tThe proposed method is more like an incremental extension to CompositionalNet by adding spatial prior and bounding box completion, which has not much technical novelty.\n\n[1] ShapeMask: Learning to Segment Novel Objects by Refining Shape Priors.
