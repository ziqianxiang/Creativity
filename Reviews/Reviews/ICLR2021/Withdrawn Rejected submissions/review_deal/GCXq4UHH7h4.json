However, there is no discussion on how this relaxed problem is in fact quite non-convex and how this choice of relaxation introduces a significant number of local minima. The comparison the authors offer is with very simplistic algorithms, rather than the more sophisticated ones in the literature.\n\nOverall, this is an interesting approach that I think deserves to be eventually published.

It shows using learned selective sensing can significantly improve the reconstruction accuracy over the (random Gaussian) compressed sensing and uniform subsampling counterparts. \n\nHowever, the novelty of the proposed method is very limited. The idea of using continuous interpolation on the discrete indices/grid, i.e. the main technical contribution in this paper, has already been proposed for CS-MRI sensing pattern design [1]. Although it is conducted on the k-space, applying this technique on image pixel space is straightforward and trivial. Besides, the comparison to a closely related work [2] is missing -- the probabilistic subsampling could also be used for the problem this paper tackles. \nFinally, since the selective sensing pattern is learned from data, it's more fair to compare it with the learned compressed sensing counterpart, as exploited in the journal version of the ReconNet [3] used in this paper. \n\n[1] PILOT: Physics-Informed Learned Optimized Trajectories for Accelerated MRI  \n[2] Deep probabilistic subsampling for task-adaptive compressed sensing  \n[3] Convolutional Neural Networks for Noniterative Reconstruction of Compressively Sensed Images  ",

            "review": "The paper proposes a nonuniform sampling design scheme chosen using training data to reduce the computation of compressed sensing acquisition. The use of learning methods such as back propagation for the nonuniform sampling design problem is interesting. However, compressive sensing approaches in practice do not perform computation to obtain the measurement vector; instead, the sensors rely on custom hardware (such as the single pixel camera or the modulated wideband converter) to have the hardware act on the discretized signal according to the matrix design. Thus, considerations of the \"sensing complexity\" are moot in those cases, and the approach provided in this paper is only relevant in cases where custom sampling schemes can be designed (e.g., when the referred imaging sensors are used).\n\nIn these terms, the paper can be understood as the joint formulation of a nonuniform sampling and deep learning-based recovery of the sensed image. The authors provide numerical comparisons with random sampling and uniform subsampling, as well as with CS with random matrices. The use of uniform subsampling makes their approach comparable to existing approaches for image super-resolution based on deep learning, but this connection is not discussed.\n            \nThere are some other minor issues with the paper:\n\n* Claiming a complexity of O(1) for selective sensing ignores the fact that the number of measurements required for recovery is dependent on the signal length N, which is accounted for in the other complexities cited.\n* Like selective sensing, sparse coding also does not require any prior knowledge of the sparsity structure of the data.\n* Fourier (k-space) measurements can be obtained directly with optical hardware.\n* The function o(.) has different inputs in different instances; please check for consistency.\n* The relaxed formulation of the integer program does not specify the fact that the solution should be a subset of {0,...,M-1}; some of the entries of the set I might point to the same integer.\n* The description of fine-tuning should be more detailed - is it simply more iterations of GD over Theta?\n* The sentence \"We also train the reconstruction networks in RS+Net from scratch based on the pre-trained selection indices in SS+Net\" is not clear. Wouldn't this make the random samples not random?\n",

            "title": "Anonymous review of selective sensing paper",
            "review": "Summary: The paper proposes a framework for jointly optimizing a selective sensing operator and a neural network for reconstruction. The motivation is to alleviate the quadratic (in dimensions) complexity associated with standard compressive sensing by using a dimension-free selective sensing approach, which can be jointly optimized with the decoder while guaranteeing that the relevant information is preserved. As this formulation yields a mixed discrete-continuous optimization, the authors propose a standard relaxation of the discrete constraints using interpolation. \n\nStrengths: The paper is generally well-written and organized and easy to follow. The idea of jointly optimizing the sensing and the decoder is interesting, although not really that novel.  \n\nWeaknesses: While the work has some merit, the development of ideas is lacking in many respects. Here are few major comments I have: \n- The paper incorrectly overstressed the limitation of compressive sensing due to the computational complexity of applying a matrix, say from a Gaussian random ensemble, to the signal of interest. In many applications, applying such matrices follows from the structure of the sensing device. For example, applying a Fourier matrix, which come with provable guarantees, can be done using a lens! In other words, physics does it for you for free. In other cases, a mask amounts to applying a Hadamard matrix to your image. \n- At a fundamental level, I am questioning the generality of the proposed approach which uses selective sampling. More specifically, it is well recognized that compressive reconstruction from a small number of measurements requires the incoherence of the sensing matrix and the sparsifying basis. This is known not to hold with the sparse matrices associated with selective sampling. The paper does not even explain any of these issues and limitations, and does not investigate it. \n- The main motivation is to reduce the computational complexity of sensing. However, the paper does not provide any comparisons to the state-of-the-art concerning computational gains. While the joint optimization of the selector and the decoder is done during the training phase, in practice they will need to be re-trained for different datasets and scenarios, which is not necessarily going to save on computation.\n- There is a large body of work on non-uniform compressive sampling that is not discussed in this work. \n- Autoencoders can also be trained to obtain compressed representations that preserve information. This is a well-studied area that the paper fails to discuss. \n\nGiven the above, I am unable to recommend this paper for publication. For me, it is a clear reject. \n",
