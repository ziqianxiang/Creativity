        "comment": "The authors extend prior work showing that networks trained to be certifiably robust using interval bound propagation are universal approximators. They extend prior results applicable to ReLU networks to a much broader class of networks with general activation functions. \n\nThe paper makes an interesting contribution to the literature relative to prior literature showing that one need not sacrifice universal approximation guarantees while training networks with IBP to be certifiably robust to l_inf attacks.\n\nSince the paper is primarily theoretical, the main concern raised by the reviewers was around novelty and the theoretical significance of ideas presented relative to prior work. While proof techniques may be novel, the extension of AUA results to alternate activation functions is not surprising and do not substantially contribute to the field's understanding of learning certifiably robust networks particular since most SOTA results for IBP-based training have been achieved with ReLU based networks. The authors' rebuttal did not providing convincing arguments for the reviewers to revise their scores. Hence I do not feel that the contributions of the paper justify acceptance at this time."

            "title": "Interesting Theoretical Result on Expressivity/Certifiability of NN, but only Incremental Extension - Lack of Novelty",
            "review": "The paper shows an \"augmented\" universal approximation (UA) result for neural networks that the authors call Abstract UA (AUA for short) and the motivation comes from understanding expressivity and certifiability of NN. Their result holds for NN with a wide variety of activation units and this is the main point of the paper, which directly extends the same result for ReLU networks (Baader et al. 2020).\n\nTypically, results in UA state that any continuous function f on a bounded domain can be expressed as a combination of activation units, sometimes even with only one hidden layer and one output layer, which is the classical result by Cybenko (1989), Hornik (1989) and more.  Their augmented version asks what if we want to have a more robust version of those statements, where we want to certify that any given box in the domain of f is mapped through the NN in such a way so that the NN values always stay close to the values of f. More formally, for some given accuracy \\delta, we want to have |NN(x) - f(x)| < \\delta for all x in the box. Furthermore, we would like to be able to certify this property and to do so we can use the technique of interval propagation. (To put it differently, the image of any interval of f is basically \"sandwiched\" between two close-by surfaces that are output by the NN.)\n\nThe result is of theoretical nature and this is fine as expressivity and certifiability are not yet well-understood. The major issue with the paper is the lack of novelty. The most related paper in terms of techniques and ideas (Baader et al.) proved the exact same result when the activations are ReLUs instead of the wider variety of activation units considered in the paper. The units considered here, are basically monotone functions that have upper and lower cut-offs or can be phrased as such after a simple transformation. The main ideas for approximating functions via step functions and indicators on intervals or boxes has been used for decades (even starting with the folklore results in approximation theory) and there seems to be lack of substantially new ideas. The reviewer feels that given the previous work on ReLUs (Baader et al.), the proof for the more general activation units can be reverse-engineered. Finally, of secondary importance the authors state some simplifications over Baader et al.\n\nA minor issue that the reviewer is ok with, is that for a more practice-oriented person, it is hard to buy the motivation from adversarial robustness/certifiability as in many settings the adversary will not just choose an attack bounded in \\ell_infinity by some small parameter. It is nice to have certifiable NN and know their behaviour if the inputs slightly change, however the motivation also needs to address what happens when a few large perturbations are allowed like the single-pixel attack (\"One pixel attack for fooling deep neural networks\").\n\nOverall, conditioned on the immediate prior work,  the result itself simply extends AUA from ReLU activations to more general units, and is not surprising. \n\nOne quick suggestion: Can the authors clarify how the lipschitzness of f or of the NN can affect the statements? Otherwise, the theorem may be misinterpreted as a consequence of continuity.\n\nSuggestions for future improving:\nDid the authors consider proving something along the lines of depth separation results for such kinds of AUA? The reviewer believes this could give a new dimension to the AUA theorems and draw another connection with certifiability and depth/width tradeoffs. Depth is usually preferred in practice over width, and a formal way for proving this is to show the power of depth in representing functions: for example, relevant works here are Telgarsky's (Benefits of depth in neural networks) and later improvements (Better Depth-Width Trade-offs for Neural Networks through the lens of Dynamical Systems) that show exponential separations in depth vs width by constructing highly oscillatory functions. However these works do not consider certifiability which may be an opportunity for your techniques.\n\nAnother quick question: Is there a formal comparison of your squashable activation units to the semi-algebraic units considered in Telgarksy? Maybe your results can also capture such activations?\n \nOther comments:\n\nTheorem 3.3:  Do the authors consider this one of the main contributions of the paper? Wouldn't it be better to be stated as a proposition, as it is quite straightforward for the activation units stated there?\n\np1: \"Their theorem states that not only can neural networks approximate any continuous function f\n(universal approximation)\" ... the reviewer believe that this first part of the sentence is a bit misleading as universality has been known since the 80s. The sentence starting with \"but...\" is the extension presented in Baader et al. and that is the contribution, right?  \n\nFig.1: When one takes interval bounds and considers a superset of box B, shouldn't the output be superset of f(B)? Maybe the figure is a bit confusing? What does it mean:  \"(Right is adapted from Baader et al. (2020).)\"\n\np2: When Abstract universal approximation (AUA) theorem is stated: Again f is continuous so it should be clarified. Also: Line 5 of this paragraph: interval bounds are stated but if the parameters are not given (is it \\eps?) like it was done in the intro, then the result is not meaningful as it would be a consequence of the continuity of f and Lipschitzness of NN (please discuss).  Maybe another way to phrase the same thing, is to say that whenever the input is changed to B+\\eps, the network follows f(B)+\\delta for appropriate parameters? The point is just that the NN will not do anything \"too wild\" correct? In other words, there is a NN that will map intervals of f to not-much-wider intervals correct?\n\nTypos/Inaccuracies:\np2: the AUA theorem implies us that \np2: while controlling approximation error δ\np2: a bounded number of layers --> just one hidden layer was proved in Cybenko. What is the \"standard\" feedforward NN?\np2: an universal -> a (several places)\np6: has rigid values --> rigid? (meaning relu is fixed everywhere?)\n\n",

The paper shows that for a continuous function $f$ there exists a neural network $N$ such that for any box $B$ the range of outputs of $N$ is close (in a parameter $\\delta$) to the range of outputs of $f(x)$, $\\forall x \\in B$.\nThis proof is constructive and applies to $N$ using ReLU, sigmoid, tanh or ELU activation functions. (The result actually includes an even larger class of activation functions, that the authors call _squashable_.)\n\nA previous work, Baader et al., shows the same result when neural networks use ReLU activation functions. The authors of this paper provide a result applicable to a broader class of networks. They also improve the size of neural networks constructed in Baader et al. (as discussed in the last paragraph of Section 6), but at many points in the paper this result feels to be incremental.\n\n-- Minor comments about the paper:\n\nFigure 1, which assumes Eq (1), could be moved to the top of Page 4, after Eq (1) is stated.\n\nSections 3 and 4 have lots of text in bold. Many paragraphs are named, and then they have definitions with the same name. It reduces readability.\n\nThe bottom of Figure 6 and the text are too close to each other.\n\n**Updates**:\n\nAfter carefully reading comments of the other reviewers as well as the authors' response, I change my score from 6 to 5.",

[2020], demonstrating that interval analysis provable ReLU networks are universal approximators, to a larger class of activation functions, which they call squashable functions.    Furthermore, they claim that their proof of this theorem is simpler due to using a bounded depth construction.  \n\nPros:\n\n* Their theorem does reduce the depth of the necessary construction.\n\n* Expanding the theorem to more activation types is a potentially useful contribution.\n\n* Technically, the paper appears to be correct.\n\nCons:\n\n* The proposed method mostly follows the same proof technique ad Baader et al. [2020] and thus is not particularly novel.\n\n* The authors claim that their method uses the most commonly used activation functions, yet ReLU is by far the most relevant activation function and is already included in the original theorem.\n\n* The number of ReLUs they use for an indicator function (they might need to use intractably many indicator functions) is asymptotically identical to Baader et al [2020]. They have only reduced the number of neurons used per indicator by a constant.  However, it is unclear whether this is an advantage, since the method appears to use more slices as well.  How do the two methods compare in terms of number of neurons for the entire net when considering the same function, delta, and epsilon?\n\n* The title “Generalized Universal Approximation for Certified Networks” is claims a significant improvement in generality over the original paper, Universal Approximation with Certified Networks (Baader et al. [2020]), yet the addition of other activation functions is hardly a significant enough difference to warrant such a claim of generality.\n\n* Care is not taken when introducing concepts from prior work:  Section 3.2 discusses concepts introduced first by Cousot et al. [1992] and then brought to neural networks by Gehr et al. [2018], but is presented as if it were new.  Definition 4.1 is an idea developed by Baader et al [2020] yet this is also not made clear.  Section 6.2 proposes an idea that is very similar to Def 4.2 from Baader et al and uses concepts introduced as the nodal basis function in He et al [2018] but does not make this clear. \n\nFinal Review:\n\nIn summary, while technically the paper does not appear to have flaws, its contributions are incremental, and its similarity to prior work is such that it is hard to recommend acceptance.

The main contribution of the paper is to extend the result of Baader et al., 2020 to networks using general squashable activation functions.\n\nI think that the main weakness of this paper is its novelty. The main idea of the proposed result seems very similar to that by Baader et al., 2020: approximate a target function using a summation of indicator functions. This idea and using a squashable (or sigmoid) activation function to approximate the indicator function have been widely used in the universal approximation literature.
