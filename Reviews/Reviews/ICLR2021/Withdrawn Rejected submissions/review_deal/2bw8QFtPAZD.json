            "review": "**Summary**: \nThis work addresses the problem of defending against adversarial attacks on point cloud deep networks (PontNet, DGCNN, pointconv ). The defense tackles two types of attacks: attacks that deform the object's geometry and attacks that shift or drop the points but keep the object's overall shape. The defense consists of preprocessing the attacked point cloud by Statistical Outlier Removal (SOR). Then it fits the point cloud to a trained Occupancy network that is learned to represent the shapes of the domain implicitly. A regularizer is used during the optimization of the restoration to make sure that the points uniformly distribute on the shape using maximization of KNN distances. Empirical results are shown on the ModelNet40 classification task, and an improvement over other defenses to recover from recent adversarial attacks on several point cloud networks is observed.     \n\n**Strengths** :\n- Abundant experiments are performed on the standard ModelNet40 dataset, and very recent strong baselines are compared against the proposed IF-defense. The results are significant in terms of improvement over the baselines. The paper show the usefulness of the method on pointNet, pointNEt++, DGCNN, and PointConv\n- The paper is well-organized and presented   \n\n\n\n\n**Weaknesses**:\n- The novelty is marginal: the implicit function representation was used for point cloud completion in DeepSDF(Park, et al. , 2019), the KNN loss is also not new since it is used in (Yu et al., 2018) and in knn-attack paper (Tsai et al. ,2020) in the opposite way ( to make the attack smooth .). From Figure 4, removing the KNN loss (by setting $\\lambda = 0$) would only reduce the performance by 1% , so it is not the main factor for the proposed IF-defense success. However, introducing implicit functions in the realm of adversarial attacks is new  \n- The experiment setup has some flaws. First, every attack method should have a limited budget $\\epsilon$ (max allowed distance norm) to compare the attacks and defenses fairly. Since no budget is mentioned in the paper, any shift-based attacks can break a defended network if a considerable change in the input. The results in Tables 2-5 are probably for unbounded attacks. The defenses are applied only after the attack is performed on an undefended network ( so the attacks are expected to be weak since they do not use the full budget. Instead, they use the minimum). \n- The pipeline for the defense is complicated relative to other point cloud defenses. The use of SOR as pr-processing ( SOR itself is a defense ) is not justified nor ablated. The proposed IF-defense consists of training a reconstruction network AND an optimization to fit the attacked point cloud to the implicit surface. Other defenses rely only on inference, which is less computationally expensive than the proposed defense \n\n\nMinor issues :\n- Some grammar mistakes:\" address both the attack effects.\", . ..etc ..\n- Table 2-5 could have been visualized better by using a bar chart, for example, to observe the relative performance of attacks and defenses. \n",

The author(s) show strong empirical defense performance over various attack methods and point cloud backbones.\n-----------------\nPros:\n1. The paper is well written and easy to follow. And the related work session is well organized.\n2. In my opinion, the proposed method is interesting and novel. The optimization process makes sense to me.\n3. The author(s) conducted extensive evaluation that shows the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n-----------------\nCons:\n1. Potentially unfair comparison: The implicit function is pre-trained on the ShapeNet dataset, which is much larger and diverse than ModelNet40. Do all baselines have access to both ShapeNet and ModelNet40? What is the performance of the proposed method trained only on ModelNet40, if ModelNet40 is the only accessible dataset for baselines?\n2. Analysis on the effectiveness of implicit function: Since the deep implicit function network is trained in clean data, would it be also vulnerable to adversarial attack? \n-----------------\nQuestions:\n1. As stated in the last paragraph in page 4, if the shape latent code is imprecise, why optimizations in page 5 can recover from it? If I understand correctly, the optimization does two things: 1) force points to be close  to the boundary defined by the shape latent code, 2) encourage points  to spread across the surface. And none of these two can help recovering from wrong shape latent code. Could you provide more reasoning / evidence to support this argument?\nAlso please address and clarify the cons above\n",

            "review": "### Summary\nIF-DEFENSE proposes a method for defending adversarial attacks for point cloud understanding tasks. The authors use an implicit function to reconstruct the surface information and restore the point clouds. Comparing with previous methods, IF-Defense presents a significant improvement in classification accuracy against multiple attacks on synthetic datasets.\n\n### Pros\nThe paper is overall clear to read. The figures are nice and the texts are easy to understand. The experiments are comprehensive. The performance improvement over the previous state-of-the-art is significant.\n\n### Cons\nMy main complaint about this paper is the problem it tries to solve. It seems to me that the adversertial attack (and defense) for the 3D point cloud-based scene understanding is not a big problem in practice. Point clouds need to be scanned by RGBD cameras or LiDARs. I don't think a perturbation attack is realistic at all. The only situation I can think is that the attacker has already controled the 3D camera. If that is the case, the system is compromised and there are a lot of easier attacks. Even for attacks such as local part removal and geometric deformation, you have to control and deform target objects... Unlike in a 2D attack which you only need to draw a dot onto a stop sign, such 3D attack is expensive to launch, and I don't think they are the weakest part in a system. \n\nI do understand this is probably not all authors' fault, as there are literatures about it. Therefore, I do not weight too much for this factor into my final rating. I will appreciate it if the authors could add more discussion in this regard.",

            "title": "Nicely executed work, but the lack of evaluation on adaptive attacks is a big red flag.",
            "review": "There are lots of reasons to accept this paper:\n* Important topic and timely work.\n* Combining implicit surface modeling with point-level adjustment is interesting, although I would have liked more justifications and explanations.\n* Results for the most part are noticeably better than SOTA.\n\nThe biggest red flag of the paper is that it doesn't evaluate against adaptive attacks, i.e., attacks that are aware of the defense mechanisms and are designed specifically to defeat the defense. See Carlini et al., On Evaluating Adversarial Robustness (https://nicholas.carlini.com/papers/2019_howtoeval.pdf), Section 2.5. More specifically, could an adversary generates point perturbations such that the recovered implicit surface appears to be of a completely different class and therefore your network will restore the point cloud to be of a completely different class?\n\nSuch attacks may or may not work, but as the defender, the burden is on you to show reasonable effort to 1) construct such attacks, and 2) show that your defense is reasonably robust even under such adaptive attacks.\n\nAlso, to what extent do the authors go through the attack pitfall checklist in the paper by Carlini et al.? (Sections 3.1 and 3.2). The bar of adversarial defense has been raised high by Carlini et al., and IMHO every paper should include a serious evaluation on adaptive attacks and go through the pitfall checklists.\n\nPlease address this during the rebuttal period. I am open to change my score after the author response.\n\nBelow are a few minor points. Would be nice to see responses to them.\n* Intellectually, could you give a brief explanation of the rationale behind your system? More specifically, what does the implicit surface model try to achieve, and why is it a good idea to first construct an implicit surface and then minimize the two proposed losses? The paper as it stands reads more like a technical report that describes what has been done without explaining much of the insights behind the work.\n* First paragraph in Section 3, what do you mean \"..the implicit model is trained purely on clean data, ...\"? Seems like the implicit model is trained on noise data with surface outliers removed, but that doesn't mean it's clean data?\n* Since the implicit field has noise and isn't perfect (after all, it's constructed from a perturbed point cloud albeit with SOR), what additional information do you expect it to provide beyond what's already in the noisy point cloud after SOR?\n* If the implicit surface is noisy, why does it make sense to \"encourage the optimized points to lie on the shape surface\"?\n* While it intuitively makes sense to \"encourages a more uniform point distribution\", I'd suggest that the point density should be correlated with the surface curvature -- intuitively flat surface shouldn't need many points and vice versa. Not a big deal here probably.\n* If your goal (evaluation metric) is the accuracy of the downstream tasks, shouldn't you co-train your entire defense network with the downstream task network?",
