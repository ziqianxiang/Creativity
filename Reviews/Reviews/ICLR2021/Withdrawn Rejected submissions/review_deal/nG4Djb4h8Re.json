        "comment": "This application-oriented paper has been carefully evaluated by three expert reviewers. Their assessments all agreed on a quite marginal methodological novelty of the presented work, yet they recognized nicely engineered pipeline of pre-existing modules that appears to satisfy an important remote sensing application. I agree with that assessment and concur with the reviewer's opinion that the work as presented, in spite of being of potential interest to healthcare or biomedical communities, will be of little interest to the ICLR audience. Therefore I recommend rejecting it.  "

Their system combines a pre-trained CNN with an existing meta learning method (MAML). The investigated both supervised and unsupervised training of their system.  Performance evaluation of their methods on benchmark datasets show their model significantly outperforms SOTA methods using multiple metrics as well as for different skin types. They further show that the unsupervised model achieves comparable results to the supervised model.\n\nThis is an interesting paper, with extensive evaluation that demonstrates their model’s superior performance  to SOTA methods. The technical novelties of their model, however, are incremental since it is primarily built the existing models : a pre-trained CNN, an existing meta-learning method (MAML), and use of the POS method to generate pseudo-labels for unsupervised learning.  \n\n",

            "review": "Contribution- \nIn this paper, the authors present a few-shot learning model for non-contact physiological signal measurement to build a more accurate and convenient personalized health sensing system. The motivation is that traditional fine-tuning method for this task is difficult since it requires large sets of high-quality training data for specific individuals, due to differences between each individual, measurement environment, and camera sensor condition. Therefore, the authors applied MAML on top of the existing deep learning network (TS-CAN) and implemented a model that aims to learn fast from a small number of training samples. The main contributions of this paper are: a meta-learning model that supports both supervised and unsupervised few-shot adaptation; improved performance by about 40% compared to a baseline that does not use meta learning; empirical analysis of performance for subjects with different skin types. \n\nStrengths- \nFew-shot learning could be beneficial for remote patient monitoring applications.  \nExperimental results on all three datasets are positive, with around 40%-50% MAE improvement compared to the baseline.  \nProvided experimental evaluation provides some insight into why the proposed approach works well in this application.  \n\nWeaknesses-  \nThis is a straightforward application of meta learning / few shot learning to a specific domain. Other than showing that meta learning / few shot learning is useful in yet another particular application, it is not clear how is this work advancing machine learning. \nSome explanations could have been more specific. For example, it is not clear how exactly are ‘pseudo labels’ generated and how do they compare with the ground truth labels.  \nThe experimental results do not do enough to provide some novel insight into MAML. For example, it would be good to see a comparison between pretrained model and MAML model performance as a function of data size, and how robust to hyperparameters are the competing approaches.   \n\nSummary of the rating:\nWhile the experimental results are positive, there is little methodological novelty and the experimental results do not seem to provide some interesting insights that might spur machine learning research in some novel directions.",

            "review": "Summary:\nThe paper proposes an (un)supervised meta-learning framework for few-shot adaptation in camera-based vital sign measurements denoted as \"MetaPhys\". The goal is to develop few-shot adapting personalized frameworks for remote physiological measurements with limited data. Authors perform cross-dataset evaluations to illustrate the model's few-shot adaptation capabilities.\n\nPositives:\nThe authors present their application domain and purpose very clearly, and the related work from literature are nicely explored. Experimental evaluations are thorough and the comparisons to state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches are done well.\n\nConcerns:\nUnfortunately I do not see any methodological contribution in this paper from a \"representation learning\" perspective. MetaPhys is (as far as it is presented in the paper) a framework on using model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) on physiological measurement data in unsupervised subject adaptation settings. Since MAML is already a model-agnostic approach, the paper seems to me like a well-presented reformulation and implementation of a well-known meta-learning algorithm in this respective application domain. The paper does not make a clearly stated distinction of their approach/contribution from a representation learning standpoint.\nThe authors list their contributions in four bullet-points, where the third and fourth ones relate to analyses of temporal and appearance features during model personalization, and analyses for subjects with different skin types. However these analyses are only addressed superficially (not described or analyzed in detail) at the end of the paper. Hence I would be questioning these as \"contributions\" of this paper.\n\nMinor comment:\nIn fact, the authors present MetaPhys for both supervised and unsupervised few-shot adaptation settings. Then why did the authors use \"unsupervised\" indication for the paper's title (and even in Abstract)?\n",
