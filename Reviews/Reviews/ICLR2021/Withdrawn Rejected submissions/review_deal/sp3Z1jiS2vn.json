            "review": "Summary:\nThe authors discuss neural nets operating on spherical signals that are equivariant not to SO(3) rotations, but only to SO(2) rotations around the poles. The linear equivariant maps are characterized in Fourier space and in terms of an azimuthal correlation. Experimentally, the authors show the method is approximately equivariant and show in simple experiments that the performance is comparable to a prior spherical convolution, with improved equivariance.\n\nStrengths:\n-\tThe authors make the important observation that in many cases in which spherical signals are processed, the relevant group to which one should be equivariant is SO(2), not SO(3).\n-\tThe authors make a practical characterization of the equivariant convolutions as restricted linear maps in Fourier space.\n\nWeaknesses:\n-\tProposition 2 seems to lack an argument why Eq 16 forms a complete basis for all functions h. The function h appears to be defined as any family of spherical signals parameterized by a parameter in [-pi/2, pi/2]. If that’s the case, why eq 16? As a concrete example, let \\hat{h}^\\theta_lm = 1 if l=m=1 and 0 otherwise, so constant in \\theta. The only constant associated Legendre polynomial is P^0_0, so this h is not expressible in eq 16. Instead, it seems like there are additional assumptions necessary on the family of spherical functions h to let the decomposition eq 16, and thus proposition 2, work. Hence, it looks like that proposition 2 doesn’t actually characterize all azimuthal correlations.\n-\tIn its discussion of SO(3) equivariant spherical convolutions, the authors do not mention the lift to SO(3) signals, which allow for more expressive filters than the ones shown in figure 1.\n-\tCan the authors clarify figure 2b? I do not understand what is shown.\n-\tThe architecture used for the experiments is not clearly explained in this paper. Instead the authors refer to Jiang et al. (2019) for details. This makes the paper not self-contained.\n-\tThe authors appear to not use a fast spherical Fourier transform. Why not? This could greatly help performance. Could the authors comment on the runtime cost of the experiments?\n-\tThe sampling of the Fourier features to a spherical signal and then applying a point-wise non-linearity is not exactly equivariant (as noted by Kondor et al 2018). Still, the authors note at the end of Sec 6 “This limitation can be alleviated by applying fully azimuthal-rotation equivariant operations.”. Perhaps the authors can comment on that?\n-\tThe experiments are limited to MNIST and a single real-world dataset.\n-\tOut of the many spherical CNNs currently in existence, the authors compare only to a single one. For example, comparisons to SO(3) equivariant methods would be interesting. Furthermore, it would be interesting to compare to SO(3) equivariant methods in which SO(3) equivariance is broken to SO(2) equivariance by adding to the spherical signal a channel that indicates the theta coordinate.\n-\tThe experimental results are presented in an unclear way. A table would be much clearer. \n-\tAn obvious approach to the problem of SO(2) equivariance of spherical signals, is to project the sphere to a cylinder and apply planar 2D convolutions that are periodic in one direction and not in the other. This suffers from distortion of the kernel around the poles, but perhaps this wouldn’t be too harmful. An experimental comparison to this method would benefit the paper.\n\nRecommendation:\nI recommend rejection of this paper. I am not convinced of the correctness of proposition 2 and proposition 1 is similar to equivariance arguments made in prior work. The experiments are limited in their presentation, the number of datasets and the comparisons to prior work.\n\nSuggestions for improvement:\n-\tClarify the issue around eq 16 and proposition 2\n-\tImprove presentation of experimental results and add experimental details\n-\tEvaluate the model of more data sets\n-\tCompare the model to other spherical convolutions\n\nMinor points / suggestions:\n-\tWhen talking about the Fourier modes as numbers, perhaps clarify if these are reals or complex.\n-\tIn Def 1 in the equation it is confusing to have theta twice on the left-hand side. It would be clearer if h did not have a subscript on the left-hand side.\n",

            "review": "This paper derives the theoretical basis for a convolution operator that is equivariant to azimuthal rotation. Prior works on spherical convolution study convolution operators that are equivariant to SO(3) rotation. In many use cases, however, full rotational invariance is not necessary or even harmful. This paper addresses this issue by deriving a more general convolution operator on the sphere and shows that prior works can be considered as a special case of the proposed operator. The proposed convolution definition has the desirable property of equivariant to SO(2) rotation with strong theoretical guarantee. It is also a generic operation that may be applied as the basic building block of spherical CNN in many applications.\n\nWhile the proposed operator has the desirable rotational equivariant property, the authors fall short on discussing other important properties of CNN. Except translational invariance, the convolution operator in ordinary CNN also benefits from 1) localized kernel, and 2) being computational and memory efficient. The proposed convolution kernel is global and has a high computational and memory overhead, which may limit its applicability to real world data. The authors should provide some discussion regarding these aspects and show that they do not outweigh the benefits on target applications.\n\nBeside the theoretical properties, another aspect that may be improved in this paper is the experiment. The purpose of the experiments are not clearly described and provide limited information. Given that the main contribution of this work is a more generalized convolution operation, the experiments should try to demonstrate how this generalized convolution operator is superior to prior spherical convolution operators. Some potential applications that may benefit from the proposed operator include object detection, scene understanding, etc. The authors should try to evaluate the method on these applications instead of MNIST. Also, the authors should explain why 1) the error increases in Fig 3a, and 2) why the model still falls short to generalize to rotated examples (or demonstrate this gap is irrelevant to rotational equivarience.).\n\nAnother comment on the paper is that the presentation may be improved. More specifically, given that there are multiple convolution definitions and different types of equivariance, the authors should try to avoid the confusion in the writing.\n",

            "review": "The authors present CNNs which are equivariant to azimuthal rotations, rather than the previously studied SO(3) rotations. The authors argue correctly that in many real-world settings, data have a canonical orientation in which they are recorded. In such cases, only equivariance to azimuthal rotations needs to be enforced in the convolutional layers. This formulation is less constrained compared to enforcing equivariance to the entire SO(3) group. \n\nPros:\n1. The authors present an interesting well-motivated theoretical idea to enforce azimuthal rotation-equivariance. They show that such operators have specific block-diagonal structure in the Fourier domain and how their action on spherical signals can be seen as correlations in the spatial domain.\n\n2. Their experiments show that, compared to a closely related work by Jiang et al., which uses icosahedral mesh rather than the complete sphere, the proposed work outperforms the baseline significantly on Omni-MNIST and Model40 classification. \n\nCons:\n1. The authors have not shown comparisons with earlier works on spherical CNNs such as Cohen et al. (2018) and Esteves et al. (2018). I understand that these works care about SO(3) equivariance rather than only azimuthal rotations. However, I think the value of this idea needs to be demonstrated empirically, i.e. utilizing the fact that the data come in a preferred orientation. I think this is an important and required comparison that the authors have missed. Only after looking at the improvements in performance over these papers can we conclude that the proposed method is a valuable addition to literature. \n\n2. Closely related to the above point, it is not clear why these datasets were chosen for the experiments. Neither Omni-MNIST nor the Model40 (after raycasting on the sphere) have a naturally preferred orientation. In other words, the authors have not used datasets where enforcing equivariance to the entire SO(3) group can be restrictive. I believe the authors should address this point if possible. ",
