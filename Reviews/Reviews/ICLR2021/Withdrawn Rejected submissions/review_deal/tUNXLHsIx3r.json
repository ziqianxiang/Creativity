            "review": "The authors build a recommendation system that takes trust into consideration. The authors consider 3 facets of trust: local\ntrust, category-based global trust, and global review-feedback based trust.  The trusts are modeled using heuristic-based ratings. These trust ratings, together with user-user-based similarity are fed into a feed-forward neural network to generate the final predictions for the recommendation system. The performance is estimated on the Epinion dataset.\n\n[Pros]\n1.Considering side-information like user trust(social ties/social connections/social impact) is a meaningful application.\n\n[Cons]\n1. My major concern is that the proposed method lacks technical contribution.  As the authors pointed out, a multi-faceted trust-based recommendation system is not a new idea and has already been studied in numerous previous works. The 3 facets of trust proposed by the authors and the modeling of them using heuristic-based ratings are just common-sense.\n\n2.Moreover, the authors use a deep neural network for the recommendation task. However, the input of the neural network only comes with a dimension of 6, which is surprisingly small. The power of a deep neural network is to learn complicated patterns through big data. Why not directly model the recommendation and trust end-to-end using a single deep neural network model(In the paper, the trust scores for the 3 facest are all generated by heuristic instead of directly learned/modeled). I think this is a fundamental problem with the current algorithm design.\n\n3.Last but not least, the setup, modeling, and formulation of the problem seem tailored to the Epinion dataset, which seems to lose generalizability and further constrains the contribution of this paper.\n\nBased on the reasoning above, I recommend rejecting this paper.",

            "review": "This paper proposed to take multiple facets of trust into account while looking at how suitable a product might be for a particular user, known as Social/Trust Recommender systems, which is usually to alleviate the cold start/sparse issue in recommender systems. The proposed MFTBR method provides a modular architecture for trust-based recommendation systems that allows the integration or removal of any number of trust facets, leading to different facet combinations.\n\n\nThe presentation of the paper can be significantly improved. The technical contribution of this paper is mediocre.  The proposed MFTBR piles up several similar modules but lacks adequate justification on why they are chosen for trust facets and why they can benefit the social/trust recommender systems. The idea of trust facets, including user-user similarity, local trust, category-wise global trust, and global review feedback, has already been incorporated in some relevant methodologies in different ways (e.g., TrustMF, TrustSVD, etc.). The combination is not particularly novel, and it is not clear if other advanced strategies can be adopted. It would be better if the authors could explicitly state the motivation of the design regarding the proposed trust facets in a clearer way. The neural network architecture illustrated in Figure 3 is not clearly presented in the text. Especially why the dimension in the input space is 6?\n\nIn experiments, the authors only use one small dataset to evaluate their effective performance.\nIt would be more convincing if other representative datasets, like Douban, Flixster, ciao, can be used to evaluate the performance. Furthermore, it would be better if more state-of-the-art baselines can be considered in experiments to validate the superiority of the proposed methods. For example, recently proposed GNN/DNN-based social/trust recommender systems can be considered as baselines. The experiments are not detailed enough. The experiment setting is not clearly stated. It is also not clear how their proposed method can address the cold-start and sparsity issue. It would be better if they could analyze the impact of different components (user-user similarity, local trust, category-wise global trust, and global review feedback).\n",

            "review": "\n1.\tQuality\nThe structure of the model and experiments are relatively complete, but the paper is poorly written. Also, the quality of English needs improving.\n2.\tClarity\nThe writing and expression of the paper need a lot of modification which is not very clear and fluent. Some problems are:\n\tToo many references are cited in the abstract. There are 4 lines of \"recent research\" in the abstract that is not necessary.\n\tOne section is need to define the problem.\n\tDataset is introduced in the second section which should be put in experiment.\n\tIn the part of research status, you just list some references. Paragraph that combine the research status with the research of this paper is need.\n\tStrange statement: For example, “If user u likes item I and has a friend user k, SocialFD not only branch u and I closer but also branch k and I, propagating trust.” in the last line of section 3.1.\n\tGrammatical mistakes such as “The Facets Considered Were: Social relation between U and V-derived from Jaccard's Similarity and explicit Trust Statements, feedback on V's Profile, and the global feedback on V's Review of Item I.” in Section 3.3.\n\tIn 4.1, the overview is given in a nutshell\n\tIn 4.2, the architecture should not be described just in a picture.\n\tSome of the necessary references are missing.\n\tLack of experiment environment settings, parameter settings, etc.\n\tOnly MAE, RMSE, RC is compared with baseline, and it is recommended that at least the runtime be evaluated.\n3.\tOriginality\nThe author combined 4 modules together: User-User similarity-based predictor, Local trust-based predictor, Category global trust-based predictor wise, Global review feedback-based predictor. The trust facet weights are computed through the neural network for optimal results, which is a measure of dynamicity is introduced which is lacking in previous models. The extensible and dynamic nature of MFTBR ensure that it remains relevant and accurate in various scenarios.\n4.\tSignificance\nPropose a modular architecture for trust-based recommendation systems that allows the integration or removal of any number of trust facets. The proposed method outperforms the baselines in MAE, RMSE and RC.\n5.\tPros and cons\n\tPros: Consider global and category. Generate viable predictions even when data is sparse.\n\tCons: \nThe statement or organization of the model is not clear enough in this article. More detailed explanation is suggested. There are so many errors in the manuscript.\nThere is the lack of enough experimentation to demonstrate the validity and applicability of the proposed method. The author needs to do more experiments with more angles and show them in this paper. For example, the paper did not record the running time, which made the experiment not convincing enough.\nThe method of this paper is not innovative enough. In fact, most of the work is done by combining other people’s methods. The authors need to highlight their innovative contributions.\n",

            "review": "In this paper, the authors focus on modeling multi-faceted trusts in collaborative filtering for rating prediction, which is a well-studied problem in recommender systems since the very beginning of early 1990s. In particular, the main idea is to use a neural network to learn the weight on the facets for better incorporation in final prediction. The authors then conduct empirical studies on one single dataset.\n\nSome comments:\n\n1 The organization of the paper can be improved significantly. For example, Section 2, Section 5 and Section 6 can be merged into one single section. \n\n2 The technical contribution is limited, e.g., the proposed solution is a two-staged heuristic solution based on neighborhood-based collaborative filtering and neural network.\n\n3 The results on one single dataset are not convincing to draw the conclusions.\n\n",
