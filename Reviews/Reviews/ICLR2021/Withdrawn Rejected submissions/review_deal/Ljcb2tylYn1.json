            "review": "The paper targets diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, through CNN-based analysis of Luria's alternating series. After extracting repeating patterns and their features, it computes kinematic such as velocity, acceleration, jerk and pressure parameters an uses them to color each segment and change the thickness of its line. Typical use of CNN networks follows for Parkinson's diagnosis. \n\nAlthough the studied problem is of interest, in the framework of analyzing subjects' writing for Parkinson's prediction, the focus of the paper is on the detection of features and their use for making typical CNN input data clearer. Its technical novelty is rather low. \n\nIn particular:\nSection 2 provides the background information which mainly refers to the Luria's alternating  series test. Some reference to the application of deep neural networks to either time series analysis, and to Parkinson's data analysis should be presented here.\nSection 3 that describes the problem is rather sketchy, naming the addition of some pressure and kinematic features to the drawing and then use some conventional CNN method for training. As is also mentioned in the discussion section, this requires more investigation, so as to optimize this procedure.\nSections 5 and 6 compare the use of AlexNet and LeNet-5 on the augmented data (it is strange that VGG16 performed so badly) showing a better performance of AlexNet, which is just an experimental result. no comparison is shown with other set-ups, such as the original drawings, to illustrate the achieved improvement.     \n\n",

            "title": "The paper explores the use of CNNs for the detection of Parkinson’s disease based on the Luria’s alternating series test. The main contribution of the paper is the use of derivatives from position to change color patterns attached to the  x,y series, as a way to codify kinematic information. Segments of the series are then processed as color images. The paper lacks a proper problem statement, has a poor English writing and exposes some methodological errors that cast doubts on the results.",
            "review": "The paper explores the use of CNNs for the classification of Parkinson's disease patients using data from the Luria’s alternating series test. Every register in the dataset contained four time series: timestamp, x and y positions and pressure. The main contribution of the paper is the use of derivatives from position (velocity, acceleration and jerk), and pressure to change color patterns attached to the x,y series, as a different way to codify kinematic information and in order to process the series as a color image. \n\nThe development of computer-aided tools to support the diagnosis and evaluation of Parkinson’s diseases has become a relevant topic in the last few years. Different sources of information have been used before, including kinematic features extracted from handwritten patterns, but the use of Luria’s alternating series test has not been widely explored. However, the paper has many weaknesses: \n\nThe quality of the English writing is poor, which makes some parts of the paper confusing. Moreover, it lacks a proper technical sound.\n\nThe paper lacks a proper problem statement; it is not clear why it is necessary to find new alternatives to codify kinematic information as an image. Moreover, it does not include proper comparison with other approaches in the state of art used to evaluate kinematic features extracted from handwritten patterns, in the same context. Just to name one example: Drotár, P., Mekyska, J., Rektorová, I., Masarová, L., Smékal, Z., & Faundez-Zanuy, M. (2016). Evaluation of handwriting kinematics and pressure for differential diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. Artificial intelligence in Medicine, 67, 39-46.\n\nThe authors should consider the inclusion of simple comparisons with recurrent networks, which are the classical approach to process sequential data, and where velocities, acceleration, jerk and pressure can also be included as input variables. \n\nThe paper lacks novelty from a learning representation point of view, since there is not any contribution in terms of network architecture, training methodologies nor loss functions, which is the main scope of the conference.\n\nValidation of Deep Neural Networks is typically performed without cross validation or any other validation methodology, since the size of databases used for training and validation purposes is usually big enough to guarantee statistically significant results. However, in this paper, the size of the database is quite small, so the same assumption cannot be made. Actually, the opposite behavior displayed by the two networks architectures evaluated (figures 5 and 7), increases the doubts about the validity of the results, and the sufficiency of the data set to achieve a proper training of the networks. More evidence should be provided regarding the patterns learnt by the network in the convolutional layers.\n\nAccording to the authors, based on the corners detected by the Shi-Tomasi algorithm, the series were split into segments and then the segments split into training and validation data sets. Taking into account that many segments came from the same subject, the training/validation partition should have followed a group partition strategy in order to avoid that segments from one subject were used for training and validation purposes at the same time. This could have led to optimistic results. \n\nThe paper contains a lot of typos, the quality of figures and images could be improved, some of them contain no relevant information. There are empty brackets (missing cites).\n\nFor these reasons I consider the paper is not suitable to be presented at the conference.",

            "review": "The authors apply straightforward CNN architectures to support Parkinson's disease diagnosis from drawing patterns. Several inconsistencies are found regarding the studied methods. Overall, the approach could not be relevant to the iclr audience. The experiments are not convincing. For example, Fig 5 does not reveal a suitable deep learning training, and only three epochs are iterated. Though the results presented in Table 1 seem acceptable, the described experimental set-up is not convincing. Besides, the related work is not fully defined. No mathematical background is displayed.",
