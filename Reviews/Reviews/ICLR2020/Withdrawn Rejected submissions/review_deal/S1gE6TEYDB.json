            "review": "Summary\nThis paper conducts research on image super resolution by addressing the problem of limited receptive field. The paper proposes two modules: GRUM (global reasoning upsample module) and GRRB (global reasoning reconstruction module), constructing a graph model based on different regions of an image and reasoning the relationships between them. This work has the potential to be a good publication, but I lean to reject this paper for now since it is not ready yet.\nStrengths\n- Doing image super resolution using graph model is novel. By building a graph with vertices of regions of an image, it is theoretically possible to address the problem of limited receptive field of CNN.\nWeaknesses\n- The designs of the two modules are not convincing. It is not clear to me why they are designed in this way. In other words, the authors stated that they are simulating the reasoning process of the human visual system, but I do not understand how GRUM and GRRB simulate the human visual system.\n- Section 3 is not reader-friendly. It is difficult to understand what is happening in these two modules by reading section 3.\n- The performance improvement is not significant. As the author listed in Table 3 and 4, the performance improvement is minor (roughly 1%?), which is not significant enough.\nPossible Improvements\nI would suggest rephrasing section 3, clearly demonstrating how the two modules simulate the human visual system (or why they are designed in this way)."

            "review": "This paper proposes a new network architecture to reconstruct an accurate high-resolution image through global reasoning. Specifically, the proposed method uses the previous module of RDN as the feature extraction part and attaches the proposed global reasoning upsampling module to it. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves better performance than the existing state-of-the-art methods.\n\n- The technical contribution of the proposed method (i.e. GRUM and GRRB) does not seem to be high judging from the ablation study (Section 4.2 and Table 1). The performance seems to be coming mainly from the RDN part. \n\n- It is not clear how the global reasoning upsample module (GRUM) affects the final performance. For example, this paper mentions that the benefit of this module is to dig out the influence of other pixels in the image on each region and this is equivalent to adding global guidance of the image to each node. However, what do you mean by global guidance, and how does the guidance affect the final performance on the super-resolution task? If possible, please elaborate on them and make the technical contribution of the proposed method clear."

            "review": "How to justify the receptive field is small? As the low-resolution image is small already, a network can definitely see holistic image as the receptive field is large enough to cover the whole image.\n\nIt seems contradictory to super-resolution process with the finding ``the brain generates the images we see based on a small amount of information observed by the human eye, rather than acquiring the complete data from\nthe point-by-point scan of the retina''. By reading the statement about the brain, it makes more sense that the brain does not reconstruct every details in understanding what appears in front of the eyes. However super-resolution requires finer reconstruction on the details. From this point, the first contribution is very weak.\n\nThe reference does not list the publication venues of the cited papers. This does not make the support materials strong from cited papers without the venues.\n\nThe most critical point is that the paper violate double-blind policy with the funding source, as explicitly mentioned in the acknowledgement."
