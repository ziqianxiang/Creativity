            "review": "This paper looks at the problem of making the reparameterization trick in Variational Inference applicable to a wider range of distributions. Reparameterized estimators have lower variance than score function estimators but their application is restricted to fewer distribution classes. Using a set of mathematical devices, they derive gradient estimator for the ELBO as a transport equation. \n\nOn similar lines as Ruiz et al (The Generalized Reparameterization Gradient or G-REP), the paper starts off by assuming that the standardized variable (\\rho in the paper, \\epsilon in Kingma and Welling, Ruiz et al.)  is a weak function of the variational parameters. They then go on to develop transport equations which reduce to the reparameterization and score function methods as special cases. This is also what we see in the related papers - G-REP goes about the estimation process for q(z,\\theta) more directly, and obtains two terms, one that looks like the reparameterization gradient and the other a score function like term. \n\nA particular form of the velocity field is then used for their polynomial based estimator.\n\nApplicability is shown for the gamma distribution (and therefore associated distributions such as the dirichlet, beta). The results show a lower variance than the other known approaches (G-REP, and Rejection Sampling VI), and the ELBO reaches a high value at a much smaller number of runs. Having said that, I am not so sure if the results are really that much better than the counterparts - especially RSVI. \n\nMy thoughts: I very much enjoyed going over the derivations and associated papers. The other related paper with a transport equation involves pathwise derivatives (as the authors note - Jankowiak and Obermeyer - https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01851) and appeals to Optimal Transport for the procedure. \n\nI am curious as to whether we can give a physical interpretation to the 'velocity' in the transport problem which looks very much like the transport equations we encounter in physics and fluid mechanics. I do note as a minor point that some of the other related papers (Ruiz et al, Naesseth et al.) read much more clearly. \n\n"

            "review": "The paper revisits the generalized reparameterization gradient [Ruiz et al. 2016] and derives it from a perspective of the transport equation [Jankowiak & Obermeyer, 2018]. While this is an interesting perspective, I think the paper is hard to read, vastly overstates its contribution, misses highly related works and provides no empirical improvement based on the presented experiments. Due to this, I believe the paper should be rejected.\n\nThe abstract of the paper does a good job of summarizing its claims. Since I believe these claims to be significantly overstated or incorrect, I will go through the abstract and comment on it.\n\n> However, the reparameterization trick is based on the standardization transformation which restricts the scope of application of this method to distributions that have tractable inverse cumulative distribution functions or are expressible as deterministic transformations of such distributions.\n\nThis is not correct, since [Jankowiak & Obermeyer, 2018] and [Figurnov et al., 2018] show how to apply the reparameterization trick to distributions with intractable inverse CDFs.\nThe reparameterization equation eqn. (5) in this paper is the same as eqn. (6) from [Figurnov et al., 2018], up to an error: the (\\nabla_z \\phi(z, \\phi)) should be matrix-inverted. The same error appears further down the page, between the two remarks.\n\n> In this paper, we generalized the reparameterization trick by allowing a general transformation. [...] We discover that the proposed model is a special case of control variate indicating that the proposed model can combine the advantages of CV and generalized reparameterization.\n\nThis generalization has already been done in [Ruiz et al., 2016], including the interpretation of the estimator as REINFORCE + control variate. The control variates based on null solutions to the transport equation have been explored in [2], which is not cited.\n\n> Unlike other similar works, we develop the generalized transformation-based gradient model formally and rigorously.\n\nI find this statement deeply problematic on two counts. First of all, the language used here is dismissive of other people’s work. While we should always strive to improve the work of our colleagues, these contributions should be phrased positively and politely. Secondly, I haven’t found the derivation in this paper to be particularly formal or rigorous. For example, Theorem 3.1 does not state any requirements for f(z), even though I am quite certain that this theorem does not apply for non-continuous f(z). Finally, I find the statement (2) of the Theorem 3.1, when taking into account the Eqn. (6), trivial: it simply says that E [g(z) + h(z)] = E [g(z)], if E [h(z)] = 0.\n\n> Based on the proposed gradient model, we propose a new polynomial-based gradient estimator which has better theoretical performance than the reparameterization trick under certain condition and can be applied to a larger class of variational distributions.\n\nThe proposed improvement is a polynomial control variate for the reparameterization gradient. Highly related variance reduction techniques have already been explored in [1] and [2]. The important disadvantage of the current work, compared to these previous works, is that this control variate is not adaptive: the CV coefficient is set to a constant, rather than updated, say, based on the gradient information. This means that this control variate may actually increase the variance if the coefficient is not guessed correctly.\n\n> In studies of synthetic and real data, we show that our proposed gradient estimator has a significantly lower gradient variance than other state-of-the-art methods thus enabling a faster inference procedure.\n\nI don’t think the actual experimental results support this claim. Figure 1 shows a small improvement on a synthetic problem. Figure 2 shows that the proposed method does not outperform the alternatives in terms of convergence speed: RSVI up until 10^3 seconds and IRG afterwards.\n\nMinor typos:\n* a same variance -> the same variance\n* I’ve found the notation \\int^{z_i} a bit confusing, it’s probably best to specify the lower limit as well\n* euqation -> equation\n\n[1] Andrew C.

            "review": "I am having a hard time validating the claims of contributions of this paper over the contributions of Ruiz et al.,(2016). Ruiz et al already propose the generalized method which allows the reparametrizated density to be dependent on the latent variable. They already derive the score function method and the standard reparameterization as special cases of their generalizaed reparameterization. So both the remarks on Page 3 area already known from previous works.  The way this paper is structured and contributions are listed, it seems the authors completely overlook several contributions of Ruiz et al, while touting some of them as their own. e.g. Above Section 3 (last para of Section 2), the authors talk about the cases of Gamma, Beta  etc which are hard to handle using the standard parameterization, but the authors fail to mention that the work of Ruiz et al is able to handle these perfectly well. \n\nThe notations in the beginning of Section 3 is confusing to me. \\rho is a transformation function, yet the authors say \"let w() be the the density function of \\rho\", because somehow \\rho is suddenly a random variable ? How did that come about ? \n\nSimilarly, some of the background material is misleading -- e.g. the authors say that the entropy term is \"ignored\" and they \"focus on the simplified ELBO\", while that is not the case in VI. The gradient of entropy is more amenable, it is not ignored. The background is very poorly written and misleading.\n\nThe possible connection to transport theory might be interesting, but the authors merely allude to it, listing the velocity field and picking the condition for unbiasedness out of thin air without any explanation or background. Simiarly the connection to control variate is only alluded to in less than 10 sentences, and in my humble opinion does not provide enough clarity for this to be a contribution. \n\nI suggest the authors clearly discuss the contributions over and above those of Ruiz et al (the obviation of calculation of full fledged jacobians) and discuss their work more vis-a-viz Ruiz et al, fix the background so that it is more faithful to what is known in the literature (how is the velocity field introduction different ?), provide the details of the method /before/ directly writing down the theorem for it (Thm 3.1), and clarify the connections to control variate in more detail rather than just merely alluding to it (may be also provide more detail in the background about it). The authors have listed the connection to control variates as a contribution but in the draft body it is merely a mention. Here is the direct quote \"We can see that the GTRANS\nmodel is a special case of the control variate method with a complex differential structure\". In its current form the paper is not ready for publication IMHO. "
