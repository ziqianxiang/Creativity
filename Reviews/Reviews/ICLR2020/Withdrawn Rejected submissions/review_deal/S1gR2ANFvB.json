It describes a direct application of na√Øve learning tool (random forest and neural network) without sufficient insight.\n\nClarity: In general, the descriptions on data collection and training are clear.\n\nOriginality: The novelty of this work is very limited, if any.\n\nContributions:\nThe contribution are limited. If the main contributions lie it the construction of the device, I suggest a resubmission to a device-related conference.\n\nFrom the machine learning perspective, this work is a simple and direct application of existing machine learning tools.. \n\n\nOther comments:\nThis paper mentions the authors are from a group (Cogniscent) at IBM, which violates the double-blind policy (at least to certain degree).\n"
