The central idea is to use a recurrent network to transform the observations into a representation that can be used with solvers specifically tailored towards that class of problems.\n\n**Decision:** I recommend to accept the paper for publication.\n\n**Arguments for decision:** The paper clearly adresses an important problem and poroposes a method capable of solving it. The method appears to be theoretically founded and the experimental validation seems solid. The relevance of the method is there as the problem class is prevalent in practical applications. The venue is a good fit as well, as the focus is the representation of a control problem in a way that allows more efficient solutions.\n\n**Feedback for improvement:**\n\n- The type setting could be improved at times. E.g. below equation (1).\n- I feel that the term \"exploration\" is overloaded. While it serves as an explicit mean to reduced the sample complexity of methods in RL, it appears to be about avoiding premature convergence in this work. I am too unfamiliar with the relevant SOC literature to judge how well the term fits, but coming from a ML background I stumbled over this expression.\n- Some of the experimental details, e.g. the exact choice of time discretisation, don't appear motivated well. \n- The paper needs to respect [1, 2] in the related work and show relations. From the perspective of learning state representations for optimal control, both works are relevant.\n- Is it necessary to start the discussion from the continuous case? While I appreciate the elegance of starting out with a continuous problem and then discretising at the last step, it felt like a barrier to understanding in my case, as my understanding of continuous optimal control is limited–and I feel the audience of ICLR might have the same problem.\n\n**References:**\n\n[1] Watter, Manuel, et al. \"Embed to control: A locally linear latent dynamics model for control from raw images.\" *Advances in neural information processing systems*. 2015.\n[2] Banijamali, Ershad, et al. \"Robust locally-linear controllable embedding.\" *arXiv preprint arXiv:1710.05373*(2017)."

            "review": "\n######### Rebuttal Response:\nThanks for the clarifications and especially for updating the formatting. The current state does not convince me to rate the paper as weak accept but I increased my rating to weak reject. \n\n\"Pereira et. al. has shown that a recurrent network architecture using LSTM outperforms the fully connected networks at every time step proposed by Han et. al. in task completion, space and time complexity. Therefore, in this paper we choose to use an LSTM-based network architecture.\"\n\n-> Yes it might be true that a recurrent function approximator does in practice perform better than a feed-forward function approximator. However, in theory a feed-forward network should be sufficient as the value function does not depend on the previous states. Therefore, the question is, why does the LSTM perform better? Does the recurrent nature of the LSTM make the predictions smoother compared to a feed-forward network?  Can any other regularizing scheme be introduced s.t. the feed-forward networks performs equally well?\n\n######### Review:\n\nSummary: \nThe paper builds on the work of Pereira et. al. and uses forward backward stochastic differential equations to learn the Hessian of the Value function Vxx and \\partial _t V_x + 1/2 tr(\\partial_{xx} V_x CC^T). In contrast to the prior work, this paper introduces multiplicative noise for the control and uses second order optimization. The performance is evaluated on different control tasks, e.g., linear system, cartpole, quadcopter & human arm actuated by tendons. \n\nConclusion: \nAll in all, I like the proposed research of combining theoretical approaches and deep learning to perform trajectory optimization and I would like to see much more of this research like this within the ICLR community. Furthermore, I think that the paper has a contribution and that the paper was improved compared to the initial Neurips submission (i.e., adding ILQG as baseline). However, the writeup and formatting is still very much sub-standard and must be improved to make this paper worth publishing. The current write-up is not accessible for the ICLR community and the understandability must be significantly improved (Details are provided below). Therefore, I currently rate this paper as a clear rejection but I am happy to improve the score to 7-8 if the write up is improved during the rebuttal. \n\n\nTheoretical Structure: \nI like the introduction, which covers the topic but might be a bit too long. Maybe you want to shorten the introduction and add an additional related work section at the end. The stochastic control introduction is nice and has the correct level of abstraction for the reader. However, the paper introduces many complex concepts which are not essential for understanding the paper (e.g., filtered probability space etc.). One might want to trade off understandability vs. mathematical rigor especially, if the paper does not rely on these concepts. Furthermore, you might want to make eq 1 more explicit as the multiplicative action noise is not visible from eq 1. Section 3 'A FBSDE Solution to the HJB PDE' is the most problematic section of this paper, which is not understandable for the common ICLR reader. Eq. 6, which just appears without any derivation, is not understandable and the reader has no intuition how to derive this eq. Furthermore, Eq 6 (page. 4) uses notations which is only clearly introduced later within the paper or even the appendix (e.g., Y being the propagated value function, Z being the propagated gradient of the value function is only mentioned in the appendix, i.e., page 12. \\Gamma is only introduced in page 5. Yes, Eq. 7 defines these variables but the style of definition is not standard and one does not expect the variables to be defined in this style.). Could the authors please provide an intuitive derivation of these equation and use clearer notation (Why would one want to abstract V, V_x, V_x, \\mathcal|{H}(V_x) in the first place as these are intuitive for the ICLR community and sufficiently short?) Especially, as this section highlights the difference to the prior works of Pereira et. al., this section should be very clear. Section 4 is clear but should include the loss function as the loss is not trivial and essential for the optimization. Currently, the loss description is buried in the appendix. All in all, the theoretical explanation and the bloated notation should be simplified and every equation should be embedded into an intuitive derivation. Currently these explanations are not understandable without reading the appendix and prior work.  \n\n\nExperiments:\nThe experiments apply 2FBSDE to 4 different control tasks (Linear system, quadcopter, cartpole & human arm) and compare the performance to the prior work of FBSDE and iLQG. The number of baselines and systems is sufficient. However, the paper should provide more evaluations:\n\n(1) Plot the histogram of the obtained cost distributions. \n(2) Plot a single state- and action trajectory (and the action distribution). Using these plots, the level of noise and smoothness and hence the applicability to physical systems can be evaluated. \n(3) Plot the noise free trajectories and show that these mean trajectories reach the desired solution.\n(4) Specify the exact cost function for every experiment\n\nFurther Comments to the individual experiments: \n\nCartpole:\nThe Cartpole iLQG seems to perform much better (swing-up the pendulum faster, don't deviate so much from x=0, much more coherent velocity compared to 2FBSDE, FBSDE). Could the authors please discuss these aspects in more detail and present experiments with longer time-horizons to check whether the proposed method can stabilize the cart at [0, 0, 0, 0]. The current plots don't reach this target state. Your plots also hint that the cartpole does not need to pre-swing the pendulum, which is most likely due to the very low action cost. This selection of action cost significantly simplifies the problem. Could the authors please include a cartpole with higher action cost and show that 2FBSDE can learn to pre-swing the pendulum. \n\nThe quadcopter:\nCould the authors please specify the exact quadcopter dynamics. What kind of abstraction did you model? What are the control inputs? Furthermore, the citation for the dynamics is wrong and puts the supervisor of the master thesis as first author. Furthermore, can the authors please provide longer plots to highlight, which method can stabilize the system.\n\nHuman Arm:\nFor the human arm neither iLQG or 2FBSDE reach the desired target location. Can you explain why no trajectory optimization does reach the desired position. \n\nFormatting:\nPlease rework the formatting such that the inline math does not cause the formatting issues of different line spacings (e.g., sec. 2.1, sec. 5) and irregular whitespaces (e.g., last line of paragraph 2.1 Preliminaries). Please remove the color coding of text for the experiments and make sure that the legends are sufficiently large and include all lines. Currently the legends are missing the target state. You can also extend the figure captions to highlight the conclusion of the plots. Please rework the figures such that the figures do not cause so much whitespace (e.g., Figure 3, 4 & 5). When reconfiguring the plots, you gain space, which can be used for further explanation of the theory. Furthermore, you might want add dotted lines to the confidence intervals as the confidence intervals are important but the differences are not clearly visible from the plots. Also, the labelling in figure 3 seems wrong, the axis labeled cart velocity should be pendulum angle and the pendulum angle axis should be cart velocity. All in all, the formatting can be significantly improved, which is especially bad as this paper is most likely a resubmission from Neurips.  \n\n\nMinor Comments / Questions:\n- 'where l :Rnx×Rnu→R+ is the running cost and C1,23 \\phi :Rnx→R+ is the terminal state cost.' Is l and \\phi of class C^{1,2} or only one of them? The notation is confusing and should be simplified.\n- Can you comment on how important this multiplicative noise in physical system? ¬¬¬\n- Why are you using a LSTM instead of a simple feed-forward neural network as the ff-nn should be sufficient to model V(x) as the value function is not recurrent. Have you tried using a simple ff-nn?",

            "review": "Summary and Decision\n\nThe authors in the paper studied the problem of stochastic optimal control using deep learning. The main contributions of this work can be summarized by introducing an additional backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE) over Pereira et al. (2019), where instead of predicting the gradient of the value function (V_x), the authors predicted the values required to compute the Hamiltonian H(V_x) instead. The authors then compared the results against both closed form solutions of optimal control and a numerical approximate controller by Li and Todorov (2007). However, it is unclear whether this particular modification leads to any incremental benefits over Pereira et al. (2019), nor is it compared against the feedforward networks of Han et al. (2017). Furthermore, one of the main benefits of this modifications the authors claimed is scalability to higher dimensions, yet we do not have any experiments in more than 6 dimensions in the quadcopter case. \n\nWhile I believe the authors have a promising idea, the current paper do not provide enough justification to demonstrate an improvement. Therefore I recommend a weak reject. \n\n\nBackground\n\nIn the classical optimal control set up, it is often very difficult to recover a solution in closed form. Yet at the same time, current numerical methods are far from satisfactory. There are two main approaches to numerically solving optimal control: \n1. Numerically solve the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation for the value function, which is difficult both due to non-linearity and curse of dimensionality. \n2. Use the forward-backward stochastic differential equation (FBSDE) representation of the solution for the HJB equation, but simulation of the backward equation is difficult due to requirement of meeting a terminal condition. \n\nHan et al. (2017) worked around the simulation difficulty by instead training a feedforward network to minimize the error of terminal condition. In the same paper, Han et al. showed this method can solve an HJB equation in 100 dimensions. Pereira et al. (2019) extended this idea to recurrent networks. Bakshi et al. (2017b) introduced the second BSDE to encourage more controlled exploration, which is used in the current paper under review. \n\nThe ultimate goal of this line of work is to solve highly complex non-linear stochastic control problems, where we have no hope of recovering an optimal in closed form. Therefore, any method with efficient approximate computation is highly desirable. In particular, methods involving an approximation with deep networks are quite promising and deserve further exploration. \n\n\nDetailed Comments \n\nThe authors in this paper essentially combined the idea of Bakshi et al. (2017b) and Pereira et al. (2019) in an attempt to improve both existing papers. Having a guided second order controlled BSDE will encourage further exploration, and intuitively this change should make training easier. Furthermore, by introducing the prediction of the quantity \\Omega_t, the authors avoid computing a rank 3 tensor. Hence, I believe this is a promising idea and deserves to be implemented and carefully studied. \n\nThe main concern of this work is that it's not clear whether this method is working. Essentially, I would like to see that despite introducing more complexity to the network compared to Pereira et al. (2019) and Han et al. (2017), the resulting network can still be trained to achieve improved results. It is very unsatisfying to only compare against a closed form solution and a simple approximate control. These experiments can serve to show that the trained network is not behaving erratically, but we cannot conclude any improvements. In fact, even when compared against the approximate control ILQG by Li and Todorov (2007), it's unclear if the current method is better when given the same computation budget. \n\nThe other main concern is scalability to higher dimensions. While computationally cheap, it is unclear whether or not predicting the quantity \\Omega_t does in fact work in high dimensions. This concern is mainly driven by the fact Han et al. (2017) has been able to solve control problems in 100 dimensions, where computing the rank 3 tensor is becoming costly. In this case, comparison against the closed form solution is sufficient to determine whether or not predicting \\Omega_t works in high dimensions. \n\n\nMinor Additional Comments\n\nThere are more minor points I would like to make, but these do not contribute to the review decision. \n1. On page 3, below equation (1), I believe C is a map [0,T] X R^{n_x} X R^{n_u} -> R^{ n_x * (n_w + 1) } \n2. On Page 3, below equation (2), it's strange seeing this notation C^{1,2} for a function of x only; in stochastic control and PDE literature, C^{1,2} typically denotes a function u(t,x) once differentiable in t and twice differentiable in x. \n3. On page 3, below equation (3), we do also require the matrix R to be symmetric? \n4. On page 3, for equation (4), it should be mentioned at some point in this paper that we can only recover an HJB equation without a sup term due to the loss \\ell(x,u) being quadratic in the control u. In general, the HJB equation and the FBSDEs can be much more difficult to work with. \n5. On page 4, it would be more satisfying to cite a more complete collection of works in stochastic control and FBSDEs. In particular, Bismut (1976) and Pardoux and Peng (1990) are seminal works that led up to El Karoui et al. (1997). It would be also nice to briefly mention a huge literature on the PDE methods to control. \n6. On page 5, the notation for \\psi and \\zeta were not introduced. I interpreted from context that these were parameters for predicting \\Gamma and \\Omega, but it would nice to have a definition. "
