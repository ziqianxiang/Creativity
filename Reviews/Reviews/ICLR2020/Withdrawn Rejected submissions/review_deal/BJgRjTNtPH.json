The authors are clear in terms of the methodology and they show that the method has excellent performance. The idea is clever, use the SOM to generate an image (the pairwise distance embeddings), then feed this embedding of distances or the distance map as an image into a CNN. The problem I have with this paper is the authors are proposing an embedding or feature space for deep neural networks. It is really confusing to me why there is no discussion of variational autoencoders or embedding algorithms like t-SNE as a comparison point. The lack of touch on the vast literature of learning features and embeddings from words, letters, music, or other non-obviously numeric signals was problematic."

            "review": "This paper proposes a deep learning-based method to predict disease states by integrating multi-omic data. This paper combines the strengths of self-organizing maps (SOMs) for representation learning and CNNs for image classification. Specifically, it uses SOMs to transform multi-omic data into a gene similarity network (GSN) for representation learning and uses CNNs for classification of disease states. And this scheme also provides an enhanced scheme to interpret and visualize multi-dimensional and multi-omics data.\nHowever, there are some concerns about this work: \n1.\tThe motivation of using self-organizing map learning algorithm to create the gene similarity network (GSN) is not clear enough. \n2.\tThe related works about dimensionality reduction and representation learning methods in gene expression data are missing.\n3.\tThe experiment results are not very convincing, because there is no comparison with other approaches. In particular, the work of (Hopp et al., 2018) which is mentioned in section 3.3 is a close method.\n4.\tThis paper is not well written, and there are some minor issues as follows:\n4.1.\tThe abstract claims that “yielding prediction accuracies in the 94-98% range for tumor stages of breast cancer and calculated Gleason scores of prostate cancer with just 11 input genes for both cases”. However, the section 2.1 mentions that “The top 14 mutated genes from Multisig were considered for the rest of the experiment”, which one is right?\n4.2.\tIn section 2.3, the description of the method is not very clear, for example, the seventh rows on page 4: “where $s^(1)_{1j}= g_j} represents the gene vector for $i^{th}$ sample and $c_{j1}$ represents neuron vector” .\n4.3.\tThe equation (6) may be wrong, since $R^{i}_j$, $G^{i}_j $, $B^{i}_j $ are all equal to $S^{i}_{1j}$.\n"

            "review": "In this paper, the authors proposed an approach which combines self-organizing maps and CNN to perform data integration, representation learning and dimensionality reduction in a problem with a lot of high dimensional cancer genomic data. Their method produces gene similarity networks. They have some experiments and validation procedure to show their method works. However, I feel this paper is too preliminary with little technical contribution. There are grammar errors and they used several uninformative figures and tables (e.g. Table 2) to fill in the space. \n"
