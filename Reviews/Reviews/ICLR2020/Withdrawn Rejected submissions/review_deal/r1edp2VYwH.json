The system consists of a cascade of small subsystems, and each of them was developed to normalize a specific characteristics on Amharic words using a hand-crafted algorithms.\n\nThis paper may not be fully relevant to this conference because most of the main methodology does not rely on any representation learning criteria, but is almost rule-based. I recommend authors to consider submitting this paper to some appropriate conferences rather than here (e.g., ACL, NAACL, or EMNLP are the best for you), since the paper should get more meaningful attention and reviews form researchers in natural language processing.\n\nPresentation errors:\n- The paper changes the font of English characters from section 3.2.\n- Figure 1 looks to have insufficient resolution."

            "review": "This paper proposes a technique for Amharic light stemming. As the authors point out, Amharic is a language with considerable complexity and richness in its mophological/orthographic processes, and effective stemming therefore is potentially useful for downstream applications. The approach presented is a cascade of transformations that standardize the form, remove suffixes, prefixes, and infixes. An analysis is offered in terms of accuracy in recovering the stems, as well as when using the stems to drive a stem-based sentiment analyzer, with comparison to another existing stemmer.\n\nAlthough this is a reasonable approach to the stemming problem in Amharic, some suggestions would be:\n1) Compare to approaches to root finding that exist in Arabic and Hebrew, which have certain similarities in morphology, and which have been widely published on.\n2) Dictionary-based sentiment analysis can be useful application, but demonstration of improvements on several applications would be far more compelling (e.g., there are Amharic-English parallel corpora available, so using this as a preprocessing step for a machine translation system would be useful).\n\nOverall though, this paper does not focus on representation learning, and as such probably would be better suited to a different venue."

            "review": "This paper studies the problem of stemming for morphologically rich languages, specifically for Amharic. The main contribution is a light stemmer that only removes affixes to the extent that the original semantic information in the word is kept after stemming. The approach relies on curated prefixes, suffixes and some rules. Both intrinsic evaluation and extrinsic evaluation (sentiment classification) are done to show the effectiveness of the stemmer. Overall, the approach is reasonable and the results are good. However, I'm not sure that ICLR is the best venue for publishing this work, since it mainly focuses on linguistics and text processing; ACL might be a better fit for this work.\n\nExperiments:\n- I did not find a description of the baseline HornMorpho. How is it different from the proposed approach? Does it use the same text preprocessing as the proposed stemmer?\n- It looks like sentiment classification is done by looking up a lexicon. What if a classifier is used? How does stemming affect it?\n\nStyle:\n- The paper does not strictly follow the ICLR style. The fonts aren't consistent. \n- Figure 1 has very low resolution.\n- I'd suggest the related work section be broken into several paragraphs.\n"
