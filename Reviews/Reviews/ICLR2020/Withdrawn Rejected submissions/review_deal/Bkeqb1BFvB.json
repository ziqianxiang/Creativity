A perturbation-based framework was built to provide a theoretical analysis of the representation capacity of GLS. The experiments show marginal and sometimes decrease in performance when using GLS compare to other methods. \n\nStrength\n\nThe idea of using GLS is certainly good and well-motivated. Itâ€™s clear that robust structural information can be extracted from GLS while preserving the isomorphism-invariant. The technical content of the paper appears to be correct and well-presented. The paper is generally well-written and structured clearly.\n\nWeakness\n\nThe experimental results are not convincing enough. Some intuitions as well as analysis of why the model underperforms the previous works are desirable. Furthermore, since the paper somewhat addresses the trade-off between expressiveness, consistency, and efficiency, results on the efficiency of the model (e.g. runtime, resources, etc.) should be included."

            "review": "This work proposed to use Graph Laplacian spectrum to learn graph representation. Its isomorphism invariance, expressiveness and deformation consistency is analyzed. Based on graph perturbation, the representation capacity of GLS is analyzed; bounds are derived for the distance between the GLS of two graphs; lastly experiments are conducted on multiple datasets to validate the proposed graph representation. \n\nAfter reading the paper, my biggest concern lies in the fact that the proposed graph representation does not outperform the existing approaches, especially on the social network datasets. \n\nFor easier reading,  it is better to mark the best performers in the results tables in bold or color.\n\nMinor:\nThe paper needs proofreading, below please find some of the typos:\n2nd sentence in the 2nd paragraph, corresponding difference -> corresponding to\n4th sentence in Sec 4.2, pad -> padded\n1st sentence in the 3rd paragraph in Sec. 5.1 w -> we?\n3rd sentence in the 3rd paragraph in Sec. 5.1 avoid -> avoids"

            "review": "This paper focuses on the laplacian spectrum of a graph as means to generate a representation. This representation can be used to compare graphs, and classify them. The authors prove that structural similarity is reflected by the similarity in their GLS.  I propose rejection of this paper for the following reasons: \n- The idea of using the spectrum for defining graph similarity is definitely not novel. See the tutorial \"Node    Similarity,    Graph    Similarity    and    Matching:        Theory    and    Applications\".\n- The claim that structural similarity (especially cut similarity) is reflected on the Laplacian spectrum is known. \n- This paper misses important literature, and actually many papers on graph similarity. E.g., \"Least-squares estimation of transformation parameters between two point patterns\" by Umeyama. Since then a lot of work has followed up on the topic. A beautiful work related to this was published recently by Kolla et al \"Spectrally Robust Graph Isomorphism\" \n- The paper is not well-written. Besides the existence of typos (E.g., Rnyi is R\\'{e}nyi), some parts can become shorter since they are standard.\n- Isomorphism on random binomial graphs is known to be an easy (i.e., in P) problem. I understand that it stands as a sanity check, but a more interesting sanity check would be great. Overall the experiments are not convincing. \n"
