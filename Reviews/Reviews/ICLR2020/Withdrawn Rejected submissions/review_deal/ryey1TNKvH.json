            "review": "This work proposes to utilize a dual path to current GNNs like GCN or GAT, in order to improve the performance. The dual path takes a dual graph as inputs, where the dual graph does not contain the original edges but has edges connecting nodes with similar topology. They determine the edges in the dual graph by using several algorithms proposed by previous studies.\n\nCons:\n1. The idea is very incremental. First, using a dual path to augment GNNs is not novel. A similar idea can be found in \"Supervised Community Detection with Line Graph Neural Networks\" (ICLR 2019). Second, the methods to determine \"non-local\" edges in the dual graph all come from old graph algorithms (all before 2010 except for one in 2014). Third, the edges in the dual graph are determined in a pre-processing step and not learned during training.\n2. The writing is poor and does not provide a fruitful \"method\" section. Two pages of \"introduction\" are not desired for a 8-page paper. The paper is more like an experimental report or technical blog.\n3. The experimental results are not convincing. Several strong baselines from ICML 2019 and KDD 2019 are not included. In addition, as the results are \"average accuracy over 100 trials\", why the std. is missing in Table 1?"

            "review": "** Summary\n\nThis paper propose to adding the topology of each node as auxiliary information to improve the node classification accuracy in the graph. Specifically, the authors show that using adjacency matrix as the topology representation is better than directly using the topology, like the degree or centrality. The results suggest that using the extra information in the form of adjacency matrix brings marginal improvement on some of the tested datasets.\n\n** Weaknesses\n\n1. This paper is poorly written and hard to follow. There are multiple un-defined terms which are important to understanding the proposed idea. For example, in the first line of Section 5.1, there are 2 terms “neighbor class” and “node self-topology”. There is no context about what they are. Is “neighbor class” the class labels of the neighbors of a given node or is it the class labels of a pair of nodes who are neighbors in the graph? What is “node self-topology”? This term only occurred once in the paper. In the first bullet of page 4, the authors mentioned that the nodes with similar topology are connected in the dual graph. How is the similarity on topology measured? What are the most important topology feature? They are core to the proposed idea and therefore should be in the main content.\n\n2. The empirical results are not persuasive. Although the authors claim that the proposed method outperforms all the state of the art methods, it is hard to tell the difference on the accuracy according to Table. 1. For example, the gap between the authors’ re-implementation and the existing method (70.9 compared with 72.5) is larger than the gap between the re-implemented model with or without the proposed extra information (72.2 compared with 70.9).\n\n3. The comparisons are not fair. For example, compared with GAT, the T-GAT has an extra dual graph which means extra parameters and computations during training and testing. This is not reflected in the comparison."

            "review": "This paper contributes an enhancement to GCN by constructing a second graph (affinity graph of topological features) for graph convolution. Among the authors' several attempts of leveraging  topological features, this is the only successful one. Other (unsuccessful) attempts include, for example, concatenating the topological features with the BOW features in citation networks.\n\nThe reader appreciates the authors report both successful and unsuccessful results.\n\nThe work is well presented, with an extensive historical account of the roles of the graph structure in node classification. In fact, topological features were popularly used prior to the emergence of graph neural networks. The rapid progress of deep learning forges a mindset of abandoning feature engineering. It is not bad to see that graph features return in some form.\n\nThat said, if the contribution of this work is interpreted as feature engineering, the contribution does not sound significant enough. The reader interprets from this work that what topological features are important to the end task is case dependent. The authors obtain this insight through empirical evaluation, wherein labeling information is used. This methodology, however, does not seem to be extendable to real scenarios, where most of the labeling information is unrevealed.\n\nThe empirical evaluation does not seem strong enough, either. Table 1 indicates that using topological features improves prediction on only half of the data sets.\n\nMinor comment: The terminology \"dual graph\" has a different meaning in standard graph theory (see, e.g., https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_graph). The authors are advised to use a different wording.\n"
