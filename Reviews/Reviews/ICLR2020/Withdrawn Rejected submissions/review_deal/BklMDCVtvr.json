        "comment": "This work builds directly on McCoy et al. (2019a) and add a RNN that can replace what was human generated hypotheses to the role schemes. The final goal of ROLE is to analyze a network by identifying ‘symbolic structure’. The authors conduct sanity check by conducting experiments with ground truth, and extend the work further to apply it to a complex model. I wonder under what definition of ‘interpretable’ authors have in mind with the final output (figure 2) - the output is very complex. It remains questionable if this will give some ‘insight’ or how would humans parse this info such that it is ‘useful’ for them in some way. \n\nOverall, though this is a good paper, due to the number of strong papers this year, it cannot be accepted at this time. We hope the comments given by reviewers can help improve a future version. \n",

It also provides an interpretable symbolic structure and examines the causal information in the symbolic structure.\n\nThe approach is inspired by the Tensor Product Encoder architecture.\n\nThe scan role analysis part seemed the most hand-wavy with lots of positions in A.7.\n\nNone of the accuracy results have variances attached to them.\n\nI am not an expert on this topic (hence the weak accept), but I liked the paper.\n\n"

            "review": "\nThis work focuses on the understanding of Deep NNs and of their generalization ability for compositional tasks and especially for partially composition tasks such as one encounters in natural language processing.\n\nThe core idea is to design and to learn a neural model (the ROLE network) able to analyse a target neural network (e.g. an encoder in an seq2seq architecture) by identifying the symbolic structures the target network manipulates (the symbols and their roles) in its representations and the compositional rules it has learned on these. The main motivations are the understanding of what is learnt by a such neural network and getting ideas on which architecture to choose for improving generalization on compositional tasks.\n \nThe experimental study shows that ROLE ’s results are relevant when dealing with a fully compositional model by design. This is a kind of sanity check, that ROLE may uncover the ground truth from the data, while no prior information is provided on the nature of the roles. \nThe experiments on the SCAN dataset concern a standard RNN model learned from data. I am not sure of the nature of RNN used here. How many layers, which activation function ? The experimental section also provides insights on what is learned by the ROLE model and on how its (compositional) representations match the ones learned by the RNN.     \n\nAs far as in understand, beyond the understanding of the learned representations in RNNs, the paper motivates the work with the expectation that the gained knowledge might be useful for designing better neural nets, with improved generalization ability. Yet i don’t  see clearly what could be done on this line.  "

            "review": "In this paper, the authors study the problem of understanding the compositional generalization abilities of NNs. A new type of NN, called ROLE, is proposed to learns to approximate the representations of a target NN E by learning a symbolic constituent structure and an embedding of that structure intoE’s representational vector space. A number of tasks are conducted, including a simple fully-compositional task, a SCAN task, a partially-compositional NLP task. Multiple tasks. The experiment results show that the proposed approach can help to understand how NNs achieve strong generalization on partially-compositional tasks, and good performance on fully-compositional task. \nPros:\n1. This work studies an important problem of fundamental AI.\n2. Authors conduct experiments on multiple task to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed technique and show how it helps to understand the generalization of NNs.\n3. The overall paper is well written, except for some typos, e.g. in page 5, Table 1 Should \"1.0\" be \"100%\"? Should \"0.828 be ''82.80\".  \nCons:\n1. Regarding the Q2 raised in the paper, only simple suggestions are given. It is suggested to evaluate its effectiveness on some real experiments."
