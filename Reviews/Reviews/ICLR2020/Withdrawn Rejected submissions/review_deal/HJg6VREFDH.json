            "review": "This paper proposes a novel variation to the WGAN, which combines WGANs with autoencoders. The paper contains several interesting ideas and theoretical results. The proposed method is also demonstrated to perform reasonable in benchmark examples. One particularly nice property is that the authors derive a duality gap that can be used as a stopping criterion. \n\nMy main concern with the paper is that I don’t think it is sufficiently well written. In particular, the motivations for IWGAN presented in section 2 are both technically involved and vague. For instance, the optimisation problem is introduced with the sentence “The primal and dual formulations motivate us to define the iWGAN objective to be”, which does not motivate what we might benefit from using the objective. I generally feel that the presented arguments in favour of IWGAN are not sufficiently clear and convincing. Unfortunately, I also have similar concerns with later sections. In fact, even though the authors argue that the simulation results are also better than state of the art algorithms, my impression is that recent GAN modules often generate images which are even more realistic than this. \n\nIn spite of my concerns, I find the presented theory interesting and with better motivations and examples, it may eventually become a solid and well-cited contribution.

            "review": "In this paper, an inference WGAN model (iWGAN) is proposed that fuses autoencoders and WGANs. By working on both the prime and dual problems, the proposed iWGAN takes an objective that is in general the upper bound of WGAN. The generalization error bound of iWGAN is analysed and its probabilistic interpretation under maximum likelihood estimation is provided.  The proposed iWGAN model is validated on both synthetic and real (MNIST and CelebA) datasets. \n\nPros:\nThis paper not only proposed the iWGAN model, but also provided some theoretical analysis about the iWGAN, such as the generalization error bound and the probabilistic interpretation. \nThrough the experiment, it seems that the proposed iWGAN works.  Especially, on the synthetic dataset, iWGAN seems to  have less mode collapse than WGAN.\n\nCons:\nThe major concerns of this paper lie in its experiment.  \n(1)\tThere is no quantitative comparison between iWGAN and WGAN, especially on the two real image datasets.  There are only some visual examples of the results in either the main body of the text or the appendix. \n(2)\tThe proposed iWAN is only compared with WGAN.  There is no experimental comparison with other autoencoder GANs  in the literature,  although the paper stated that iWGAN has many advantages over other autoencoder GANs (in the abstract).\n\nIn addition to experiment, other concerns include:\n(1)\tThe proposed method needs to be better motivated, although it is interpreted under the framework of maximum likelihood estimation. For example, what is the advantage to optimize the proposed upper bound of WGAN over its original objective? In the experiment, it seems iWGAN has less mode collapse than WGAN based on the synthetic data. But there is no explanation or discussion about why iWGAN could enjoy this favourable property.\n(2)\tThe proposed framework is tightly based on WGAN. It is not clear whether it could be extended to other GANs, which limits the significance of the proposed work.\n\nDue to the above concerns, rating is recommended as \"3 Weak Reject.\"\n\nSuggestions:  The authors are encouraged to provide extensive comparison with other autoencoder GANs and WGAN, especially in quantitative way.  \n"

In this algorithm, the authors show a rigorous probabilistic interpretation under the maximum likelihood principle. This algorithm has a stable and efficient training process. The authors provided a lots of theoretical and experimental analysis to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Therefore, the innovation of this paper is very novel. The theoretical analysis is sufficient, and the technology is sound. "
