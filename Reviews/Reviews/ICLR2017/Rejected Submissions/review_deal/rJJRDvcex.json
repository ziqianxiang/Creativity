        "comment": "This paper proposes a hybrid architecture that combines traditional CNN layers with separable RNN layers that quickly increase the receptive field of intermediate features. The paper demonstrates experiments on CIfar-10 and semantic segmentation, both by fine-tuning pretrained CNN models and by training them from scratch, showing numerical improvements. \n \n The reviewers agreed that this paper presents a sound modification of standard CNN architectures in a clear, well-presented manner. They also highlighted the clear improvement of the manuscipt between the first draft and subsequent revisions. \n However, they also agreed that the novelty of the approach is limited compared to recent works (e.g. Bell'16), despite acknowledging the multiple technical differences between the approaches. Another source of concern is the lack of large-scale experiments on imagenet, which would potentially elucidate the role of the proposed interleaved lrnn modules in the performance boost and demonstrate its usefulness to other tasks. \n \n Based on these remarks, the AC recommends rejection of the current manuscript, and encourages the authors to resubmit the work once the large-scale experiments are completed."

            "review": "This paper proposes a cascade of paired (left/right, up/down) 1D RNNs as a module in CNNs in order to quickly add global context information to features without the need for stacking many convolutional layers. Experimental results are presented on image classification and semantic segmentation tasks.\n\nPros:\n- The paper is very clear and easy to read.\n- Enough details are given that the paper can likely be reproduced with or without source code.\n- Using 1D RNNs inside CNNs is a topic that deserves more experimental exploration than what exists in the literature.\n\nCons (elaborated on below):\n(1) Contributions relative to, e.g. Bell et al., are minor.\n(2) Disappointed in the actual use of the proposed L-RNN module versus how it's sold in the intro.\n(3) Classification experiments are not convincing.\n\n(1,2): The introduction states w.r.t. Bell et al. \"more substantial differences are two fold: first, we treat the L-RNN module as a general block, that can be inserted into any layer of a modern architecture, such as into a residual module. Second, we show (section 4) that the\nL-RNN can be formulated to be inserted into a pre-trained FCN (by initializing with zero recurrence\nmatrices), and that the entire network can then be fine-tuned end-to-end.\"\n\nI felt positive about these contributions after reading the intro, but then much less so after reading the experimental sections. Based on the first contribution (\"general block that can be inserted into any layer\"), I strongly expected to see the L-RNN block integrated throughout the CNN starting from near the input. However, the architectures for classification and segmentation only place the module towards the very end of the network. While not exactly the same as Bell et al. (there are many technical details that differ), it is close. The paper does not compare to the design from Bell et al. Is there any advantage to the proposed design? Or is it a variation that performs similarly? What happens if L-RNN is integrated earlier in the network, as suggested by the introduction?\n\nThe second difference is a bit more solid, but still does not rise to a 'substantive difference' in my view. Note that Bell et al. also integrate 1D RNNs into an ImageNet pretrained VGG-16 model. I do, however, think that the method of integration proposed in this paper (zero initialization) may be more elegant and does not require two-stage training by first freezing the lower layers and then later unfreezing them.\n\n(3) I am generally skeptical of the utility of classification experiments on CIFAR-10 when presented in isolation (e.g., no results on ImageNet too). The issue is that CIFAR-10 is not interesting as a task unto itself *and* methods that work well on CIFAR-10 do not necessarily generalize to other tasks. ImageNet has been useful because, thus far, it produces features that generalize well to other tasks. Showing good results on ImageNet is much more likely to demonstrate a model that learns generalizable features. However, that is not even necessarily true, and ideally I would like to see that that a model that does well on ImageNet in fact transfers its benefit to at least one other ask (e.g., detection).\n\nOne additional issue with the CIFAR experiments is that I expect to see a direct comparison of models A-F with and without L-RNN. It is hard to understand from the presented results if L-RNN actually adds much. In sum, I have a hard time taking away any valuable information from the CIFAR experiments.\n\nMinor suggestion:\n- Figure 4 is hard to read. The pixelated rounded corners on the yellow boxes are distracting.",

Overall it is not a earth shattering paper, but a good piece of incremental science.\n\n\nPros:\n* Clear description\n* Well built experiments\n* Simple yet effective idea\n* No overclaiming\n* Detailed comparison with related work architectures\n\n\nCons:\n* Idea somewhat incremental (e.g. can be seen as derivative from Bell 2016)\n* Results are good, but do not improve over state of the art\n\n\nQuality: the ideas are sound, experiments well built and analysed.\n\n\nClarity: easy to read, and mostly clear (but some relevant details left out, see comments below)\n\n\nOriginality: minor, this is a different combination of ideas well known.\n\n\nSignificance: seems like a good step forward in our quest to learn good practices to build neural networks for task X (here semantic labelling and classification).\n\n\nSpecific comments:\n* Section 2.2 “we introduction more nonlinearities (through the convolutional layers and ...”. Convolutional layers are linear operators.\n* Section 2.2, why exactly RNN cannot have pooling operators ? I do not see what would impede it.\n* Section 3 “into the computational block”, which block ? Seems like a typo, please rephrase.\n* Figure 2b and 2c not present ? Please fix figure or references to it.\n* Maybe add a short description of GRU in the appendix, for completeness ?\n* Section 5.1, last sentence. Not sure what is meant. The convolutions + relu and pooling in ResNet do provide non-linearities “between layers” too. Please clarify\n* Section 5.2.1 (and appendix A), how is the learning rate increased and decreased ? Manually ? This is an important detail that should be made explicit. Is the learning rate schedule the same in all experiments of each table ? If there is a human in the loop, what is the variance in results between “two human schedulers” ?\n* Section 5.2.1, last sentence; “we certainly have  a strong baseline”; the Pascal VOC12 for competition 6 reports 85.4 mIoU as best known results. So no, 64.4 is not “certainly strong”. Please tune down the statement.\n* Section 5.2.3 Modules -> modules\n* The results ignore any mention of increased memory usage or computation cost. This is not a small detail. Please add a discussion on the topic.\n* Section 6 “adding multi-scale spatial” -> “adding spatial” (there is nothing inherently “multi” in the RNN)\n* Section 6 Furthermoe -> Furthermore\n* Appendix C, redundant with Figure 5 ?",

            "review": "The paper proposes a method of integrating recurrent layers within larger, potentially pre-trained, convolutional networks. The objective is to combine the feature extraction abilities of CNNs with the ability of RNNs to gather global context information.\nThe authors validate their idea on two tasks, image classification (on CIFAR-10) and semantic segmentation (on PASCAL VOC12).\n\nOn the positive side, the paper is clear and well-written (apart from some occasional typos), the proposed idea is simple and could be adopted by other works, and can be deployed as a beneficial perturbation of existing systems, which is practically important if one wants to increase the performance of a system without retraining it from scratch. The evaluation is also systematic, providing a clear ablation study. \n\nOn the negative side, the novelty of the work is relatively limited, while the validation is lacking a bit. \nRegarding novelty, the idea of combining a recurrent layer with a CNN, something practically very similar was proposed in Bell et al (2016). There are a few technical differences (e.g. cascading versus applying in parallel the recurrent layers), but in my understanding these are minor changes. The idea of initializing the recurrent network with the CNN is reasonable but is at the level of improving one wrong choice in the original work of Bell, rather than really proposing something novel. \nThis contribution (\" we use RNNs within layers\") is repeatedly mentioned in the paper (including intro &  conclusion), but in my understanding was part of Bell et al, modulo minor changes. \n\nRegarding the evaluation, experiments on CIFAR are interesting, but only as proof of concept. \n\nFurthermore, as noted in my early question, Wide Residual Networks (Sergey Zagoruyko, Nikos Komodakis, BMVC16)\nreport  better results on CIFAR-10 (4% error), while not using any recurrent layers (rather using instead a wide, VGG-type, ResNet variant). So. \nThe authors answer: \"Wide Residual Networks use the depth of the network to spread the receptive field across the entire image (DenseNet (Huang et al., 2016) similarly uses depth). Thus there is no need for recurrence within layers to capture contextual information. In contrast, we show that a shallow CNN, where the receptive field would be limited, can capture contextual information within the whole image if a L-RNN is used.\"\n\nSo, we agree that WRN do not need recurrence - and can still do better. \nThe point of my question has practically been whether using a recurrent layer is really necessary; I can understand the answer as being \"yes, if you want to keep your network shallow\".  I do not necessarily see why one would want to keep one's network shallow.\n\nProbably an evaluation on imagenet would bring some more insight about the merit of this layer. \n\n\nRegarding semantic segmentation, one of my questions has been:\n\"Is the boost you are obtaining due to something special to the recurrent layer, or is simply because one is adding extra parameters on top of a pre-trained network? (I admit I may have missed some details of your experimental evaluation)\"\nThe answer was:\n\"...For PASCAL segmentation, we add the L-RNN into a pre-trained network (this adds recurrence parameters), and again show that this boosts performance - more so than adding the same number of parameters as extra CNN layers - as it is able to model long-range dependences\"\nI could not find one such experiment in the paper ('more so than adding the same number of parameters as extra CNN layers'); I understand that you have 2048 x 2048 connections for the recurrence, it would be interesting to see what you get by spreading them over (non-recurrent) residual layers.\nClearly, this is not going to be my criterion for rejection/acceptance, since one can easily make it fail - but I was mostly asking for some sanity check \n\nFurthermore, it is a bit misleading to put in Table 3 FCN-8s and FCN8s-LRNN, since this gives the impression that the LRNN gives a  boost by 10%. In practice the \"FCN8s\" prefix of \"FCN8s-LRNN\" is that of the authors, and not of Long et al (as indicated in Table 2, 8s original is quite worse than 8s here). \n\nAnother thing that is not clear to me is where the boost comes from in Table 2; the authors mention that \"when inserting the L-RNN after pool 3 and pool4 in FCN-8s, the L-RNN is able to learn contextual information over a much larger range than the receptive field of pure local convolutions. \"\nThis is potentially true, but I do not see why this was not also the case for FCN-32s (this is more a property of the recurrence rather than the 8/32 factor, right?)\n\nA few additional points: \nIt seems like Fig 2b and Fig2c never made it into the pdf. \n\nFigure 4 is unstructured and throws some 30 boxes to the reader - I would be surprised if anyone is able to get some information out of this (why not have a table?) \n\nAppendix A: this is very mysterious. Did you try other learning rate schedules? (e.g. polynomial)\nWhat is the performance if you apply a standard training schedule? (e.g. step). \nAppendix C: \"maps .. is\" -> \"maps ... are\"\n\n\n",
