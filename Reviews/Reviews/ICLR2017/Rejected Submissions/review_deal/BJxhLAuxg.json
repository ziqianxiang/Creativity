        "comment": "The authors have combined two known areas of research - frame prediction and reward prediction - and combined them in a feedforward network trained on sequences from Atari games. The fact that this should train well is unsurprising for this domain, and the research yields no other interesting results. Pros - the paper is clearly written and the experiments are sound. Cons - there is very little novelty or contribution."

            "review": "The topic of the paper, model-based RL with a learned model, is important and timely. The paper is well written. I feel that the presented results are too incremental. Augmenting the frame prediction network with another head that predicts the reward is a very sensible thing to do. However neither the methodology not the results are novel / surprising, given that the original method of [Oh et al. 2015] already learns to successfully increment score counters in predicted frames in many games.\n\nIâ€™m very much looking forward to seeing the results of applying the learned joint model of frames and rewards to model-based RL as proposed by the authors.

            "review": "This paper introduces an additional reward-predicting head to an existing NN architecture for video frame prediction. In Atari game playing scenarios, the authors show that this model can successfully predict both reward and next frames.\n\nPros:\n- Paper is well written and easy to follow.\n- Model is clear to understand.\n\nCons:\n- The model is incrementally different than the baseline. The authors state that their purpose is to establish a pre-condition, which they achieve. But this makes the paper quite limited in scope.\n\nThis paper reads like the start of a really good long paper, or a good short paper. Following through on the future work proposed by the authors would make a great paper. As it stands, the paper is a bit thin on new contributions.",

            "review": "The paper extends a recently proposed video frame prediction method with reward prediction in order to learn the unknown system dynamics and reward structure of an environment. The method is tested on several Atari games and is able to predict the reward quite well within a range of about 50 steps. The paper is very well written, focussed and is quite clear about its contribution to the literature. The experiments and methods are sound. However, the results are not really surprising given that the system state and the reward are linked deterministically in Atari games. In other words, we can always decode the reward from a network that successfully encodes future system states in its latent representation. The contribution of the paper is therefore minor. The paper would be much stronger if the authors could include experiments on the two future work directions they suggest in the conclusions: augmenting training with artificial samples and adding Monte-Carlo tree search. The suggestions might decrease the number of real-world training samples and increase performance, both of which would be very interesting and impactful.",
