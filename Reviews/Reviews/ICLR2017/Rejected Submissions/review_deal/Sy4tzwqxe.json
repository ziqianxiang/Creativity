        "comment": "This paper is both time and topical in that it forms part of the growing and important literature of ways of representing approximate posterior distributions for variational inference that do need need a known or tractable density. The reviewers have identified a number of areas that when addressed will improve the paper greatly. These include: more clearer and structured introduction of methods, with the aim of highlighting how this work adds to the existing literature; careful explanation of the term wild variational inference, especially in context of alternative terms and more on relation to existing work; experiments on higher-dimensional data, much greater than 54 dimensions, to help better understand the advantages and disadvantages of this approach. It if for these reasons that the paper at this point is not yet ready for acceptance at the conference."

            "review": "The paper proposes two methods for what is called wild variational inference. \nThe goal is to obtain samples from the variational approximate distribution q \nwithout requiring to evaluate the density q(z) by which it becomes possible to \nconsider more flexible family of distributions. The authors apply the proposed \nmethod to the problem of optimizing the hyperparamter of the SGLD sampler. \nThe experiments are performed on a 1-d mixture of gaussian distribution and \nBayesian logistic regression tasks. \n\nThe key contribution seems to connect the previous findings in SVGD and KSD \nto the concept of inference networks, and to use them for hyperparameter \noptimization of SGLD. This can not only be considered as a rather simple \nconnection/extension, but also the toyish experiments are not enough to convince \nreaders on the significance of the proposed model. Particularly, I'm wondering \nhow the particle based methods can deal with the multimodality (not the simple\n1d gaussian mixture case) in general. Also, the method seems still to require to evaluate\nthe true gradient of the target distribution (e.g., the posterior distribution) for \neach z ~ q. This seems to be a computational problem for large dataset settings. \nIn the experiments, the authors compare the methods for the same number of \nupdate steps. But, considering the light computation of SGLD per update, I think \nSGLD can make much more updates per unit time than the proposed methods, \nparticularly for large datasets. The Bayesian logistic regression on 54 dimensions\nseems also a quite simple experiment, considering that its posterior is close to \na Gaussian distribution. Also, including Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) with \nautomatic hyperparameter tuning mechanism (like, no u-turn sampler) would be\ninteresting.\n\nThe paper is written very unclearly. Especially, it is not clear what is the exact\ncontributions of the paper compared to the other previous works including the\nauthors' works. The main message is quite simple but most of the pages are \nspent to explain previous works. \n\nOverall, I'd like to suggest to have more significant high-dimension, large scale \nexperiments, and to improve the writing. \n",

            "title": "Review: Two Methods for Wild Variational Inference",
            "rating": "3: Clear rejection",
            "review": "The authors propose two variational methods based on the theme of posterior approximations which may not have a tractable density. The first is from another ICLR submission on \"amortized SVGD\" (Wang and Liu, 2016), where here the innovation is in using SGLD as the inference network. The second is from a NIPS paper (Ranganath et al., 2016) on minimizing the Stein divergence with a parametric approximating family, where here the innovation is in defining their test functions to be an RKHS, obtaining an analytic solution to the inner optimization problem.\n\nThe methodology is incremental. Everything up to Section 3.2 is essentially motivation, background, or related work. The notion of a \"wild variational approximation\" was already defined in Ranganath et al. (2016), termed a \"variational program\". It would be useful for the authors to comment on the difference, if any.\n\nSection 3.2 is at first interesting because it analytically solves the maximum problem that is faced in Ranganath et al. (2016). However, this requires use of a kernel which will certainly not scale in high dimensions, so it is then equivalent in practice to having chosen a very simple test function family. To properly scale to high dimensions would require a deeper kernel and also learning its parameters; this is not any easier than parameterizing the test function family as a neural network to begin with, which Ranganath et al. (2016) do.\n\nSection 4 introduces a Langevin inference network, which essentially chooses the variational approximation as an evolving sequence of Markov transition operators as in Salimans et al. (2015). I had trouble understanding this for a while because I could not understand what they mean by inference network. None of it is amortized in the usual inference network sense, which is that the parameters are given by the output of a neural network. Here, the authors simple define global parameters of the SGLD chain which are used across all the latent variables (which is strictly worse?). (What then makes it an \"inference network\"?) Is this not the variational approximation used in Salimans et al. (2015), but using a different objective to train it?\n\nThe experiments are limited, on a toy mixture of Gaussians posterior and Bayesian logistic regression. None of this addresses the problems one might suspect on high-dimensional and real data, such as the lack of scalability for the kernel, the comparison to Salimans et al. (2015) for the Langevin variational approximation, and any note of runtime or difficulty of training.\n\nMinor comments\n\n+ It's not clear if the authors understood previous work on expressive variational families or inference networks. For example, they argue Rezende & Mohamed, 2015b; Tran et al., 2015; Ranganath et al., 2015 require handcrafted inference networks. However, all of them assume use of any neural network for amortized inference. None of them even require an inference network. Perhaps the authors mean handcrafted posterior approximations, which to some extent is true; however, the three mentioned are all algorithmic in nature: in Rezende & Mohamed (2015), the main decision choice is the flow length; Tran et al. (2015), the size of the variational data; Ranganath et al. (2015), the flow length on the auxiliary variable space. Each works well on different problems, but this is also true of variational objectives which admit intractable q (as the latter two consider, as does Salimans et al. (2015)). The paper's motivation could be better explained, and perhaps the authors could be clearer on what they mean by inference network.\n+ I also recommend the authors not term a variational inference method based on the class of approximating family. While black box variational inference in Ranganath et al. (2014) assumes a mean-field family, the term itself has been used in the literature to mean any variational method that imposes few constraints on the model class.",

            "review": "The authors propose methods for wild variational inference, in which the\nvariational approximating distribution may not have a directly accessible\ndensity function. Their approach is based on the Stain's operator, which acts\non a given function and returns a zero mean function with respect to a given\ndensity function which may not be normalized.\n\nQuality:\n\nThe derviations seem to be technically sound. However, my impression is that\nthe authors are not very careful and honest at evaluating both the strengths\nand weaknesses of the proposed work. How does the method perform in cases in\nwhich the distribution to be approximated is high dimensional? The logistic\nregression problem considered only has 54 dimensions. How would this method\nperform in a neural network in which the number of weights is goint to be way\nmuch larger? The logistic regression model is rather simple and its posterior\nwill be likely to be close to Gaussian. How would the method perform in more\ncomplicated posteriors such as the ones of Bayesia neural networks?\n\nClarity:\n\nThe paper is not clearly written. I found it very really hard to follow and not\nfocused. The authors describe way too many methods: 1) Stein's variational\ngradient descent (SVGD), 2) Amortized SVGD, 3) Kernelized Stein discrepancy\n(KSD), 4) Lavengin inference network, not to mention the introduction to\nStein's discrepancy. I found very difficult to indentify the clear\ncontributions of the paper with so many different techniques.\n\nOriginality:\n\nIt is not clear how original the proposed contributions are. The first of the\nproposed methods is also discussed in\n\nWang, Dilin and Liu, Qiang. Learning to draw samples: With application to\namortized mle for generative adversarial learning. Submitted to ICLR 2017, 2016\n\nHow does this work differ from that one?\n\nSignificance:\n\nIt is very hard to evaluate the importance of proposed methods. The authors\nonly report results on a 1d toy problem with a mixture of Gaussians and on a\nlogistic regression model with dimension 54. In both cases the distributions to\nbe approximated are very simple and of low dimension. In the regression case\nthe posterior is also likely to be close to Gaussian and therefore not clear\nwhat advances the proposed method would provide with respect to other more\nsimple approaches. The authors do not compare with simple variational\napproaches based on Gaussian approximations.",
