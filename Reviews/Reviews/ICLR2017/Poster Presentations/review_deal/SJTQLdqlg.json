        "comment": "The primary contribution of this paper is showing that k-nearest-neighbor method based memory can be usefully incorporated in a variety of architectures and supervised learning tasks. The presentation is clear, and results are good. I like the synthetic task and analysis. For the Omniglot task, running and reporting results on the original splits used by Lake would be good, as the splits used in matching nets are considerably easier and result in ceiling effects.",

The module is general enough that the authors apply the module to several neural network architectures and show improvements in performance.\n\nUsing k-nearest neighbors for memory access is not completely new. This has been recently explored in Rae et al., 2016 and Chandar et al., 2016. K-nearest neighbors based memory for one-shot learning has also been explored in [R1]. This paper provides experimental evidence that such an approach can be applied to a variety of architectures.\n\nAuthors have addressed all my pre-review questions and I am ok with their response.\n\nAre the authors willing to release the source code to reproduce the results? At least for omniglot experiments and synthetic task experiments?\n\nReferences:\n\n[R1] Charles Blundell, Benigno Uria, Alexander Pritzel, Yazhe Li, Avraham Ruderman, Joel Z.

But besides that I think this is a very nice and useful paper. I hope the authors will publish their code.",
