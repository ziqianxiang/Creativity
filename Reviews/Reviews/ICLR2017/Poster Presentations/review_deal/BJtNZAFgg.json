Totally, the paper is well-written, and easy to follow what is contribution of this paper. From the theoretical parts, the proposed method, BiGAN, inherits similar properties in GAN. The experimental results show that BiGAN is competitive with other methods. A drawback would a non-convex optimization problem in BiGAN, this paper is still suitable to be accepted in my opinion. ",

            "review": "The authors extend GANs by an inference path from the data space to the latent space and a discriminator that operates on the joint latend/data space. They show that the theoretical properties of GANs still hold for BiGAN and evaluate the features learned unsupervised in the inference path with respect to performance on supervised tasks after retraining deeper layers.\n\nI see one structural issue with this paper: Given that, as stated in the abstract, the main purpose of the paper is to learn unsupervised features (and not to improve GANs), the paper might spent too much space on detailing the relationship to GANs and all the theoretical properties. It is not clear whether they actually would help with the goal of learning good features. While reading the paper, I actually totally forgot about the unsupervised features until they reappeared on page 6. I think it would be helpful if the text of the paper would be more aligned with this main story.\n\nStill, the BiGAN framework is an elegant and compelling extension to GANs. However, it is not obvious how much the theoretical properties help us as the model is clearly not fully converged. To me, especially Figure 4 seems to suggest that G(E(x)) might be doing not much more than some kind of nearest neighbour retrival (and indeed one criticism for GANs has always been that they might just memorize some samples). By the way, it would be very interesting to know how well the discriminator actually performs after training.\n\nComing back to the goal of learning powerful features: The method does not reach state-of-the-art performance on most evaluated tasks (Table 2 and 3) but performs competitive and it would be interesting to see how much this improves if the BiGAN training (and the convolutional architecture used) would be improved.\n\nThe paper is very well written and provides most necessary details, although some more details on the training (learning rates, initialization) would be helpful for reproducing the results.\n\nOverall I think the paper provides a very interesting framework for further research, even though the results presented here are not too impressive both with respect to the feature evaluation (and the GAN learning).\n\nMinor: It might be helpful to highlight the best performance numbers in Tables 2 and 3.",
