As discussed on openreview, the isotropic Gaussian noise model used to create a model with a likelihood is questionable, and it's unclear how useful likelihoods are when models are obviously wrong. However, the results, lead to some interesting conclusions, and on balance this is a good paper.",

            "review": "# Review\nThis paper proposes a quantitative evaluation for decoder-based generative models that use Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS) to estimate log-likelihoods. Quantitative evaluations are indeed much needed since for some models, like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Generative Moment Matching Networks (GMMNs), qualitative evaluation of samples is still frequently used to assess their generative capability. Even though, there exist quantitative evaluations like Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), the authors show how AIS is more accurate than KDE and how it can be used to perform fine-grained comparison between generative models (GAN, GMMs and Variational Autoencoders (VAE)).\n\nThe authors report empirical results comparing two different decoder architectures that were both trained, on the continuous MNIST dataset, using the VAE, GAN and GMMN objectives. They also trained an Importance Weighted Autoencoder (IWAE) on binarized MNIST and show that, in this case, the IWAE bound underestimates the true log-likelihoods by at least 1 nat (which is significant for this dataset) according to the AIS evaluation of the same model.\n\n\n# Pros\nTheir evaluation framework is public and is definitely a nice contribution to the community.\n\nThis paper gives some insights about how GAN behaves from log-likelihood perspective. The authors disconfirm the commonly proposed hypothesis that GAN are memorizing training data. The authors also observed that GANs miss important modes of the data distribution.\n\n\n# Cons/Questions\nIt is not clear for me why sometimes the experiments were done using different number of examples (100, 1000, 10000) coming from different sources (trainset, validset, testset or simulation/generated by the model). For instance, in Table 2 why results were not reported using all 10,000 examples of the testing set?\n\nIt is not clear why in Figure 2c, AIS is slower than AIS+encoder? Is the number of intermediate distributions the same in both?\n\n16 independent chains for AIS seems a bit low from what I saw in the literature (e.g. in [Salakhutdinov & Murray, 2008] or [Desjardins etal., 2011], they used 100 chains). Could it be that increasing the number of chains helps tighten the confidence interval reported in Table 2?\n\nI would have like the authors to give their intuitions as to why GAN50 has a BDMC gap of 10 nats, i.e. 1 order of magnitude compared to the others?\n\n\n# Minor comments\nTable 1 is not referenced in the text and lacks description of what the different columns represent.\nFigure 2(a), are the reported values represents the average log-likelihood of 100 (each or total?) training and validation examples of MNIST (as described in Section 5.3.2).\nFigure 2(c), I'm guessing it is on binarized MNIST? Also, why are there fewer points for AIS compared to IWAE and AIS+encoder?\nAre the BDMC gaps mentioned in Section 5.3.1 the same as the ones reported in Table2 ?\nTypo in caption of Figure 3: \"(c) GMMN-10\" but actually showing GMMN-50 according to the graph title and subcaption.",

            "review": "Summary:\nThis paper describes how to estimate log-likelihoods of currently popular decoder-based generative models using annealed importance sampling (AIS) and HMC. It validates the method using bidirectional Monte Carlo on the example of MNIST, and compares the performance of GANs and VAEs.\n\n\nReview:\nAlthough this seems like a fairly straight-forward application of AIS to me (correct me if I missed an important trick to make this work), I very much appreciate the educational value and empirical contributions of this paper. It should lead to clarity in debates around the density estimation performance of GANs, and should enable more people to use AIS.\n\nSpace permitting, it might be a good idea to try to expand the description of AIS. All the components of AIS are mentioned and a basic description of the algorithm is given, but the paper doesn’t explain well “why” the algorithm does what it does/why it works.\n\nI was initially confused by the widely different numbers in Figure 2. On first glance my expectation was that this Figure is comparing GAN, GMMN and IWAE (because of the labeling at the bottom and because of the leading words in the caption’s descriptions). Perhaps mention in the caption that (a) and (b) use continuous MNIST and (c) uses discrete MNIST. “GMMN-50” should probably be “GMMN-10”.\n\n\nUsing reconstructions for evaluation of models may be a necessary but is not sufficient condition for a good model. Depending on the likelihood, a posterior sample might have very low density under the prior, for example. It would be great if the authors could point out and discuss the limitations of this test a bit more.\n\n\nMinor:\n\nPerhaps add a reference to MacKay’s density networks (MacKay, 1995) for decoder-based generative models.\n\nIn Section 2.2, the authors write “the prior over z can be drastically different than the true posterior p(z|x), especially in high dimension”. I think the flow of the paper could be improved here, especially for people less familiar with importance sampling/AIS. I don’t think the relevance of the posterior for importance sampling is clear at this point in the paper.\n\nIn Section 2.3 the authors claim that is often more “meaningful” to estimate p(x) in log-space because of underflow problems. “Meaningful” seems like the wrong word here. Perhaps revise to say that it’s more practical to estimate log p(x) because of underflow problems, or to say that it’s more meaningful to estimate log p(x) because of its connection to compression/surprise/entropy.",

            "review": "The paper describes a method to evaluate generative models such as VAE, GAN and GMMN. This is very much needed in our community where we still eyeball generated images to judge the quality of a model. However, the technical increment over the NIPS 16 paper: “Measuring the reliability of MCMC inference with bidirectional Monte Carlo” is very small, or nonexistent (but please correct me if I am wrong!).  (Grosse et al). The relative contribution of this paper is the application of this method to generative models. \nIn section 2.3 the authors seem to make a mistake. They write E[p’(x)] <= p(x) but I think they mean: E[log p’(x)] <= log E[p’(x)] = log p(x). Also,  for what value of x? If p(x) is normalized it can’t be true for all values of x. Anyways, I think there are typos here and there and the equations could be more precise.\nOn page 5 top of the page it is said that the AIS procedure can be initialized with q(z|x) instead of p(z). However, it is unclear what value of x is then picked? Is it perhaps Ep(x)[q(z|x)] ?\nI am confused with the use of the term overfitting (p8 bottom). Does a model A overfit relative to a another model B if the test accuracy of A is higher than that of B even though the gap between train and test accuracy is also higher for B than for A. I think not. Perhaps the last sentence on page 8 should say that VAE-50 underfits less than GMMN-50?\nThe experimental results are interesting in that it exposes the fact that GANs and GMMNs seem to have much lover test accuracy than VAE despite the fact that their samples look great. \n",
