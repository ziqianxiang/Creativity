            "review": "The paper aims to learn an autoencoder that can be used to effectively encode the known attributes/ generative factors and this allows easy and controlled manipulation of the images while producing realistic images.\n\nTo achieve this, ordinarily, the encoder produces latent code with two components y and z where y are clamped to known attributes using supervised loss while z is unconstrained and mainly useful for good reconstruction. But his setup fails when z is sufficiently large as the decoder can learn to ignore y altogether. Smaller sized z leads to poor reconstruction.\n\nTo overcome this issue, the authors propose to employ a student teacher training paradigm. The teacher is trained such that the encoder only produces y and the decoder that only consumes y. This ensures good disentanglement but poor reconstruction. Subsequently, a student autoencoder is learned which has a much larger latent code and produces both y and z. The y component is mapped to the teacher encoder’s y component using Jacobian regularization.\n\nPositives:\nThe results of image manipulation using known attributes is quite impressive. The authors propose modifications to the Jacobian regularization as simple reconstruction losses for efficient training. The approach avoids adversarial training and thus is easier to train.\n\nNegatives:\nUnsupervised disentanglement results are only shown for MNIST. I am not convinced similar results for unsupervised disentanglement can be obtained on more complex datasets. Authors should include some results on this aspect or reduce the emphasis on unsupervised disentanglement. Also when studying this quantitative evaluation for disentanglement such as in beta-VAE will be nice to have.\n\nTypos:\npage 3: tobtain -> obtain\npage 5: conditionning -> conditioning ",

            "review": "Summary: The paper proposes a method to tackle the disentanglement-reconstruction tradeoff problem in many disentangling approaches. This is achieved by first training the teacher autoencoder (unsupervised or supervised) that learns to disentangle the factors of variation at the cost of poor reconstruction, and then distills these learned representations into a student model with extra latent dimensions, where these extra latents can be used to improve the reconstructions of the student autoencoder compared to the teacher autoencoder. The distillation of the learned representation is encouraged via a novel Jacobian loss term that encourages the change in reconstructions of the teacher and student to be similar when the latent representation changes. There is one experiment for progressive unsupervised disentangling (disentangling factor by factor) on MNIST data, and one experiment for semi-supervised disentangling on CelebA-HQ.\n\nPros:\n- I think the idea of progressively capturing factors of variation one by one is neat, and this appears to be one of the first successful attempts at this problem.\n- The distillation appears to work well on the MNIST data, and does indeed decrease the reconstruction loss of the student compared to the teacher.\n- The qualitative results on CelebA-HQ look strong (especially apparent in the video), with the clear advantage over Fader Networks being that the proposed model is a single model that can manipulate the 40 different attributes, whereas Fader Nets can only deal with at most 3 attributes per model.\n\nCons:\n- There are not enough quantitative results supporting the claim that the model is “effective at both disentangling and reconstruction.” The degree of disentanglement in the representations is only shown qualitatively via latent interpolation, and only for a single model. Such qualitative results are generally prone to cherry-picking and it is difficult to reliably compare different disentangling methods in this manner. This calls for quantitative measures of disentanglement. Had you used a dataset where you know the ground truth factors of variation (e.g. dSprites/2D Shapes data) for the unsupervised disentangling method, then the level of disentanglement in the learned representations could be quantified, and thus your method could be compared against unsupervised disentangling baselines. For the semi-supervised disentanglement example on CelebA, you could for example quantify how well the encoder predicts the different attributes (because there is ground truth here) e.g. report RMSE of the y_i’s on a held out test set with ground truth. A quantitative comparison with Fader Networks in this manner appears necessary. The qualitative comparison on a single face in Figure 5 is nowhere near sufficient.\n- There is quantitative evidence that the reconstruction loss decreases when training the student, but here it’s not clear whether this quantitative difference makes a qualitative difference in the reconstructions. Getting higher fidelity images is one of the motivations behind improving reconstructions, so It would be informative to compare the reconstructions of the teacher and the student on the same image.\n- In the CelebA experiments, the benefit of student training is not visible in the results. In Figure 5 you already show that the teacher model gives decent reconstructions, yet you don’t show the reconstruction for the student model (quantitatively you show that it improves in Figure 3b, but again it is worth checking if it makes a difference visually). Also it’s not clear whether Figure 4 are results from the student model or the teacher model. I’m guessing that they are from the student model.\n- These quantitative results could form the basis of doing ablation studies for each of the different losses in the additive loss (for both unsupervised & semi-supervised tasks). Because there are many components in the loss, with a hyperparameter for each, it would be helpful to know what losses the results are sensitive to for the sake of tuning hyperparameters. This would be especially useful should I wish to apply the proposed method to a different dataset.\n- I think the derivation of the Jacobian loss requires some more justification. The higher order terms in the Taylor expansion in (2) and (3) can only be ignored when ||y_2 - y_1|| is small compared to the coefficients, but there is no validation/justification regarding this.\n\nOther Qs/comments:\n- On page 5 in the last paragraph of section 3, you say that “After training of the student with d=1 is finished, we consider it as the new teacher”. Here do you append z to y when you form the new teacher?\n- On page 6 in the paragraph for prediction loss, you say “This allows the decoder to naturally …. of the attributes”. I guess you mean this allows the model to give realistic interpolations between y=-1 and 1?\n- bottom of page 6: “Here we could have used any random values in lieu of y_2” <- not sure I understand this?\n- typo: conditionnning -> conditioning\n- I would be inclined to boost the score up to 7 if the authors include some quantitative results along with more thorough comparisons to Fader Networks\n\n************ Revision ***********\nThe authors' updates include further quantitative comparisons to Fader Networks and ablation studies for the different types of losses, addressing the concerns I had in the review. Hence I have boosted up my score to 7.",

            "review": "This paper proposed a novel approach for learning disentangled representation from supervised data (x as the input image, y as different attributes), by learning an encoder E and a decoder D so that (1) D(E(x)) reconstructs the image, (2) E(D(x)) reconstruct the latent vector, in particular for the vectors that are constructed by mingling different portion of the latent vectors extracted from two training samples, (3) the Jacobian matrix matches and (4) the predicted latent vector matches with the provided attributes. In addition, the work also proposes to progressively add latent nodes to the network for training. The claim is that using this framework, one avoid GAN-style training (e.g., Fader network) which could be unstable and hard to tune. \n\nAlthough the idea is interesting, the experiments are lacking. While previous works (e.g., Fader network) has both qualitative (e.g., image quality when changing attribute values) and quantitative results (e.g., classification results of generated image with novel combination of attributes), this paper only shows visual comparison (Fig. 4 and Fig. 5), and its comparison with Fader network is a bit vague (e.g., it is not clear to me why Fig. 5(e) generated by proposed approach is “more natural” than Fig. 5(d), even if I check the updated version mentioned by the authors' comments). Also in the paper there are five hyperparameters (Eqn. 14) and the center claim is that using Jacobian loss is better. However, there is no ablation study to support the claim and/or the design choice. From my opinion, the paper should show the performance of supervised training of attributes, the effects of using Jacobian loss and/or cycle loss, the inception score of generated images, etc. \n\nI acknowledge the authors for their honesty in raising the issues of Fig. 4, and providing an updated version.
