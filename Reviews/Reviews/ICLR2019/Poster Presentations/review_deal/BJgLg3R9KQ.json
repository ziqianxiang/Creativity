This annotation can be used for training more accurate and more interpretable attention models (deep neural networks) for object recognition. All reviewers and AC agree that this work is clearly of interest to ICLR and that extensive empirical evaluations show clear advantages of the proposed approach  in terms of improved classification accuracy. In the initial review, R3 put this paper below the acceptance bar requesting major revision of the manuscript and addressing three important weaknesses: (1) no analysis on interpretability; (2) no details about statistical analysis; (3) design choices of the experiments are not motivated. Pleased to report that based on the author respond, the reviewer was convinced that the most crucial concerns have been addressed in the revision. R3 subsequently increased assigned score to 6. As a result, the paper is not in the borderline bucket anymore.\nThe specific recommendation for the authors is therefore to further revise the paper taking into account a better split of the material in the main paper and its appendix. The additional experiments conducted during rebuttal (on interpretability) would be better to include in the main text, as well as explanation regarding statistical analysis. \n",

            "review": "\nSUMMARY\n\nThis paper argues that most recent gains in visual recognition are due to the use of visual attention mechanisms in deep convolutional networks (DCNs). According to the authors; the networks learn where to focus through a weak form of supervision based on image class labels. This paper introduces a data set that complements ImageNet with circa 500,000 human-derived attention maps, obtained through a large-scale online experiment called ClickMe. These attention maps can be used in conjunction with DCNs to add a human-in-the-loop feature that significantly improves accuracy.\n\nREVIEW\n\nThis paper is clearly within scope of the ICLR conference and addresses a relevant and challenging problem: that of directing the learning process in visual recognition tasks to focus on interesting or useful regions. This is achieved by leveraging a human-in-the-loop approach.\n\nThe paper does a fair job in motivating the research problem and describing what has been done so far in the literature to address the problem. The proposed architecture and the data collection online experiment are also described to a sufficient extent.\n\nIn my view, the main issue with this paper is the reporting of the experiment design and the analysis of the results. Many of the design choices of the experiments are simply listed and not motivated at all. The reader has to accept the design choices without any justification. The results for accuracy are simply listed in a table and some results are indicated as “p<0.01” but the statistical analysis is never described. Interpretability is highlighted in the abstract and introduction as an important feature of the proposed approach but the evaluation of interpretability is limited to a few anecdotes from the authors’ review of the results. The paper does not present a procedure or measure for evaluating interpretability.\n\nOTHER SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT\n\n- The verb “attend” is used in many places where “focus” seems to be more appropriate.\n\n- “we ran a rapid experiment”: what does rapid mean in this context?\n\n- “the proposed GALA architecture is grounded in visual neuroscience” : this and many other statements are only elaborated upon in the appendix. I understand that page limit is always an issue but I think it is important to prioritise this and similar motivations and put at least a basic description in the main body\n\nUPDATE\n\nMy most serious concerns have been addressed in the revised version.\n",

            "review": "This paper proposes a new approach to use more informative signals (than only class labels), specifically, regions humans deem important on images, to improve deep convolutional neural networks. They collected a large dataset by implementing a game on clickme.ai and showed that using this information results in both i) improved classification accuracy and ii) more interpretable features. \n\nI think this is good work and should be accepted. The main contribution is three fold: i) a publicly available dataset that many researchers can use, ii) a network module to incorporate this human information that might be inserted into many networks to improve performance, and iii) some insights on the effect of such human supervision and the relation between features that humans deem important to those that neural nets deem important. \n\nSome suggestions on how to improve the paper:\n1. I find Sections 3 & 4 hard to track - some missing details and notation issues. Several variables are introduced without detailing the proper dimensions, e.g., the global feature attention vector g (which is shown in the figure actually). The relation between U and u_k isn't clear. Also, it will help to put a one-sentence summary of what this module does at the beginning of Section 3, like the last half-sentence in the caption of Figure 3. I was quite lost until I see that. Some more intuition is needed, on W_expand and W_shrink; maybe moving some of the \"neuroscience motivation\" paragraph up into the main text will help. Bold letters are used to denote many different things - in  Section 4 as a set of layers, in other places a matrix/tensor, and even an operation (F). \n\n2. Is there any explanation on why you add the regularization term to every layer in a network? This setup seems to make it easy to explain what happens in Figure 4. One interesting observation is that after your regularization, the GALA features with ClickMe maps exhibit minimal variation across layers (those shown). But without this supervision the features are highly different. What does this mean? Is this caused entirely by the regularization? Or there's something else going on, e.g., this is evidence suggesting that with proper supervision like human attention regions, one might be able to use a much shallower network to achieve the same performance as a very deep one?\n\n3. Using a set of 10 images to compute the correlation between ClickMe and Clicktionary maps isn't ideal - this is even less than the number of categories among the images. I'm also not entirely convinced that \"game outcomes from the first and second half are roughly equal\" says much about humans not using a neural net-specific strategy, since you can't rule out the case that they learned to play the game very quickly (in the first 10 of the total 380 rounds). \n\n4. Title - this paper sound more \"human feedback\" to me than \"humans-in-the-loop\", because the loop has only 1 iteration.  Because you are collecting feedback from humans but not yet giving anything back to them. Maybe change the title?",
