They showed in some situations bias is unavoidable; however, there exist some situations in which bias is a consequence of weak features (features with low influence to the classifier and high variance). Therefore, they used some feature selection methods to remove weak features; by removing weak features, they reduced the bias substantially while maintaining accuracy (In many cases they even improved accuracy).  Showing that weak features cause bias is very interesting, especially in their real-world dataset in which they improved bias and accuracy simultaneously.  \n\n\nMy main concerns about this paper are its related work and its writing.\nAuthors did a great job in reviewing related work for bias amplification in NLP or vision. \nHowever, they studied bias amplification in binary classification, in particular, they looked at GNB; and they did not review the related work about bias in GNB.  I think it is clear that using MAP causes bias amplification. Therefore, I think changing theorem 1 to a proposition and shifting the focus of the paper to section 2.2 would be better. Right now, I found feature orientation and feature asymmetry section confusing and hard to understand. In the paper, the authors claimed bias is a consequence of gradient descent’s inductive bias, but they did not expound on the reasoning behind this claim. Although the authors ran their model on many datasets, there is no comparison with previous work. So it is hard to understand the significance of their work. It is also not clear why they don’t compare their model with \\ell_1 regularization in CIFAR.\n\n\nMinor:\n\nPaper has some typos that can be resolved.\nCitations have some errors, for example, Some of the references in the text does not have the year, One paper has been cited twice in two different ways, For more than two authors you should use et al., sometimes \\citet and \\citep are used instead of each other.\nAuthors sometimes refer to the real-world experiment without first explaining the data which I found confusing.",

            "review": "Summary:\n\nIn this paper the authors identify a specific source of marginal class probability bias that occurs when using logistic regression models. Using synthetic and real datasets they demonstrate this bias and explore characteristics of the data that exacerbate the issue. Finally, they propose two methods for correcting this bias in logistic regression models and neural network models with logistic output layers and evaluate these methods on several benchmark datasets.\n\nReview:\n\nOverall, I found the paper well-written, the problem well-motivated, and the proposed methods clear and reasonable. While I have a few concerns about presentation and experimentation, these are issues that can easily be remedied and I recommend acceptance.\n\nMajor comments:\n\n- The authors repeatedly say that gradient descent is the cause of the bias amplification (e.g. Section 2.2 title, \"...features that are systematically overestimated by gradient descent.\", \"... i.e., a consequence of gradient descent's inductive bias.\", \"... gradient descent may lead to systematic bias...\"). The inductive bias they describe is coming from the use of logistic regression, not the use of gradient descent. Specifically, a logistic regression model has a convex likelihood, which means that regardless of what algorithm is used to maximize the likelihood, it should converge to the same point. In fact, most off-the-shelf implementations of logistic regression do not use vanilla gradient descent. Further, gradient descent may be used to estimate the parameters of any number of models which may or may not have the same inductive bias the authors describe.\n\n- I thought the related work section was well-written and would strongly recommend moving it to the beginning of the paper as it motivates the entire problem. I also think it could be helpful to ground the technical definitions of bias amplification in a meaningful example.\n\n- I think that the experimental setup for comparing \\ell_1 regularization to the proposed feature selection methods is not quite fair. In particular, the hyperparameters of the \"expert\" method are selected to minimize bias subject to the constraint that loss not increase. In contrast, the \\ell_1 regularization hyperparameter is selected purely to minimize bias. Instead, I would select the \\ell_1 regularization hyperparameter in the same way as the expert method, that is, to minimize bias subject to a constraint on loss. In general, I think hyperparameters should be selected using the same criterion for all methods.\n\n- The authors make a point of highlighting results on the \"prostate\" which showed a large increase in accuracy along with a large decrease in bias. I think the paper would benefit from some exploration of why this happened. Specifically, it would be valuable to answer the question: what are the properties of the \"prostate\" dataset that make this method so effective and are these properties general and identifiable a priori?\n\n- Section 2, paragraph 2, line 5: The stated goal in this paragraph is \"minimizing 0-1 loss on unknown future i.i.d. samples\". As stated in the introduction, this is, in fact, not the goal. The goal is to minimize loss while also minimizing bias. A larger criticism that I would have of this work is: if minimizing bias is a first order goal, then why are we using empirical risk minimization in the first place? Put another way, why use post-hoc correction for an objective function that does not match our actual stated goals rather than using an objective function that does?\n\nMinor comments:\n\n- Section 1, paragraph 4, line 2: \"Weak\" is not clearly defined here. Is it different than \"moderately-predictive\"?\n\n- Section 2.1, last paragraph, line 1: I understand what the authors are saying when they say \"Bias amplification is unavoidable\", but it is avoidable by changing our objective function. I would consider rewording this statement to something like \"Using an ERM objective will lead to bias amplification when the learning rule...\"\n\n- Equation 4: I believe h should be changed to f in this equation.\n\n- Equation 6: L is not defined anywhere.\n\n- Table 1: As defined in equation 1, B_D(h_s) should be between 0 and 1. Also, the accuracy results for the glioma dataset have the wrong result in bold.\n\n- Section 4, methodology paragraph, line 5: forthe --> for the\n\n- Section 5, paragraph 5, lines 5-6: Feature selection is not used \"only to improve accuracy\". For example, Kim, Shah, and Doshi-Valez (2015) use feature selection to improve interpretability (https://beenkim.github.io/papers/BKim2015NIPS.pdf).",

            "review": "update: The authors' feedback has addressed some of my concerns. I update my rating to 6.\n=================\noriginal:\nThis paper provides some new insights into classification bias. On top of the well known unbalanced group size, it shows that a large number of weak but asymmetry weak features also leads to bias. This paper also provides a method to reduces bias and remain the prediction accuracy.\n\nIn general, the paper is well written, but some description can be clearer. Some notation seems inconsistent. For example, D in equation (1) denotes the joint distribution (x,y), but it also refers to the marginal distribution of x somewhere else. \n\nIn the high level, I am not totally convinced of how significant the result is.  In particular, the bias this paper defines is on the probability (softmax) scale, but logistic regression is on logit scale--   not even aimed at the unbiasedness in the original scale. So the result in section 2 seems to be expected.  Given the fact that unbiasedness is not invariant under transformation, I am wondering why it should be the main target in the first place.  \n\nIn the bias reduction methods in equation 5 and 6, both the objective function and the constraint are empirical estimations. Will it be too noisy to adapt to the high dimensional setting? On the other hand, adding some sparsity regularization improves prediction seems well known in practice.\n\nI would also encourage the authors to have extended work both theoretically and experimentally.  The asymmetry feature is only illustrated by a single logistic regression. Is it a problem of weak features, or indeed a problem of logistic regression? What will happen in a more general case beyond mean-field Gaussian?  I would imagine in this simple case the authors may even derive the closed form expression to verify their heuristics.  \n\nBased on the evaluations above, I would recommend a weak reject. \n",
