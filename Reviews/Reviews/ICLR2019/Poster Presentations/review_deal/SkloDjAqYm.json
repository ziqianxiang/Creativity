This paper may very well improve researchers efficiency, in particular when working with calcium imaging. The question remain to what extent these ideas may be useful in other imaging modalities, i.e. fMRI.\n\nMy main critique would be to be more explicit about why the VAE you propose, is superior to other models in the generative modelling domain.",

            "review": "The paper proposes a VAE-style model for identifying motifs from calcium imaging videos. As opposed to standard VAE with Gaussian latent variables it relies on Bernouli variables and hence, requires Gumbel-softmax trick for inference. Compared to methods based on matrix factorization, the proposed method has the advantage of not requiring any preprocessing on the imaging videos. My main comments are as follows:\n\n- How sensitive is the method to the choice of beta and other hyperparameters?  Compared to SCC which has fewer hyperparameters, how robust is the method?\n- How does it perform on real data compared to methods based on spike time matrices? Do they generate similar motifs? \n- The application of the method seems quite limited to calcium imaging videos and it does not provide comparison with other deep generative models for videos. Methods such as Johnson et al. NIPS 2016 (Composing graphical models with neural networks for structured representations and fast inference) can also be applied to calcium imaging datasets and can potentially infer the motifs.\n\nI believe the problem of inferring the neural motifs is an interesting problem; however, I think this paper requires more work to it shows its advantages over other deep generative models for video data and also itâ€™s performance on real data compared to SCC (or some other matrix factorization based approach). \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe authors have addressed my comments about other deep generative models and hyperparameter sensitivity. However, I still think the paper is more suitable for other venues with readers from the neuroscience community. Hence, I change my rating to 5. ",
