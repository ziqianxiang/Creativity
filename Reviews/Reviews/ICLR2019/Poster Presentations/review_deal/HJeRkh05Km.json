The agent uses a graphnet to learn relationships and support the navigation. The empirical protocol is sound and uses best practices, and the authors have added additional experiments during the revision period, in response to the reviewers' requests. However, there were some significant problems with the submission - there were no comparisons to other semantic navigation methods, the approach is somewhat convoluted and will not survive the test of time, and the authors did not conclusively show the value of their approach. The reviewers uniformly support the publication of this paper, but with a low confidence. ",

            "review": "This paper tackles the problem of navigating scenes to find objects which are potentially not included in the training phase. To find an unseen object from a scene, the proposed model incorporates an external knowledge graph as an augmented input of the actor-critic model. To construct a knowledge graph, entities in a scene are identified by ResNet and then the link structure between entities are extracted from VIsual Genome dataset. Through the ablation study, it is shown that using the knowledge graph helps to track and identify unseen objects during training.\n\n- The original knowledge graph (KG) has relation labels (such as next to, on in figure 3) between different objects, however, GCN does not take into account the relations between objects. Only co-occurrence patterns will be encoded into the KG constructed from an image. There are more complex graph convolutional models modelling relations between nodes such as [1]. Have you considered adding explicit relations between entities? will it increase the navigation performance? if not why?\n- It is unclear how many objects are used to construct a KG from an image. For example, are top-k objects identified by ResNet used to construct a KG?\n- Description of the reward is a bit unclear as well, especially when the model is trained without stop action. From the text, the agents receive a positive reward when it is close to the target (within a certain number of steps). Does this mean that the agent gets a positive reward on every step near the target while it's not in the final state?\n- This might be a trivial question, but I couldn't find it from the text. Can you find all object from AI2-THOR in the categories of ImageNet and of Visual Genome? is there any information loss while constructing a KG from the classification result? What is the average number of nodes of a KG? and is there any correlation between the size of KG and the result?\n- Why are the performances of the models is unstable with Bedroom dataset (in terms of variance)? \n- The input feature of GCN is a combination of word feature and image feature. It is clear that there is a corresponding word embedding for each of the identified objects, but it is unclear what is the corresponding image feature. If two objects are identified in the same frame, do input features of these two objects share the same image features from Resnet?\n\n[1] Schlichtkrull, Michael, et al. \"Modeling relational data with graph convolutional networks.\" European Semantic Web Conference.

            "review": "This paper explores the use of semantic priors for semantic navigation. The semantic priors are derived from language datasets (in the form of word embeddings, which assign similar feature vectors to related words) and from visual datasets (Visual Genome, which represents relationships between objects that co-occur in scenes).\n\nThe general ideas are reasonable. The experimental protocol is sound and uses recent best practices. The results are fine.\n\nI'm a bit puzzled by the way the GCN is used. Figure 2 implies that the GCN doesn't actually use information from the current image. I.e., the GCN input doesn't change as the agent navigates the scene. (In Figure 2, the GCN path appears similar to the Word Embedding path. The Word Embedding path doesn't update when the agent moves, so the reader can infer that the GCN path doesn't update either.) But then I don't quite understand how the GCN incorporates information from the current scene.\n\nFigure 4 implies that the GCN is re-evaluated when the agent moves and the input image changes. But how is information from the image fed into the GCN? The text implies that an ImageNet classification model is run on the image. But why image classification and not object detection? It seems that what one would really want is to understand what objects are in the scene. And how is output of the image classification network supplied to the GCN? Is the target object type used as well? Overall it's not clear to me exactly how information from the current image is supplied to the GCN, why this mechanism is right, and what the GCN is expected to do. (I do understand how GCNs work, just not how exactly they are used here and why this precise usage is right for this application.) I hope the authors can clarify in the response.\n",

            "review": "This work proposes to use semantic knowledge about the relationships and functionality of different objects, to help in navigation tasks, in both familiar and unfamiliar situations. The paper is very well written and it is clear what the authors did. The approach seems sound, and while it combines two existing approaches (actor-critic reinforcement learning for navigation, and belief propagation using graph convolution networks) is sufficiently novel to be of interest to at least some members of the community. The experimental evaluation is good, and the proposed method outperforms Mnih 2016 by a significant margin, especially in the more interesting settings. A good ablation study is provided. \n\nMy main concern is that there seems to be a larger pool of work in semantic navigation than what the evaluation includes. Anderson 2018, Zhu 2017 and Gupta 2017 seem relevant. While none of these use knowledge graphs, some of these show they outperform Mnih 2016 so would be stronger baselines. \n\nI am also curious whether the proposed work generalizes across scene type categories (e.g. if it learns on kitchens but it tested on living rooms). This would be an experiment in the spirit of unknown object/scene but even more challenging. ",
