            "title": "Interesting contribution to V1 modeling",
            "review": "In this interesting study, the authors show that incorporating rotation-equivariant filters  (i.e. enforcing weight sharing across filters with different orientations) in a CNN model of the visual system is a useful prior to predict responses in V1. After fitting this model to data, they find that the RFs of model V1 cells do not resemble the simple Gabor filters of textbooks, and they present other quantitative results about V1 receptive fields. The article is clearly written and the claims are supported by their analyses. It is the first time to my knowledge that a rotation-equivariant CNN is used to model V1 cells.\n\nThe article would benefit from the following clarifications:\n\n1. The first paragraph of the introduction discusses functional cell types in V1, but the article does not seem to reach any new conclusion about the existence of well-defined clusters of functional cell types in V1. If this last statement is correct, I believe it is misleading to begin the article with considerations about functional cell types in V1. Please clarify.\n\n2. For clarity, it would help the reader to mention in the abstract, introduction and/or methods that the CNN is trained on reproducing V1 neuron activations, not on an image classification task as in many other studies (Yamins 2014, etc). \n\n3. “As a first step, we simply assume that each of the 16 features corresponds to one functional cell type and classify all neurons into one of these types based on their strongest feature weight.” and “The resulting preferred stimuli of each functional type are shown in Fig. 6.“\nAgain, I think these statements are misleading because they suggest that V1 cells indeed cluster in distinct functional cell types rather than form a continuum. However, from the data shown, it is unclear whether the V1 cells recorded form a continuum or distinct clusters. Unless this question is clarified and the authors show the existence of functionally distinct clusters in their data, they should preferably not mention \"cell types\" in the text.\n\nSuggestions for improvement and questions (may not necessarily be addressed in this paper):\n\n4. “we apply batch normalization”\nWhat is the importance of batch normalization for successfully training the model? Do you think that a sort of batch normalization is implemented by the visual system? \n\n5. “The second interesting aspect is that many of the resulting preferred stimuli do not look typical standard textbook V1 neurons which are Gabor filters. ”\nOK but the analysis consists of iteratively ascending the gradient of activation of the neuron from an initial image. This cannot be compared directly to the linear approximation of the V1 filter that is computed experimentally from doing a spike-triggered average (STA) from white noise. A better comparison would be to do a single-step gradient ascent from a blank image. In this case, do the filters look like Gabors?\n\n6. Did you find any evidence that individual V1 neurons are themselves invariant to a rotation?\n\n7. The article could be more self-contained. There are a lot of references to Klindt et al. (2017) on which this work is based, but it would be nice to make the article understandable without having to read this other article.\n\nTypo: Number of fearture maps in last layer \n\nConclusion:\nI believe this work is significant and of interest for the rest of the community studying the visual system with deep networks, in particular because it finds an interesting prior for modeling V1 neurons, that can probably be extended to the rest of the visual system. However, it would benefit from the clarifications mentioned above.",

            "title": "Does rotation equivariance add neuroscientific insight?",
            "review": "﻿This paper applies a rotation-equivariant convolutional neural network model to a dataset of neural responses from mouse primary visual cortex. This submission follows a series of recent papers using deep convolutional neural networks to model visual responses, either in the retina (Batty et al., 2016; McIntosh et al., 2016) or V1 (Cadena et al., 2017; Kindel et al., 2017; Klindt et al., 2017). The authors show that adding rotation equivariance improves the explanatory power of the model compared to non-rotation-equivariant models with similar numbers of parameters, but the performance is not better than other CNN-based models (e.g. Klindt et al., 2017). The main potential contributions of the paper are therefore the neuroscientific insights obtained from the model. However, I have concerns about the presented data and the validity of rotation equivariance in modeling visual responses in general (below). Together with the fact that the model does not provide better explanatory power than other models, I cannot recommend acceptance. I am open to discussions with the authors, but do not anticipate a major change in the rating.\n\nUpdate after revisions: The authors performed extensive work to address my concerns. This showed that some concerns (RF appearance) were valid, and the authors removed them from the final manuscript. I raised my score accordingly.\n\n1. As noted by the authors, the finding that “Feature weights are sparse” (page 6) could be due to the sparsity-inducing L1 penalty. The fact that a model without L1 penalty performs worse does not mean that there is sparsity in the underlying data. For example, the unregularized model could be overfitting. A more careful model selection analysis is necessary to show that the data is better fit by a sparse than a dense model. \n\n2. The finding that there are center-surround or asymmetric (non-gabor) RFs in mouse V1 is not novel and not specific to this model (e.g. Antolik et al., 2016). \n\n3. Many of the receptive fields in Figure 6 look pathological (overfitted?) compared to typical V1 receptive fields in the literature. I understand that sensitivity to previously undetected RF features is a goal of the present work. However, given how unusual the RFs look, more controls are necessary to ensure they are not an artefact of the method, e.g. the activation maximization approach with gradient preconditioning, the sparsity constraints, or overfitting. Perhaps a comparison of RFs learned on two disjoint subsets of the training set would help to determine which features are reproducible.\n\n4. Should orientation be treated as a nuisance variable? Natural image statistics are not rotation-invariant. In the visual system, especially in mice, it is not clear whether orientation is completely disentangled from other RF properties. The orientation space is not uniformly covered, and some directions have special meaning (e.g. cardinal directions), such that it might be invalid to assume that the visual system is equivariant to rotation. (The same concern applies to the translation equivariance assumed when modeling visual RFs with standard CNNs.) Of course, there is a tradeoff between model expressiveness and the need to make assumptions to fit the model with realistic amounts of data. However, this concern should at least be discussed.\n\n5. Some more details about the neural recordings would be good. What calcium indicator? How was the recording targeted to V1? Perhaps some example traces.",

            "review": "The paper analyses the data collected from 6005 neurons in a mouse brain. Visual stimuli are presented and the responses of the neurons recorded. In the next step, a rotational equivariant neural network architecture together with a sparse coding read-out layer is trained to predict the neuron responses from the stimuli. Results show a decent correlation between neuron responses and trained network. Moreover, the rotational equivariant architecture beats a standard CNN with similar number of feature maps. The analysis and discussion of the results is interesting. Overall, the methodological approach is good.\n\nI have trouble understanding the plot in Figure 4, it also does not print well and is barely readable on paper.\n\nI have a small problem Figure 6 where \"optimal\" response-maps are presented. From my understanding, many of those feature maps are not looking similar to feature maps that are usually considered. Given the limited data available and the non-perfect modeling of neurons, the computed optimal response-map might include features that are not present in the dataset. Therefore, it would be interesting to compare those results with the stimuli used to gather the data. E.g. for a subset of neurons, one could pick the stimulus that created the maximum response and compare that to what the stimulus with the maximum response of the trained neuron was. It might be useful to include the average correlation of the neurons belong to each of the 16 groups(if there are any meaningful differences), especially as the cut-off of \"correlation 0.2 on the validation set\" is rather low.\n\nNote: I am not an expert in the neural-computation literature, I am adapting the confidence rating accordingly.",
