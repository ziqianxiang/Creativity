            "review": "The paper \"Diversity and Depth in Per-Example Routing Models\" extends previous work on routing networks by adding diversity to the type of architectural unit available for the router at each decision and by scaling to deeper networks. They evaluate their approach on Omniglot, where they achieve state of the art performance.\n\nOverall, the paper is very well written and every aspect can be easily understood. The overview over related work given in the paper is thorough, and the authors explain very well how their approach relates to previous approaches.\n\nThe architecture presented is a natural and important extension of previous work. Adding diversity in routing units has indeed not been investigated well and is an important contribution to the community. Additionally, the authors do a good job of identifying problems with existing approaches (overfitting, routing depth) and offer a empirically convincing solutions. \n\nThe result section given in the paper is its weakness and requires a more in-depth analysis:\n+ the results given for Omniglot are impressive\n+ the experiments analyzing the impact of diversity and routing depth are interesting and offer interesting insight into the architecture\n- the results do not show learning behavior over epochs; this is not necessary, but would give an additional insight into the learning behavior of the architecture\n- the experimental settings are confusing: why are the different experiments performed with different datasets? This makes it seem as if the authors cherry-picked the best results for the different experiments (this might not be the case, but the results on Omniglot alone are good enough that negative results and a detailed discussion of them would not have hurt the paper, but enriched the discourse)\n- additional experiments that offer a transition from larger datasets to smaller ones would be interesting; seeing how the performance of the architecture behaves e.g. on CIFAR10 for 1k, 5k, 10k, 25k and 50k would have illustrated how well the architecture is able to generalize from different numbers of samples\n\nIn summary, I think the paper analyzes a very important problem and has a lot of potential. However, it needs more extensive experiments that illustrate how the proposed architecture behaves over a wider variety of datasets.\n\nUPDATE AFTER REBUTTAL:\nI am still torn about this paper. On one hand, I still think that the topic and discourse provided by this paper is extremely important. On the other, the results - even after the revision - do not completely convince me. I might update my score after some discussion with the other reviewers.\n2ND UPDATE:\nAfter giving it some more thought, I find myself convinced that this paper has a contribution important enough to be accepted. I increase my score to 7.",

            "review": "Overall, this is a valuable read. Authors tackle the head on problem of what is a good architecture where we can having routing with diverse models. The papers is written well, with comparisons to mixture of experts, other models that tackled this problem with either homogeneous architectures or static architectures. Below is my assessment on various axis:\n\nQuality - Enough experiments to justify some conclusions, equations helped ground the method with math.\n\nclarity - Very well written, good figures and analysis.\n\noriginality - While the authors achieve SOA results on OmniGlot and do explore a few options, I feel the work still lacks originality in the formulation or does not have original contributions to either the architectures used or the optimization procedures employed.\n\nsignificance - very significant to look at this problem both in terms of compute, accuracy perspective as well as scaling these networks for multiple tasks.\n\npros - thorough analysis, even the negative experiments are well written and throw more light into the problem space.\n\ncons - OmniGlot comparisons seem not fair as the model capacity is not added as part of the table which raises concerns on achieving state of the art with more high complexity models than routing mechanism. Will be great to move from CIFAR-10 and test things on CIFAR-100 to really see the value of proposed work. I would recommend a higher rating if authors address these two concerns.",

            "review": "The major contribution of this work is extending routing networks (Rosenbaum et al., ICLR 2018) to use diverse architectures across routed modules. I view this as an important contribution and am very impressed by the experiment on Omniglot where it shows big performance gain on a split with very few examples. This idea of incorporating in architectural bias and not just parameter bias for small data problems is very compelling and intuitive to me on the surface. The ablation study was also very interesting in this regard. I really like the discourse and found it to be filled with interesting insights throughout ranging from the connection between routing networks and neural architecture search to the heuristic for selecting k.  However, after the great discourse, I was quite disappointed by the breadth of the experiments. \n\nThe paper is positioned as exploring two parallel ideas that are independently interesting 1) diversity in the architecture of modules in routing models 2) the effect of increasing depth in routing models. For the first idea, this is shown very well by the Omniglot experiment but is not evaluated in any other setting. Showing this in a few other experiments would have really driven this point home in my opinion.  The second idea is not really executed in a convincing way to me. The authors call it a ‘negative result’ in the end, but I’m not sure I really feel like I learned anything from this experiment. I wonder about statistical significance. I also feel like the authors are trying to turn it into a commentary that this is a pain point for all variants of routing models while they only actually tried it for their proposed architecture which makes quite a few decisions along the way. I would have liked to see more model variants and datasets before really feeling like I can make any empirical determinations about the fundamental limitations of all routing models in this regard.  Additionally, if there were such a fundamental scaling limitation, you would imagine that an experiment could be constructed that really highlighted this fact where all routing models do way worse.\n\nIn short, I think there are some really good idea in this paper and vote for acceptance on that basis. Had the authors provided more empirical evidence about architectural diversity, I would have given it a very high score. The analysis of depth is also a very interesting topic, but it could possibly even serve as another paper considering that the current results don’t really come to concrete conclusions for the community. \n",
