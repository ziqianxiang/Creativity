By combining the two approaches, the work finds a new method that performs better than existing approaches.\n\nThe paper clearly has new interesting ideas which have been executed well. Two of the reviewers have voted in favour of acceptance, with one of the reviewer providing an extensive and detailed review. The third reviewer however has some doubts which were not resolved completely after the rebuttal.\n\nUpon reading the work myself, I am convinced that this will be interesting to the community. However, I will recommend the authors to take the comments of Reviewer 2 into account and do whatever it takes to resolve issues pointed by the reviewer.\n\nDuring the review process, another related work was found to be very similar to the approach discussed in this work. This work should be cited in the paper, as a prior work that the authors were unaware of. \nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1812.04744\nPlease also discuss any new insights this work offers on top of this existing work.\n\nGiven that the above suggestions are taken into account, I recommend to accept this paper.\n",

            "review": "This is a very interesting paper that achieves something that seems initially impossible: \nto learn to reconstruct clear images from only seeing noisy or blurry images. \n\nThe paper builds on the closely related prior work AmbientGAN which shows that it is possible to learn the *distribution* of uncorrupted samples using only corrupted samples, again a very surprising finding. \nHowever, AmbientGAN does not try to reconstruct a single image, only to to learn the clear image distribution. The key idea that makes this is possible is knowledge of the statistics of the corruption process: the generator tries to create images that *after they have been corrupted* they look indistinguishable from real corrupted images. This surprisingly works and provably recovers the true distribution under a very wide set of corruption distributions, but tells us nothing about reconstructing an actual image from measurements. \n\nGiven access to a generative model for clear images, an image can be reconstructed from measurements by maximizing the likelihood term. This method (CS-GAN) was introduced by Bora et al. in 2017. Therefore one approach to solve the problem that this paper tackles is to first use AmbientGAN to get a generative model for clear images and then use CS-GAN using the learned GAN. If I understand correctly, this is the 'Conditional AmbientGAN' approach that is used as a baseline. This is a sensible approach given prior work. However, the authors show that their method ('Unpaired Supervision') performs significantly better compared to the Conditional AmbientGAN baseline. This is very surprising and interesting to me. Please discuss this a bit more ? As far as I understand the proposed method is a merging of AmbientGAN and CS-GAN, but much better than the naive separation. Could you give a bit more intuition on why ?\n\nI would like to add also that the authors can use their approach to learn a better AmbientGAN. After getting their denoised images, these can be used to train a new AmbientGAN, with cleaner images as input , which should be even better no ?\n\nIn the appendix where is the proposed method in fig 5- 8 ?\n\nDoes the proposed method outperform Deep Image Prior ? \n\n\n",

            "review": "This paper presents a method to reconstruct images using only noisy measurements. This problem is practically interesting, since the noiseless signal may be unavailable in many applications. The approach combines ideas from recent development in compressed sensing and GANs. However, the modelâ€™s presentation is confusing, and many important details of the experiments are missing.\n\nPros:\n\n* The problem is interesting and important\n* The combination of compressed sensing and GANs for image reconstruction is novel\n\nCons:\n\n* The model structure is unclear: for example, what is the role of the variable \\theta? Section 2.1 says it is known, but the algorithm samples from its prior(?). Since there is no further explanation with respect to the experiments, I am not sure how the values of \\theta or its distributions were determined. Although \\theta is formally similar to the \\theta parameters of the measurement function in ambientGANs, this interpretation is at odds with the example given in the paper (below eq.1, saying \\theta can be positions or sizes).\n* A few important details of the model are missing. For example, what is the exact structure of the measurement function F?\n* The baseline models are a bit confusing. More detail about unpaired vs paired supervision would also be helpful for understanding how these baseline models use the additional information.\n* Although the paper mentioned parameters are obtained from cross-validation, it would still be helpful to describe a few important ones (e.g., neural network size, weight \\lambda) for comparison with other models.The experiments on only CelebA dataset are too limited.",
