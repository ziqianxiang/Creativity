This is well-positioned in the rapidly advancing field of MARL and the contribution of the paper is both novel, interesting, and effective. The agents learn how to schedule themselves, how to encode messages, and how to select actions. The approach is evaluated against several other methods and achieves a good performance increase. The reviewers had concerns regarding the difficulty of evaluating the overall performance and also about how it would fare in more real-world scenarios, but all agree that this paper should be accepted.",

Specifically, the authors look into cases where agents share the same reward and they are in a partially observable environment, each of them with different observations. The main contribution of this work is that authors provide a model for communication scheduling for dealing with cases where only a certain number of agents is allowed to communicate.\n\nThe paper is very clear, positions the work very well in the literature of MARL and communication. The authors perform experiments in two environments and include a number of reasonable baselines (e.g., adapted DIAL for top(k))  as well as the full-communication upper bound. \nThe authors moreover provide a nice analysis on the messages in the predator-pray experiment.\n\nMy only concern is that authors report \"DIAL(1) performs worse than SchedNet-Top(1)\".  However, Figure 3a clearly shows that Dial(1) to be within the variance of Sched-Top(1) -- from this it's not clear that the null hypothesis can be rejected. The authors should probably verify this with a statistical test cause at the moment their claim is unsupported. Moreover, why Figure 3c does not contain the same models as Figure 3a (e.g., DIAL appears to be missing)?\n\n\n",

            "review": "# overview\nThis paper focuses on multi-agent reinforcement learning tasks that require communication between the agents, and further presupposes that the communication protocol is bandwidth constrained and contentious so that a scheduling mechanism is necessary.  To address this they introduce a new learned weighting scheme based scheduler and distributed actor, centralized critic based architecture which is evaluated on a couple of communication driven multi-agent tasks.\n\nThe two evaluation tasks had their bandwidth artificially constrained, and SchedNet time to convergence was shown to fall somewhere between having no communication and full communication, and somewhat better than a purely round-robin based scheduling scheme, which doesn't seem particularly informative.  From this it is difficult to assess the significance of the contributions.\n\n# pros\n* communication in multi-agent scenarios is an important aspect to consider, and this work shines a spotlight on scenarios in which bandwidth is constrained.\n* general presentation fairly clear and easy to read\n\n# cons\n* Would have been more impactful to focus experiments on real-world scenarios in which bandwidth is constrained and naturally contentious\n\n# other comments\n* pg. 2 related work, suspect you meant to call out Foerster et al 2017b in second reference not Foerster et al 2017a twice.",
