        "metareview": "The paper considers the problem of incorporating human physiological feedback into an autonomous driving system, where minimization of a predicted arousal response is used as an additional source of reward signal, with the intuition that this could be used as a proxy for training a policy that is risk-averse.\n \nReviewers were generally positive about the novelty and relevance of the approach but had methodological concerns. In particular, concerns about the weighting of the intrinsic vs. extrinsic reward (why under different settings the optimal tradeoff parameter was different, how this affects the optimal policy if the influence of the intrinsic reward is not decreased with time). Additional baseline experiments were requested and performed, and the paper was modified to significantly incorporate other feedback such as drawing connections to imitation learning. A title change was proposed and accepted to reflect the focus on the application of risk aversion (I'd ask that the authors update the paper OpenReview metadata to reflect this).\n\nAt a high level, I believe this is an original and interesting contribution to the literature. I have not heard from two of three reviewers regarding whether their concerns were addressed, but given that their concerns appear to me to have been addressed (and their initial scores indicated that the work met the bar for acceptance, if only marginally), I am inclined to recommend acceptance.",

            "review": "Summary:\nThis submission proposes a reinforcement learning framework based on human emotional reaction in the context of autonomous driving. This relies on defining a reward function as the convex combination of an extrinsic (goal oriented) reward, and an intrinsic reward. This later reward is learnt from experiments with humans performing the task in a virtual environment, for which emotional response is quantified as blood volume pulse wave (BVP). The authors show that including this intrinsic reward lead to a better performance of a deep Q networks, with respect to using the extrinsic reward only. \nEvaluation:\nOverall the proposed idea is interesting, and the use of human experiments to improve a reinforcement learning algorithm offers interesting perspectives. The weakness of the paper in my opinion is the statistical analysis of the results, the lack of in depth evaluation of the extrinsic reward prediction and the rather poor baseline comparison.\nDetailed comments:\n1.\tStatistical analysis\nThe significance of the results should be assessed with statistical methods in the following results:\nSection 4.1: Please provide and assessment of the significance of the testing loss of the prediction. For example, one could repetitively shuffle blocks of the target time series and quantify the RMSE obtained by the trained algorithm to build an H0 statistic of random prediction.\nSection 4.2: the sentence “improves significantly when lambda is either non-zero or not equal to 1” does not seem valid to me and such claim should in any case be properly evaluated statistically (including correction for multiple comparison etc…).\nError bars: please provide a clear description in the figure caption of what the error bars represent. Ideally in case of small samples, box plots would be more appropriate.\n2.\tTime lags in BVP\nIt would be interesting to know (from the literature) the typical latency of BVP responses to averse stimuli (and possible the latency of the various mechanisms, e.g. brain response, in the chain from stimuli to BVP). Moreover, as latency is likely a critical factor in anticipating danger before it is too late, it would important to know how the prediction accuracy evolves when learning to predict at different time lags forward in time, and how such level of anticipation influence the performance of the Q-network.\n3.\tPoor baseline comparison\nThe comparison to reward shaping in section 4.4 is not very convincing. One can imagine that what counts is not the absolute distance to a wall, but the distance to a wall in the driving direction, within a given solid angle. As a consequence, a better heuristic baseline could be used. \nMoreover, it is unclear whether the approaches should be compared with the same lambda: the authors need to provide evidence that the statistics (mean and possibly variance) of the chosen heuristic is match to the original intrinsic reward, otherwise it is obvious that the lambda should be adapted.\n4.\tBetter analysis of figure 5-6(Minor)\nI find figure 5-6 very interesting and I would suggest that the authors fully comment on these results. E.g. : (1) why the middle plot of Fig. 6 mostly flat, and why such differences between each curve from the beginning of the training. (2) Why the goal oriented task leads to different optimal lambda, is this just a normalization issue?\n",

            "title": "An interesting application of RL, but scientifically sloppy",
            "review": "Starting from the hypothesis that humans have evolved basic autonomic visceral responses that influence decision making in a meaningful way and that these are at work in driving a car, the authors propose to use such signals within the RL framework. This is accomplished by augmenting the RL reward function with a model learned directly from human nervous system responses. This leads to a \nconvex combination of extrinsic rewards and visceral responses, with the goal to maximize extrinsic rewards and minimizing the physiological arousal response. The authors first show that they can train a CNN to predict systolic peaks from the pulse waveform based on the input images. The output of this network is then used with parametrically altered weightings in combination with the task related reward to evaluate performance on different driving tasks. The authors show that for different weightings performance on a number of driving tasks performance as measured by the collected extrinsic rewards is better.\n\nOverall, this is an interesting application of RL. It is OK to be inspired by biology, neuroscience, or psychology, but further reaching claims or interpretations of results in these fields need to be chosen carefully. The discussion of neuroscience and psychology are only partially convincing, e.g. there is extensive evidence that autonomic responses are highly dependent on cognition and not just decisions dependent on visceral, autonomic responses of the SNS. Currently, the manuscript is rather loosely switching between inspirations, imprecise claims, and metaphorical implementations with relation to neuroscience. The authors are encouraged to relate their work to some of the multi-criteria and structural credit assignment literature in RL, given the convex combination of rewards.  It may also be important to relate this work to imitation learning, given that the physiological measurements certainly also reflects states and actions by the human agents. While one indication for the reasons of higher extrinsic rewards with the augmented system is mentioned by the authors, namely that the autonomic signal is continuous and while the extrinsic rewards are sparse is convincing, it is not at all clear, why the augmented system performs better as shown in figure 5. \n",

            "review": "The method proposes to use physiological signals to improve performance of reinforcement learning algorithms. By measuring heart pulse amplitude the authors build an intrinsic reward function that is less sparse that the extrinsic one. It helps to be risk averse and allows getting better performances than the vanilla RL algorithm on a car-driving task. \n\nI found the paper well written and the idea is quite nice. I like the idea that risk aversion is processed as a data-driven problem and not as an optimisation problem or using heuristics. I think this general idea could be pushed further in other cases (like encourage fun, surprise, happiness etc. ). \n\nThere are some issues with this paper yet. First, modifying the reward function also modifies the optimal policy. In the specific case of car driving, it may not be bad to modify the policy so that it makes passenger less stressed but in general, it is not good. This is why most of works based on intrinsic motivation also schedule the lambda parameter to decrease with time. This is not something explored in this paper. Also, this work is well suited to the car-driving scenario because stress is closely related to risk and accident. But it may not work with other applications. I would thus suggest that the title of the paper reflects the specific case of risk aversion. ",
