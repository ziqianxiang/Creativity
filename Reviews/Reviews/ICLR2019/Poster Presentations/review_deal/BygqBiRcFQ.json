            "review": "The paper introduces scattering transforms on graphs by adopting diffusion wavelet constructions, and gives an extension of the scattering transforms to non-Euclidean domains. The main result consists of a stability analysis of the non-adaptive representation under deformation of the underlying graph metric, also defined in terms of graph diffusion.\n\nPros: \n\nThe study addresses the important problem of representation stability of non-Euclidean CNNs, which is a timely topic. The theoretical analysis builds an interesting connection between the diffusion graph geometry and the analysis of deep networks.\n\nCons: \n\n- It is unclear what type of graph is the primary consideration, either (a) expander/small-world with large spectral gap, e.g. social network, or (b) irregular mesh embedded in a Euclidean space or on an intrinsic manifold - as originally considered in diffusion wavelet, and in the Euclidean CNN/scattering transform theory - which often fails to present a spectral gap. The formula suggests (b) while the analysis and experiments point to (a). A coverage of both cases is unlikely. \n\n- The deformation considered is proposed in terms of the graph metric perturbation, which appears to lack sufficient motivation. This is not apparent from the experimental results (How is the x-axis of plots in Figure 1 related to \"perturbation\"?). Will such deformation reduce to that as being considered for irregular meshes in computer vision applications e.g. in [1]? The proposed model would be more convincing if the class of \"covered deformations\" can be clarified and the relevance to practices of non-Euclidean CNNs can be better addressed.\n\n- The experimental section lacks performance and comparison in a controlled environment, e.g., on synthetic data with more samples to show statistical significance. There also appears to be a gap between theory and experiment: can the dependence on spectral gap be empirically supported, even only qualitatively, e.g., by a comparison on small world graph v.s. others?\n\nOverall, the recommendation is still in favor of acceptance. Finally, the reviewer would like to raise the following questions:\n\n- As the result is presented as an extension of the Euclidean scattering transform, will the stability result recover the traditional one in Mallat et al. when the underlying graph is a regular grid (though the definition of deformation differs in appearance)?\n\n- What about the computational efficiency, scalability and storage cost of the algorithm? It would also clarify the computational procedure by providing an algorithm box or release of code. However, assuming that the focus of the paper is on theory, computation is a relatively minor point.\n\n[1] Boscaini, D., Masci, J., Rodolà, E., & Bronstein, M. (2016).

            "review": "The paper presents in interesting and new analysis of stability of scattering transforms on graphs, when the domain (graph) is perturbed by deformations. It combines key ingredients of scattering transforms (extended here to graphs through graph diffusion wavelets), deformation of graphs (based on graph diffusion distances) and a theoretical stability analysis. Similarly to the Euclidian domain, it is shown that linear filters cannot provide representations that are simultaneously rich and stable. \n\nGenerally, the paper is pretty complete, interesting and sufficiently well presented. One might wonder if the choice of the diffusion framework for both the representation construction, and the deformation analysis, is a simplistic choice, and how similar ideas could extend to different domain deformation for example. The experiments and comparisons are also very minimal, and hard to interpret. Comparing things only with GFT and SVM is probability a 'easy' choice, with the advent of a plethora of new graph convnets architectures (GFT is probably not a 'graph baseline', as mentioned in the conclusion). \n\nThis is however an interesting work, that will likely generate exciting discussions at ICLR.

            "review": "The paper introduces an adaptation of the Scattering transform to signals defined on graphs\nby relying on multi-scale diffusion wavelets, and studies a notion of stability of this representation\nwith respect to changes in the graph structure with an appropriate diffusion metric.\n\nThe notion of stability in convolutional networks is an important one, and the proposed notion of stability\nwith respect to diffusion distances seems like an interesting and relevant way to extend this to signals on graphs.\nWith this goal in mind, the authors introduce a scattering transform on graphs by relying on diffusion wavelets,\nand provide an appropriate study of stability, which seems to highlight relevant properties of the graphs.\nThe proposed representation seems to provide benefits compared to the previous work of Zou & Lerman,\nparticularly regarding computational efficiency, as well as stability with respect to a metric that is perhaps more\nuseful, though there is a dependence on the graph topology through the spectral gaps.\nIn addition, the experiments on author attribution and source localization suggest that the\nresulting representation remains discriminative, in addition to providing stability to changes in graph structure.\n\nI find that these contributions provide an interesting advance in theoretical understanding of graph convolutional networks\nfrom a stability perspective, in addition to introducing a useful non-learned representation,\nand am thus in favor of acceptance.\n\nNevertheless, some parts of paper would benefit from further discussions and more clarity:\n\n- other than empirically, one aspect that's missing compared to the original study of the scattering transform is energy preservation. The authors could at least provide a discussion of whether such a property can be obtained here as well (does it depend on the spectral gap through C(beta)?)\n\n- what is the role of the spectral gap in the stability bounds? is this a drawback of the diffusion metric / choice of wavelets?\n\n- Section 3.2 suggests that metric stability is a good way to characterize stability, by seeing deformations in Euclidian domains as a change to the ground metric. Yet, in Euclidian scattering, the same representation is applied to a deformed signal and the original signal, and stability is measured with the Euclidian metric.\nCan the link be made more precise, by explaining what a deformation of a signal would be on a graph, or by applying arguments from the proposed construction to the Euclidian case?\n\n- the paper is heavy on terminology from wavelets and harmonic analysis, a more detailed presentation of diffusion wavelets and related concepts such as localization would be beneficial. Also, it seems like the chosen wavelets in the construction favor spatial over frequential localization - is this due to a trade-off? if so, can it be avoided?\n\n\nSome more detailed comments:\n- Section 2, 'generally far weaker': what is meant by 'weaker'?\n- Section 3.3:\n  * 'calculus on T': T is used before being defined\n  * clarify what norm is used (I assume operator norm?)\n  * 'defines a distance', 'stronger than .. GH': this should probably be justified\n- Section 4:\n  * 'optimal spatial localization', 'temporal difference', 'favoring spatial over frequential localization': these could be clarified\n  * 'amplify the signal': what does this mean?\n  * the sentence about the choice of the appropriate J is not clear and should be further clarified\n- Section 5.1:\n  * the sentence about the choice pi/pi* = 1 should be clarified. Also, where is this assumption used?\n  * epsilon_psi, epsilon_U should be defined\n  * 'given that [..] by definition': this doesn't seem to be defined elsewhere\n  * (16): isn't a factor m missing in the first term?",
