This is a major topic of research in representation learning for NLP, so to see something genuinely original work well is significant. All three reviewers were impressed by the breadth of the experiments and by the results, and this will clearly be among the more ambitious papers presented at this conference.\n\nIn preparing a final version of this paper, though, I'd urge the authors to put serious further effort into the writing and presentation. All three reviewers had concerns about confusing or misleading passages, including the title and the discussion of the performance of tree-structured models so far.",

            "review": "Quality\n - Pro:\n   o This paper was in general a quality effort. It had a thorough bibliography of both older and recent relevant research contributions\n   o Providing useful, well done experimental results on four tasks was also a sign of this good thoroughness\n - Con: none observed\n\nClarity\n - Pro:\n   o The paper was generally well-written and clear. Results were clearly presented.\n - Con:\n   o Notwithstanding the half page of explanation of the intuition behind the new ON-LSTM update rules (top of p.5), it wasn't really enough for my old brain to get a good sense of what was going on – though I'm sure younger, smarter people will have made more sense of it. :) It would really help to try to provide more intuition and understanding here. Things that would probably really help include a worked example and diagrams.\n   o There were minor English/copyediting problems, but nothing that interfered with understanding. E.g., \"monotonously\" on p.4 should be \"monotonically\" (twice).\n\nOriginality\n - Pro\n   o This was REALLY NEAT! This paper had a real, clear, different idea that appeared interesting and promising. That puts it into the top half of accepted papers right there.\n   o The basic idea of the different update time scales, done flexibly, controlled by the master forget/input gates seemed original, flexible, and good.\n - Con: Nothing really observed; there are clearly a bunch of slightly related ideas, well referenced in this paper.\n\nSignificance\n - Pro\n   o If this idea pans out well, it would be a really interesting new structural prior to add to the somewhat impoverished vocabulary of successful techniques for building deep learning systems.\n   o Has an original, promising approach. That has the opportunity for impact and significance.\n - Con:\n   o The results so far are interesting, and in places promising, but not so clearly good that this idea doesn't need further evaluation of its usefulness.\n   o All the results presented are on small datasets (Penn Treebank WSJ (1 million words) size or smaller). What are the prospects on bigger datasets?  It looks like in principle this shouldn't be a big obstacle – except for not having a highly tuned CuDNN implementation, it looks like this should basically be fairly efficient like an LSTM and not hard to scale like, e.g., an RNNG.\n\nOther comments:\n - Some of the wording on page 1 seemed strange to me. Natural language has a linear overt form as spoken and (hence) written. It's really not that the sequential form is just how people conventionally \"present\" it. That is, it's not akin to a chemical compound which is really 3 dimensional but commonly \"presented\" by chemists in a convenient sequential notation.\n - p.2 2nd paragraph: Don't RNNs \"explicitly impose a chain structure\" not \"implicitly\"?!?\n - I wasn't sure I was sold on the name \"Ordered Neurons\". I'm not sure I have the perfect answer here, but it feels more like \"multi-timescale units\" is what is going on.\n - The LM results look good.\n - Because of all the different datasets, etc. it was a little hard to call the grammar induction results, but they at least look competently strong.\n - The stronger results on long dependencies in targeted syntactic evaluation look promising, but maybe you need a bigger hidden size so you can also do as well on short dependencies?\n - The logical inference results were promising – they seem to suggest that you capture some but not all of the value of explicit tree structure (a TreeLSTM) on a task like this.\n - The tree structures in Appendix A look promisingly good.\n",

            "review": "The paper proposes a new RNN unit: ON-LSTM. The idea is to explicitly integrates the latent tree structure into recurrent models. Experiments are conducted to evaluate performances on four different tasks: language modeling, unsupervised parsing, targeted syntactic evaluation, and logical inference. Good results on unsupervised parsing show that the model learns something close to human judgments of the sentence parses.\n\nThe paper is clearly written, and the experiments seem planned well.\nThe language modeling results are not state-of-the-art, but the unsupervised parsing results of layer 2 are quite impressive. The analyses are reasonable.\n\nOverall, the paper seems worthy of being accepted.",

            "title": "Promising approach for adding a hierarchical inductive bias to LSTMs",
            "review": "Language is hierarchically structured: smaller units (e.g., noun phrases) are nested within larger units (e.g., clauses). This is a strict hierarchy: when a larger constituent ends, all of the smaller constituents that are nested within it must also be closed. While the different units of an LSTM can learn to track information at different time scales, the standard architecture does not impose this sort of strict hierarchy. This paper proposes to add this constraint to the system by ordering the units; a vector of \"master\" input and forget gates ensures that when a given unit is reset all of the units that follow it in the ordering are also reset.\n\nStrengths:\n* The paper introduces an elegant way of adding a hierarchical inductive bias; the intuition behind this idea is explained clearly.\n* The evaluation tasks are very sensible. It's good that the model is shown to obtain good perplexity and slightly improve over an LSTM baseline; it's not the state of the art, but that's not the point of the paper (in fact, I would emphasize that even more than the authors do). The unsupervised parse evaluation (Table 2) is the heart of the paper, in my opinion (and should probably be emphasized more) -- the results from the second layer are quite impressive.\n* The (mildly) better performance than LSTMs on long-distance dependencies, and (mildly) worse performance on local dependencies, in the Marvin & Linzen dataset, is interesting (and merits additional analysis).\n\nWeaknesses:\n* The discussion of the motivation for unsupervised structure induction in the introduction is somewhat confused. I am not sure that neural networks with latent syntactic structures can really address the seemingly very fundamental question mentioned in the first paragraph (whether syntax is related to \"an underlying mechanism of human cognition\") - I would suggest eliminating this part. At the same time, the authors might want to add another motivation for studying architectures that discover latent structure (as opposed to being given that structure) - this setting corresponds more closely to human language acquisition, where children aren't given annotated parse trees.\n* The authors discuss hierarchy in terms of syntactic structure alone, but it would seem to me that the hierarchy that the LSTM is inducing could just as well include topic shifts, speech acts and others, especially if the network is trained across sentences.\n* There is limited analysis of the model. Why does the second layer show better unsupervised parsing performance than the third layer? (Could this be related to syntactic vs. semantic/discourse units I mention in the previous bullet?) Why is the model better at ADJP boundaries than NP boundaries? It would have been more useful to report less experiments but analyze the results of each experiment in greater depth.\n* In this vein, I am not sure it's useful to include WSJ10 in Table 2, which is busy as it is. These sentences are clearly too easy, as the right branching baseline shows, and require additional POS tagging.\n* I found it difficult to read Figure A.2: could you help us understand what we should take away from it? \n* It is not entirely clear why the model needs both unit-specific forget/input gates and the \"master\" forget/input gates, and there is no discussion of this issue. Have you tried using only the \"master\" gates?\n\nMinor notes:\n* RNNGs are described as having an explicit bias to model syntactic structure; this is an arguably confusing use of the word \"bias\", in that the architecture has a hard constraint enforcing syntactic structures (bias implies a soft constraint).\n* There are some language issues: agreement errors (e.g. \"have\" in the sentence that starts with \"Developing\" in the introduction), typos (\"A order should exist\", \"co-occurance\"), determiner issues (\"values in [the] master forget gate\", \"when the overlap exists\") - I would suggest going through and copy editing the paper.\n* \"cummax\" seems like a better choice of name for cumulative maximum than \"cumax\".\n* It may be helpful to remind the reader of the update equation for c_t in a standard LSTM.\n* Did the language model have 1150 units in each layer or in total? Why did you use exactly three layers? Did you try one, two and four?\n* It's not clear if the results in Table 2 reflect the best seed out of five (as the title of the column \"max\" indicates) or the average (as the caption says).\n",
