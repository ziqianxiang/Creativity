This work focusses on standardizing non systematic names (for example Asprin to 2-Acetoxybenzoic acid). \n\nThe authors approach this as a machine translation problem. They create a parallel corpus of non-systematic and systematic names and build a seq2seq model for accomplishing this task. The authors report accuracy and BLEU score for the translation task.\n\nMy main concern with this work is novelty. It seems like this is a straightforward application of an existing model for this task. Also it is not clear why BLEU score is an appropriate metric for this task. Is it okay for downstream applications to have the systematic name partially right?\n\nOverall, I think this paper does not present substantially new ideas to merit publication.",

            "review": "Pros: This seems like very competent and important work in an under-served area: Doing the mapping (or \"entity linking\") of chemical names to their standardized systematic forms. It's not my area, but I was frankly surprised when the paper said there was only one relevant prior piece of work, but having searched for a few minutes on Google Scholar, I'm at least inclined to believe that the authors are (approximately) right on that one. (This stands in stark contradistinction to the large quantity of biomedical entity recognition and linking work.) So, it's valuable to have work in this area, and the approach and application are sensible. In one sense, this gives the work significance and originality (as to domain). The paper is also clearly written, and certainly sufficiently accessible to an ML reader.\n\nCons: Unfortunately, though, I just don't think this qualifies for acceptance at ICLR. It's application of known techniques, and lacks any ML novelty or sufficient ML interest. It would only be appropriate for an \"ML applications\" track, which ICLR does not have. And while its performance is _way_ better than that of the only previous work on the topic that they know, accuracy of mapping non-systematic chemical terms (54.04%) is still low enough that this technique doesn't seem ready for prime time. \n\nOther comments: In table 5, you show that a prior pipeline stage of spelling correction is definitely useful in your system (table 5). And yet, given the power of deep learning seq2seq transductions, and the potential to use them for spelling correction, one might wonder whether this prior step of spelling correction is really necessary. It might be interesting to explore further where it helps and whether the gains of spelling correction might be obtainable in other ways such as using data augmentation (such as spelling error insertion) in the seq2seq training data. The Golebiewski bib entry is lacking any information as to where it is published, which seems especially bad for the key citation to prior work of the whole paper. In general, the bibliography has issues: non-ASCII characters have been lost (you either need to LaTeX-escape them or to load a package like utf8, and capitalization of acronyms, etc. should be improved with curly braces.",

            "review": "This work presents a method to translate non-systematic names of chemical compounds into their systematic equivalents. Beyond that, a corpus of systematic and non-systematic chemical names is introduced that were extracted from chemistry and manually labelled.\n\nThe paper is well-structured and the authors introduce the problem setting very nicely to a machine learning audience, explain the challenges and motivate the architecture of their model. The model is a combination of tested approaches such as a spelling error correction, a byte pair encoding tokenizer and a sequence-to-sequence model consisting of (Bi)LSTMs and attention mechanisms. \n\nThe evaluation appears solid. The model achieves significantly improved results on the proposed corpus, even though compared to a underwhelming baseline. The analysis could be improved by showing and explaining some examples of failed translation attempts. It would also be interesting to see how the failed attempts are distributed over the error types (spelling, order, common name, synonym). The authors suggest a scenario where non-systematic names are converted and checked against a database of systematic names. For this, it would be interesting to know whether there are cases where a non-systematic name was translated into the wrong (but valid) systematic name.\n\nConcluding, the paper presents an interesting application for machine translation, a new dataset and a method that successfully labels 50% of the given corpus.\n\nMinor issue: The color scale of Fig. 5 is hard to recognize due to low contrast.",
