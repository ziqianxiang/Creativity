My issues concern the empirical Rademacher complexity (ERC) and in particular the choice of the loss class for which the ERC is being computed. This  class is obviously data dependent, but the Reviewers concerns centers on the nature of its data dependence. It is not valid to define the classes by the Jacobian's norm on the input data, as this _structure_ over the space of classes is data dependent, which is not kosher. The reviewer was gently pushing the authors towards a very strong assumption... i'm guessing that the jacobian norm over all data sets was bounded by a particular constant. This seems like a whopping assumption. The fact that I can so easily read this concern off of the reviewer's comments and the authors seem to not be able to understand what the reviewer is getting at, concerns me.\n\nBesides this concern, it seems that this paper has undergone a rather significant revision. I'm not convinced the new version has been properly reviewed. For a theory paper, I'm concerned about letting work through that's not properly vetted, and I'm really not certain this has been. I suggest the authors consider sending it to COLT.",

            "review": "The paper provides a generalization bound for multi-layered deep neural networks in terms of dimensions rather than norms. The bound is derived by controlling Rademacher complexity of the Ramp loss under the Lipschitzness of the network as a parametric function in Depth * Width ^2 number of parameters, and then using standard L-2 covering and Dudley Integral. They extend this technique for CNNs, Resnets, Hyper-spherical Networks, etc and provide specialized bounds for each case. In the end, the authors provide comparisons to the existing bounds. \n\nAlthough intended, the bound in Theorem-1 depends on the number of parameters and hold only if m > d * (p^2) = number of parameters (from the last line of proof of Lemma 3, we need \\beta < \\alpha and thus m > h). Such bounds are already know in the literature (see Anthony and Bartlett, 1999). Adaptive (completely norm dependent, like Bartlett et. al. 2017) bounds will be better than explicit dimension dependent bounds. The comparison in Figure-1 which suggest their bound to be better is unfair because they are comparing their specialized bounds for CNN to generic bounds for standard feedforward networks. Same for comparison in Table-2. \n\nIt was already established in Theorem 3.4 (Bartlett et al. 2017) that spectral norms are necessary for any generalization bounds for Deep Neural Networks, thus voiding the claims made in the paper (and discussion) about the importance of spectral norms. \n\nTypos / Errors : \n1. Statement of Lemma 2 does not contain the spectral norms terms. \n2. The third equation in Page 13 should be K <= \\sqrt{pD} max B_{d, 2}; and this changes the bound further. \n\nThe paper introduces some new techniques on mathematical analysis of specialized neural networks.

The proof follows the setting of Bartlett et al. 2017 with new development on the Lipschitz properties of neural networks.\n\nPros:\n1. The paper provides a solid improvement over previous bounds on generalization error.\n2. The presentation of the result and proofs is clear and easy to follow.\n3. It does case studies specially on widely used network structures CNN, ResNet, etc.\n\nCon:\n1. It is not clear whether the bound is vacuous or not, as discussed in Arora et al. 2018.  If it is vacuous, it is hard to justify the claims that given the generalization error, which is vacuous for all bounds, the paper's bound allows the choices of larger dimensions of parameters and larger spectral norms of weight matrices.\n2.  The L_w has the factor \"products of B_{d,2}s\" which, however, does not show up in the final generalization bound (The equation right above Appendix B). This products may introduce an additional $D$ under sqrt changing D to D^2 under the sqrt, which changes the order. The authors should give some explanation on this.\n\n3. Is the assumption on the orthogonal and normalized filters in CNN a must thing for the argument or just for convenience of the presentation? The paper should be clearer about this point.\n\n4. The RHS of the equation  in Lemma 2 misses terms related with B_{d,2}.\n5. Typos: Find one typo in Page 3  \"deﬁed as\"\n",

I have increased my rating to 7.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThis paper proposes a generalization error bound for DNNs (and their generalizations) based on the depth and width of the networks, as well as the spectral norm of weight matrices. The proposed work is shown to provide a tighter generalization error bounds compared with a few existing literatures. \n\nPros: This paper makes theoretical contributions to the understanding of DNNs. This is an important but difficult task. As a theoretical paper, this one is relatively easy to follow. \n\nCons: In spite of its theoretical contributions, this paper has a few major issues. \n\nQ1: This paper fails to fairly compare with the most recent work, Arora et al. (2018), Zhou and Feng (2018). For instance, Arora et al. (2018) uses error-resilience parameters instead of the norms of weight matrices to obtain a better generalization error. The authors claim that the error-resilience parameters are less interpretable than the norms of weight matrices. This claim could be subjective and is not convincing. \n\nQ2: The error bounds of Bartlett et al. (2017), Neyshabur et al. (2017) could be improved for low-rank weight matrices, in which case the proposed Theorem 1 is tighter only if $p \\le D^2$. This holds only when DNN is very deep. Can theorem 1 be improved by similarly considering the low-rankness of weight matrices?\n\nQ3: In Corollary 2, the error bound for CNN, the authors assume that the filters are orthogonal with unit norm. Can the authors provide some justification on the orthogonal filters? In addition, Zhou and Feng (2018) have achieved similar bound for CNN. Can the authors provide some justification why this latest result is not included in Table 2? \n\n",
