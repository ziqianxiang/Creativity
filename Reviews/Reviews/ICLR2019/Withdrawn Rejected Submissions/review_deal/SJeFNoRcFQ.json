The authors provide both empirical and theoretical results that aim to show that the empirical spectral density of weights of DNN captures the implicit regularization phenomenon. However, the results are far from rigorous theory and it is not clear how recent results in MP theory yields the statements made in the paper. \n\n\nDetailed comments:\n\n1. The empirical studies seem interesting. It seems that two kinds of results are shown. The first one is that ESD fits perfectly for small models, and the second one is that deep models fit heavy-tailed random matrices class. It would be interesting to see more details about how these models are trained, as training greatly affects the value of the weights.\n\n2. Theoretical results are not clearly stated. In section 2, the authors introduce the basics of MP theory. However, it is not clear how to derive the theory in this paper based on the MP theory. It seems that the main theory is the \"5+1 phases of training\". The definition of these 6 phases is not even explicitly given in this paper. Moreover, the theory of all these phases seems to depend on equation (3) , but there are no lemmas or propositions that gives a rigourious theoretical guarantee.",

            "review": "The paper analyzes the empirical spectral density of DNN layher matrices and compares them with the traditionally-regularized statistical models, and develop a theory to identify 5+1 phases of training based on it. The results with different batch sizes illustrate the Generalization Gap pheneomena, and explains it as being causes by implicit self-regularization.\n\nHowever, the paper seems a little bit handwavy to me, without any serious theoretical justification. For example, why are \\mu=2 and 4 chosen as the threshold between weakly/moderately/very heavy-tailed? In addition, the paper is build upon o the 5+1 model as in Figure 2 and the graphical comparison between the empirical ESD and the expected ESD of the five models in Table 1, and they lack any mathematical/rigorous definition---see table 2. The simulations are performs over a particular data set and a particular setting, and I wonder if the observations would be different for a different data set and a different setting. \n\nAs a result, it may give some important intuition, but the content is not sufficiently rigorous to my knowledge.\n",

The authors propose an analysis which offers a fresh view to this problem. This view has been articulated very well, and is based on sound mathematical arguments. \n\nOn the other hand, since there is no formal theorem to support the introduced assumptions, the authors have attempted to provide empirical evidence through experiments with standard DNN architectures and benchmark datasets. However, this is where the weakness of this paper lies: The provided empirical evidence, while nicely executed, is not enough to convince the critical reader. We need experiments with more diverse datasets and experimental setups. \n\nAlthough I accept the claim of the authors concerning the lack of space, they could also trim the Introduction so as to free up some space, as well as provide an indefinite number of extra supporting evidence in the form of Supplementary Material/Appendices. \n\n\n",
