            "review": "1) Motivation of the problem is not very clear: It seems like the aim is classify impulse noise types and if they originate from the top, bottom or same floor. What is not clear, however, is the usefulness of collecting the test and train data from the same building. Shouldn't the test and train data be from mutually exclusive buildings?\n2) It is also not clear whether the datasets were collected from one or many buildings\n3) The authors should also provide an intuitive explanation why the sounds from the three floors would sound different. And is this specific to a particular building or can be generalized across buildings? Would the size and contents of the rooms (e.g, carpets, furnitures) have an impact on the accuracy?",

            "review": "The paper applied convolution neural network for type/position classification tasks on an interesting audio dataset which recorded the impact noises of a building. Details description of the dataset is provided and experiment results with VGG16 are presented. All in all, while the application scenario is interesting, the novelty of the paper is rather mild. Using pretrain VGG for audio classification has already been proposed by several other papers.  Moreover, this paper may receive a much broader audience in acoustic journal/conference than in ICLR.\n\nSeveral improvements can be done for the papers. Firstly, an embedding layer or a transformation layer can be built for transforming the audio signals into “images”. It would be interesting to compare this type of structure versus directly using log-scaled Mel-spectrogram. Second, instead of using images to pre-train VGG network. How about using acoustic signals. What can be the gain or loss of the performance?  Third, more detail information about the adaptation layer can be provided. Fourth, about the metric used for position prediction, it would be nice to have a weighted accuracy with the consideration of position. \n",
