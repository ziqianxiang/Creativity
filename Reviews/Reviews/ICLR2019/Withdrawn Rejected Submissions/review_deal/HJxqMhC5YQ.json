        "metareview": "The authors present a system for end-to-end multi-lingual and multi-speaker speech recognition. The presented method is based on multiple prior works that propose end-to-end models for multi-lingual ASR and multi-speaker ASR; the work combines these techniques and shows that a single system can do both with minimal changes. \n\nThe main critique from the reviewers is that the paper lacks novelty. It builds heavily on existing work, and  does not make any enough contributions to be accepted at ICLR. Furthermore, training and evaluations are all on simulated test sets that are not very realistic. So it is unclear how well the techniques would generalize to real use-cases. For these reasons, the recommendation is to reject the paper.",

I am not sure of how useful the evaluation is, since this situation is not realistic. Also, currently it cannot test the real code-switching since the utterances are not related and not from the same speaker.\n- There are not enough analyses. E.g. it would be good to analyze what contributes to the gap between the single-speaker ASR system performance on the isolated speech and the multi-lingual multi-speaker ASR system on the mixed speech. How well does the proposed end-to-end framework perform compared to a two-step framework with speaker separation followed by multi-lingual single-speaker ASR?",

I don't see any contribution in this paper, other than explaining how to create an artificial (un-realistic) database of mixed speech in multiple languages, and then training a multi-speaker end-to-end speech recognition system on that database.\n",

Overall, the paper is quite clear written.\n- Strengthens:\n+ Experimental results show consistent improvements in speech recognition performance and language identification performance.\n\n- Weakness:\n+ I'm not sure whether the framework is novel. The authors have just mixed training data from several languages to train an end-to-end multi-speaker speech recognition system.\n+ I don't see the real motivation why the authors want to make the task harder than needed. The example provided in figure 1 is very rare in reality.\n+ The authors claimed that their system can recognise code-switching but actually randomly mixing data from different languages are not code-switching.\n+ In general, it would be better to have some more analyses showing what the system can do and why.",
