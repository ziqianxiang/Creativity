I agree that the very related work of Roy et al should be mentioned, even though it has not been published it has been on arxiv since May.\n\n- Ablation studies are only on smaller IWSLT datasets, confirming that the hints from an auto-regressive model are beneficial (whereas the main results are on WMT)\n\n-  I agree with R1 that the important modeling details (e.g., describing how the latent structure is generated) should not be described only in the appendix, esp given non-standard modeling choices.  R1 is concerned that a model which does not have any autoregressive components (i.e. not even for the latent state) may have trouble representing multiple modes.  I do find it surprising that the model with non-autoregressive latent state works well however I do not find this a sufficient ground for rejection on its own. However, emphasizing this point and discussing the implication in the paper makes a lot of sense, and should have been done.  As of now, it is downplayed. R1 is concerned that such model may be gaming BLEU: as BLEU is less sensitive to long-distance dependencies, they may get damaged for the model which does not have any autoregressive components.  Again, given the standards in the field, I do not think it is fair to require human evaluation, but I agree that including it would strengthen the paper and the arguments.\n\n\nOverall, I do believe that the paper is sufficiently interesting and should get published but I also believe that it needs further revisions / further experiments.\n\n\n",

Hidden output matching by incurring a penalty if the cosine distance between the representation differ according to a threshold. The authors state that this reduces same output word repetition which is common for NART models\n2. Reducing the KL divergence between the attention distribution of the teacher and the student model in the encoder-decoder attention part of the model.\n\nWe see experimental evidence from 3 tasks showing the effectiveness of this technique.\n\nThe strengths of this paper are the speedup improvements of using these techniques on the student model while also improving BLEU scores. \nThe paper is easy to read and the visualisations are useful.\n\nThe main issue with this paper is the delta contribution as compared to the NART model is Gu et. al. The 2 techniques, although simple, don't make up for technical novelty.\nIt would also be good to see more analysis on how much the word repetition reduces using these techniques quantitatively, and performance especially on longer length sequences.\n\nAnother issue is the comparison of latency measurements for decoding. The authors state that the hardware and the setting under which the latency measurements are done might be different as compared to previous numbers. Though still impressive speedup improvements, it somehow becomes fuzzy to understand the actual gains.",

Inference is much faster than for\nauto-regressive models, while BLEU scores are reasonably close.\n\nThe approach is simple, only necessitating two auxiliary loss functions during\ntraining, and rescoring for inference.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\nThe discussion of related work is deficient. Learning from hints is a variant\nof knowledge distillation (KD). Another form of KD, using the auto-regressive\nmodel output instead of the reference, was shown to be useful for non-autoregressive\nneural machine translation (Gu et al., 2017, already cited).

            "review": "This work proposes a non-autoregressive Neural Machine Translation model which the authors call NART, as opposed to an autoregressive model which is referred to as an ART model. The main idea behind this work is to leverage a well trained ART model to inform the hidden states and the word alignment of NART models. The joint distribution of the targets y given the inputs x, is factorized into two components as in previous works on non-autoregressive MT: an intermediate z which is first predicted from x, which captures the autoregressive part, while the prediction of y given z is non-autoregressive. This is the approach taken e.g., in Gu et al, Kaiser et al, Roy et al., and this also seems to be the approach of this work.  The authors argue that improving the expressiveness of z (as was done in Kaiser et al, Roy et al), is expensive and so the authors propose a simple formulation for z. In particular, z is a sequence of the same length as the targets, where the j^{th} entry z_j is a weighted sum of the embedding of the inputs x (the weights depend in a deterministic fashion on j) . Given this z, the model predicts the targets completely non-autoregressively. However, this by itself is not entirely sufficient, and so the authors also utilize \"hints\": 1) If the pairwise cosine similarity between two successive hidden states in the student  NART model is above a certain threshold, while the similarity is lower than another threshold in the ART model, then the NART model incurs a cost proportional to this similarity 2) A KL term is used to encourage the distribution of attention weights of the student ART model to match that of the teacher NART model. These two loss terms are used in different proportions (using additional hyperparameters) together with maximizing the likelihood term.\n\nQuality: The paper is not very well written and is often hard to follow in parts. Here are some examples of the writing that feel awkward:\n\n--  Consequently, people start to develop Non-AutoRegressive neural machine\nTranslation (NART) models to speed up the inference process (Gu et al., 2017; Kaiser et al., 2018;\nLee et al., 2018). \n\n-- In order to speed up to the inference process, a line of works begin to develop non-autoregressive\ntranslation models. \n\nOriginality: The idea of using an autoregressive teacher model to improve a non-autoregressive translation model has been used in Gu et al., Roy et al., where knowledge distillation is used. So knowledge distillation paper from Hinton et al., should be cited. Moreover, the authors have missed comparing their work to that of Roy et al. (https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.11063), which greatly improves on the work of Kaiser et al., and almost closes the gap between a non-autoregressive model and an autoregressive model (26.7 BLEU vs 27 BLEU on En-De) while being orders of magnitude faster. So it is not true that:\n\n-- \"While the NART models achieve significant speedup during inference (Gu et al., 2017), their accuracy\nis considerably lower than their ART counterpart.\"\n\n-- \"Non-autoregressive translation (NART) models have suffered from low-quality translation results\"\n\nSignificance: The work introduces the idea of using hints for non-autoregressive machine translation. However, I have a technical concern: It seems that the authors complain that previous works like Kaiser et al, Roy et al, use sophisticated submodules to help the expressiveness of z and this was the cause for slowness. However, the way the authors define z seems to have some problems:\n\n- z_j does not depend on z_1, ..., z_{j-1}, so where is the autoregressive dependencies being captured?\n- z_1, z_2, ..., z_{T_y} depends only on the length of y, and does not depend on y in any other way. Given x, predicting z is trivial and I don't see why that should help the model f(y | z, x) help at all? \n- Given such a trivial z, one can just assume that your model is completely factorial i.e. P(y|x) = \\prod_{i} P(y_i|x) since the intermediate z has no information on the y's except it's length.\n\nThis is quite suspicious to me, and it seems that if this works, then a completely factorial model should work as well if we only use the \"hints\" from the ART teacher model. This is a red flag to me, and I am finding this hard to believe.",
