            "review": "This paper proposes a search method for neural network architectures such that two (potentially) conflicting objectives: maximization of final performance and minimization of computational complexity can be pursued simultaneously. The motivation for the approach is that a principled multiobjective search procedure (NSGA-II) makes it unnecessary to manually find the right trade-off between two objectives, and simultaneously finds several solutions spanning the tradeoff. It is also capable of finding solutions from the concave regions of the Pareto-front. Multiobjective search for architectures has been explored in recent work, so the primary contribution of this paper is to show its utility in a more general and perhaps more powerful setting.\n\nThe paper is clearly written and is easy to understand, except that the parenthetical citations used appear to differ from the ICLR style and cause confusion. The authors delve into details of the approach though many aspects are from past work. I think that this makes the paper more self-contained and easy to understand, even if it makes the paper longer than the suggested length of 8 pages. I also found the comparisons and ablations shown in Figures 8 and 9 to be useful and informative. \n\nHowever, based on the presented results on the CIFAR-10 dataset (which can be compared to past work), I am not convinced of the utility of multiobjective optimisation for architecture search. There are a few reasons for this:\n\n1. The best architectures found by previous methods in the literature are already at a similar or better accuracy. It appears that NSGA-Net did not succeed in finding architectures that a) outperform past results with higher FLOPs, or b) match past results with fewer FLOPs. I understand that in principle, a benefit of NSGA-Net is that other solutions with lower accuracy and fewer FLOPs are also found simultaneously, but these models are not discussed or analysed much in detail. What precisely is the utility of the proposed method then? This consideration is also complicated by the next point.\n\n2. For the evaluation in the paper, the network with the lowest accuracy is extrapolated â€” the number of filters in each layer are increased and the network is retrained. Is this procedure justified in general? How to know the best increasing factor? \nSince lowering the computational cost is an objective of the search, changing the cost of an obtained solution does not seem principled.  Moreover, changing network sizes will affect any ordering of networks by accuracy since optimal hyperparameters for both optimization and regularization may change. In general, it is rather difficult to decouple hyperparameter search from architecture search.\n\n3. A baseline that is missing in the paper is hyperparameter search, which can often yield very good performance for a given architecture. Tuning regularization in particular is often crucial. Since NSGA-Net trains 1200 networks, a comparable search would consider a known architecture e.g. Densenet and allocate 200 trials each to 6 architectures of different FLOPS (or 100 each to 12 architectures). How effective is this simple procedure at obtaining a good tradeoff front?\n\nDue to these concerns, I am presently unconvinced by the results in this paper, though I think that in general multiobjective optimization of architectures should be a fruitful direction. \n\nMinor question: Figure 9(b) indicates that experiments were also conducted on the SVHN and MNIST datasets. Why are these results not reported?",

            "review": "\n- Summary\nThis paper proposes an evolutionary-based method for the multi-objective neural architecture search, where the proposed method aims at minimizing two objectives: an error metric and the number of FLOPS. The proposed method consists of an exploration step and an exploitation step. In the exploration step, architectures are sampled by using genetic operators such as the crossover and the mutation. In the exploitation step, architectures are generated by a Bayesian Network. The proposed method is evaluated on object classification and object alignment tasks.\n\n- Pros\n  - The performance of the proposed method is better than the existing multi-objective architecture search methods in the object classification task.\n  - The effect of each proposed technique is appropriately evaluated. \n\n- Cons\n  - The contribution of the proposed method is not clear to me. The proposed method is compared with the existing multi-objective methods in terms of classification accuracy, but if we focus on that point, the performance (i.e., error rate and FLOPs) of the proposed method is almost the same as those of the random search judging from Table 4. It would be better to compare the proposed method to the existing multi-objective methods in terms of classification accuracy and other objectives.\n  - This paper argues that the choice of the number of parameters is sub-optimal and ineffective in terms of computational complexity. Please provide more details about this point. For example, what is the drawbacks of the number of parameters, what is the advantages of FLOPs for multi-objective optimization?\n  - Please elaborate on the procedure and settings of the Bayesian network used in this paper.\n  - It would be better to provide discussions of recent neural architecture search methods solving the single-objective problem.\n",

            "title": "Poorly justified approach",
            "review": "After rebuttal, I adapted the score. See below for original review.\n--------------------------------------------\n\n\nThe authors implement a two-stage multi-objective optimization scheme to optimize neural network architectures with several conflicting goals.\nI can not accept the paper in its current form.\n\nIn short, I have the following main criticisms:\n1. use of crowding distance(CD) instead of hypervolume-contribution.\nCD is not consistent with the HV estimator, especially CD might remove solutions that have a large HV-contribution and thus HV will not increase monotonically. The effect is even visible in Figure 8c) as in iteration 22, HV is decreasing as crowding distance removes a good offspring. In short: Crowding distance should not be used as long as the number of objectives does not prohibit computing the HV-contribution.\n\n2. No good justification of BN. It is unclear to me why BN should be used instead of more iterations at stage 1. In 4.4 BN is only compared to the uniform initialization, but this comparison has no meaning given that we already have an optimized front that improved on the uniformly sampled distribution. To be honest, the samples shown from BN do not look very convincing as a lot of very poor architectures are created.\n\nA proper comparison would be comparing the 2-step approach with only the first step and the same budget. Then we could compare samples from both distributions (either sampling from the front using mutation/crossover or sampling from BN). Also we would have a fair comparison of the obtained fronts and HV-values.\n\n3. Ablation study cross-over\nI am not convinced by the results presented. The paper says this is a \"small scale\" study but does not give the number of iterations/samples. It is clear that in the setup of the mutation operator cross-over might help, simply because it can change many more connections in a single iteration than mutation alone, which is limited to max 1 change. Allowing up to two mutations and no crossover could already proof to be better (orsmaller size of offspring population, see below)\n\n\nSmaller concerns:\n\n1. The results suggest that the uniform distribution might not be tuned well, as it only covers the \"expensive\" networks but not the \"cheap\" networks. A better initialization scheme that covers the x-axis better might already show vastly different results. As the Flop-objective is cheap to compute and does not require simulation, one could expect to tune this offline before initialization.\n\n2. No handling of Noise.\nDuring optimization, the chosen starting point and SGD algorithm will introduce noise into the process. Thus, the final test accuracy will be noisy. As an elitist dominance scheme is used, one might easily end up with an architecture that has a large variance when trained, i.e. when performing a final training pass on the full dataset, the performance might be very different. Moreover, the algorithm might stop convergence towards the true pareto front as it is held back by noisy \"good\" results. This should be discussed in the paper\n\n3. A single-offspring approach might be better than sampling a full population (or offspring size in the order of parallel instances one can expend to run). 40 sounds excessive given that the sampling distribution is only improved through selection and given that the pareto front approximation appears to include less than 40 elements. This might also affect the results in the ablation study for cross-over: more iterations with reduced offspring size allows for more mutations of successful offspring.\n\n4. Some unclear or wrong wordings:\npage 4: \"As a consequence[...] the best solution encountered [...] will always be present in the final population. \" What do you consider \"best\" in a 2-objective problem? Do you mean: the best in each objective?\npage 6, footnote1: this is not true. even without crossover the selection operator ties the solutions together, an offspring has to beat any point in the population, not necessarily its direct parent.\n\n5.
