The reviewers feel this is an important contribution to the recent work on embedding graphs into non-Euclidean spaces, especially since this work focuses on multi-relational links, thus supporting knowledge graph completion. The results on WN11 and FB13 are also promising.\n\nThe reviewers and AC note the following potential weaknesses: (1) the primary concern is the low performance on the benchmarks, especially WN18 and FB15k, and not using the appropriate versions (WN18-RR and FB15k-237), (2) use of hyperbolic embedding for an entity shared across all relations, and (3) lack of discussion/visualization of the learned geometry.\n\nDuring the discussion phase, the authors clarified reviewer 1's concern regarding the difference in performance between HolE and ComplEx, along with providing a revision that addressed some of the clarity issues raised by reviewer 3. The authors also justified the lower performance due to (1) they are focusing on low-dimensionality setting, and (2) not all datasets will fit the space of the proposed model (like FB15k). However, reviewers 2 and 3 still maintain that the results provide insufficient evidence for the need for Riemannian spaces over Euclidean ones, especially for larger, and more realistic, knowledge graphs.\n\nThe reviewers and the AC agree that the paper should not be accepted in the current state.\n",

            "review": "The paper proposes a new approach to compute embeddings of multi-relational data such as knowledge graphs. For this purpose, the paper introduces a variant of TransE that operates on Riemannian manifolds, in particular, Euclidean, Spherical, and Hyperbolic space. This approach is motivated by the results of Nickel & Kiela (2017), who showed tha  Hyperbolic space can provide important advantages for embedding graphs with hierarchical structure.\n\nHyperbolic and Riemannian embeddings are a promising research area that fits well into ICLR. Extending hyperbolic, and more general, Riemannian embeddings to multi-relational data is an important aspect in this context, as it allows to extend such methods to new applications such as Knowledge Graph Completion. Overall, the paper is written well and mostly good to understand. However, I am concerned about multiple aspects in the current version:\n\n- What is the motivation for using this particular form of translation? In Riemannian manifolds, the analogue of vector addition and subtraction is typically taken as the exponential or logarithmic map (as expm and logm in Euclidean space are exactly vector addition and subtraction). For the spherical and hyperbolic manifold both maps have closed form expressions and are differentiable. It is therefore not clear to me what the advantage of the proposed approach is compared to these standard methods. In any case, it would be important to include them in the experimental results.\n\n- It is also not clear to me whether the benefits of hyperbolic embeddings translate into the setting that is proposed here. The advantage of hyperbolic embeddings is that they impose a hierarchical structure in the latent space. The method proposed in this paper uses then a single (hyperbolic) embedding of entities across all relation types. This implies that there should be a single consistent hierarchy that explains all the links in all relations. This seems unlikely and might explain some of the hyperbolic results. A more detailed discussion and motivation would be important here.\n\n- Regarding the experimental results: Why are the results for HolE and ComplEx so different? As [1,2] showed, both models are identical, and for that reason should get close to identical results. The large differences seem inconsistent with these results. Furthermore it seems that the results reported in this paper do not match previously reported results. What is the reason for these discrepancies?\n\n[1] Hayashi, K., and Shimbo, M. \"On the equivalence of holographic and complex embeddings for link prediction\", 2017.\n[2] Trouillon, T, and Nickel, M. \"Complex and Holographic Embeddings of Knowledge Graphs: A Comparison\", 2017.",

            "review": "In this paper, authors focus on the problem of efficiently embedding Knowledge Graphs in low-dimensional embedding spaces, a task where models are commonly evaluated via downstream link prediction and triple classification tasks. The proposed model - Riemannian TransE, based on TransE [Bordes et al. 2013] - maps entities to points in a non-Euclidean space, by minimising a loss based on the geodesic distance in such space. This paper is especially interesting, since extends previous approaches - such as Poincare embeddings - to the multi-relational setting. Results look promising on WN11 and FB13, but authors mention results on the more commonly used WN18 and FB15k are less accurate than those obtained by the baselines (without reporting them). It is worth mentioning that WN18 and FB15k were found to be solvable by very simple baselines (e.g. see [1]). Furthermore, authors do not report any finding on the geometry of the learned spaces.\n\nIntroduction - Wording is a bit weird sometimes, e.g. what does \"evaluating dense matrices or tensors\" mean?\nRelated Work - Likewise, this section was a bit hard to follow. I do not fully get why authors had to use terms like \"planet\", \"launcher\", \"satellite\" etc. for describing mappings between entities and points in a manifold, relations and points in another manifold, and the manifold where the geodesic distances between representations are calculated.\nWhat is the intuition behind this?\nTab. 1 does a great job at summarising existing scoring functions and their space complexity. However, it may be worth noticing that e.g. the inner product used by DistMult is not really a \"dissimilarity\" between two representations (but rather the opposite). Is the number of parameters the same for Riemannian TransE as for the other methods (including the extra \"l\" parameters)? If it isn't the comparison may be slightly unfair.\n\n[1] https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.01476",

            "review": "This paper presents a generalization of TransE to Riemannian manifolds. While this work falls into the class of interesting recent approaches for using non-Euclidean spaces for knowledge graph embeddings, I found it very hard to digest (e.g. the first paragraph in Section 3.3). Figure 3 and 4 confused me more than helping me to understand the method. Furthermore, current neural link prediction methods are usually evaluated on FB15k and WN18. In fact, often on the harder variants FB15k-237 and WN18RR. For FB15k and WN18, Riemannian TransE seems to underperform compared to baselines -- even for low embedding dimensions, so I have doubts how useful this method will be to the community and believe further experiments on FB15k-237 and WN18RR need to be carried out and the clarity of the paper, particularly the figures, needs to be improved. Lastly, I would be curious about how the different Riemannian TransE variants compare to TransE in terms of speed?\n\nUpdate: I thank the authors for their response and revision of the paper. To me, results on WN18RR and FB15k-237 are inconclusive w.r.t. to the choice of using Riemannian as opposed to Euclidean space. I therefore still believe this paper needs more work before acceptance.",
