The idea being that their approach may leverage commonality across domains to improve adaptation while maintaining domain specific parameters where needed. This idea and general approach is interesting and worth exploring. The authors' rebuttal and paper edits significantly improved the draft and clarified some details missing from the original presentation. \n\nThere is an ablation study showing that each part of the model contributes to the overall performance. However, the approach provides only modest improvements over comparative methods which were not designed to learn from multiple target domains. In addition, comparison against the latest approaches is missing so it is likely that the performance reported here is below state-of-the-art. \n\nOverall, given the modest experimental gains combined with incremental improvement over single source information theoretic methods, this paper is not yet ready for publication.",

            "review": "In this paper, the authors proposed a new domain adaptation setting for adaptation between single source but multiple target domains. To address the setting, the authors proposed a so-called information theoretic approach to disentangle shared and private features and meanwhile to take advantage of the relationship between multiple target domains. \n\nPros:\n- This paper conducts comprehensive empirical studies.\n\nCons:\n- The motivation for this new domain adaptation setting is not clear to me. In the real world, the domain adaptation between multiple source domains and single target domain is in desperate need, as like human beings an agent may gradually encounter many source domains which could altogether benefit a target domain. However, I do not think that the adaptation between single source and multiple targets is intuitively in need.\n- The proposed framework is quite similar to DSN, which limits this work's novelty. Though the authors take a large paragraph to illustrate the connections and differences between this work and DSN, I cannot be convinced. Especially during empirical study, the comparison is not fair. The adapted mp-DSN models multiple encoders for multiple target domains, while it is correct to extend DSN with a shared encoder for multiple target domains just like MDTA-ITA.\n- There are technical flaws. The authors claimed that this work is different from ELBO optimisation, but follows an information theoretical approach. Actually, the right way to optimise the proposed loss in Eqn. (1)(2) is exactly the ELBO. Instead, the authors replace the probability/distribution q(x|z) and q(d|z) with concrete terms, which is technically wrong. such concrete term ||x-F(z;\\phi)|| cannot represent a probability/distribution. \n- In the experiments for feature visualisation, I do not think such comparison with original features makes any sense. The features by DSN which also separates private from shared features  should be compared. \n- The presentation is in a quite poor quality, including many typos/grammatical errors. \n   - The most annoying is the inappropriate citations. Every citation should be included in a brace, e.g. \"the same underlying distribution Sun et al. (2016)\" -> \"the same underlying distribution (Sun et al. (2016))\". Please kindly refer to other submissions to ICLR 2019. \n   -  Typos: in the beginning of Section 2, \"without loss of generalizability\" -> \"without loss of generality\"; in the end of Page 3,  the last equation is not right, where p(y|z_s) should be q(y|z_s).\n   - The font in Table 2 is too small to read. \n",

            "review": "This paper investigates multi-target domain adaptation which is an unexplored domain adaptation scenario compared with adapting single/multiple source to single target. A mutual information-based loss is proposed to encourage part of the features to be domain-specific while the other part to be domain-invariant. Instead of optimizing the proposed loss which is intractable, this work proposes to use neural network to model the relative functions and optimize proposed lossâ€™ lower bound by SGD.\n\nMethod: \nThe proposed loss has an explanation from information theory, which is nice. However, the proposed loss is a combination of 4 different mutual information. The effectiveness of each one is unclear. An ablation study should be provided. \n\nClarity: The presentation should be improved, especially in the descriptions for experiments. \n- Typo: Section 4: TanH should be Tanh\n- Duplicated reference: Konstantinos Bousmalis, Nathan Silberman, David Dohan, Dumitru Erhan, and Dilip Krishnan.

I understand c-MTDA-ITA is to combine all the target domains into a single one and train it using MTDA-ITA. And s-MTDA-ITA is to train multiple MTDA-ITA separately, where each one corresponds to a source-target pair. But I am confused by the MTDA-ITA results in both table 1 and table 2. Could the authors provide some explanation for MTDA-ITA?\n\n- For the metric in digits adaptation, the standard metric is classification accuracy. The authors use mean classification accuracy. Is this the mean of classification accuracy of multiple runs? If so, authors should provide the standard deviation. If this is the average per-class accuracy, this is different from standard routine in ADDA, CORAL, etc.\n\nConcerns: \nThe effectiveness of MDTA-ITA, s-MDTA-ITA and c-MDTA-ITA are not convincing. From the experiments, it seems the c-MDTA-ITA cannot provide convincing superior performance compared to c-ADDA and c-DTN.",

It is interesting to explore such direction since in many real-world applications, applying the model to many different target domains are required.   \n\nIt is also noted that there is one very related work \"Multi-target Unsupervised Domain Adaptation without Exactly Shared Categories\" available online (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.00852.pdf).  It is desirable to have a discussion and comparison with them since they are doing Multi-target Unsupervised Domain Adaptation. In their method, the exact shared category is even not required. \n\nFor the algorithm part, authors basically adopt the information-theoretic approach to handle the proposed method. This part contribution is limited since the techniques involved are very common in the domain adaptation. \n\n",
