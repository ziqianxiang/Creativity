        "comment": "The reviews are of good quality. The responses by the authors are commendable, but ICLR is selective and reviewers still believe that the research would be better as two separate papers: one about the problem and solution from an ML perspective, and the other about the application to surgery. Papers that provide a new method in the context of a single application domain run the risk of making a contribution to neither, and of being evaluated by reviewers who are not experts in both."

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper proposed a modification of the VAE that was designed for handling ICU data for perioperative care. The new method specifically handles the entanglement of the latent variables in the traditional VAE, so it can provide interpretable representation of the data that also serves well the downstream prediction and regression tasks.\nThe authors conducted experiments on one publica dataset and two new real-world perioperative datasets. In all cases, the proposed methods are superior to the comparator methods. \n",
            "main_review": "The proposed method combines the idea of disentangled latent variables and identifying meaning of representation for the prediction task. It also provides a new estimation for the correlation between latent variables, which also showed superiority in the conducted experiments. There is novelty in the methodology, however, the marginal improvement of the proposed methods over the previously published methods may not be sufficient to justify its superiority.\nBesides that, I may have the following questions:\n1. The authors also suggested a new measure of correlations between the latent variables and  to use that instead of TC. The new correlation metric was compared with TC in the delirium dataset. Was this consistently observed in other datasets?\n2. There are two hyper parameters introduced in this method, but the authors did not mention the reasons for the choice of the hyper parameters. When we think about an end-to-end modelling process, the hyperparameter tuning and model selection process might also play a role in the evaluation of the method. Will the authors help to explain the choice of the hyperparameters?\n",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "To improve accuracy of prediction and interpretability on a task using high dimensional and noisy data, the authors proposed surgical VAE (sVAE). sVAE is prediction-guided with explicit expression of predicted outcome in the latent representation, and it disentangles the latent space so that it can be more interpretable. sVAE was evaluated using two private datasets and one public dataset, and showed its efficacy on both classification tasks and regression tasks.\n",
            "main_review": "1) Regarding reproducibility, an experiment using a public dataset is more important. Thus it would be better to have MIMIC-III dataset results in the main text rather than one of the private datasets.\n\n2) While the authors argue that this sVAE is specifically designed for high-dimensional and complex clinical data, there are many prediction tasks in various fields using such high-dimensional and complex, (and noisy) data. Thus the authors should at least discuss generalization of this approach.\n",
            "summary_of_the_review": "The authors introduced sVAE, a prediction-based, interpretable deep latent model designed for clinical prediction tasks. However, such tasks based on high-dimensional and complex data exist not only in surgery but also in a wide range of fields in the real world, thus generalization is important considering the backgrounds of ICML participants. If the authors aim to keep the scope within the clinical or surgical field, a more specific venue would be appropriate.",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes a representation learning framework for high-dimensional, complex clinical data. It is not clear to what extent this is specific to *surgery*, however. The related works section is appropriately structured, deep, and recent. Some of the text (e.g., around background) is needlessly simplistic. \n\nThe primary methodological contribution orbits around the function $g()$— the  disentangling function applied to the latent representation of an encoder. Naturally, there are many papers that disentangle latent representations (e.g., Yan et al 2016 (Attribute2image), Higgins et al 2017 (beta-VAE), Mathieu et al 2019), including various attempts at sequential encoding; some of this work is cited in Sec 2, and the efficient computation of the total correlation is presented as the key step to add and then overcome. The result is Eq 6 and SVD is subsequently used in the estimation/replacement of TC. While the rationale provided is _fine_, some claims made regarding the intuition for this step do not seem to be matched by the rationale/citations given, and it would have been advisable to dig into this substation theoretically, a bit more.",
            "main_review": "In addition to comments made in the Summary of the Paper section, some experimental issues exist. How the (severe) missing rate in the delerium data was handled is not expressed. It is good to include MIMIC-III, and the baselines are well chosen (although how they were optimized is also not expressed). Instead of choosing a single standard for all baselines, it would have been preferable to understand their strengths and weaknesses at different hyper-parameters (e.g., does one’s performance grow more or less quickly with more (or fewer) reduced features $d$? I.e., Table 3 but with all baselines). Gaussians are used w/o consideration, but this is as usual so it is not taken as a negative. Although sVAE clearly outperforms many baselines, the degree to which it’s close to smooth-VAE, especially considering (supposed?) variances would make a significance test, and some cross-validation, advisable.\n\nThe interpretability angle is interesting and appreciated, especially within the medical context. Not enough has been shown to warrant the mention of ‘trust’ in the conclusion, though. \n\nThere are a few textual issues, including grammar (e.g., “… we want our sVAE to … minimizes …”) but in general the text is well structured and constructed.",
            "summary_of_the_review": "Generally, there are no major concerns with regards to the empirical setup (nothing that was done appears incorrect or suggests incorrect results), except that more should have been done to validate the results. The technical contribution over the vast amount of other work on disentangling latent representations is clear but perhaps slight and therefore the applied angle seems to be emphasized (indeed, ‘surgery’ is even in the name of the model) but, apart from using some relevant datasets and showing some qualitative results, there is almost nothing about the applied context that seems to influence the design, nor the analysis of the results beyond the standard ML metrics.",
