        "comment": "This paper presents work on video scene segmentation.  The reviewers appreciated the introduction of a boundary-aware pre-training method.  However, concerns were raised regarding limited novelty, empirical effectiveness, and generic applicability.  The reviewers engaged in significant discussion based on the other reviews and authors' responses.  Based on these discussions the reviewers concluded that while the proposed method does have differences with respect to BSP, the overall contributions were not sufficient for inclusion in ICLR."

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper introduces a boundary-aware self-supervised learning framework for video scene segmentation. Based on the contrastive learning protocol, the authors employ DTW to generate dimidiate video segmentation from unlabeled video. Using these segments, the authors employ four loss functions to pre-train a backbone network.",
            "main_review": "My most concern is about pseudo-boundary discovery. As the rest loss functions are borrowed from current self-supervised loss functions. First question is: why only use one boundary in each video? This operation is not reasonable as the video may contain multiple scenes. Also, how to define the different scenes? For figure 4 (c), we can see the shots come from the truck inside, track outside and inside again. So, the generated pseudo-scene B is confused as it contains another scene. This task is totally different from action segmentation as action segmentation has clear boundaries in each video. In my opinion, without the so-called pseudo-boundary discovery, even video-level loss for self-supervised video representation, such as [1,2] can train a strong backbone for second stage training.\n[1] Self-supervised Co-training for Video Representation Learning, neurIps\n[2] Space-Time Correspondence as a Contrastive Random Walk,NeurIps\n\nMy second concern is about the experimental result. The proposed pre-training the main contribution of the whole paper with complex loss functions design. However, from table 1, we can see that without finetune, the proposed method is inferior to the old Grouping method. The main performance promotion(31.55->56.26) comes from the second stage. \nFinally, from the ablation studies, the whole paper is a combinatoric paper, which combines many existing ideas instead of proposing novel ones. The ablation studies do not give much insight into the method or behavior of the proposed loss. Especially compared to existing work ShotCoL, the performance improvement is limited but the methods are much complicated. \n\nSome other suggestions for improvement: 1. One dataset is not enough for a top-conference work, more datasets, such as AdCuepoints should be evaluated. 2. Some typos: 1) % p.  2) . For fair comparison, all pre-training methods employ ResNet-50 (He et al., 2016) as the shot encoder fENC and we pre-train the models for 10 epochs.",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper introduces a self-supervised learning method for the video scene segmentation task, which needs to temporally localize scene boundaries in a video. Their proposed method defines pseudo-boundary from a sequence of shots by splitting it into two sub-sequences and train a model to predict the pseudo-boundary with three novel tasks: Shot-Scene Matching (SSM), Contextual Group Matching (CGM), and Pseudo-boundary Prediction (PP). Experiments on pre-training and transfer learning show that this method is critical to improving the video scene segmentation performance, and it achieves the new state-of-the-art on the MovieNet-SSeg benchmark.",
            "main_review": "(+) This paper studies an interesting problem that make a video network aware of boundary infomation for video scene segmentation. This is a general problem in many video understanding tasks such as temporal action localization, video language grounding.\n\n(+) The proposed method is under self-supervised learning settings, which does not require any extra annotation cost, but still improve the video network for the down stream task.\n\n(+) The discovery of pseudo boudnarys follow the intuition of the scene segmentation task. Moreover, the algorithm garantees that it can alway generate one unique pseudo boundary from a given video.\n\n(+) According to their experimental results, the proposed method can achieve a new state-of-the-art on the MovieNet-SSeg benchmark.\n\n(-) The core idea of this paper is similar to BSP (Xu et al., 2020), which generate psuedo boundaries and devolped pretext tasks on them. From Table 4, the performance of this work is only merginally higher (1.64%) than BSP.\n\n(-) Not sure if or not DTW is necessary to do the temporal alignment problem. Since the second sequence has only 2 elements, the solution space is only O(K). The optima could be efficiently found by an argmanx operation after metrix multiplication. \n\n(-) In Table 3, the last column 'Sum' seems to be the summation. This does not make sense to me to sum different metrics together without further explaination. \n",
            "summary_of_the_review": "In short, this paper studies an interesting problem, and proposes an convinient and effective method as a solution. Although the proposed solution is not very novel, and not strongly techniqual, it is marginally above the acceptance threshold for the potential impact beyond video scene segmentation. \n\nI also would like to see the opinion from other reviewers.

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper presents a boundary-aware self-supervised learning framework for the task of video scene grouping.  During the pre-train stage, the authors first apply DTW to find a pseudo boundary in a given video sequence, and then applies Shot-Scene Matching and Contextual Group Matching to optimize the intra-scene and inter-scene distribution of features. Moreover, Pseudo-boundary Prediction and Masked Shot Matching are utilized to help the model identify transitional moments. ",
            "main_review": "Pros:\n- This paper is clear and easy to follow.\n- The overall framework looks reasonable and effective.\n- The proposed method achieves good results and outperforms previous methods.\n\nCons\n- The proposed framework is not generic and hard to be applied to other methods for the task.\n- In the pseudo-boundary discovery stage, the given video sequence is separated into two scenes, which is reasonable if there the input contains only two scenes. Yet, one may wonder that how the training data is prepared and what if there are more than two scenes. Given the high performance reported in experiments, the related analysis is important which however is missing.\n- From Tab.3, the effectiveness of MSM is marginal.\n- The lack of insights makes this paper less interesting. E.g. the authors claim that SSM and CGM help to optimize inter-/intra- feature distribution, yet lack direct evidence/demonstration. Simply reporting some improvements in final accuracy is less convincing, as the performance can be affected by other reasons like stronger network architecture, better training protocol, etc.",
