        "comment": "The authors study a practical problem of selecting/combining existing multi-label classification APIs under a budget constraint for a specific problem instance on hand. The task can be viewed as an (online) integer programming problem when given an accuracy estimator for the combination performance. The authors relax the integer constraints and propose a framework to solve the task in the dual form. They also run experiments to validate that the proposed framework is advantageous (cost or accuracy-wise) over the best single API.\n\nMost of the reviewers are positive about the practical value and the potential impacts of the work in applications/products/services. There are several disputes between the authors and some reviewers that cannot be fully resolved during the rebuttal. In the end, no reviewers express willingness to strongly champion for the acceptance of the paper, making the paper a borderline case. The decision is based on a careful examination of the current manuscript and every side's opinions.\n\n* Novelty: Some reviewers question about the novelty of the work. There are two aspects about novelty: one is on whether the problem itself is novel (are the authors trying to propose a new multi-label method?) In this aspect, the authors' response, which states that they are not aiming at proposing a new method, but at solving an automation task for MLaaS users, appears believable. The other aspect is whether the solution technique, namely the relaxed integer programming and other techniques, are sufficiently novel. Some reviewers find the novelty aspect satisfactory, while others believe that the proposed optimization technique have been widely used in machine learning community. The authors did not clarify the similarity/difference of the proposed technique to existing ones during the rebuttal. In this sense, the technical novelty is not well justified.\n\n* Speed: Some reviewers are concerned about different aspects of the running time and other costs. The authors emphasized the rapid speed in inference phase, particularly in Figure 3. Less is discussed about the time needed for the training phase (although the authors claim to be much smaller than the inference time)---somehow even the most positive reviewers have some questions about this aspect. The authors could add more clarification about the different \"time\" costs to the discussion. One dispute between some reviewers and the authors is about the *complexity* analysis of time, which is indeed missing in the current manuscript and can be a nice-to-have for future todos.\n\n* Theoretical Guarantee: One major dispute between some reviewers and the authors is on the theoretical guarantee provided. The reviewers suggest a regret-style bound, which compares the solution to the worst-case sequence; the authors provide an optimization-style bound, which compares the solution to the absolute optimal solution. Different bounds have their different roles for supporting the framework. Given that the authors have provided some reasonable bounds, the lack of regret bound is not taken against the authors.\n\n* Specialty: One concern raised by some reviewers is that the technique does not seem particularly tailored for multi-label classification (except some minor parts). In this sense, it is nice to have for the authors to discuss more on the wider applicability of the technique, and/or include some more specialty of the multi-label classification problem into the technique design.\n\nAfter taking all the factors above into account, and calibrating the received scores to the distribution across the papers, it seems that the paper could use some more revision before being mature enough as an impactful work."

            "summary_of_the_paper": "Given several mutli-label machine learning APIs, this paper study how to select those APIs under a budget constrant while striving to improve the overall accuracy. The author first formulate the budget API select problem as an integer linear programming problem, then relax the integer contraint and solving the relax problem in dual. The advantage of such modeling is to have a fast decision function for online deployment of their API selection systems. The experiment results are promising and consists of several ablation studies.\n",
            "main_review": "## Strengths:\n- novel problem setup of MLaaS, which is very practical for industrial practionioners\n- solving the API selection problem as relaxed integer programing seems techincal sounds\n- most of the writing is clear and easy to follow\n\n## Weakness:\n- While the paper aims to solve for multi-label problem, most components in the proposed FrugalMCT seem not tailor for the mulit-label problem, except for label combination part mentioned in Sec 3.4.\n- FrugalMCT needs call all candidate APIs do prediction on the training set so that it can collect supervision to learn the accuracy predictors. This step induces extra costs, but did not show up in the experiment results.\n\n## Major Comments\n- It seems to me that we can also apply FrugalMCT framework to an online production systems, where we have several ML predictors each with different inference latencies. We would like to select multiple ML predictors under the total latency constraint while striving for the best overal accuracy. It would be very interesting to see the impact of FrugalMCT in such cases.\n\n## Minor Comments\n- In the caption of Figure 1, \"is is high\" => \"is high\"\n",

As APIs differ in terms of accuracy and query cost, their approach achieves greater accuracy than a single API at a lower cost than the best single API.",
            "main_review": "# Soundness of the claims\nThe presented work is both theoretically grounded and empirically evaluated. In theory the authors' approach has convenient performance guarantees and can be implemented efficiently due to leveraging the specific structure of the problem. In the empirical evaluation the authors also prove the practical benefit of their approach demonstrating that their approach can achieve a higher predictive accuracy at a lower cost than the single best API, thereby outperforming the single best MLaaS platform in terms of both accuracy and cost which is not a really surprising result as long as the performances of the different APIs are complementary but still a strong result with practical benefits.\n\n# Significance\nThe contribution is significant and I estimate that this work will have great impact on the respective community.\n\n# Novelty\nAlthough the basic idea of selecting APIs has already been done in previous work (FrugalML), except for the basic idea, the remaining paper is to the best of my knowledge novel.\n\n# Relation with prior work\nRelated work is adequately and discussed in sufficient detail.\n\n# Clarity of writing\nThe paper is very well structured and clearly written. As already said, I really enjoyed the reading.\n\n# Relevance\nThe paper is definitely relevant to the machine learning community. The considered problem is relevant from a practical and very interesting from a methological perspective.",

The empirical results show that FrugalMCT is effective on three multi-label classification tasks, including computer vision and NLP tasks. And the GitHub model cost is also analyzed. The case study demonstrate that the proposed FrugalMCT improves the classification results compared to the single ML API.\n\nThe authors mention that the complexity of FrugalML is exponential to the number of labels.
