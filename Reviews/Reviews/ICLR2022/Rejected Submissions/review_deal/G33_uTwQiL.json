The network is empirically evaluated in the tasks of predicting Newtonian trajectories and molecular conformations.\n\nAll four reviewers are critical of the paper and recommend rejection (one weak, three strong). The reviews have flagged weaknesses and quality issues with several aspects of the submission, including the proposed methodology, the novelty of the contribution, and the clarity of the presentation. Although detailed clarifications were provided by the authors, most of the reviewers' concerns remain, and the consensus among reviewers remains to reject the paper.\n\nConsequently, the current version of the paper does not appear to meet the quality standards for acceptance to ICLR."

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This work (EVFM) aims to to improve predictions of n-body system dynamics by combining continuous lie symmetries with permutation symmetry. The authors propose to do this by encoding SO(3) invariant representations of each node, followed by the use of a graph transformer and a vectorization block to estimate the vector field. An evolving block is subsequently used to predict dynamics.\n",

The idea using a scalarization block, a graph transformer and a vectorization block is interesting\n2. The results on the synthetic task and the molecular conformer generation task are promising\n\nWeaknesses:\n1. For me, the math appears to be imprecise/ wrong at many places which makes it a difficult read - for example, starting in  Def 2.1 shouldn't it  be r vectors and s covectors? Also in the line, the group actions from SO(3) acting should involve the dual representations?\n2. For me, the authors make claims without sufficient proofs - for e.g. on page 5 - the bolded line doesn't have a proof - can you please show the same, especially given that the basis associated with ij pair is different. Also the proof for Proposition A.2 is not easy to follow or check.\n3. Scalability Concerns - In the tensor example above eq 3.4, the authors provide an example for the s=0 case (2,0) - and this in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ alone is of size 9 (3x3) - and this needs to be saved/ computed for each i,j pair. The authors also note that in their case, they only use the (1,0) type tensors. Please add scalability results especially against E(N) GNN which the authors compare against.\n4. Appears to be missing some relevant work - for e.g. [1], etc. Moreover the authors only appear to compare their model with the computationally efficient models like E(N) GNN - while ignoring models like LieConv[2] , LieTransformer [3], etc which can be used for the same task (Newtonian Many-Body System task). \n\nReferences:\n1.

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes a new model: Equivariant Vector Field Network (`EVFN`), which aims to solve the multi-body system modeling problem. Specifically, `EVFN`\n introduces a new kind of equivariant basis which considers more interactions between two particles and employs a graph transformer architecture to learn the edge-wise embeddings.\n",
            "main_review": "## Strengths\n1. Well written and easy to understand.\n2. The construction of the equivariant basis seems interesting.\n\n## Weakness\n1. The connection between `EVFN` and `EGNN` is not well discussed. Essentially, `EGNN`  takes $||x_i – x_j||^2$ as the geometric scalar and apply $\\phi(\\cdot)$ to obtain the edgewise message  ( see Eq(3)  in [1]). After obtaining edgewise message, `EGNN`  uses $\\phi_x$ to project $m_{ij}$ to a scalar and then vectorizes it by $x_i – x_j$ in Eq(4) in [1]. The key differences of `EVFN` are 1). Extending the equivariant basis from one dimension to three dimensions. 2). Replacing the `MLP` model $\\phi_e$ as well as the aggregation operation in Eq(5) and Eq(6) in [1] with an existing `GraphTransformer`  block. In this vein, `EVFN`  can be viewed as the extension of `EGNN` with the new equivariant bases.\n\n2. The motivation behind the equivariant basis construction is not well elaborated.  In the multi-body system modeling, the equivariant basis $\\frac{x_i -x_j}{||x_i-x_j||}$ has its physical meaning which indicates the force directions. However,  the benefit of using the outer product of two coordinates to construct the equivariant basis is not clear, since there is no explicit physical meaning of the outer product of two coordinates. It’s better to give more in-depth discussions about the choice of such equivariant bases here. \n\n3. There is no ablation study on the new equivariant basis and the ` GraphTransformer ` on multi-body system modeling.  As mentioned before,  the new-added equivariant bases have no explicit physical meaning of modeling the multi-body system, the main impact factor of the performance improvement of `EVFN` looks vague. \nOn the other hand, the ablation study on molecular conformation generation even implies that the contribution of ` GraphTransformer ` is slightly larger than that of the new equivariant basis (`EVFN w/o GT` gains the larger performance drop on 5 out of 8 metrics in Table 3. ).  If the performance improvement comes from `GraphTransformer`, the overall contribution of this paper is limited. Therefore, it is crucial to conduct the ablation study of the different components of `EVFN` to show the contributions of the new equivariant basis on multi-body system modeling. For example, apply the new equivariant bases on the `EGNN`  framework. \n\n4. The number of training samples used in the multi-body modeling experiment is not reported. Meanwhile, there is no analysis of the impact of the number of training samples for the different baselines.\n\n5. From Table 1, the result of `GCN`  surpasses many sophisticated baselines in the interpolation and extrapolation tasks, such as `EGNN`.   This is quite weird.

Moreover, the empirical evidence does not support this claim (Table 1, col 7).\n\n#### Questions:\n- “So far, we have achieved permutation and SE(3) equivariance” (p.5) isn’t it SE(3) invariance? -- the initial centering giving translation invariance, and the scalarization block giving SO(3) invariance\n- Did the authors experiment with other kinds of SO(3)-equivariant frames in the scalarization block?

            "main_review": "Transforming particle interaction into a rotationally invariant reference frames is a common approach in molecular mechanics, usually achieved with inner coordinates such as distances, angles, dihedral angles etc. These have the disadvantage that some coordinate information is lost, however they fulfill all equivariance / invariance properties w.r.t. rotation, reflection, translation and permutation in local reference frames. \n\nThe authors claim that \"EVFN is able to represent tensor information losslessly\". This is also true for previous equivariant approaches such as TFN, EGNN, PaiNN or NequIP, as long as no distance cutoff is used (see for example Dym and Maron 2020). However, in practice the distance cutoff is essential not only for computational efficiency but also to facilitate generalization across local environments. This is not possible in the proposed approach:\nThe EVFN transform is rotationally equivariant and translational invariant only with respect to global transforms. This has serious consequences for its capability to generalize, in particular for larger systems. As an extreme example, take two molecules (or clouds of Newtonian particles) at a large enough distance such that the inter-molecular interactions are negligible. Since the proposed coordinate is not translational invariant, the pairwise representations are not invariant to rotating the two molecules separately. Therefore, the proposed representation is not suitable to model general many-particle systems.\n\nDespite these flaws, the method shows good performance on the toy systems and conformer search. A reason might be that for small systems generalization is not the deciding factor, and the baseline methods do not retain the necessary information. To better judge this trade-off, it would be helpful to apply the proposed approach to the related task of predicting molecular force fields (e.g. on the MD17 dataset where a lot of baselines are available for comparison).\n\nFurther comments:\n- Centering the system prevents application of the method to a box with periodic boundary conditions. Are there any ideas how to overcome this?\n- The background section could be made more accessible for readers not familiar with group theory and tensor algebra, since this part is not really necessary to understand the method and proofs in Eq. 3.1-3.3.\n- Sec 4.2: the ISO17 dataset was introduced by Schütt et al (2017)\n- Why are the equivariance errors in Table 1 slightly higher for EVFN than for the other equivariant methods?",
