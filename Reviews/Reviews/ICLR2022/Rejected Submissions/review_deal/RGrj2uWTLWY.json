        "comment": "The paper studies the noisy labels problem in semi-supervised node classification and proposes a method that leverages pairwise interactions to explicitly force the embeddings for certain node pairs to be close to each other leading to better robustness.\n\nThe reviewers agreed the proposed method is promising. However, the reviewers also had concerns about the novelty, and that certain aspects of the method could be justified better and the experiments should consider larger scale settings to make the paper more convincing. These were the key reasons for rejection."

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper focuses on semi-supervised node classification with noisy node labels. The authors propose a novel learning objective called the pairwise interactions, which encourages node pairs holding positive PI labels to have close node embeddings. Extensive experiments show promising results.",
            "main_review": "Strengths:\n\n1. The problem is well-motivated.\n\nThis paper focuses on semi-supervised node classification in a setting where noisy node labels exist. As node classification is a fundamental problem in graph machine learning and noisy labels always exist due to some annotation errors, this problem looks well-motivated and interesting to me. \n\n2. The idea of pairwise interactions is intuitive.\n\nTo deal with the problem, the authors propose a new objective called the pairwise interaction. Different from most training objectives which focus on pointwise interactions between nodes and labels, this objective forces similar nodes to have similar node embeddings, where the similarity is measured with both graph structures and node labels. Overall, this objective is intuitive in the context of node classification with noisy labels.\n\n3. The model is simple yet effective.\n\nBased on pairwise interactions, the authors propose PI-GNN, which consists of two GNNs, i.e., a mask generator and a task executor. The mask generator computes a soft mask matrix over node pairs, which is used to reweight node pairs for training. The framework is quite straightforward, and it is able to effectively model the pairwise interactions.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n1. The novelty of the paper seems limited.\n\nMy major concern is on the novelty of the paper. In terms of problem, node classification with noisy labels has been explored quite extensively in literature. For example, as mentioned in related work, methods based on loss correction and sample reweighting have been applied to GNNs. Given these works, the problem studied in this paper is not very new. \n\nComparing this work with existing works, the authors claim that existing works only consider pointwise interactions while this paper focuses on pairwise interactions. However, the idea of modeling pairwise interactions is also not very new in the field of graph machine learning. For example, [1] uses a GNN to infer whether two linked nodes have the same label, and thus models pairwise interactions. [2] uses Gaussian process with a graph structure-based kernel for node label prediction, which can also achieve modeling pairwise interactions. [3] and [4] use CRFs to model pairwise interactions of node labels. Although all these works leverage pairwise interactions in the clean-label setting, they have very similar ideas to this paper, and they can be extended to deal with noisy labels quite easily.\n\nTherefore, although this paper has some contributions over existing works, I think these contributions are small, and hence the novelty of the paper is limited.\n\n2. Some model designs need more justification.\n\nAlthough PI-GNN is very intuitive, some model designs need more justification.\n\nIn equation (5), why the mask matrix is designed in that way? Is there any example to motivate the design? It would be more convincing if the authors could further elaborate on that or provide some theoretical justification.\n\nIn PI-GNN, two GNNs are leveraged. To me, these two GNNs have quite similar roles in the sense that they both try to learn an embedding for each node. Is there any conceptual difference between the embeddings learned by the two GNNs? What if we use the same GNN encoder for both the mask generator and the task executor?\n\nIn equation (4), a pairwise loss function is used for training. According to the definition, the size of $B_{PI}^+$ is much larger than the size of $B_{PI}^+$, resulting in a problem of label imbalance. How does PI-GNN deal with the problem?\n\n3. It is better to consider some larger datasets.\n\nIn the experiment, all the datasets are very small, and the largest one only has ~10K nodes. If I understand correctly, PI-GNN has higher memory cost than standard GNNs, as PI-GNN needs to compute a soft weight for each pair of nodes. Because of that, it is unclear whether PI-GNN can deal with very large graphs, and it would be more convincing if the authors could run such experiments.\n\n[1] Stretcu, Otilia, Krishnamurthy Viswanathan, Dana Movshovitz-Attias, Emmanouil A.

Ideally, a node pair has positive PI is more likely to have the same labels. Authors further propose strategies to optimize such PI labels.\n\nI think the motivation of this paper is good. One can expect to gain strong intersection between nodes with same label even in presence of noise and such structure upon the graph should have good impact on the robustness. What I am concerned is the experiments, I don not feel the empirical results in this paper achieve significantly accuracy upon vanilla GNN approach (like GCN).

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper is mainly dedicated to developing a robust model against noisy labels. Since it is observed from Fig. 1(a) that the noise ratio for the PI labels is lower than that of the point-wise labels, the authors introduce positive and negative sample pairs (Pair Interactions) to enhance model capabilities, which is likely contrastive learning. Moreover, the labels of positive and negative sample pairs may not be confident, e.g., sub-optimal PI labels with noises. To address this problem, the authors introduce another branch (Mask Generator) trained on pair interaction learning objective to generate a confidence map to reweight the loss of PI learning objective in Task Executor. Experimentally, the accuracies of the proposed method are higher than baselines in the case of noisy labels.",

It is not clear how does label propagation generate PI labels? Is it a semi-supervised way? Are clean labels used? If so, in principle, this setting is incorrect for robustness research. If not, please give a more detailed explanation and training details. Besides, what does this sentence “which does not touch noisy class labels for learning” (on Page 6) mean?\n2. How about the complexity, no analysis is given.\n3. In experiments, although 5 datasets are evaluated in table1, only two small datasets (Cora and Citeseer) are used in all subsequent experiments. Both these two datasets belong to citation datasets, which have similar characteristics. DBLP and WikiCS datasets should be evaluated on ablation study.\n4. From Fig.3 (c)-(d), the performance of PI-GNN always increases with \\beta increasing. More \\beta values should be used to test the trend of accuracy, the most extreme is how the performance when \\beta=1.\n",

It employs a new auxiliary task to predict PI (pairwise interactions) labels using a pair of nodes.

The experiments on five real-world benchmarks demonstrate that PI-GNN outperforms GNN models (GCN, GraphSAGE, and GAT) and methods for noisy label settings (Decoupling, GCE, DivideMix, and so on.) on various noise levels and settings. PI label learning and uncertainty-aware training both contribute to performance improvement.",
            "main_review": "This paper tackles an important problem in the graph representation learning community, uses a simple but effective approach, and conducts experiments with various settings (especially with/against label-noise baselines). However, it has several weaknesses and should be revised for the following points:\n\nFirst, related work on graph structure learning is not thoroughly surveyed. Using a task to predict graph structure (i.e., adjacency matrix or PI label 1) and label agreement (i.e., PI label 2) is proposed in many existing works. However, this paper does not discuss them and only mentions a few works such as [Stretcu, Otilia, et al.]. I would recommend authors to survey prior works about their methods. Plus, these prior works are not empirically compared by experiments; thus, the technical novelty of the model might be overclaimed.\n\n- Jiang, Bo, et al. \"Semi-supervised learning with graph learning-convolutional networks.\" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. 2019.\n- Yu, Donghan, et al. \"Graph-revised convolutional network.\" Joint European Conference on Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases.

The confidence mask requires $|V| \\times |V|$ space and time complexity, and it would be numerically large if we want to deal with a gigantic graph. However, this paper does not analyze how the model parts cost and how large graphs can be used. Here are some quick solutions: (1) conducting experiments on relatively large graphs (e.g., OGB datasets), (2) analyzing complexity and comparing with baselines, and (3) measuring the memory consumption and training/inference wall-clock time.\n\nThird, experimental settings and their demonstration are not consistent. For example, some tables only present a subset of noise ratio settings (e.g., 0.4/0.6, 0.2/0.4 in Table 3, 0.4/0.6 in Table 8). Significant test results are only reported on Cora and CiteSeer (considering that we usually use asterisks, a space-efficient way to represent statistical significance). Is there any specific reason or motivation for this configuration?\n\nLastly, here are some minor concerns and suggestions:\n- The term 'uncertainty estimation' seems far from the well-known meaning in the deep learning (especially in the Bayesian DNN) community. Therefore, it can be misleading to many potential readers. Researchers are now differentiating the softmax output and the model uncertainty (i.e., A model can be uncertain in its predictions even with a high softmax output). For more details, see Gal, Yarin, and Zoubin Ghahramani. \"Dropout as a Bayesian approximation: Representing model uncertainty in deep learning.\" international conference on machine learning. PMLR, 2016.\n- It would be great if the authors used line charts to show the performance against noise ratio of models. Tables are also good, but sometimes it is hard to recognize the difference and see the big picture.\n- It would be great if the authors present the exact value of $\\beta$ in Figure 3.\n",
            "summary_of_the_review": "Although this work has several strengths (important problem, simple but effective method, and extensive experiments), it is not ready for publications by following weaknesses:\n- Related work on graph structure learning is not thoroughly surveyed and not compared.
