        "comment": "The paper proposes numerical method for solving SDEs that empirically are faster than previous approaches. Two reviewers felt the paper was above threshold, while two felt it was below threshold for acceptance. While the paper is borderline in this sense, all four reviewers noted that the paper lacked a theoretical justification and rested on empirical evidence for the usefulness of the approach. Several reviewers also pointed out that these empirical results are on the weak side. While the paper may add a potentially useful learning trick to the optimization literature, these two significant concerns put it on the side of a borderline reject."

            "main_review": "## Strengths\n\n1. This paper proposes the first adaptive step-size numerical SDE solver for score-based generative modeling. Experimental results demonstrate clear improvement over previous methods like Euler-Maruyama methods and probability flow ODEs. It also demonstrates improvement over DDIM for a moderate budget of iteration numbers.\n\n2. The method itself is simple and clear, and only requires tuning one hyperparameter. \n\n## Weaknesses\n\n1. No theoretical understanding of the proposed numerical SDE solver. It would be better to include an analyze on the convergence order of the proposed approach.\n\n2. Results of predictor-corrector for VP SDEs in Table 1 are significantly worse than results reported in the original score sde paper. What could be the reason for this? Did you use the correct signal-to-noise ratio for the Langevin corrector?\n\n3. Some minor writing issues. The first page has a footnote \"equal contribution\", while all author names should be anonymized. In section 3.1.3, $E_q$ is defined to be a scalar (the $L_q$ norm), but it is referred as a vector in the expression for computing $\\| x\\|_2 $.\n\n4. In section 3.1.5, it is mentioned that a different step size is applied to each data sample. How is this implemented in deep learning frameworks? Will it cause noticeable slowdown on GPUs?",

This paper is mostly empirical by nature, and authors suggested five techniques in improving the SDE solver performance.",
            "main_review": "1)\nI understand the paper's nature lies in the empirical side. However, some claims can be further elaborated through formal analyses. For example, Norm calculation in 3.1.3 can be analyzed by following algorithmic complexity, i.e. big-oh notations. I suggest that authors find such analysis opportunity throughout the paper. Moreover, it would be great if you can come up with a table to organize such complexity comparisons.\n\n2)\nI cannot follow why Eq 5 could be better in both quality and speed at the same time. Eq 5 has more constraints to setup the tolerance, so the speed-up seems to be an obvious benefit. However, the quality could be damaged while I also note that the quality is not being too much hurt from your result report. Why is that?\n\nThis question goes same to utilizing L2 norm, instead of L-$\\infty$ norm\n\n3)\nIs there any theoretic argument on the integration method? Which can be proved or contests as a proposition or a theorem?\nI could not fully comprehend the argument in the current text, and it just looks like swapping SDE solvers to find the best match.\n\n4)\nThese improvements can be further investigated through ablation studies, which seems to be must-do, in my opinion. Without the ablation study, I cannot argue which technique contributed to more or less.",

However, their sampling speed is slow due to the large number of evaluations required by numerical SDE solvers. This works aims to accelerate the sampling process by using a more efficient SDE solver. The proposed approach generates data 2 to 10 times faster than the baselines while achieving reasonably well sample qualities.",
            "main_review": "1. The major contribution of the paper seems to be an application of existing numerical solvers (Roberts, 2012) to sampling from SDE models. The technical novelty could be limited as the solver already exists despite the tricks used to improve the empirical results. \n2. There is no theoretical analysis of the method.\n3. It seems that the major contribution is on the empirical side. However, the empirical results are not very impressive especially when NFE is small. For instance, in Table 1, DDIM outperforms the proposed method when NFE=49. As the goal of the paper is to improve the sampling speed of score-based models, having a good result when NFE is small enough is important. An FID of 72.29 using 49 NFE might not be impressive since NFE=49 is already a large budget. Wondering when the proposed method can outperform DDIM when NFE=100.\n4. There are some formatting issues (e.g., too much space) on the first page. In the tables, some best values are in bold while some are not. It would be good to be consistent.\n5. Algorithm 1 should be better explained in section 3.2. The required parameters and their selections should also be explained more clearly.\n6. The paper writing can be improved. For instance, in section 3.1.1, \"the stochastic Improved Euler’s method\" should be explained more clearly.  \"Dynamic step size algorithm\" is an important contribution of the paper, the setting should be better explained. If possible, can move some details from the appendix to the main paper.\n7. It would also be interesting to perform experiments on even higher-dimensional images if model checkpoints are available.",

The title is too exaggerated and does not reflect the content of the paper. Instead, I would like to see a title that is precise, for example, \"An efficient SDE solver for score-based models\". \n- Fig 1: What about the original Improved Euler baseline? \n- Section 3: The several components of the algorithm seem to be parameter tuning and engineering trick. There is no theoretical or even intuitive justification for why they offer better performance (Appendix F does not answer this question). In addition, I do not see any ablation study on the contribution of each component. \n- Section 3.1.3: The last equation ($\\ell_2$ norm) in this subsection cannot be understood.\n- The algorithm: Although the algorithm does not need stepsize or scheduler tuning, there are other hyperparameters involved so some tuning is still needed.\n- Experiments: How often do you reject under different NFE? There should be experiments on the relationship between NFE and percentage of rejection. Next, there should be a figure similar to Fig 1 but the x-axis is the time spent rather than NFE. \n- Appendix A: Are those methods $\\ell_2$ or $\\ell_{\\infty}$? \n- Appendix E: What can we read from this table?",

There is also much space for improvements in the experiments (especially, on the overall generation speed measured by seconds). In addition, the title is exaggerated. \n\n---------\nUpdates after the rebuttal\n\nI appreciate that the authors agreed to use a more precise title. Some of my concerns are also addressed. Therefore, I will increase my score to 5. However, I still think the experiments lack some key components such as time spent and number of rejections, although they might strongly correlate to NFE. The empirical results are good but not impressive enough. I encourage the authors to further improve the method and make additional theoretical/empirical justifications. ",
