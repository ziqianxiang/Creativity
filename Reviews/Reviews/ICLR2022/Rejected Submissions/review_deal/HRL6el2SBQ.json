            "summary_of_the_paper": "The authors propose adding angular distance in the OoD score and additional training samples via intra-class mixup.  Angular margin/distance is defined as the angle between the weight vector from a class and an instance (ie. arccos of the dot product of the unit weight vector and the unit vector for a instance.  Intra-class mixup generates samples by interpolating between two samples of the same class.   Angular spread is the standard deviation of the angular margin for a given dataset.  Intra-class mixup reduces angular spread in in-distribution data and increases angular spread between in-distribution and OoD data.   Angular separability is defined as the squared difference of in-distribution angular margin and OoD angular margin, normalized by the sum of their standard deviation.\n\nWith four datasets, they show that intra-class mixup increases angular separability in 3 datasets.  With four datasets and 3 different OoD techniques, intra-mixup is more accurate in AUROC and FPR95, but not AUPR.   Adding the cosine of angular margin in the OoD scores generally improves performance over using OoD scores alone.\n\n\n\n",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "Inspired from inter-class mixup (Zhang et al, ICLR 2018), where data augmentation is used to train models more robust to adversarial samples, this work proposes intra-class mixup to reduce the variance of in-distribution samples, i.e. the training set, and improve the capacity of a trained model to detect out-of-distribution samples at inference time. The key difference between the two works is that the here proposed does the mixup within samples belonging to the same class. \n\nIn addition to this, the work propose to use the angular margin, i.e. the angle between the normal of the decision boundary of a neural net (obtained from the weights of the last layer) and an unmixed sample, to detect OOD samples. The cosine of such angle shall be coupled with an OOD method to perform OOD detection. ",
            "main_review": "Strengths\n- Overall the paper is clearly written, although the experiments and results could be improved. \n- Good coverage of the related work\n- Very relevant topic\n\nWeaknesses\n- This work is presented as an alternative to standard empirical risk minimization (ERM) or the setup of mixup (Zhang et al, ICLR 2018), where ERM is replaced by vicinal risk minimization (VRM, Chappelle et al, NIPS 2000). What learning strategy is used here, in opposition to these two works, is never stated. \n- The experimental setup is not clear, which limits reproducibility and makes difficult to interpret the obtained results. What exactly is considered as in-distribution and what samples are OoD and how are they generated? (see detailed comments)\n- The proposed comparisons against ERM and mixup are not necessarily relevant. ERM is the standard approach to train a model and mixup proposes a data augmentation strategy to make a model more robust to adversarial samples. This work, instead focuses on the detection of OOD samples. As such, it should compare itself with methods addressing the same problem and not directly against ERM and mixup (table 1).\n\nDetailed comments\n- Please acknowledge previous work on angle-based outlier detection [1], as it closely relates to this work.\n- The angular margin is estimated w.r.t the decision boundary (see eqs. 3 and 4). Therefore, there is an error in the illustration in Fig. 1a.\n- Differently from mixup, in this work \\lambda does not follow a Beta distribution. Moreover, no details are provided on how it is chosen. Please comment.\n- If the label should not change, second line of Eq. 2 could be omitted. Otherwise, there is no guarantee that \\hat{y} will have the same value. This would only hold when \\lambda=1 or 0 and y_i=y_j=1 or 0.\n- Eq 5 implies that new data is being generated, i.e. data augmentation. Is this the case? What happends with the original samples? I suppose they are undesired since they have high variance.\n- Could the authors motivate why the angular margin needs to be used coupled with another metric (eq. 7) and not on its own?\n- The experimental setup is not clear. The paper misses to clearly establish what is an OoD sample/set on each of the experiments. In which way Gaussian and uniform noise are used for this purpose?\n- At inference time, when is a sample considered OOD?\n- The AUROC is not a good measure in OOD detection problems, since usually the majority class dominates. AUPRC should be favored. Interestingly, it is mixup that fairs best in that scenario, despite not being a method designed for OOD detection. Please comment \n\nMinor\n- There are typos in the plots in figure 1b,c,d\n- Table 2 is unnecessary and may be omitted\n\nReferences\n[1] H.-P. Kriegel, M. S hubert, and A. Zimek.

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The authors propose to use intra-class mixup (i.e. linearly interpolating images from the same class) as a form of data augmentation. They further define the angular margin and propose to add it to out-of-distribution detection scores in order to improve the performance. They evaluate their method's OOD performance on three different OOD scores and show improvements.",
            "main_review": "A strong point of the paper is that they evaluate their method in many different settings, i.e. on 3 OOD methods on 4 different in-distribution. They also report AUROC, AUPR and FPR95, which is good. They do not fit special hyperparameters for each specific out-distribution, making their comparison fair in my opinion. Furthermore they test their OOD detection performance on many different out-distributions. \n\nThat being said, one OOD detection task that they should definitely add is CIFAR10 vs. CIFAR100 and vice-versa, as this task is known to be particularly difficult.\n\nOverall, the paper's use of the angular margin is not well-motivated. Especially the creation of a new OOD score by simply adding the angular margin to other OOD scores is completely ad-hoc. On top of this, it should be noted that their angular margin score depends on arbitrary bias values in the last layer. If one adds some bias shift $b$ to every bias in the last layer then it shifts the origin and thus modifies the angular margin. However, the resulting network's loss would be identical to the original and thus there is a-priori no reason that training should favor one network over the other. All their OOD performance measures would also remain invariant except for the angular margin score. There should at least be a discussion about why despite all this, the angular margin score is still helpful.\n\nI am not sure about the strength of their baselines. Comparing for example with the results from [1], they used the same architecture but their simple MSP model beats even the best results in Table 9 (on all but one of the datasets and metrics that both report). This doesn't even mention the fact that even if this wasn't the case the paper would still only be comparing their results to weak baselines. Basically, the authors argue that one can improve all three of the baselines that they study using their technique. But even the improved version's performance is worse than, for example outlier exposure [Hendrycks et. al. 2019] or Mahalanobis distance [Lee et. al 2018], so why use the weak techniques in the first place?\n\nOne point of confusion for me was that the standard deviations in Table 1 were seemingly computed across the dataset, whereas in all other tables they were computed across different random seeds. I really think this could be clarified explicitly in the Table's caption (especially given that the authors had lots of space left).\n\nI was also confused how exactly the standard deviations of the averages were computed in Table 4, Table 5 and in the appendix. Are all runs aggregated and then the standard deviation across all of them is computed? Or is the average computed for each seed and then the standard deviation of that is reported?\n\nMore issues:\n- In Table 1 the caption reads \"Intra-class mixup has consistently has better separability\" (small typo here!), even though it clearly isn't true for CIFAR-10. \n- Table 2 is fairly useless to the paper and appears to have been added to pad out the length.\n- In Table 3, we see that Inter generally performs better in terms of accuracy (the gap being quite large on CIFAR-100). This should at least be acknowledged and discussed by the authors. Arguably, this issue is strong enough as an argument against using their method just by itself, so it cannot be glossed over.\n- In Table 4, there are 6 instances of wrong boldfacing, making the authors' results look better than they are.\n\nMinor comments:\n- The citation style is very hard to read. Presumably the authors used \\citet (instead of \\citep) even for citations that are not directly referenced in the sentence.\n- \"Angular\" is misspelled in all axis labels in Figure 1.\n- All Table captions should be above the tables, not below.\n- All equations are missing punctuation.\n- Wenn formatting $\\cos$ or $\\arccos$ in mathmode one should use \\cos and \\arccos (instead of $cos$ and $arccos$). Similarly, I would recommend to use \\mathrm for worded subscripts, i.e. $R_\\mathrm{expected}$ instead of $R_{expected}$.\n- Several figure and table captions end without punctuation. \n\n[1] Towards neural networks that provably know when they don't know, Alexander Meinke, Matthias Hein, at ICLR20",
