        "comment": "This paper experimentally shows that the block-structure of similarities between layers typically appears for different models and such a structure is mainly induced by small set of dominant datapoints. Moreover, the dominant datapoints are not just noisy artifacts but represent some common image patterns such as background colors. The authors also found that the block structure can easily disappear by removing  the dominant datapoints, and the authors also proposed a method to suppress the block structure by regularizing PCs, Shake-Shake regularization, and transfer learning.\n\nThis paper gives thorough experiments that clarify the mechanism of appearance of a block structure. However, its significance is a bit minor. Indeed, the block structure does not affect the generalization ability very much, and it can be removed without changing the predictive performance. I agree that investigating the behavior of the internal representation is of scientific interest as the authors pointed out, but on the other hand, its significance would not be convincing. Indeed, this concern was pointed out by several reviewers. Next, the main focus of this study is about the setting of large model with small data size. It is not clear whether it is universal across different model size relative to the dataset size. There is no theoretical investigation (for example, the block-structure phenomenon could be explained by a high dimensional random matrix theory). \n\nIn summary, this paper investigates a somehow interesting phenomenon but its significance is not convincing. Thus, it would be a bit below the threshold of the acceptance."

            "main_review": "## Strength\n\n### [Strength1]\nThe authors conducted exhaustive experiments on standard datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-10, Patch Camelyon) and on different model architectures (several levels of shallow/deep ResNets with narrow/wide layers).\nAccording to (Nguyen et al., 2020), the block structure can emerge beyond ResNet as well (they conducted experiments on ResNet without skip connections).\nThese observations imply that the results reported in the paper will be ubiquitous (at least for images).\nRevealing general phenomena underling deep models would be valuable to the community.\n\n### [Strength2]\nThe observation that dominant datapoints tend to share some common image patterns seems to be nontrivial.\nThis phenomenon itself can be a topic of interest for further researches.\nThis phenomenon might also imply that deep models can be vulnerable to a slight change of the colors of the entire images.\nThat is, if we modify an input image to have a color close to that of dominant points, its intermediate representations might be large (e.g., Fig5), which will lead to different outputs (i.e., the model is vulnerable). \n\n\n## Weakness\n\nIn the paper, the authors reported that the block structure is induced by the dominant datapoints.\nThe authors then discussed the experimental results based on this connection.\nThe results are therefore connected to block structure through dominant datapoint, i.e., [block structure] -- [dominant datapoints] -- [results].\nBecause of this structure, there are two topics underlying the current paper: (i) the connection [block structure] -- [dominant datapoints] discussing the origin of the block structure, and (ii) the connection  [dominant datapoints] -- [results] discussing the emergence and dynamics of dominant datapoints.\n\nMy concern here is that these topics (i) and (ii) would be irrelevant (or, at least the connection would be far looser than expected).\nThe current paper claims that [block structure] and [results] are tightly connected through [dominant datapoints].\nHowever, the validity of the connection (i) [block structure] -- [dominant datapoints] is questionable, as I describe below.\nIn particular, I suspect it can be an artifact induced by the use of KCA with linear kernel for the similarity measure.\n\n### [Detail]\nEssentially, KCA with linear kernel measures the squared Frobenius norm of the covariance matrix (with some normalization).\nIt is known that the covariance is vulnerable to the existence of outliers.\nIndeed, as reported in (Nguyen et al., 2020, Fig3) as well as in Fig4 of the current paper, removing outliers (i.e., PCs or dominant datapoints) eliminate the similarity between layers.\nThese observations imply that \"dominant datapoints are kept being outliers across layers ((ii) above)\" rather than \"the representations are similar across layers ((i) above)\" because (at least some fraction of) the similarity is the consequence of the existence of such outliers.\n\nIn Appendix J, the authors reported the similarity under some other kernels.\nThere, we can find that linear kernel exhibits the strongest similarity (possibly because it is vulnerable to the existence of outliers).\nThis raises a question on the adequacy of the current study which rely solely on linear kernel.\nThe removal of outliers will lead to smaller KCA under linear kernel (and less blocks) as reported in the paper.\nHowever, I wonder whether the similar can hold for KCA under some other kernels.\nFor example, we can reduce the effect of outliers with large activations for block structure by adopting the feature map $\\phi(x) = \\frac{x}{\\\\| x \\\\|}$ which induces the cosine kernel $k(x, y) = \\cos(x, y)$.\nThen, the question is whether the removal of dominant datapoints lead to reduction of KCA under cosine kernel (and some other kernels as well) and elimination of the block structure.\nIf the significant reduction of KCA is not observed in variety of kernels, the connection (i) [block structure] -- [dominant datapoints] would be an artifact induced by the use of linear kernel.\n\nHere, I would like to remind that my comment above is all about the validity of the connection (i) [block structure] -- [dominant datapoints].\nIf the connection (i) still holds despite the selection of kernels, that would be far nontrivial, and would be an interesting phenomenon with further investigations needed.\nI would also remark that the second connection (ii) [dominant datapoints] -- [results] can be of independent interest irrelevant to the validity of the connection (i). (unless there are related studies in this direction)\n\n",
            "summary_of_the_review": "The current paper mixes the two connections (i) [block structure] -- [dominant datapoints] and (ii) [dominant datapoints] -- [results].\nTo make the paper rigid, these two connections need to be distinguished.\nThe results in the current paper implies the connection (ii).\nHowever, the validity of the connection (i) remains questionable.\nI suspect it can be an artifact induced by the use of KCA with linear kernel for the similarity measure.\nIf this is the case, the paper needs to be reorganized with its main focus on (ii) but not (i).\nIf the authors are willing to connect (i) and (ii), it would be essential to confirm that the reported phenomena are not artifact induced by the use of KCA with linear kernel, and demonstrate they are ubiquitous irrelevant to the selection of similarity measures.",

            "main_review": "While several facts mentioned in the paper are interesting, one of the key dissatisfying experiences of reading this paper is that the authors do not place this phenomenon in larger context or really examine its implication. \n\nOn the issue of surprise and arising of the block structure:\n1. It does not seem entirely surprising to me that subsequent layers have similar representations, after all this is why we need deep neural networks, to slowly evolve the representations towards something that correctly predicts the output. \n2. Since the authors mainly examine resnets, which have block structure architecture, this is even less surprising. Perhaps the authors could try to vary the residual connections. \n3. Can the block structure be seen from an information bottleneck viewpoint?\n\n\nOn the implications of block structure:\n1. The authors don't address in their paper why this block structure \"is bad\". The authors have no results showing that it affects results or generalization. \n2.  The main issue with it seems to be that the layers have redundant representation and perhaps one could reduce depth if the representation evolved more quickly, but this is never mentioned or brought up in the paper. The paper has no experiments showing the ability to prune or reduce networks when they eliminate block structure. \n\n\nOn the differences in block structure that arise:\n1. There actually seems to be an order-dependence to the particular representation that arises, thats why different random seeds result in different representations. This could be because the network learns what to do on a the initial set of inputs first and then on other sets of inputs, so the authors could try batching groups of similar inputs which are shown first and which are shown later to the network. But having said that it is not clear why the order dependence is bad again. \n2. This would explain the transfer learning helping as well, because in transfer learning a different dataset is trained initially. \n\nOn eliminating the block structure: \n1. It seems that most attempts to eliminate block structure still leaves some of it in tact. \n2.  Can it be removed by explicitly penalizing for betewen layers similarity? Would this affect generalization?\n\n\n",
