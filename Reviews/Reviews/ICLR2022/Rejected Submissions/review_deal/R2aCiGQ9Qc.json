        "comment": "This paper focuses on investigating the relations between the heterophily and over-smoothness problem. However, the relationship is not clear.\n\nThe over-smoothness problem considers the features and the adjacency matrix, while the heterophily incorporates the adjacency matrix and the labels. They have different views on the graph. It may not be treated as the same coin. Besides, the stacked aggregations lead to indistinguishable node representations and poor performance in the over-smoothing problem. The same phenomenon appears in the heterophily problem because the features in different classes are falsely mixed, leading to indistinguishable nodes [2]. They have the same phenomenon but different origins. It may be not a necessity to combine these two problems.\n\nBesides, MADGap[1] is proposed to evaluate the over-smoothness problem. It is unreliable to use the accuracy and the degree to measure this problem. Therefore, in section 3, the relations between node degrees and the homophily ratio cannot infer the relations between the heterophily and over-smoothness problem.\n\nAs a result, the authors should carefully re-organize their paper and results. \n\nA suggestion is to pack the submission as a new method to learn from heterophily instead of trying to make such a close relationship with over-smoothing.\n\n- [1] Measuring and Relieving the Over-smoothing Problem for Graph Neural Networks from the Topological View.

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper studies two problems plaguing graph neural networks (GCNs/GNNs): 1) oversmoothing of GCNs/GNNs; and 2) GCNs/GNNs often do not yield good performance on heterophilous networks. The authors aim to develop a theory to explain these issues simultaneously, where a few lemmas and theorems were developed based on certain simplifying assumptions. Based on these theoretical results, the authors develop a generalized GCN (GGCN) with negative message passing. Evaluation is conducted and compared with the state-of-the-art.",
            "main_review": "Strengths:\n 1. The attempt to develop a theory to simultaneously address heterophily and oversmoothing issues in graph neural networks is important.\n 2. Evaluation  shows that the proposed GGCN shows some promising results.\n\nWeaknesses and Concerns:\n\n - Theoretical analysis is based on first on the vanilla linear GCN model, i.e., SCN of (Wu et al 2019), which removes non-linear activations. This makes analysis of GCNs trivial. For example, with the linear GCN model, the statement in Lemma 1 is trivially true.\n\n  - In addition, the graph generation process is also greatly simplified, assuming each node generates \"links\" uniform-randomly to nodes within the same class vs. nodes of the different class, independently of the choices made by, say, neighboring nodes.\n\n - Despite these simplifying assumptions (which are Okay to make the problems trackable in order to obtain rigorous theoretical results), I find that the theoretical developments are rather sloppy, and I have difficulty in following the theoretical derivations and proofs. All in all, the paper lacks rigor as I would have liked to see in a \"theory\"-oriented paper.\n\n\n  For example, in the proof of Lemma 1, you go from eq.(13) to eq(14), but never explain what $\\mathbf{x}$ is? Is $\\mathbf{x}$ simply $\\mathbf{f}_{i}^{L}$?   \nOr does it refer to the input (node features)?  I assume it is the latter, as in Lemma 2, you seem to use $\\mathbf{x}$ to denote the input. In any case, if it is the latter,  you have NOT established it yet (without accumulating all the weight matrices $\\\\mathbf{w}$ in the lower layers.  \n\n - The authors use the term \"movements\" in the latent space rather loosely, I have no ideas what it means precisely. In Lemma 2, it seems that you meant by the shifting the decision boundary.\n\n As an example, take the proof of Lemma 2. First of all, by stating that the representation of class 1 becomes: $\\{\\mathbf{f}^{(L)}_{i} - t {\\mathbf{w}}^{*T}\\}$, you seem to assume that only one hyperplane has shifted, as t ${\\mathbf{w}}^{*T}$ represents only a single hyperplane. This is in general NOT true.  Why do you need to\"overload\"  $f_1(x)$ and $f_2(x)$? This seems to create confusion. In fact, I am not sure what the first equation in eq(15) represents, in particular, what $w'$ and $b'$ represent, since they are never explained. What is the relation between eq.(15) and eq.(16)?\n\n  I am not sure wherer eq.(17) comes from.  \n\n Likewise in the proofs of Theorem 1 and Theorem 2, you start taking expectations without even properly defining the random variables and distributions over which you are taking expectations. Specifically, in the proof of Theorem 2,  when you start considering the higher layers $l$, you take the expectations based only on $k_i$ -- here you completely ignore the fact that once you move to higher layers where the aggregation of  \"messages\" from neighboring nodes would  introduce dependence on the inputs of the neighboring nodes.\n\n- There are a lot of issues similar to what I have pointed out here. It really makes following the proofs difficult. I have NO confidence in the theoretical results obtained in the paper.\n\n - In terms of the GGCN model, having \"negative\" message passing to deal with heterophily seems rather straightforward -- ideally, if the model is designed properly,  this \"negativity should follow directly from the model (if one assumes  \"+\" captures similarity, and \"-\" captures \"dissimilar\", as in signed networks); I suspect that the (relative) \"low\" degree claim is mostly due to the simplistic graph generation process used in the paper where node links are generated independently of other nodes.\n\n",

            "main_review": "In this paper, the authors attempt to theoretically unify the cause of oversmoothing and heterophily. Specifically, the authors prove that under their proposed framework with certain assumptions, the level of homophily and relative degree may affect model performance. The authors further show the link between GNN performance and signed messages. Based on the analysis results, the authors propose a GCN model named GGCN by utilizing signed messages and degree corrections along with decaying aggregation. The effectiveness of the proposed model is validated by several experiments using real-world datasets of different statistics. In general, the paper is structured well and easy to follow. However, there are several issues the authors need to address.\n\nFirst, it would be better if the authors can further justify the novelty of the proposed approach, especially the modeling part. Both signed messages and degree corrections have been adopted to improve GNN performance and to solve a similar or the same problem (e.g., heterophily). I suggest the authors to further justify why this approach can be considered novel rather than combining several existing methods that focus on the same problem.\n\nI also have two questions for the evaluation: 1) It is good to see that GGCN performs well on heterophilous datasets. However, I suggest the authors to further discuss the potential reasons why GGCN performs worse than several baselines given that the analysis in Sec. 3 does not show the signed messages and degree corrections may hurt model performance on homophilous graphs. 2) The ablation study results in Table B.1 seem to be not aligned with the results in Table 2. When the number of layer increases, GGCN's performance seems to be stable in Table 1 but all the variants seem to decay much in Table B.1. I suggest the authors to further explain the difference between these results.\n\nThe signed messages require to compute pair-wise cosine similarities on node embeddings. It would be better if the authors can append a scalability analysis to compare GGCN with baselines on training/inference efficiency.",

While the previous version of the paper was basically the same in the technical and experimental contents, the presentation was lacking clarity a lot. Great parts have been rewritten now, and I appreciate the efforts of the authors in addressing these issues.

This article asserts that the relative degree and homophily level account for node representation movement and further affect the likelihood of misclassification. \n\nThe contributions of this paper are as follows: \n1) it attempts to establish a connection between heterophily and over-smoothing by identifying common causes; \n2) it establishes that the relative degree and homophily level have an effect on the misclassification rate; and \n3) it also designs and presents a model that allows for negative interactions between nodes, which is shown to be robust to over-smoothing and capable of achieving state-of-the-art performance on heterophily datasets.",
            "main_review": "Strength:\n- The idea of finding the common causes of the two problems instead of simply releasing them separately is very enlightening. It is a good starting point for tackling these two problems from a theoretical perspective.\n- Theoretical analysis is provided and it is technically sound.\n- This paper justifies the introduction of the signed messages in solving these two problems in a more general setting.\n\nWeakness:\n- Theorems are based on probably many assumptions.\n- The theorems fail to prove that the relative degree would affect the misclassification rate. On one hand, in theorem 1, high-homophily nodes with a relatively low degree will move toward the original boundary and the opposite class in the shallow layers. However, based on this theorem, they will not flip the labels because the parameters will never be negative. On the other hand, the effective homophily of the nodes is actually the only factor in theorem 2. The proof of Theorem 2 in appendix A.4 actually verifies that the relative degree has no effect in this process.\n- In this paper, high/low homophily/heterophily are defined by comparing the node's homophily level with the homophily level of the whole graph. When we discuss the heterophily problem faced by the GCNs, we are mostly talking about the heterophily level of the graph. Unluckily, the homophily level defined in this paper cannot be translated into the homophily level of the graph. That is to say, a graph with an average homophily level higher than 0.5 doesn't guarantee that it has more nodes with a homophily level higher than the average. At the same time, the empirical experiments are conducted on a collective level (performance on the whole graph on average) instead of on each node. I have to say the theory and the experiment are not well combined.\n",

It is actually exciting to see a paper that tries to link the two widely existing problems of GCNs together theoretically. However, although the theorems presented in the paper are actually correct, they don't support the conclusion that the authors claim.\n\nAfter reading the other reviews, I would choose to maintain my opinion, and the lack of innovation is my primary concern.",
