        "comment": "The paper proposes an algorithm for unsupervised skill transfer between robots with different kinematics. Integral to the approach is the idea that while the robots differ, they may use similar strategies to perform similar tasks. Without access to paired data, the paper formulates the problem of learning correspondences between robots as one of matching skill distributions across robots. Drawing insights from work in machine translation, the paper proposes an unsupervised objective that encourages the model to learn to align the distribution over skill sequences. Experimental results demonstrate the ability to use learned skill correspondences to support transfer across different robots in different domains.\n\nAs several reviewers point out, the problem of learning to transfer skills across robots with different kinematic designs from video demonstrations raises a number of interesting challenges that are relevant to the robotics and learning communities. Among them, a fundamental contribution of the paper is the ability to learn skill correspondences in an unsupervised manner based on unlabeled demonstrations. The approach by which this is achieved (i.e., using distribution matching) is sensible and clearly described. While the reviewers agree on the significance of the research problem, they raise a few key concerns regarding the initial submission. Among them are questions about the nature and extent of the domain variations that the method can handle (e.g., between robots with different degrees-of-freedom); the significance of the contributions; and how this work is situated in the context of existing approaches to robot skill learning. Several reviewers question the definition of morphological variation and comment that these variations may violate the assumption that task strategies are similar across designs. The authors provided detailed feedback to each of the reviews, which helps to clarify several of these concerns. Unfortunately, several reviewers did not respond to multiple requests to update their reviews. The one who did decided to maintain their score.\n\nThe paper tackles an important problem in robot learning and the work has the potential to have significant impact on the way in which robots acquire new skills. The original submission together with the author responses suggest that there is are solid contributions here. The authors are strongly encouraged to revisit the discussion of the approach to more clearly convey the novelty of the approach and to consider experimental evaluations that better support these claims."

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper proposed to learn skills correspondences between robots of different morphologies in an unsupervised way - without requiring paired data from the robots. They learn a skill translation model that maps skills from a source robot to a target robot. The translation model is learned by minimizing a loss composed of two components: (1) the likelihood of the translated skills under the target distribution estimated from target robot skills data, and (2) the likelihood of the target skills under the translated distribution estimated from the translated skills data.\n\nThe proposed approaches hinges on the assumption that robots with different morphologies follow similar high-level strategies when performing similar tasks. So, a sequence of tasks across the robots is used to learn the skills correspondences. ",
            "main_review": "Strengths:\n\nThe paper avoids the need to manually annotate datasets with low-level correspondences between robots, which requires expertise when dealing with robots with different morphologies. Instead they provide correspondences over skills, which is much easier to specify, even by non-robotics-expert users. \n\nTheir experiments show superiority over baselines from the literature. \n\nWeaknesses:\n\nAlthough the Baxter and Sawyer have different dynamics, their kinematics are not that different. Yes, the link dimensions are different but they have the same number of degrees. I would have loved to see experiments on robots with different number of degrees of freedom as that is more challenging. The argument that the choice of robots is dictated by the availability of the datasets is kind of weak given experiments are run in simulations. It can't be hard to generate a similar dataset for other robots. \n\nI would have loved to see an ablation study on the quality of skills across the robots. Surely, the data generation process needs to make sure there is some alignment of tasks across the robots. How much of this has an effect on the quality of the translated skills?\n\nI would have also loved to see an analysis of the training time of the translation model in relation to the time it takes to learn the skill from scratch with the target robot.\n\nOne important aspect of transfer that is usually ignored, is the cost of transfer compared to learning from scratch. And the cost could be the time it takes to collect data to learn the translation model compared to learning the skills from scratch using the target robot. Of course, using data already existing avoids this but is still a problem for robot for which data doesn't exist. See [1] as an example, albeit in a different domain.\n\nIt's not clear if the translation model is evaluated on unseen skills or trajectories. My guess is no. How well does it generalize to unseen skills?\n\nIn Table 2, how come rewards in the source domain are higher than in the target for the HRL baseline? Especially between Bax-R and Bax-L. How different are these tasks when performed with either the right or left hands?\n\nMoreover, why should we expect the translated trajectories obtain higher rewards in the target domain than in the source domain? Especially between left and right hands.\n\n1.

            "main_review": "\nThe idea of being able to reproduce skill sequences between different robots based on videos or visual demonstrations is a very hard problem with potentially very impactful applications!\n\nIn this current work, I am not quite sure what is considered as morphologically different? Does it refer to different kinematics or robots with different DOFs?\nDepending on this definition, the assumption: “different morphological robots use similar task strategies (in terms of sequences of skills) to solve similar tasks” might not always hold. Although the high-level of semantic skill sequences might be the same, the actual trajectories corresponding to those skills can be significantly different.\n\nIt would be useful to clearly emphasise the contributions of the approach, as many parts rely on TVI introduced in Shankar & Gupta (2020).\n\nI am not sure how Eysenbach et al. (2019) and Sharma et al. (2020) are related to the presented approach. However, I think there are several older related works, which would help provide context and give motivation to the proposed approach, such as:\n- Movement primitives:\n  - Kober, J. and Peters, J.

            "main_review": "\nStrengths:\n\n+ The idea of transferring skills between robots with different morphologies is interesting. \n\n+ Presentation of the technical approach is clear.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n- What are the theoretical novelties? The novelty of the paper is not clearly discussed and justified in the paper. The idea of using forward and backward losses in the objective function is widely used to maintain consistency in domain adaptation and transfer learning. \n\n- The insight/premise that differently morphological robots follow similar strategies to address similar tasks seems questionable. For robot manipulation, this can be true. But for robot locomotion as an example, this assumption may not hold: robots can perform locomotion by walking, crawling, hopping, and wheeling, based on the morphology of the robot. How does the premise hold in general robotics tasks?\n\n- The terms (skill, strategy, and mode) are confusing, and it is hard to imagine these terms in the context of a robotics application. Can the authors provide a concrete scenario of robots using a sequence of skills to complete a task? What are the examples of skills, strategies, and modes in that concrete scenario?\n\n- What is the runtime (or computational cost) of the proposed approach and other compared methods? How many iterations are used for the algorithm to converge? The paper argues efficiency several times, but does not provide clear theoretical analysis or experimental support. \n\n- How to segment a sequence of observations into skill tuples? How the start and end points of each skill are determined when segmenting a long sequence?\n\n- “Analysing qualitative skill translations” in the experimental section 4.1 has no experimental support. No experimental results are provided to justify the statements in this subsection.\n\n- It is not convincing to argue the left arm and the right arm of a Baxter robot have a different morphology in the experiments. The Sawyer robot and the Baxter robot’s arms also have similar design and configurations. In the application of robot manipulation, suction cups, soft grippers and traditional mechanical grippers can be considered as morphologically different robots, or maybe robot arms with obvious differences, e.g., in terms of degrees of freedom. How the proposed approach can be generalized to transfer skills among these robots with obvious morphological differences?\n",
