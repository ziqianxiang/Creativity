        "comment": "The paper made a solid theoretical contribution on the adversarial  generalization bounds of multi-layer neural networks.\n\nHowever, the paper, at the current form, has many issues in the claim that \"the product of the norm can explain the generalization gap\":\n\n(1). Weight decay. The authors uses the weight norm as the proxy for generalization gap, however, it is unclear to me that \"adversarial trained networks have a larger generalization gap\" can be explained by the product of weight norms. To carefully verify this, the authors have to at least carefully tune the weight decay, to the largest possible extend so the generalization error is not hurt, and compare the product of the weight norms in this scenario.  Without weight decay, the neural networks might learn a lot of redundancies in the weights (especially with adversarial training)  which makes the product of the norm to be too large. \n\nThe authors do perform experiments showing that with weight decay, the generalization gap becomes smaller and the norms become smaller, however, it is totally unclear to me that the weight decay considered in the experiments are actually optimal -- It could still be the case that with proper weight decay, the product of the norms in adversarial training is actually smaller comparing to that of the clean training. \n\n\nMoreover, the authors should also clarify that **the product of the norms, according to the experiments, are simply too large and they can not be used in the theoretical result to get any meaningful generalization bounds**.\n\n\n\n(2). The product of the norm in Rademacher complexity  is tight: This  claim only holds for neural networks with 1 neurons per layer. Once there are more than one neurons, there can simply be one neuron that learns f(x) and the other learns -f(x) and they completely cancels each other. So the product of the norm is obviously NOT TIGHT for any neural network with MORE than ONE NEURON per layer. In fact, the gap can be INFINITELY large. \n\n\nUnfortunately, I like the paper very much and I hope this paper could be published, however, the claims  \"the product of the norm can explain the generalization gap\" is simply too misleading and ill-supported. I encourage the authors to completely remove this claim and submit the paper to COLT."

Although the authors verified that the product of weight norm in adversarial training is indeed much larger than that in standard training, I think this is not a strong empirical verification of the proposed bound. The reason is there existing some constants in the bounds in adversarial training and standard training, which may be different. Therefore, simply comparing the product of the weight norm is not rigorous. I would like to see more discussion on this. We know that some of the existing deep learning theory may be only mathematically correct, thus providing sufficient empirical evidence to show the consistence between the theory and practice is important. \n\n2. There exists a product of the weight norm in the proposed bound, which implies that the trained model can generalize better if this product is smaller. Therefore, can we use some techniques to regularize this product during training to improve the generalization ability.

Compared with existing literature which try to show other variants of adversarial Rademacher complexity, this paper directly works on adversarial Rademacher complexity itself. This paper provides both the lower bound and the upper bound. Besides, this paper conduct numerical experiments to combine with the theoretical bound to justify why adversarial training has a worse generalization than standard training.",

It directly overcomes the difficulties in deriving adversarial Rademacher complexity rather than using other variants. It provides both the upper bound and lower bound, both of which are important. \n\nHowever, there are still a lot of things that can be improved in this paper. Below are my major concerns towards this paper (ordered in importance). My rating is currently weak accept given the importance of the upper and lower bounds, but it could be adjusted based on the author response towards my concerns. \n\n[1] My understanding towards the adversarial training and the adversarial Rademacher complexity is that, both adversarial-trained and standard-trained neural networks have their own standard Rademacher complexity and adversarial Rademacher complexity. So \"the generalization gap of adversarial training loss and adversarial testing loss\" is larger than \"the generalization gap of standard training loss and standard testing loss\" for both adversarial-trained (denote as A and B) and standard-trained neural networks (denote as C and D), i.e. A>B and C>D. On the other hand, through experiments, it is observed that the adversarially trained neural networks obtains larger norms, so its generalization is worse, i.e. A>D. Is my understanding correct? Is it essential to provide evidence for A>C or B>D in other to conclude A>D? In Figure 1, what does the \"generalization gap\" refer to?\n\nIn addition, could you provide some insights on why the norm of adversarially trained model is larger? Why does increasing the samples size lead to a larger norm/margin? Also, given these observations, is there any way to improve the generalization performance of adversarial training? Is there any implications on the loss landscape of adversarial robust neural networks? The current Section 6 displays some observations but no detailed insights.\n\n[1](as important as the above) The current proof of Theorem 3 only says \"By the results of the lower bounds of ..., we obtain that ...\". Please provide more details on the existing results and how to obtain the final result. Please provide some concrete illustrations to this either in pdf or in the discussion. \n\n[3] The literature review of generalization of adversarial training in this paper only considers those about Rademacher complexity.

It would be great if the authors could make it clear about the following questions when describing the proof steps in Theorem 1:\n\n   (1) Which steps are different from the derivation of standard Rademacher complexity? Which steps are not essential? If we use Theorem 1 and take \\epsilon=0, what steps should we modify to obtain the standard Rademacher complexity mentioned in Section 5.3?\n\n   (2) Which steps are different from the literature about adversarial Rademacher complexity?
