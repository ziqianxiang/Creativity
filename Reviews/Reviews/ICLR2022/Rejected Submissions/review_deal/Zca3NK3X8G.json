        "comment": "This paper proposes an architecture of a policy network (WaveCorr) that is particularly effective for portfolio management tasks.  A key observation that leads to the design of WaveCorr is that the dependency across asset should be treated differently from the dependency across time.  The proposed WaveCorr has the property that it is \"permutation invariant\" with respect to assets, which means that the class of functions that can be represented by WaveCorr is invariant to permutation of assets.  WaveCorr is shown to achieve the state-of-the-art performance in a portfolio management task.\n\nA major point of discussion was the definition of \"permutation invariance\".  The reviewers and AC understood the difference between the permutation invariance defined in this paper and that studied in the prior work (the output of a network is insensitive to the permutation of the particular values of the input).  With the definition in this paper, however, a fully connected layer is permutation invariant, but the Corr layer proposed in the paper appears to have more structure.  It is unclear exactly what properties of the Corr layer leads to the performance improvement."

Such a scheme mainly introduces a permutation invariance property, and it is very interesting.",
            "main_review": "Strengths: \n1. The target issue of creating permutation invariant policy networks for DRL is fundamentally interesting and important.\n2. The proposed design is well-grounded and has potential applications.\n3. The theoretical characterizations are appreciated.\n\nWeaknesses:\n1. The portfolio management task is a good example but should be treated as an application, not a goal.\n    Such a permutation invariant policy network may have more applications.\n2. For comparison methods of the portfolio management task, beside equal weight (EW), it is also expected to compare with minimum variance or mean-variance strategy, which are also widely used.\n3. In Table 2~4, the maximum drawdown seems to be relatively high, over 20%?  which is not normal. Please check carefully.\n\n",

The illustration of the architecture and its specificity is also detailed.\n\n2. The paper presents a reasonable solution to deal with permutation invariance across assets, which is a relevant problem in portfolio optimization with deep learning.\n\n3. The paper presents experimental results on real-world data that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to the alternatives in consideration.\n\nWeakness:\n1. Presentation: The description of the architecture is not clear. The intention of some of the components, such as causal convolution, skip connections are not specified. Related work such as WaveNet is not well discussed. \n\n2. Contribution: While the paper identifies the asset permutation invariance property and proposed a solution to deal with this problem in portfolio optimization, I find this contribution somewhat limited because permutation invariance as a general property is not new.\n\n3. Experiments: While the proposed method is validated on various datasets competing with various existing methods, it is not clear to me whether the compared methods are indeed state-of-the-art as claimed.

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper develops the first CNN based portfolio optimization network named **WaveCorr**, which is capable of capturing both temporal and cross-sectional correlation structure for the training data. The paper proposes a new type of the permutation invariant (PI) principle for a class of functions (e.g., neural network blocks), and it demonstrates that \\texttt{WaveCorr} structure satisfies the PI principle. By conducting numerical studies using data from both Canadian (TSX) and American (S\\&P 500) stock markets, the paper testifies the superior performance of **WaveCorr** in terms of Sharpe ratio and stability, compared with several benchmark models.",
            "main_review": "I have following major comments on the paper:\n\nPros:\n\n- For financial data, the estimation of correlation structure is a notoriously hard problem prone to overfitting, due to low signal-to-noise ratio and high dimensional nature of covariance matrix. In my personal view, the PI principle can be viewed as another regularization structure to reduce the complexity of the function class, thus alleviate the over-fitting problem. The idea of adding the corr layer and the result that **WaveCorr** portfolio policy network architecture satisfies the PI property are interesting.\n\n- The numerical section is well structured and the training procedures are reported in detail.  \n\nCons:\n- The paper discusses in Remark 3.1 about the distinction of definition of PI between this paper and the previous literature, but it seems to me that the motivation for this part is still insufficient. Except for the fact that the architecture in this paper violates the PI in previous literature, is there any other motivation or intuition to define PI in the current setting?\n\n- The current approach seems also applicable to long-short portfolio (i.e., $\\sum w_i = 0$). Is it possible to include some simple test in the appendix to test the performance in this setting?\n\n- In the numerical part, the standard deviations reported in tables solely reflect the randomness in selection of assets, but fail to capture the uncertainty from temporal variation. For example, one question to consider is: what would be the ex-ante standard deviation estimation, if the proposed portfolio is traded in the next year? If this part is not addressed, one can not rule out the possibility that the superior performance of the proposed method is due to a lucky test period.",
