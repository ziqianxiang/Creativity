        "comment": "This paper has been reviewed by four expert reviewers who gave diverging scores. The three negative reviewers have provided significant constructive feedback. The main criticism is the lack of novelty and clarity in the paper. The authors have submitted their rebuttal which did not improve the scores of these reviewers. After the discussion phase, the paper did not obtain any support for acceptance and stayed under the acceptance threshold. Following the reviewers' recommendation, the meta reviewer recommends rejection."

The authors introduce a domain discriminator on pairs\nof graph-level embedding and address the issue of few-shot learning in graph data. The proposed method is tested on 3 benchmark datasets and achieves good performance compared to the prior approaches.",

There is a lot of prior work which is not discussed in the paper. \n\n[1] Lei, K., Qin, M., Bai, B., Zhang, G., and Yang, M., 2019, April.

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper proposes a method to resolve the issue of domain imbalanced dataset in graph link prediction. The proposed method uses adversarial training to generate graph embeddings that are domain agnostic in order to facilitate transfer learning cross domains. The paper uses T-SNE plot of graph embedding to gain insights of the best scenarios for applying the proposed methods. The paper compares the proposed method with heuristics-based and GNN-based domain adaptation methods using experiments.\n",
            "main_review": "Strength\nThe proposed domain adaptive method of using adversarial training is well described.\nThe experimental results support the effectiveness of the proposed method.\nThe T-SNE plots add good insights of the proposed method, can facilitate its applicability.\n\nWeakness\nThe paper hasn’t discussed the key difference between the proposed method and the DANN (Domain-Adversarial NN). It made it harder to assess the novelty of the proposed method. The paper seems like a direct application of DANN on a new problem, link prediction using GNN.\n\nThe paper’s experimental settings might not be close to a real world scenario. The paper selects 10 samples for other domains and only 1 sample for an imbalanced domain. How likely is this a real world scenario? This simple scenario makes it hard to justify the universal applicability of the proposed method.\n",

In few-shot learning, we usually consider how to leverage a few instances to learn a generalizable model. This paper defines and creates a few-shot situation for graph link prediction, but the proposed method does not consider how to effectively use “few-shot” and how to guarantee the trained model can be generalized well to new tasks with 0/few training steps. \n2.\tThe definition of “domain” in this paper is unclear. For instance, why select multiple domains from the same single graph in ogbn-products? Should we consider the selected domains as “different domains”?\n3.\tThe application of adversarial learning in few-shot learning is confusing. Adversarial learning in domain adaptation aims to learn domain-invariant representations, but why do we need such kind of representation in few-shot learning?\n",
