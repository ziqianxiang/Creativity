        "comment": "This paper presents a second-order optimization algorithm for neural nets which extends LeCun's classic Lagrangian framework. The paper derives a method for computing the exact Newton step for a single training example for a multilayer perceptron. It then describes approximations that can be used to extend the method to more examples.\n\nThe authors claim to have spotted factual errors in the reviews. However, I've looked into the issues, and I find myself agreeing with the reviewers on each of those points (or, if there are misunderstandings, they result from a lack of clarity in the paper rather than insufficient scientific computing background on the part of the reviewers).\n\nThe authors claim to have solved a longstanding problem by giving an efficient method for calculating the stochastic Newton step (for a single training example). However, it's not clear this is very useful; as a reviewer points out, estimating the curvature with a single example can't give a very accurate estimate. Once the method is extended to batches, more approximations are required. I also agree with the reviewers that the later parts of the methods section appear a bit rushed.\n\nAs the reviewers point out, in the experimental comparisons, the proposed method seems to underperform SGD with momentum even in terms of epochs, which is the setting where second-order methods usually shine. Other second-order optimizers (e.g. K-FAC) have been shown to outperform first-order methods in terms of both wall clock time and epochs, so epochwise improvement seems like the minimum bar for a second-order optimization paper."

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper claims that it is possible to compute the Newton method's update exactly for deep neural networks (multi-layer perceptrons).\nThe motivation is that Newton's method, as a second-order optimizer that includes loss curvature information, should improve upon first-order optimizers, such as gradient descent, that use only first derivatives (gradient) of the loss. Second order methods tipically converge in a smaller number of iterations, but each update is expensive to compute and that's why they are not widely used in practice.\nIt must be noted that Newton's method is almost never mentioned in the context of Neural Networks (NN), because it is only guaranteed to converge for convex loss functions (which is clearly not the case for NN). However, the authors claim they have some tricks to fix that. ",
            "main_review": "In summary, my opinion is that the paper falls well short of its claims, for the following reasons:\n\n1) The approximations involved are sometimes crude and often not well motivated. For example:\n- What the authors call \"stochastic case\", is truly the \"batch size = 1\" case. I do not expect training with one data point per update to work in reasonable circumstances.\n- I think approximating the inverse of H by knowing just its product with a single vector is unreasonable. Basically, we know the curvature of the loss along one direction only (which we can't even control)! I don't think there is any point in doing that, one is better served by using standard diagonal approximations of the Hessian or the Fisher matrix, as done in several previous work. In that case we actually know the curvature along several directions.\n- The fact that only the bias, and not the weights, contribute to divergence of the Netwon's update worries me a lot, I don't expect that to happen in any reasonable circumstance. It suggests that all the approximations made are highly unrealistic.\n- Part of the motivation is to go beyond the approximations made in previous work, but the authors end up making them anyway towards the end, e.g. the K-FAC like approximation.\n- The assumption that the effect of variance is negligible in Eq.(27) is completely unjustified.\n\n\n2) The writing of the paper is quite poor, and it goes worse and worse towards the end, with several typos and confusing statements. It looked like the authors struggled to finish the paper in time for the submission deadline. For example:\n- I appreciate that the authors provide Section 1 to remind readers how to derive backpropagation using lagrange multipliers. That is very intuitive, introducing auxiluary variables and lagrange multipliers does not change the final result. However, when moving to section 2, it is completely unclear where the Newton's update comes from.\n- Several sections towards the end of the paper are cunfusing and out of context, such as: \"Probability distribution/weights\", \"Notes on convergence\", \"To batch or not to batch\". \n- Notation and nomenclature are highly confusing. Besides using symbols that are different from standard convention, which is maybe OK, they use confusing wording: \"positive symmetric matrices\" instead of \"positive definite matrices\", \"adjoint state vectors\" instead of \"lagrange multipliers\".\n\n3) Finally, the \"Results\" section: by just looking at the plots, it seems that the proposed method is worse than most of competitors. Even worse, there is no comment or interpretation to make sense of the results.\n\n",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes a stochastic second order method to train neural network under some specific regularisation criterion. The method is based on the Sifrian, an extension of the Lagrangian that splits the definition of the gradient of each layer's parameter as different constraints with their own multiplier. Solving the best direction from the Sifrian is complicated in the general case but can be done when considering only one sample. This allows for a stochastic algorithm to train the neural network. Finally, some limited  numerical experiments are conducted.",
            "main_review": "Overall assessment\n==================\n\nOverall, I find the paper hard to read and follow, in particular due to the notations (see section bellow). The introduction of the Sifrian is not really justified (**Q1**). It seems to derive from a splitted problem with auxillary variables but this is never explicited. In particular, I believe there is a link with ADMM training that use such auxillary variable which should be explicited (**Q2**). Moreover, the results only apply to very specific networks and these constraints are not discussed (**Q3**) and the numerical experiments are not really convincing (**Q4**). For these reasons, I feel that the paper is not ready for publication and I recomend rejection.\n\n**Q1:** Overall, I feel that the approach is not well justified in the current manuscript. In the Sifrian, it is unclear why the loss function is omitted? It is also unclear why one can choose in Eq.(14) quantities to be equals to what is proposed. In Eq.(15), it is not clear why $H$ would be the Hessian. Indeed, if $G,g$ were the gradient, it would be the Hessian but here, $G$ and $g$ are variables so it is unclear why it is exactly the Hessian. Overall, I feel that these missing justification is mainly due to an unclear exposition but this makes it very hard to get an intuition on why this method should work.\n\n**Q2:** The proposed approach looks very similar to ADMM training for neural network (see for instance [A]). This paper should be mentionned and the main difference with the proposed method shoudl be highlighted.  Also, could you explain what is the main advantage of the Sifrian compared to the Augmented Lagrangian?\n\n**Q3:** The assumptions for this method are not standard and are scattered across the paper. This makes it hard to know when this method can be applied. Indeed, the specific regularisation, the need for a white layer, a strictly monotonous do not appear in a common place when exposing the contribution. Moreover, the limitation they introduce are not really discuss.\n\n**Q4:** The numerical evalution of the method is not really convincing. The scale of the considered problem is really small (MNIST and CURVE). The proposed method is not performing better than the other methods, neither in iteration or in time. For the other methods, the choice of parameters is not really discussed (for instance, is the `SGDMomentum` method slow on CURVE beccause of the choice of step size). Also, the implementation of the proposed method also include steps that are not discussed in the main manuscript to avoid overfitting, using moving average with an extra parameter. While this probably helps with variance reduction, discussing this in the main part of the paper seems necessary.\n\n\nMinor comments, nitpicks and typos\n----------------------------------\n\n- **M1:** The need for the white layer seems very artificial. I would be surprised that it cannot be removed by specifying this constraint in the Sifrian. \n\n- p.2: note$^1$ -> a CNN is a FNN. It would be better to say that while only dense networks are considered, this also applies to CNN.\n- p.2 _notation $x_p(n)$ -> usually, using exponent notation $x^{(p)}$ for sample number makes it more readable, to avoid collapsing with coordinate selection and layer numbering in the compact notation.\n- p.2 _\"$p$ designs one single pattern\"_ -> $p$ designs a single sample.\n- p.2 _Compact notation_: The 2 sets of notations make it confusing and I think only using the compact notation would make the paper clearer.\n- Definition.1: use a definition environment to make it clearer where the definition starts and stops.\n- Eq.(4): it is not clear immediatly that $x$ is the activation of all layers.\n- p.4 _\"Our approach to extend the Lagrangian consists of\"_ -> \"consits in\".\n- Definition.2: I dont understand why you did not use $b_p$ instead of $\\gamma_p$ to make the notation more consistent with Eq.(5)? I think this is the same term as in the Lagrangian and not changing this would help the reader follow.\n- Eq.(12): I think there is a missing $g(W, \\beta, x, b)$.\n- p.5: _The first equation becomes_ -> Not sure why $b_{p, k}$ disappears and why the indexes  are not `2..n`.\n- p.7: _\"which by construction overfits to every pattern\"_ -> overfits every sample.\n- p.7: _\"The last layer bias nature depend\"_ -> depends.\n- Eq.(25): put variable relatively to which you minimize under the argmin.\n\n\nExtra References\n----------------\n\n[A] Taylor, G., Burmeister, R., Xu, Z., Singh, B., Patel, A. and Goldstein, T., 2016.

            "main_review": "This manuscript is among the many proposals of applying a second-order method to train neural network models. The problem being tackled is for sure of great interest, but unfortunately, this manuscript fails to provide a meaningful solution to this open problem.\nThe major issues of the manuscript include:\n\n1. Both the numerical result and the theoretical contributions are weak. Usually we expect a paper with either a strong theoretical result or outstanding numerical performance. Unfortunately, the numerical results show that the proposed method performs significantly inferior to existing methods, even in terms of the number of epochs and in terms of the training objective, for which usually second-order methods stand out. From the theoretical side, the auxiliary function for deriving the algorithm is not well-motivated, and the derived algorithm, although directly associated with the auxiliary function, has only weak connection with the original objective to minimize.\n\n2. Another issue is that there is no convergence guaantees for the proposed algorithm. The authors claimed that the framework of Sunehag et al. (2009) could be applied, but the assumptions in that work require a unique global minimizer, which is not verifiable at all for neural network models.\n\n3. I also have strong concerns against the claim of escaping saddles in Section 3.1. Usually in nonconvex optimization like the training of neural network models, escaping saddle points is referred to preventing the iterates from trapped in saddle points of the training objective, but the discussion in sec 3.1 is simply discussing how to obtain a descent direction in general. The terminology is quite confusing.\n\n4. Overall speaking, the motivation of the proposed auxiliary function and of the algorithm is weak and the readability of the paper can be significantly improved. It was extremely hard for me to understand what the authors would like to express, but the concepts could actually be made much more intuitive. Even in the preliminary part of introducing backpropagation, the path the authors took is abstruse, while back propagation itself should be a simple concept by viewing from the simple chain rules. The proposed auxiliary function is also hard to understand the intuition behind and its connection with the optimization of the original objective. What the auxiliary function describes and why we want to solve for the point satisfying (12) are not clearly described nor motivated, and clearly its connection to finding a second-order step for the training objective is weak. The modification of the update step to make it a descent one also looks like quite arbitrary, and if the original update direction is \"Newton\", this change for sure destroys the meaning of the derivation.\n\nI have read the authors' responses, and some misunderstandings of the regularizer are clarified. But the quality of the work still remains a huge concern and my reccomendation for this manuscript remains unchanged.\n\n",
