The main idea is to alternate learning of the representation and the classifier. \nReviewers pointed out that several papers already addressed this learning setup, often under the name \"imbalanced semi-supervised learning\". No rebuttal was submitted. \n\nThe paper should make direct comparison to recent papers listed by reviewers, both in terms of the technical approach and in terms of empirical experiments. It cannot be accepted tot ICLR."

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes a new setting--semi-supervised long-tailed recognition. To harness the imbalanced unlabeled data, the authors combined the decoupling in long-tailed recognition and pseudo-labeling in semi-supervised learning, which formulates a three-stage method. Stage 1 generates pseudo-labels with a classifier trained with class-aware resampling. Stage 2 fine-tunes the feature extractor on with pseudo-labeling. Stage 3 trains the classifier with class-aware resampling on top of the refined feature extractor. Experiments indicate that the proposed method outperforms baselines.",
            "main_review": "Pros:\n1)\tI believe this work is well motivated. The setting is more realistic than supervised imbalanced recognition in that imbalance usually comes together with unlabeled datasets. In this case, randomly sampling a part of the examples and labeling them manually is reasonable. In this sense, the proposed setting is more closed to what practitioners will encounter in the wild.\n2)\tThe manuscript is overall well-written and easy to follow. The authors introduce the setting and the motivations clearly. The contributions are also clearly summarized. \n3)\tThe intuition behind each stage of the method is stated clearly and emphasized. From my perspective, the proposed method is not a simple combination of pseudo-labeling with decoupling since the authors managed to associate each part of the networks with different training stages and take the effect of imbalance on pseudo-labels into consideration.\n\nCons:\n1)\tThe baselines are not strong enough. Although the proposed method outperforms the baselines by a large margin, it is still not clear how good the performance is. For supervised imbalanced recognition, the authors consider LDAM+DRW and decoupling as baselines. For standard semi-supervised learning, the authors compare with pseudo-labeling and mean teacher. However, these are not recent state-of-the-arts. It would be better to compare with leading methods on https://paperswithcode.com/sota/long-tail-learning-on-imagenet-lt and better semi-supervised methods such Fixmatch and Noisy student training.\n2)\tIt is unclear how the pseudo-labels are refined by stages 2 and 3. The authors should provide numbers or figures to demonstrate the effect of stages 2 and 3 separately.\n3)\tFor this setting, a more natural method could be: train the representations on all data with self-supervised learning, and fine-tune the representations with the supervised data, and train the final classifier with class aware-sampling. It could e interesting to compare with this baseline.\n",

They consider both of the labelled data and unlabelled data exhibit long-tailed distribution. To solve the problem, they propose an alternate sampling framework which learns the feature and classifier separately and update them iteratively. On two datasets, the results validate the efficacy of proposed method.",
            "main_review": "Strengths:\n1. The author propose the new setting of semi-supervised long-tailed recognition, where both labelled and unlabelled data are long-tailed. \n2. This paper is well-written, clear and easy to understand. The structure of this paper is also good.\n3. The proposed 3-staged method seems reasonable. I am not sure if the author is based on the findings that some balanced strategy, like class-balanced sampling, will hurt the quality of learned feature. Even they achieve better results. The improvement lies in classifier. Thus the  authors update the feature and classifier separately.\n\nWeaknesses:\n1. It is also about the new setting proposed. It is actually more like considering the characteristics of long tail in semi-supervised learning. It may not so significant by constraining that the unlabelled data also exhibit long-tailed distribution in long-tailed recognition. As claimed, the unlabelled data will help our classification, that means we may use as many as unlabelled data as possible, for example, the open-set data.\n\n2. Even we consider the long tailed case in unlabelled data, should we consider different long tailed versions? for example, the unlabelled data maybe uniformly distributed? The degree of skewness is less or more severe than the labelled data? Even worse, the many-, medium-, few- classes in unlabelled data may shift since the collected labelled data are easily biased. \n\n3. In Table 1, the overall results are the best. However, the few- accuracy of proposed methods seems lower than \"Pseudo-Label + L\" and \"Mean-teacher+L\". Why is the case? One motivation of proposed method is trying to improve the result when predicting the label of unlabelled data. It seems contradictory with the motivation. The proposed method did not improve the result of few-classes.\n\n",

Semi-supervised long-tailed recognition has already been studied with the name of imbalanced semi-supervised learning [1,2,3].\n\n2. The proposed method is also not novel. In Eq. (2), the authors propose to use temporal consistency loss for learning unlabeled data, which is similar to the method of [5]. This is already outdated in the semi-supervised learning literature where better loss functions [6,7] or pseudo-labeling-based methods [8] show the state-of-the-art performances.\n\n3. The main technical contribution, alternating sampling is also nothing but simple engineering that any long-tailed recognition or semi-supervised learning researchers do. In order to claim the significance of the proposed method, the authors should have at least provided a more comprehensive analysis on the proposed method (e.g., with different imbalance factors).\n\n4. The experiment is also too weak. The authors should have evaluated the proposed method on more training setups (at least one more imbalance factor) and more realistic datasets (iNaturalist [9] or other large-scale datasets) compared with stronger baseline methods (imbalanced semi-supervised learning [2,3], recent long-tailed recognition [10], or at least the FixMatch [8]).\n\n[1] Hyun et al., Class-imbalanced semi-supervised learning. arXiv 2020.\n\n[2] Kim et al., Distribution aligning refinery of pseudo-label for imbalanced semi-supervised learning.

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes a long-tailed semi-supervised learning setting where both labeled and unlabeled data from a long-tailed distribution exist. To address this setting, they use an iterative decoupling training method, which is based on Kang et al 2020. The only difference is after initialization using the original decoupling method, pseudo labels are obtained from unlabeled data and the feature extractor is updated with pseudo labels, then the classifier is updated using the new feature representations. Two new benchmarks are provided, and the methods had improved performance over selected baselines. ",
            "main_review": "The biggest weakness is the experiments. I am not sure why the authors choose ResNet18 as the backbone for Cifar10 experiments. In previous papers, people are using ResNet32, and even without the help of unlabeled data, the results on Cifar10-LT (imbalance 100) were already over 70% using ResNet32 (for example the baselines, not the actual method, reported in this paper [1]). It is hard to judge how good the proposed method is by the reported results, especially when the compared baselines are limited. Most of the existing long-tail methods after decoupling are not compared in the experiments (for example, BBN[2], logit-adjustment[3], and RIDE[4]). Although these methods were not designed for semi-supervised learning, simply adding a pseudo-label component to these baselines is not complicated. In addition, advanced semi-supervised learning methods (like FixMatch[5]) are not discussed either.\n\nBesides the experiments, I think the proposed method lacks novelty as well. Simply adding a pseudo-label component to the decoupling training procedure is too engineering. Since this paper is not a theoretical paper, the novelty of the method is a little more important. \n\n\n[1] Cai, J., Wang, Y., & Hwang, J. N. (2021).

            "main_review": "Strength:\n\n1. The idea of alternating the sampling strategy is very simple yet powerful. \n2. The paper identifies an important problem for using pseudo-label in long-tailed learning: the problem with inaccurate pseudo-labels exacerbates when employing class-balanced sampling. The finding comes with solid empirical evidence (Table 2) and analysis (Sect 3.5).\n3. The empirical results are promising. The proposed method outperforms the existing methods by a significant margin (Table 1). Sufficient ablation studies are provided. Particularly, I find the loop-wise pseudo label accuracy shown in Table 3 insightful.\n\n\nWeakness:\n\n1. A semi-supervised feature learning baseline is missing.\n\n   This is my main concern about the paper. The key argument in the paper is that feature learning and classifier learning should 1) be decoupled, 2) use random sampling and class-balanced sampling respectively, 3) train on all labels and only ground-truth labels respectively. The authors, therefore, propose a carefully designed alternate sampling strategy.\n\n   However, a more straightforward strategy could be 1) train a feature extractor ($f$ in the paper) and a classifier ($g\\prime$ in the paper) using random sampling and any semi-supervised learning method on all data, then 2) freeze the feature extractor ($f$) and train a new classifier ($g$ in the paper) using class-balanced sampling on data with ground-truth labels. Compared with the alternate sampling strategy proposed in this paper, the semi-supervised feature learning baseline will take less implementation effort and is easier to combine with any semi-supervised learning methods.\n\n   The baseline seems to be missing in the paper. Although the naive baseline may not give the best performance, it should be compared to justify the sophisticatedly designed alternate sampling strategy.\n\n2. References are not up-to-date.\n\n   All references in the paper are in or before 2020. In fact, much research progress has been made since then. For example, some recent works [1, 2] study the class-imbalanced semi-supervised learning as well, a discussion on these methods should be necessary. A recent survey on long-tailed learning [3] could be a useful resource to help update the related works in the paper.\n\n3.
