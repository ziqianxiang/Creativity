        "comment": "This paper received a majority voting of rejection. In the internal discussion, one reviewer updated his/her score from 1 to 3 according to the author response. I have read all the materials of this paper including manuscript, appendix, comments and response. Based on collected information from all reviewers and my personal judgement, I can make the recommendation on this paper, *rejection*. Here are the comments that I summarized, which include my opinion and evidence.\n\n**Interesting Idea**\n\nEvery reviewer including me agree that the idea of modelling Bayes label transition is novel and interesting. \n\n**The motivation lacks of supportive evidence**\n\nThe second motivation that \"the feasible solution space of the Bayes label transition matrix is much smaller than that of the clean label transition matrix\" is not well supported. The authors should theoretically or empirically demonstrate this point. The current description on uncertainty is not strong enough. Moreover, if so, the benefits are not illustrated. The feasible solution space, even with a small coverage area is continuous with infinite solutions. \n\n**A new concept**\n\nThe authors tried to sell the concept of a new transition matrix, but failed. I believe it might result from the organization and presentation. The authors spent too much pages introducing others' work. At least, a formal definition of the new concept should be given. In the current version, Definition 1 is from Cheng et al., 2020 on distilled examples.\n\n**Title**\n\nLiterally from title, I guess DNN is a key component or a selling point of this paper. Actually no. We expect the authors could provide the insights on what benefits are using DNN over other techniques and how to apply DNN to estimate the transition matrix. If this is not a selling point, this word might be removed from the title.\n\n**Algorithm 1**\n\nI am a little surprised that the only algorithm listed in this paper is label noise generation. Instead the proposed algorithm of this paper is expected.\n\n**Experimental Evaluation**\n\nThe experimental results look much better than other baselines. It is a little confusing that some best results are bold, some not. \n\n**Presentation**\n\nAlthough I did not notice obvious grammar errors, some sentences are very long (3 lines). They made difficulties to follow the idea. I have to read these sentences several times. In my eyes, this is the biggest one! Presentation means how to sell the idea to audience (not only reviewers, but also future readers) in an easy understood way. The current version spent much space introducing others' work; on the contrary, the original or key part is not well illustrated. \n\nAlthough this paper has a novel idea and good experimental support, other issues listed above demonstrate the current version is not ready for a top-tier conference. No objection from reviewers was raised to again this recommendation."

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper proposes to estimate an Instance-Dependent Noise (IDN) label transition matrix. Instead of modelling the clean label transition as typically done in previous literature, the authors propose to estimate the Bayes label transition using a DNN, motivate by several advantages including theoretically guaranteed Bayes label collection and smaller feasible solution space, hence empirically easier to model. Controlled experiments show consistent improvement over other SOTA methods in noisy label transition.",
            "main_review": "To the best of my knowledge, this is the first paper that introduces to model Bayes label transition rather than clean label transition. The paper is well written and easy to follow. Results are very promising compared to other SOTA methods.\n\nMy main concern is on the novelty of the contribution. Given that the idea of modelling Bayes label transition is a new and interesting idea, the techniques are mostly based on existing works:\n- Step 1: The Bayes label collection closely follows the framework proposed by Cheng et al. (2020). Note that the extension to multiclass setting, despite being straightforward as agreed by the authors, was also presented in the Supplementary Section B in Cheng et al. (2020) already.\n- Step 2: By replacing clean labels with Bayes labels, the authors model transition matrix with a DNN. This seems to be the main contribution (as it is included in the paper title too?) but in experiments the authors simply did straightforward adaptation of standard DNN architecture for this task. Some ablation or other experiments to compare to non-parametric models for (Bayes) label transition could also support the paper.\n- Step 3: The final classification algorithm uses F-correction proposed by Patrini et al. (2017).\n\nGiven the relatively weak methodological contribution, the current paper is also a bit weak in terms of theoretical contributions. For instance,\n- As stated in Sec 1, one of the motivations for modelling Bayes label transition is that Bayes label has a smaller feature solution space hence easier to model because it is one-hot, but it would support the paper if the authors can include a formal definition and/or theoretical justification on this claim.\n- Besides, I would argue that Bayes label transition being easier to model does not mean that using Bayes labels to learn a weakly supervised model is preferred to using inferred clean labels in practice, unless the impact of error propagation from label transition to weakly supervised model is carefully studied. Again theoretical justification may strongly improve the paper.\n- In Sec 4.3, the authors acknowledged that the Bayes transition estimation through distilled examples breaks the assumption that F-correction requires an unbiased estimate of the transition matrix, but then only briefly mentioned that the network can generalise well to non-distilled examples empirically. This is only a claim at best, and also breaks the motivation that the authors are looking for classifier-consistent algorithms.\n\nOther minor concerns/suggestions:\n- Since the paper significantly relies on the distilled example collection from Cheng et al. (2020), Cheng et al. (2020) spent quite some space discussing the known issues and mitigation strategies of their distilled example collection (e.g., the automatically-collected distilled examples only is not statistically consistent, covariate shift correction, how to collect without knowledge on noise rate bound). The current paper only has ablation on the impact of noise rate bound (Sec 5.2), it would be worth discussing the impact of any other known issues of their distilled example collection on the currently proposed methods.",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The transition matrix plays a vital role in modeling label noise. Current methods focus on modeling the transition from clean labels to noisy labels. While this paper alternatively models the transition from Bayes optimal labels to noisy labels. Since we usually use the Bayes optimal labels for prediction. This transformation will not affect the practical use but makes the estimation of the matrix much easier.  Specifically, this paper designs a DNN to estimate the transition matrix. During training, the DNN can be optimized with the classifier simultaneously in an end-to-end manner.  Extensive experiments are conducted to support the proposed method.",
            "main_review": "Strengths:\n\nThis paper transforms the original clean transition matrix estimation problem to the estimation of transition from Bayes optimal labels to noisy labels, which is quite interesting and novel for the noisy label learning.  A DNN is used to estimate the transition matrix, which can be optimized simultaneously with the classifier in an end-to-end manner. This is also a major contribution in this area. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the method. And the results have shown great improvements. This can be considered as another highlight of this paper.\n\nMinor weaknesses:\n\nThe authors introduced a parametric Bayes label transition network, which is a DNN. Thus, the authors should compare the extra parameter quantity of the proposed method with those of related methods.\n\nIt would be good if the author can provide an example of the learned transition matrix from Bayes optimal labels to noisy labels. Or there should be some investigation about how the Bayes-transition matrix was being estimated, empirically or theoretically. \n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This work proposes to use *Bayes label transition matrix* (instead of the common *clean label transition matrix*) to learn from instance-dependent noisy labels. The Bayes label transition matrix is estimated by DNNs.",
            "main_review": "This paper mainly applies the idea in Cheng et al. (2020) to multiclass problems to identify \"distilled examples\". The extension is straightforward, but is problematic. The use of *Bayes label transition matrix* seems novel, but lacking justifications make it a minor novelty. Finally, using DNNs for estimations has nothing new. Overall this paper is not novel nor significant. The correctness and clarity are also of concern.\n\n---\n\nStrengths:\n\n- The use of *Bayes label transition matrix* to learn from instance-dependent noisy labels seems novel.\n- The experiments seem comprehensive.\n\n---\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n1. The idea to identify \"distilled examples\" is neither novel nor significant. This paper simply applies the setting and the idea in Cheng et al. (2020), the bounded instance-dependent label noise paper. Although the authors claimed they extended Cheng et al. (2020) from binary to multiclass, this extension is neither novel nor significant. Instead, it is quite problematic. First, Cheng et al. (2020) already has showed that their framework can be easily extended to multiclass setting in the supplementary material. Second, in this paper, the authors used the same theorem (Theorem 1) to identify distilled examples as that in Cheng et al. (2020). This is problematic: although it is true that $\\eta_y(x) > 0.5$ implies $y$ is the Bayes label in multiclass, this is only a sufficient condition. In fact, requiring $\\eta_y(x) > 0.5$ is the so-called \"dominant label\" condition [1], and is generally considered as a quite strong assumption. Third, Cheng et al. (2020) also considered covariate shift and the case when $\\rho_{max}$ is not known, but such extensions are missing in this work. To summarize, this work only trivially applies some of Cheng et al. (2020)'s results to multiclass to identify \"distilled examples\". This is not a meaningful contribution.\n\n2. The use of *Bayes label transition matrix* seems novel, but lacks justifications. The paper claims (second paragraph in page 2, (b)) that \"The feasible solution space of the Bayes label transition matrix is much smaller than that of the clean label transition matrix.\", but no justifications are given for the claimed \"sparsity\". Recall that \"sparsity\" means that entries of a matrix are mostly zeros. Such claim is not true for the *Bayes label transition matrix*, even if the Bayes class posterior is sparse. In Section 4.2, the authors acknowledged that \"if we have a distilled example for the i-th class, we can only make use of it to learn the i-th row of the transition matrix.\", but the explanation for why the other rows are not random nor learnable is far from satisfactory. More theoretical and empirical work is needed to understand and justify the use of *Bayes label transition matrix*.\n\n3. The use of DNNs to estimate *Bayes label transition matrix* has nothing new. No insights about how to design such nets are provided.\n\n4. The noise generating process (Algorithm 1) does not reflect the bounded noise assumption. At the beginning of Section 3, it is assumed that $\\forall x, 0 \\le \\rho_y(x) \\le \\rho_{max} < 1$, where $\\rho_y(x)  = P(\\tilde{Y} = y | Y \\ne y, x)$. However, in Algorithm 1, it is only guaranteed that for each $i$, $P(\\tilde{Y} \\ne y_i | Y = y_i, x_i) \\le \\rho_{max}$. Therefore, the proposed noise generating process does not satisfy the bounded noise assumption.\n\n5. In experiments, specifically Section 5.2, the baseline does not make sense, because both \"class-dependent\" and \"T-Revision\" are for CCN setting (the label noise only depends on the label, but not on the instance). The authors should have compared with methods that are designed for instance-dependent label noise.\n\n6. The clarity of this paper is of concern. The writing quality is below the requirements of this conference. For example, the paper used a long paragraph in page 1 to discuss about *statistical consistency*, but such information is not directly related to this work since this work does not have consistency results. BTW, Xia et al. (2020b) is not classifier-consistent.\n\n---\n\nOther minor issues:\n\n1. In Figure 1, the noisy class posterior does not sum to 1.\n \n---\nRefs:\n\n[1] Tong Zhang:\nStatistical Analysis of Some Multi-Category Large Margin Classification Methods. J. Mach. Learn.
