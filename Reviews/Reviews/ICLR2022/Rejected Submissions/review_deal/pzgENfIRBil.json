        "comment": "This paper presents a numerical approach to solving the multi-body Schrodinger equation.  Three reviews give low confidence scores and the one review with high confidence, and high score, is very brief and the reviewer appears to have a weak background in this area.  My feeling is that the ICLR reviewer pool does not contain reviewers who are really competent to review this paper.  There is a large literature in the physics community on this problem and the paper should be reviewed in an appropriate venue.  This is especially true for evaluating the empirical results. If the mathematical techniques are relevant to general machine learning, and the authors want to have an impact on machine learning community, then it should be possible to give empirical results on a problem commonly used to evaluate machine learning methods at machine learning venues. Whether or not this is important for physics should be judged by physicists.  In any case, the reviews are for the most part not enthusiastic."

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes a numerical algorithm for solving a class of  nonlinear generalized eigenvalue problems  that arises from the Hartree-Fock approximation of the Schr\\\"odinger equation. here the focus is on finding the first $k$-smallest eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The general idea is to perform  fixed point iterations (or solve a sequence of linear eigenvalue problems) in the framework of Self-Consistent Fields. To solve for the top $k$-smallest eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the linear problems, the authors replace the classical Oja’s algorithm with the recently developed EigenGame. The advantage of EigenGame is that the time-consuming QR decomposition step in Oja’s algorithm is replaced by a generalized Gram-Schmidt step in the computation of gradient updates. The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated in extensive numerical experiments.  ",
            "main_review": "Efficient computation of the Schr\\\"odinger eigenvalue problems  is a fundamental problem in computational  physics is certainly  worth to study. This paper made an interesting attempt for approximating the top $k$-smallest eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors of a generalized nonlinear eigenvalue problem associated to the Hartree-Fock approximation. of the Schr\\\"odinger problem. However, from my perspective, the contribution of this paper is incremental and may not be sufficiently novel for ICLR. Here are some concerns and comments. \n\n- First, it seems that the core of the proposed algorithm is the Eigengame for finding the first $k$-PCA of the linear eigenvalue problem, although there are other minor adaptions, such as introducing the damping and momentum. To me, a simple application of an existing method from others to a new problem is not novel enough for ICLR.  \n\n- Second, the authors claim that the proposed \"SCGDLED is robust to initial guesses\". However, this was only demonstrated in empirical results, but not justified rigorously. Can the authors prove the convergence of the proposed algorithm? Note that the Eigengame paper contains solid theoretical convergence analysis. I am wondering if any rigorous analysis can be done here. \n\n- Another question I had is about the original Schr\\\"odinger problem. In the present paper, the authors seeks an  Hartree-Fock approximation of the Schr\\\"odinger problem and considers a finite dimensional discretization of the Hartree approximation. Can the authors comment on whether (and how) the proposed method, especially the idea of Eigengame can be extended to solving the original  (infinite dimensional) Schr\\\"odinger problem without resorting the Hartree approximation? \n\n- In the statement of Proposition 1, is the assumption simply saying that  $F$ is continuous? If so, please  state it in this way. The current statement seems not precise. \n\n- Regarding Appendix D, I do not think it is a good idea to  include a 10-page long table to show the numerical results. I would recommend the authors select some representative data and perhaps leave the rest to some open repository. ",

If so, then F = 0 everywhere and the proposition is meaningless. The proof is also hard to understand. It seems that the authors are trying to prove something along the lines of \"a stable local convergence point is the solution of equation 1\", but I am not sure.\n\nJudging from the experiment results, we still need to combine the proposed method with the SCF to achieve a good solution. Can the authors give more information on the full solver case? For example, a comparison between SCF and SCGLED. How many of the examples the two algorithms fail to converge? If converge, what is the perfermance?\n\nSome minor problems: Change the symbol to distinguish clearly $V_{eff}$ and $V$.\n\nEquation (2) (3) can be written in the matrix form to be more consistent with the rest of the paper.\n",

It regards F(V) as a special “online data generator”, thus allows gradient-like eigen decomposition methods in streaming k-PCA to approach the self-consistency of the equation in an iterative way similar to online learning. SCGLED is shown to be robust to initial guesses, free of quantum-mechanism-based heuristics designs. This paper demonstrates SCGLED can replace traditional heuristics-based initial guess methods with large performance advantages and is capable of finding highly precise solutions independently without any traditional iterative methods.",
