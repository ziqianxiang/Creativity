        "comment": "The reviewers all generally find the paper both well-motivated in addressing an important challenge as well as well-written. However, there's quite a bit of hesitation around whether the proposed metric is convincing enough as an approach to measure local calibration.\n\nReviewer 76PS and 784d's concerns around the choice of feature map and associated hyperparameters remain unaddressed, and I agree with their concern. There is no clear understanding of what constitutes a \"good\" feature map, which makes the metric quite difficult to use whether as a benchmark of ML methods or for general application.  I recommend the authors use the reviewers' feedback to enhance their preprint should they aim to submit to a later venue."

A large number of experiments were carried out to prove authors' claim.\nWeakness:\n    1. Why choose the binning scheme over predicted model confidences? How about taking all samples into account, or other schemes? \n    2. For a unique sample, the neighborhood the authors defined maybe change when the size of its bin is changed, does it make sense? I think you can refer to [1].\n    3. Is the promising experimental result due to the superiority of the method, or is it an accidental result from a specific kernel function and feature map?\n    4. Since performance is sensitive to many choices, as discussed in Section 3.2 ``the MLCE is very sensitive to \\gamma\", the authors set \\gamma as 0.2 and show the good performance, but how can I choose the best one in real-word applications? So clear and strong ablation study is necessary.\n   5.  The difference between the confidence and the accuracy for one sample is not reasonable when using it in Eq. 4. Since the accuracy is not a good metric for only one sample, although the authors propose using neighbors (what about the case the prediction of the current sample is wrong?)\n   6. Using kernel to introduce locality is not new.\n\nOther concerns:\n    1. The style of Table 3 is different from other tables, is there anything special the authors want to emphasize? Although the article is clear on the whole, there will still be misunderstandings on this point.\n    2. In Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, there are no error bars, while the other same type figures (Fig. 5, Fig. 6 and Fig. 7) have reported that. \n\n[1] Karandikar, A. , et al. \"Soft Calibration Objectives for Neural Networks.\" (2021).",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This work proposes a new metric for calibration in classification where calibration is measured over localities in the input space, and the localities are determined with a kernel over the feature space. A recalibration algorithm (LoRe) is additionally proposed, which aims to recalibrate the class predictions w.r.t. local calibration error (LCE). The experiments show that 1) LoRe achieves better local calibration (measured by MLCE, i.e. maximum LCE) than baseline recalibration methods on ImageNet, 2) LoRe achieves better group-wise calibration (measured by worst group-wise maximum calibration error) across 3 datasets with identifiable groups, and 3) achieves competitive performance in a simple decision making task where confident incorrect predictions incur high costs. ",
            "main_review": "Strengths:\n- This paper is generally well written and clear. It is easy to follow and the experiments support the argument made in this paper.\n- The notion of local calibration seems novel to me. Although I have not scoured papers in this area, conditioning calibration error not just on confidence, but also feature similarity in the classification setting seems new to me.\n\nWeaknesses:\n- While the experimental results look positive, I believe they are not surprising because, as far as I can tell, LoRe uses the same feature map and kernel as the core evaluation metrics (LCE, MLCE). What happens empirically when different feature maps and kernels are used for applying LoRe and evaluating with LCE, MLCE?\n- Further, it seems as though computing the proposed metric (LCE, MLCE) depends on 1) a specific feature map, 2) a specific method for further reducing dimensions, 3) a specific kernel function, and 4) specific settings of the hyperparameters for the kernel. It is hard to be convinced that this is a robust metric when calculation depends on so many choices, i.e. I can imagine different rankings for the methods if the evaluation metric was computed with different choices of the above. \n- Continuing from the above point, is there a reason why the authors chose a Laplacian kernel? Have the authors experimented with other kernels? How about different feature maps?\n- Choosing a suitable $\\gamma$ seems quite arbitrary. Last line of Section 3.2, the authors simply state, \"0.2 is a good intermediate point\" without any justification. In practice, how should $\\gamma$ be chosen?\n- How much does the LCE metric diverge from classwise-ECE? If I understand correctly, LCE is meant to measure ECE in localities over the input feature space. Classwise-ECE, in a certain way, provides a proxy of this, because ECE is measured for each true class label, and inputs features should be well clustered within each class label (assuming meaningful features). In fact, if the features were separable by class, I believe LCE should be identical to classwise-ECE with an appropriate kernel and hyperparameter.\n- Continuing from the point above, I believe it would have been more meaningful to 1) compare against methods that target classwise-ECE (i.e. perform recalibration by class), and 2) to additionally report classwise-ECE values in the experiments.\n- Is LoRe an efficient algorithm during test-time? It seems as though Equation 6 needs to be computed for each test point x, where x_i indexes all points in the recalibration dataset $\\mathcal{D}$. This would be in contrast with other post-hoc methods which, e.g. learn a lookup table or tune a scalar during the recalibration phase, and can predict during test-time with a single forward pass of the classifier.\n\nMinor comments:\n- What is $d$ in the denominator of the Laplacian kernel definition (Section 3.2)?\n- In Figure 2, is the vertical dashed line simply ECE? It is referred to as \"average calibration error\" in text in Section 3.3.\n- Are the experiments with ImageNet run with just 1 seed?",
            "summary_of_the_review": "While the concepts introduced and methods proposed are interesting, I do not believe the proposed metric is necessarily robust, and am not convinced of its advantages over an established metric (classwise-ECE, which also has not been reported in this work).\nI believe elaborating (theoretically or experimentally) on these points could make a much stronger case for this work.",

            "main_review": "In general, the idea of evaluating a model on both the feature space and output space is quite interesting. It provides a potential direction to extend the current probability calibration framework.\n\nOn the positive side, while the proposed LCE straightforwardly applies the kernel method, the authors put some reasonable effort into investigating the proposed measure's theoretical properties. While the proof of Theorem 1 relies on some existing work on kernel methods, it might provide some valuable references to other researchers interested in similar problems.\n\nOn the negative side, one main concern with this paper is the ambiguity of the proposed definition of Local Calibration. On the one hand, we have an existing definition of a perfectly calibrated model, which is solely defined in terms of the probabilistic output space. On the other hand, we also have the definition of a Bayes-optimal model, which is defined only on the feature space. For both cases, we can define a classifier that is optimal for either measure. Furthermore, we know that being a Bayes-optimal model is a sufficient but not necessary condition for being a perfectly calibrated model.\nHowever, while the proposed local calibration tries to incorporate both output space and feature space, it is unclear what is an optimal classifier under the definition due to the introduced kernel space. The author did not clearly show the requirements for a classifier to be perfectly local calibrated and its relationship to the Bayes-optimal model / perfectly calibrated models. It hence could be problematic when we want to treat local calibration as a measure to optimise.  \n\nAlso, while the authors used NLL and BS for their experiments, they did not discuss much the framework of Proper Scoring Rules. PSRs can be used to evaluate the overall quality of a probabilistic forecaster in terms of both refinement and calibration. A classifier with minimal refinement loss and calibration loss is Bayes-optimal and optimal both on the feature and probabilistic output spaces. It is therefore closely related to the local calibration concept proposed in this paper. I would therefore encourage the authors to consider potential links to PSRs further so that the local calibration concept can be clearly linked to calibrated / Bayes-optimal classifiers.\n\nA minor suggestion is also to consider links to existing kernel-based probabilistic classifiers (relevant vector machines / Gaussian Processes), where the probability output is directly optimised with a given kernel space.",
            "summary_of_the_review": "This paper provides an interesting method to improve probabilistic outputs with the proposed definition of local calibration. However, the local calibration concept is not linked with the existing definition of calibrated / Bayes-optimal classifiers, so it might not stand firm as a measure to optimise.

The analogy to global calibration metrics is not immediately obvious to me and merits more discussion\n- the choices around representations which are operated on seem under-discussed. For instance, my guess from reading this paper is that t-SNE is quite important to the practical results of this method - would be good to hear if that's true or not, or how other approaches compare results-wise. If t-SNE is essential to the application of the method, it indicate the method may not be that robust\n- Additionally, I'm curious about the application of t-SNE here - how is a test point placed in a t-SNE representation space which was fit on a validation set? As far as I know, t-SNE representations are usually not amortized\n- 2-d pictures in Fig 2 are very nice but I find the right side confusing - I need some clarification on how to read these CDFs. Also, you state that the regions of over/under-confidence are clustered in input space, but it's not clear how we would tell if this is more than we'd expect given random variation or not\n- I'm skeptical that MLCE is the only metric worth looking at here - I'm also curious about something like average LCE\n- Table 2: how is this correlation calculated - over what sample of models?\n- Table 4: I'd like to see standard deviations/confidence intervals here. This type of metric is similar to an average LCE, which is good, but the wins seem uneven (which is fine). Also curious to here why some metrics show different results than others\n\n\nOther thoughts:\n\n- would be interesting to think about customizable kernels to inject notions of similarity we care about (e.g. the improper group-wise kernel mentioned in section 4)\n- Fig 3: tell me what these legend abbreviations mean\n- as bandwidth goes to \\infty, can you discuss what other methods it becomes similar to?\n- I would be interested to see exploration of which regions are uncalibrated for models\n",
