        "comment": "The reviewers agree that the paper is addressing an interesting problem. However, the authors analyze the effect of heterophily on GNN for node classification. The authors simplify the analysis by removing the nonlinearity in the GNN model and derive some theoretical results. However, the analysis is very specific to the simplified version of GNN, and the link to later proposed solution is also weak. Furthermore, a more significant improvement in experiments will also make the paper more convincing."

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper shows that not all cases of heterophily are harmful for GNNs with aggregation operations. Based on a backpropagation analysis on an SGC-style GNN, it provides a new metric based on similarity matrix which considers the influence of both graph structure and input features. Observing that the diversification operation is able to address some harmful heterophily cases, it proposes the Adaptive Channel Mixing GNN framework which combines a high-pass filter, a low-pass filter and an identity channel.",
            "main_review": "Heterophily is an important factor for us to understand the performance of GNN on different graphs.  I think the paper found a good point that heterophily is not always harmful for all GNNs. This paper provides a new perspective to understand the problem, and designs a new metric based on the gradient analysis, which is interesting. The filterbank based method does solve the problem to some extent and gained very good performance.\n\nHowever, 1. It is not clear why the gradient leads to the aggregation similarity score as the heterophily metric, and how does it impact the GNNs’ performance. There is also no direct connection with the later diversification analysis. \n2. The diversification operation helps on heterophilous graphs also lacks of enough motivation and theoretic explanation. It seems there is only one example (Figure 3) to illustrate it. That is not enough. In addition, the diversification operation even cannot work well for all cases, especially for multi-class problems. This makes the value of this paper hurt a lot.\n3. The filterbank based method is trivial and not new. Adding that the theoretic analysis of diversification operation or new metric is also not convincing, the novelty of this paper is incremental. \n",

Based on the analysis, the authors propose an adaptive channel mixing (ACM) framework to improve GNN model performance. Several experiments have also been conducted to evaluate the proposed model. In general, the authors focus on an important problem and the paper is easy to follow. There are a few issues the authors need to address.\n\nMy first concern is that the heterophily analysis might be over-simplified. It is good to see that the authors introduce an example to show when traditional heterophily metrics may fail to provide a meaningful heterophily value. However, the analysis conducted has two major assumptions: binary classification and one-hop aggregation. Though I understand that certain assumption is required for most theoretical analysis, these two seem to be very strong given that multi-layer of GNNs are usually operated on graphs with multiple node labels. This reduces the significance of the analysis.\n\nSome technical terms also need to be better explained or discussed. For example, the authors introduce high-pass (HP) and low-pass (LP) filters in Sec. 4 without introducing any motivation or rationales of applying them. I suggest the authors to better connect these filters with the analysis in Sec. 3 so that readers can better understand why in certain scenarios these two filters can help alleviate the heterophily problem. The authors briefly introduce some potential implementation of HP/LP filters in Sec. 4.2 while the exact implementation selected in the experiments is missing. I suggest the authors to explicitly indicate which filter implementations are selected and whether they're deterministic or learnable.\n\nThe ACM framework seems to be a weighted aggregation of the results after frequency filters. I suggested the authors to add an ablation study by comparing the ACM framework with some multi-head self-attention mechanisms to better understand where the gains are from.",

The same comment can be applied to the beginning of Section 4: explicitly give the definition of diversification operation before discuss about it.\n-Figure 2: how do you get the curves of (b) (c) (d) when you only manipulate H_edge?\n-Some figures are not easily readable in b/w print.\n-The three steps of ACM lacks explanations and justification. Specifically, in Steps 2 and 3, why using such a combination weight calculation scheme? The raw weights are estimated only based on the results from the corresponding filter. I feel it would be better to decide the weight for each channel based on all the filtered results. In step 3, why using W_{mix}? How do we interpret the temperature parameter here? Is the softmax in step 2 row-wise (need to explain it in order to improve readability)?\n-Experiments: In Figure 4, how to interpret the relations between H_{agg}^M and the performance increase? It would be better to put important and necessary discussions in the main text.\n\n-Minor typos: page 7, \"called is\", \"a set of filterbank\".",

Then, it performs very comprehensive experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.\n\nIf I need to mention a weakness, this is the fact that the paper necessarily compresses a lot of discussion and description due to the conference constraints. For that reason, it misses a thorough analysis and comparison with the state of the art, as well as a more in-depth discussion of the experimental results and conclusions.
