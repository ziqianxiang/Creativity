The authors claim that this phenomenon is due to the sub-optimal attack procedures that do not leverage the true representation potential of the ViTs.

The experiments conducted on ImageNet/COCO dataset, and PASCAL demonstrate that the proposed method can outperform the baselines on some of the experimental settings. The paper also provides a detailed analysis of the model and experimental results. \n\n### Novelty ###\n\nThe paper proposes two novel strategies about how to enhance the transferability of ViT models, i.e. refined tokens and self-ensemble. When those ideas are combined to an adversarial attack, it significantly boosts the transferability of adversarial examples, thereby bringing out the true generalization of ViTs’ adversarial space. These two ideas are interesting and should be heuristic for the research community, especially for those who have a strong interest in designing ViT models. \n\n\n###Clarity###\n\nThe paper is overall logically clear and easy to follow. The tables and figures are well illustrated by the captions. The writing and presentation of this paper are good enough to convey the ideas.\n\n###Pros###\n\n1) The paper proposes two interesting ideas to enhance the generalization ability of the ViT models, i.e. refined tokens and self-ensemble. These two methods are well-motivated. For self-ensemble, it creates an ensemble of classifiers by learning a shared classification head at each block along the ViT hierarchy, leading to an explicit utilization of class-specific information at each ViT block. For refined tokens, the paper proposes both patch token refinement and class token refinement to tackle the misalignment between the features with the classifier. \n\n2) The paper provides extensive experiments on multiple datasets, settings, and vision tasks. The results show that both proposed techniques can boost the performance, compared with many SOTA baselines.  Through the experiments, this paper empirically demonstrates favorable transfer rates across different model families (convolutional and transformer) as well as different vision tasks (classification, detection, and segmentation).\n\n3) The paper provides a detailed empirical analysis to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. \n\n###Cons###\n\n1) While self-ensembling is useful to enhance the transferability of the ViT models, it also makes the models more complex. Thus, some computational costs and inference speed analysis are desired. \n\n2) One of the main assumptions of proposing the patch token refinement and class token refinement is there exists misalignment between the feature and classifier in ViT models. It will be helpful to provide some empirical evidence to validate this assumption (even some material in the appendix). \n\nBased on the summary, cons, and pros, the current rating I am giving now is \"weak accept\". I would like to discuss the final rating with other reviewers, ACs.\n",

The main strengths of the paper are:\n\n- The paper is well organized and well-written. \n- The proposed approaches are well-motivated by empirical findings.\n- The paper has several experiments that the effectiveness of these approaches.\n\nI also have some concerns/questions about the discussions in the paper:\n\n- In my view, the addition of the ensemble module and refined tokens is similar to an approach that combines both CNN and ViT. In Figure 6, it is also evidence that the addition of the refined tokens is important. This begs the question of whether adversarial samples of hybrid CNN/ViT models have similar transferability performance as of the proposed methods in the paper? Currently, it seems like the paper only studies one particular type of ViTs, and the generality of the proposed methods, as well as the generality of the motivation, can be limited.\n- Does the same trend follow w.r.t adversarial transferability to other large CNN models such as BiT?\n\n",
