        "comment": "This paper proposes use of a novel generative modelling approach, over both sequences and structure of proteins, to co-design the CDR region of antibodies so achieve good binding/neutralization. The reviewers are in agreement that the problem is one of importance, and that the technical and empirical contributions are strong. There are concerns over the relevance of evaluating the method by using a predictive model as ground truth. Still, the overall contributions remain."

This combination of strengths makes it an excellent paper that should be of wide interest.\n\nStrengths:\n- The design of each component follows naturally from previous work (such as Ingraham et al 2019). This helps isolate out key methodological contributions, for example no teacher forcing in structure, in an easy-to-interpret way.\n- The coarsening procedure is of wider applicability in protein modeling beyond sampling CDR loops and an ablation study demonstrates its value empirically for this work.\n- Baselines chosen highlight key interactions in RefineGNN components and show that the model appears to effectively leverage the added complexity.\n- Evaluations are thorough and span a number of datasets, one of the biggest strengths of this paper.\n\nWeaknesses:\n- The use of a predictor to evaluate neutralization is justified based on very recent work, and it is unclear that this practice is in line with broader norms in the antibody engineering community.\n",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes a joint generative model (co-designing the sequence and the structure at the same time) for the CDRs of antibodies, with the goal to enhance binding specificity or neutralization capabilities. \n\nThe proposed method and two existing baselines are evaluated on 1) perplexity on hold-out set; 2) perplexity and sequence recovery on known antigen-antibody complexes; and 3) redesign CDR-H3 of existing antibodies for coronavirus neutralization as measured by a given neutralization predictor. RefineGNN, the proposed method, shows improved performance in all three tasks.",
            "main_review": "This paper studies the important problem of computationally designing antibody CDRs. The joint modeling approach of structures and sequences is novel and interesting. The generation method is flexible and the authors also adapt it for conditional generation (conditioned on the rest of the antibody and on given properties of interest with the predictive model already available).\n\nThe empirical results are convincing. Both perplexity and sequence recovery are standard metrics in protein design, and the proposed method showed improvements in both perplexity and sequence recovery on two separate data sets. The two baselines used for comparison are well described and meaningful.\n\nRequest for clarification: In section 4.2, it is not immediately clear whether the antigen is also included in the conditioning or only the antibody itself.\n\nIt would be appreciated if the authors can add more discussion around when this proposed method applies in practice. For example, the method requires already knowing the frame of the antibody. When is a fixed frame variable CDR-H3 design a reasonable assumption? Or, when can we realistically expect to have accurate predictors for properties of interest?\n\nWhile the model is trained on unbound antibody structures, the second evaluation task is conditioned on the antibody structures in bound state within a complex (if I’m not mistaken), will there be a mismatch between the bound and unbound structures? Clarification and discussion around this point would also be appreciated.\n",
