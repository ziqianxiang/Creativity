        "comment": "This paper introduces a tree-structured wavelet deep neural network to effectively extract more discriminative and expressive feature representations in time series signals.  Based on a frequency spectrum energy analysis,  the approach decomposes input signals into multiple subbands and builds a tree structure with data-driven wavelet transforms the bases of which are learned using invertible neural networks. In the end, the scattering subband features are fused using a self-attention-like mechanism.  The effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified extensively on a variety of datasets from different domains including follow-up experiments in the rebuttal.  Overall,  the work is technically novel and provides an interesting way of extracting adaptive finer-grained features to deal with time series signals.  The authors' rebuttal is solid which has cleared most of the concerns raised by the reviewers with additional supportive experimental evidence. \n\nI would recommend accept."

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper introduces a novel technique for the analysis of biomedical signals. The technique is inspired from Wavelet transform and consists in analyzing the original signal in different frequency subband. The technique differs from wavelet transform by the fact that instead of using a fixe wavelet function, a dedicated invertible neural network is learnt for each frequency subband. Finally, features from each subbands are fused using a Transformer like model.\nThe proposed techniques has been thoroughly tested on separate datasets and separate tasks, and compared to various state-of-the-art techniques, and the proposed technique has consistently outperformed other techniques on these various tasks. Finally, an ablation study has been performed in order to demonstrate the benefits of the different choices of the model architecture.\n",
            "main_review": "The paper proposes a truly innovative technique, which seems to be effective and versatile enough to be applied on several tasks and different biomedical signals (EEG, EMG,…)\nThe technique has been thoroughly evaluated and the results are convincing. The sue of the ablation study demonstrates the right decisions and design choices have been taken throughout the architecture design.\nI have some minor points to raise:\nIn section 3.2, the frequency bisection operator aims at building a predictor for estimation odds samples from even ones. If I am not mistaking, this predictor is applied also for downsampled signals, but I fail to understand how hard it is to find a suitable predictor. How can the authors explain, why trying to achieve such a trivial task allows to build such an effective network.\nCould the authors discuss how the use of scattering network with the suggested fusion module could be working on the different teste tasks?\nCould the authors discuss how much computing time is required for training and deploying the suggested technique on real examples?\n",

In particular, a wavelet-based algorithm is carried out using invertible neural networks and a formant-based strategy.

Moreover, the experiments dñemonstrate convincing evidence regarding the time-series discrimination results.\n-The codes are available, and the main training details are exposed.\n\nCons. and comments\n\n-The formant-based feature extraction seems to be confusing. How do you test the formant (maximum) estimation from noisy signals?.\n-Authors claim that a fixed window is used to compute de FFT; however, how to set such a parameter for different non-stationary patterns?\n-The loss function in eq 11 depicted an L2 regularization; how to deal with outliers?\n-The bisection operation includes the estimation of even and odd signal parts. Nonetheless, It would be helpful to discuss better the relationship between the sampling frequency, the window size, and the bisection operation.\n-Concerning the BCI2a database results, the acc seems to be poor. Can you explain better why?. Maybe, confusion matrices and class-dependent time-series analysis could be discussed.",

Empirical study is mainly conducted on human activity or health monitoring data to support the design decisions. ",
            "main_review": "In general, the paper gives a reasonable way to combine classic frequent-temporal analysis (i.e., Fourier transformation and wavelet) and deep learning operations (e.g., attention for feature fusion). I list the main advantages and disadvantages below:\n\nAdvantages:\n+  The combination of deep learning and classic frequent-temporal analysis is effective, e.g., to use attention based mechanism for feature fusion across different domain is a solid design.\n+ The organization of empirical study is good, the author not only reports the end-to-end performance boost over the state-of-the-art approaches, but also provides some ablation study to support the design of the wavenet modules.\n\nDisadvantages:\n+ The biggest concern I have is that, the author claims \"Such a disentangled representation learning method facilitates a more effective extraction of the discriminative features, as demonstrated by our extensive experiments on various real-life time series classification datasets.\" Along with the tune of the introduction, it seems that the author tends to argue this approach should be considered as a general approach for various time series analysis tasks. However, in the empirical study only four classification tasks over human activity or health monitoring data are considered. I think such empirical finding may not be sufficient for a claim of an effective general-purpose time series analysis framework.\n\n+ One technique section is a little confusing to me, i.e., why would the FSEA balance the energy of each subband? It seems that the motivation of such frequent domain analysis is to identify the dominating frequency and remove the noisy in other frequencies. Additionally, shouldn't the wavelet transform include the functionality of co-locating salient frequent and temporal signal simultaneously? Why would you still need a FSEA module?\n\n+ Lastly, a tiny issue would be a lack of introduction about how the training and test datasets are split in the text, perhaps one additional col in Table 1 would fix this. \n \n",
            "summary_of_the_review": "This paper presents a solid and reasonable way to combine classic frequent-temporal analysis and the recent advance of deep learning based approaches. \nHowever, it seems a little incautious to claim the effectiveness of the proposed model as a general purpose approach for time series analysis based on the narrow scope of the benchmark datasets. I personally suggest two options for fixing this:\n\n+ To conduct a more extensive evaluation over diversified datasets, e.g. there are 128 datasets available in the latest UCR time series website (https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/time_series_data_2018/), all of them or a representative subset of them would be a good collection of benchmarks. \n\n+ To narrow-down the scope of the approach as an effective method for health monitoring related time series analysis. In this way, some concrete analysis should be added about some unique domain-specific properties of such signals, and the author would also justify why the proposed approach would be able to learn the representation of these properties more effectively. \n\nPost rebuttal comments:\nMy concerns have been mostly resolved given the update and additional experimental results. \n \n",
