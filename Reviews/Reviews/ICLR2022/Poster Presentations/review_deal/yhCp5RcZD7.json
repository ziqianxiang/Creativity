        "comment": "This paper provides a normal map-inspired implicit surface representation involving a smooth surface whose high frequency detail comes from normal displacements.  Reviewers were impressed with the results and theoretical discussion in the paper.  The AC agrees.\n\nThe authors were responsive to reviewer feedback and addressed some questions about parameter choice during the rebuttal phase, including new experiments/discussion in the supplementary document.  Note the response to reviewer WHEF notes that the authors will be releasing data/code; the AC strongly hopes the authors are true to their word in that regard.\n\nThe AC chose to disregard some comments from reviewer G54X regarding tests with noise, as this method appears to be tuned to computer graphics applications; the level of empirical work here aligns with past work in the area.  Of course the authors are encouraged to include some tests responding to the reviewer comments in the camera ready.  The AC also found the score from reviewer WHEF to be somewhat uncalibrated with the tone of their review, but of course their assessment is quite positive nonetheless.\n\n\nOne small comment:  The abstract appears a bit strangely on the OpenReview site because of line breaks; if possible, please remove the line breaks.\n\nAnother small comment:  The \"spectral shape representation\" phrase used a bit in the discussion below might not be advisable, as this phrase typically refers to the intrinsic spectrum of a shape (e.g. Laplace-Beltrami analysis)"

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper addresses the problem of obtaining a 3D surface reconstruction from point clouds. This has been one of the most studied topics in 3D vision, with different kinds of approaches. The authors tackle this problem using implicit representations, specifically using signal distance functions and query features. The main contributions are a consideration of implicit displacements for modeling different frequency levels and introducing a transferable implicit displacement field that replaces the common coordinates inputs with constructed transferable features. ",
            "main_review": "Strengths:\n\nS1: The paper presents an interesting idea. Although this is a straightforward idea, using implicit displacement fields is up to my knowledge new.\n\nS2: Related work is OK, and the paper is well organized.\n\nS3: Several experimental results are presented, including ablation studies. However, essential comparisons are missing (see the weaknesses.)\n\nWeaknesses:\n\nW2: The method is mostly constructed on top of previous methods; there are no network changes or losses. There is a contribution in the signed distance function and a pipeline for transferable implicit displacement fields. Why are we using two SIRENs for f and d? Shouldn't the d be a simpler network?\n\nW3: Considering the experimental result. I feel that the method will fail with noise because of things like the need for normal to the points. This is a very relevant fact, and it is not described in the document. There are small tests with noise in the appendices, but the level of noise added is almost 0.",
            "summary_of_the_review": "Although the proposed method builds mainly on top of previous techniques, the paper presents some interesting contributions. However, it is not clear how this new representation will work with noise, and I believe it would be beneficial to clarify this. However, if the other reviewers think the paper is ready to be accepted, I will not be against it.",

In addition, the authors introduces transferable implicit displacement fields, which enables the transferability of displacements between aligned shapes. The method is a natural extension to the displacement mapping method and is theoretically grounded. The evaluation results show that this method could represent shapes with sharper details while using less storage compared to baseline methods.",
            "main_review": "Strengths\n- The paper is well-written and well-motivated. The authors have done adequate derivation from the classic explicit displacement mapping method, making the proposed method theoretically sound.\n- The idea of implicitly representing both base surface and displacement map with neural networks is new and elegant. Transferable implicit displacement field (IDF) also adds to the novelty of this framework.\n- The proposed method outperforms all baseline methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. The authors have done adequate ablation studies to validate the method design. The transfer experiments are impressive and show great potential in applying the method to downstream shape processing tasks such as detail modeling.\n\nWeakness\n- It would be helpful to explain how some of the hyper-parameters are chosen e.g. attenuation factors $\\nu$, and frequency factors $\\omega_B, \\omega_D$\n\nOther\n- Is it possible to perform hierarchical displacement mapping / shape modeling based on this idea? Any discussion is welcomed.\n\n",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes an implicit neural representation for 3D geometry, named implicit displacement fields. The method is consists of two SIREN networks as baseline models to approximate: a coarse base shape representation (low-frequency) and an implicit displacement field (for high-frequency details). Different from previous works, the displacement field is implicitly represented by a SIREN network. The coarse and fine networks design also enables applications such as shape manipulation.",
            "main_review": "Strengths\n\n(1) To represent both the coarse surfaces and displacements implicitly by two neural networks is new. The results show that the proposed method can keep detailed 3D geometry while remaining a reasonably small network size.\n\n(2) Instead of naively building the displacement SDF as residuals, the proposed displacement field and attenuation function (eq(1),eq(3)) are interesting. Ablation studies also demonstrate their effectiveness.\n\nWeaknesses\n\n(1) I would like to see more experiments and discussions about how the parameters ωB and ωD (ωB = 15 and ωD = 60) are chosen in the paper. How would they affect the performance in different objects, from simple to complex surfaces? To me, it seems that these two parameters would be object-dependent. \n\n(2) Is this method generalizable to other baseline models (other than SIRENs)? ",

Experiments are done thoroughly to demonstrate the effectiveness of each component of the method.

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper proposes a an implicit representation of surface displacement fields that is well learnable by neural networks. The network is based on two SIREN architectures that separate low and high frequency information in the model. One returns an SDF of the rough shape while the second returns a displacement field at the surface of the SDF. In addition to this architecure (which existed before but for a different application), the paper introduces an inverse implicit mapping that speeds up the evaluation of the loss, and a feature based UV map that can be transferred between similar shapes. The paper compares to previous work on SketchFab, and specifically evaluates against a vanilla SIREN model where this method results in both a smaller model size as well as more detailed reconstruction. Additionally, there are experiments that show how details can be transferred across different (but similar) models. ",
            "main_review": "he paper is well written, makes its contribution very clear and gives a distinguished overview about related work. I had no problems following the text, and the equations are \n\nThe papers main contribution is the introduction of a two-level implicit representation (both based on SIREN) for 3D geometry which works exceptionally well. The general idea was already introduced for single-view reconstruction (in Li & Zhang as mentioned by the authors), but this papers evolves the setting to work for general geometry representation, including an inverse displacement and making the displacement transferrable by using a kind of feature-based UV map. \n\nWhile the existing two SIREN network setup lowers the value of the contribution, the elegant solution for some geometry representation specific problems. These solutions are the expensive comparison to the ground-truth which is solved by including an inverse implicit field, and learning a feature based UV field (computing consistent UV maps on different surfaces is very hard). I could see especially the second part being reused in other applications as they allow to transfer the UV to similar shapes. \n\nThe results are visually impressive, especially the texture transfer, closer to the ground-truth than all competitors all while using a smaller model size. The results are both smooth in areas where this is correct, as well as able to show details where necessary.  This could be incredible useful for applications based on implicit 3D representations that struggle with training complexity of highly detailed models. \n\nThe ablation study is well done, however the quantitative comparison is only done on a single dataset, SketchFab-16. I do not know this database and the provided link only goes to a general website with a wide collection of 3D models (some of them not free). This makes it impossible to exactly reproduce the results. Additionally, it seems all models on this page are of a certain high quality, it would have been interesting to at least see some other examples with shapes of different quality. \n\nMinor comments:\n- I find that the practice of the listed citations without brackets around them very distracting when reading. I do not know if this is part of the conference style guide but I would recommend to change it. \n- Figure 4: It would be great to write the w parameter directly under/above each image. ",
            "summary_of_the_review": "While neither the SIREN architecutre nor the displacement field is a novel contribution, their combination is not trivial and shows exceptional results in terms of quality and model size. In addition, the paper presents some elegant solutions for efficiently evaluating the loss in this new setting, and using a feature based UV mapping that can be transferred to similar shapes. \nI think these are sufficient for publication. The quantitative evaluation is a bit lacking, and the final version of this paper should include an exact list of shapes that were used in the evaluation. op",
