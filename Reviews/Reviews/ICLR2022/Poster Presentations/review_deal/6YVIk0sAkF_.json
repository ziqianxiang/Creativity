        "comment": "The paper considers matrix and tensor factorization, and provides a bound on the excess risk which is an improved bound over the bounds for ordinary matrix factorization. The authors also show how to solve the model with standard gradient-based optimization algorithms, and present results showing good accuracy. The method can be a bit slow but this depends a bit on the number of iterations, and in general it achieves better accuracy in a similar amount of time to other baseline algorithms.\n\nThe reviewers raised a few points, such as jdoi noting the tensor experiments were for small tensors and should include the method Costco as well; other reviewers mentioned more methods as well.  The authors seemed to address most of these concerns in the rebuttal, adding more experiments and more details on timing.  26KD mentioned the optimization procedure was unclear, but the revision includes pseudocode in the appendix that clarifies.\n\nOverall, the paper has both a theoretical and algorithmic contribution, and would be of interest to many ICLR readers."

The analytical results show that when n2 is larger than n1, the nonlinear DMF provides a tighter generalization bound than MF. Similar analysis has been extended to two-mode matrix factorization and multi-mode  tensor factorization. Experimental results in synthetic data and real data show better results of the proposed algorithm as compared to other algorithms in completion tasks. ",

Are they bounded by r?\n\n[2] There are some concerns about the synthetic data simulation used in the paper. It is okay to use complexed non-linear transformation (e.g. sin/exp) to verify the non-linear multi-mode tensor factorization works as expected. While, it would be better if the synthetic data can are generated the same way as the assumption (tanh activation function as used in the experiment) to verify how efficient of the algorithm in recovering a tensor with known factorization. \n",

The main contribution of the methods lie in full exploration of non-linearity of data in matrix and tensor factorization. To better motivate the proposed models, the authors provide theoretical analysis for why and when nonlinear deep matrix factorization outperforms linear deep matrix factorization in matrix completion.

Specifically, it first presents the theoretical results showing why nonlinear deep matrix factorization is better than the ordinary matrix factorization model.

The authors also extend this method to tensor factorization by further factorizing the factor matrices in the Tucker decomposition using the deep factorization method. Impressive results are obtained using both synthetic and real-world datasets.",

The paper is well written and easy to follow; the theoretical analyses are delivered clearly despite the heavy notations. The two-mode design in the proposed matrix factorization is quite unique, to the best of my knowledge. Theoretical analysis and synthetic experiments show that when data is generated according to the assumption, it outperforms baselines and achieves better generalization. The idea of incorporating deep matrix factorization into Tucker decomposition is also quite interesting.\n\nMy questions/comments are:\n\n1) In Assumption 2, it is assumed that X is generated by $\\mathbf{X}=\\mathbf{U}^\\top\\mathbf{Q}\\mathbf{V}$, I wonder what motives this assumption and are there any motivating examples in the real world to justify this assumption?\n\n2) The sizes of the tensors used for experiments are quite small, how would the proposed model scale to a large tensor? Also, the running time of the proposed model and the baselines are not reported.\n\n3) There are other recent nonlinear tensor completion models, e.g. CoSTCo[1]. It would be great to see relevant discussion and comparison with those recent methods.\n\n\n[1] Liu, Hanpeng, et al. \"Costco: A neural tensor completion model for sparse tensors.\" Proceedings of the 25th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining. 2019.\n\n",

In eqn.(2), it that a typo for the half parenthesis in the last term?\n\n2. It is quite confusing for the symbol \"h\", which sometimes denotes the dimension, e.g., in (5), while sometimes represents the function in p.5. It may be better to distinguish them with different notation.\n\n3. In line -9 p.3, does it mean that one particular $h_l$ is large or all $h_l$'s are large?\n\n4. The Assumption 2 in Sec 3 is not well organized. First, the definitions for $f_{\\theta_i}$ could be moved to eqn.(8) when they first appeared. Second, should the functions $f_{\\theta_i}$ for $i=1,2$ defined from one matrix space to another, instead of $\\mathbb{R}^{d_i}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{m_i}$? Also, the mapping notation here should be $\\to$ rather than $\\mapsto$. Lastly, the parameter spaces are not clearly defined, e.g., the spaces where the parameters $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$ belong to. \n\n5. Minor issues: \nline 5 p.4: What does it mean by \"d can be larger than the ground truth\"? It seems that d is the dimension of the latent variable. \nline -14 p.5: \"tighter generalization bound\" -> \"a tighter generalization bound\"\nline -10 p.5: \"could be\" -> \"are\"\nline 11 p.7: \"higher-order\" -> \"high-order\"?\n ",
