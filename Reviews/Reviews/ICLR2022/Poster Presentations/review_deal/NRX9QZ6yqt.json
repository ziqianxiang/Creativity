        "comment": "The paper proposes a general method to enhance the performance of first-order optimizers. The main idea is to use a memory buffer to maintain a limited set of critical gradients from recent history. Namely, gradients with large l2 norm. The paper includes a convergence proof on strongly convex smooth objectives. Experimental results are reported for several architectures in vision and language tasks. When integrated with several commonly used optimizers (SGD, SGDM, RMSProp, Adam), the method shows an improvement in terms of learning speed as well as improved performance (in almost all cases). Several ablations are performed to show strong robustness to hyperparameters introduced.\n\nThe paper is very well written and easy to follow. The proposed method is simple and effective. The empirical evaluation is strong and the ablation studies exhaustive and convincing, as pointed out by all four reviewers.\n\nThe authors provided a solid rebuttal addressing many questions raised by the reviewers.\n\nReviewer KE2X is the only reviewer recommending to reject the paper, pointing out that the paper lacks a clear motivation on why the critical gradients are selected based on the l2 norm. In their response the authors provided a connection with recent methods designed to find important examples when training neural networks. In the discussion (not visible to the authors). Reviewer v5GJ stated that this criterion is intuitive and acceptable given the strong empirical performance reported. The AC agrees with this view.\n\nReviewer KE2X also points out that the theoretical results do not provide a convincing improvement over vanilla SGD. The authors acknowledge this point, adding that the convergence results apply to a wide variety of critical gradient methods and aggregation strategies, so it is natural to expect that improvements will depend on the specific conditions. While the AC agrees that having stronger theoretical results would improve the paper, as it stands it is certainly above acceptance threshold.\n\nOverall the paper makes a solid contribution with a method that is simple and effective. It will likely inspire other alternative methods in the future. The AC recommends accepting the work."

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper proposes a memory-augmented optimizer to make use of the history information of the gradients. The motivation is that the aggregation of past gradients nudges parameter updates in a better direction. However, it remains to answer how much historical information of the gradients is sufficient. The authors study and analyze the memory requirement of several common optimization algorithms. Based on that, the authors propose a new optimizer that retains a limited gradient history and those gradients are selected by their importance. This method could be built upon existing popular optimizers like Adam and SGD and enjoys accelerated convergence and improved performance.",
            "main_review": "Pros\n* The selection of the critical gradients directly depends on the $l_2$ norm of the gradients and the aggregation function is simple enough, so the idea itself looks reasonable and the implementation of the algorithm is straightforward. Furthermore, the optimizer could be combined with other popular first-order optimizers which can make it more useful.\n* The related work section is well-written and the number of citations is adequate. I feel comfortable reading through the paper and the points are obvious to me. The comparison between the proposed method and other algorithms on memory requirements and performance improvement is clear.\n* The experiment results are strong. Figure 2 gives a nice summary about how the proposed memory-augmented optimizer influences performance of the original optimizer.\n\nCons\n* Although it seems natural to choose gradients of large norm as the critical ones. I did not find any motivation or explanation for that. There are several related works trying to utilize the information of historical gradients, but it is not clear how saving the critical gradients by looking at their norm helps improve the performance. More specifically, In Figure 5 (a) and (b), it seems the choices of selection techniques and replacement methods do not influence the results a lot. I would be rather interested if the author could give some insights about the reason why such selection mechanisms work well.\n\n* The theoretical proof looks merely fine to me. It is not clear how the choice of $K$ will influence the bound. It would be more obvious and convincing if the authors could give some examples rather than simply claim it may be possible to accelerate convergence rates when $K > 1$. I guess such acceleration might depend on specific conditions and these conditions could show some improvements and limitations of the proposed algorithm. \n\nComments\n* Maybe there is a limitation for the number of pages, but I personally feel it will make the paper look more complete if Algorithm 1 goes to the main body.\n* The description of $A_t$ at the bottom of page 13 seems to be wrong. Shouldn't the blocks of identity matrices be moved one block to their left?",
            "summary_of_the_review": "In general, the paper is well-written and the experimental results look strong. However, the lack of clear motivation and explanation of the proposed method downgrades my rating to the paper. Furthermore, the theoretical part could be more detailed as the current one does not provide a convincing improvement over vanilla SGD method. I hope the authors will answer these questions in the future.",

The method proposed in the paper is centered around \"critical gradients\" with large l2 norm and only retaining them in the limited buffer. Experimental results show the faster convergence in terms of iterations compared to standard SGD algorithms without critical gradient buffers. \n",
            "main_review": "The critical gradient strategy seems fairly interesting and a promising way to accelerate training. The paper was fun to read and well written. The experimental evaluation is fairly comprehensive and has interesting analysis. The main concerns I have are:\n* Although the convergence speed in terms of iterations is faster, the wall clock time relative to baselines especially with large buffer sizes seems much higher Appendix D2 Table 4. The overhead seems to stem from the book keeping, replacement and aggregation strategy. Is there a convergence speed comparison Figure 2 with wall clock times as opposed to number of gradient updates?  \n* In Analysis there is nice study on the staleness of the gradients in the buffer. Can the staleness bound just be enforced instead of relying on it being empirically the case?  \n* If the critical gradients are finally aggregated either via sum or averaging there can be easier strategies for doing the same aggregation in a more online fashion without additional memory. Especially given that there is a decay term when doing gradient selection for replacement. Was there an attempt to try more online approaches?\n",
