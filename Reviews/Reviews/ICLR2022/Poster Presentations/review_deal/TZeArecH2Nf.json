        "comment": "Between a reject, an accept, and a borderline-accept, this is truly a borderline paper, though I'd lean slightly on the side of accepting it. The most negative review raises issues of weak baselines, along with several more minor issues. The authors rebut this reasonably well, arguing several differences from the setting used in the suggested baseline papers. It is a little hard to follow who is correct between the review and the rebuttal, though the rebuttal makes reasonably convincing arguments. Other than the baselines most of the issues raised by the negative review are more minor and can be easily fixed in a revision. The specific issues mentioned are mostly not raised in either of the more positive reviews.\n\nThe borderline (positive) review is by far the most detailed, but overall praises the paper and mostly suggests fixes in terms of better positioning the paper. Overall both the positive and borderline-positive reviews make persuasive arguments as to the paper's conceptual merits, which outweigh some more minor issues."

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper studies item recommendation (ItemRec) and item-marketing (UserRec) as two variants of the same problem. Specifically, the authors convert ItemRec to UserRec based on the temporal point process with the proposed RIM. The authors evaluate the approach on three widely-used datasets.",
            "main_review": "***Strong aspects***\n1. The research problem is well motivated. Item recommendation and item marketing are indeed two important and close-related problems.\n2. Modeling users' behaviors by a temporal process makes sense, and it has been demonstrated effective in many works.\n3. This paper evaluates the approach on three benchmark datasets.\n\n***Weak aspects***\n1. Baselines are weak and old. Competitive sequential models in recommender systems such as the Transformer-based one, SASRec [1], should be considered. Besides, there is no baseline for item marketing.\n2. Experimental setup in Table 1 is strange. It is obvious that RNN will have better performance since all of the other methods cannot leverage temporal information. \n3. The evaluation is not well explained. Why is diversity needed in the ItemRec task?\n4. Paper writing requires improvement. The figures are not so clear, such as Figure 3. Even some basic explanations, such as the difference between UserRec and ItemRec, are not well presented.\n\n[1] Kang, W. C., & McAuley, J.  Self-attentive sequential recommendation.

Therefore I have raised my score.",

The studied problem is important, but the proposed method is not well evaluated and cannot be claimed as a good solution to the research problem.

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper considers the problem of recommendation in a temporal context. In this setting, which the authors call UserRec, the recommender system must determine whether to recommend an item to a user at a specific point in time given their prior interaction history, or whether to delay the interaction. They draw connections to classical item recommendation, where the recommender must instead recommend some item to a given user, and does not have the option of delaying the recommendation. By modelling the UserRec problem as a temporal point process (TPP) the authors propose a framework to convert algorithms developed for ItemRec into a UserRec model.\n\nThey then propose an algorithm for recommendation in matching that leverages their TPP representation to setup a convex optimization problem. Finally, the authors validate their results on three different datasets.",
            "main_review": "This is a strong paper with many interesting novel contributions. The problem of UserRec is very naturally modeled by the author's proposed framework and their empirical results are impressive.\n\nMy main criticism is that the paper was quite terse and hard to read on a first pass. The paper uses tools that are likely to be unfamiliar to many in the ML community with relatively little introduction. I think this could likely be remedied by moving some of the details that aren't core to the paper to the appendix, and spending more time on exposition during the main body of the paper.\n\nFurthermore, in section 5.1 the authors compare against classic matrix factorization techniques such as ALS. However, they do not compare against matrix factorization methods that take into account the temporal nature of the task, which have been shown to work well in these settings. e.g. timesvd++: https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~zha/CSE8801/CF/kdd-fp074-koren.pdf it would be interesting to see a comparison with such methods.",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes a framework to address the so-called user recommendation (UserRec) problem, tasked to match users (as item consumption sequences) to item products for marketing purposes. The framework extends the Temporal Point Process (TPP) and is built on top of a recurrent intensity model (RIM). The proposed methods were tested on three real-world recommender system datasets against standard baselines on both item and user recommendation tasks, in both offline and online matching experiments.",
            "main_review": "Strength:\n\n- The paper attempts to address the user recommendation problem for item marketing, which is relatively underexplored in the RecSys research community but critical in real-world applications.\n\n- The intensity perspective introduced in this paper is technically well-motivated, fresh and interesting.\n\n- The proposed methods were empirically evaluated on three real-world datasets against standard baselines, where the takeaway message is relatively clear. Apart from the user recommendation task, the trajectory perspective also naturally enables user-inductive generalization (i.e., without explicitly learning identifier-based user representation). This property is consistent with the user-inductive experimentation setup in the paper, also close to the real-world online scenarios.\n\nWeakness:\n\n- It is acceptable to me but the position of this paper might be a little bit awkward - it's apparently different from traditional item recommendation scenarios, attempts to address the marketing problem, but doesn't touch the causal aspect or deep dive into the applications such as online advertising or push notifications.\n\n- Another concern is the technical part of this work can be a bit difficult to digest for general RecSys audience. Including running examples might be helpful for readers to grasp the technical ideas at high-level.\n",
            "summary_of_the_review": "Although the paper has some caveats and the presentation of the work could use additional improvements, I still find the work interesting and enables a new perspective for the recommender system community. Notable contributions deserve to be called out are 1) it attempts to address the warfare of all parties of multi-sided marketplaces, and 2) it connects user and item utilities in a time-sensitive space. As a researcher working in industry, I'd like to emphasize that addressing the producer/marketer utility is crucial not only for the business success, but also for the market fairness as well as the long-term health of the ecosystem. In this regard, I personally appreciate the contributions of this work.",
