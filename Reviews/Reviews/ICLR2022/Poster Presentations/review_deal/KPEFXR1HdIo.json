The model is more detailed and physically realistic than proposed in earlier work, which may allow for applications to manufacturing guidance and textile design.\nThe paper is generally well-written and contains detailed problem formulation and derivations.\nExperiments show it is possible to successfully learn a control policy and material parameters using the differentiable model."

Compared to the previous differentiable cloth model, this paper is more specific and fine-grained.

Their contact dynamics can even model the Strobeck effect and also simulate self-excited vibrations. I would very much like to see those detailed dynamics in their video. (By the way, the authors mentioned the supplementary video in the paper several times but I could not find the supplementary materials. Did the authors upload it? Or is there something wrong with my reviewer console?)\nThe authors also conduct extensive experiments to support their claims. \n\nI also have some concerns after reading the paper,\n1. The fine-grained model is accurate. I wonder what its time performance is. Could the author report the wall clock time? I also notice the time step is relatively small (0.001s). What is the biggest time step the simulation can deal with?\n2. How this method can scale to some more complex topology? All the experiments are on one square sheet. Can your method simulate something like a T-shirt or dress, which is probably more relevant to design and fabrication?\n3. Could the author release the code and video as supplementary materials?\n",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This manuscript enhances the yarn-level cloth simulation to a differentiable level by introducing alternative differentiable operators in place of originally discontinuous/indifferentiable counterparts. In addition to differentiable components for energies, collisions, frictions, etc, this manuscript also differentiates through the implicit Euler method, which enables greater time steps with better stability. The authors empirically studied the efficacy of this differentiable simulator on a variety of environments with multiple baselines. I believe one of the major contributions can be a non-trivial implementation in C++ and its interfaces with modern deep learning architectures (unsure if it will be open-sourced through).",
            "main_review": "I believe the implementation of this paper is respectful and non-trivial. It looks like that this paper fills the gap in differentiable simulation with a cloth simulator from a yarn-level perspective. Despite its potential applications, I have a few technical questions and suggestions about it:\n\n1. This manuscript provides a novel view of the intersection of differentiable simulation and cloth simulation by thinking at the yarn level. I believe one of the important baselines is [1], which was the latest work working on differentiable cloth simulation in a mesh-based view. I expect some discussion between this work and [1].\n2. The statement \"Previous research (Liang et al., 2019; Du et al., 2021) suffers from this problem, which unfortunately leads to learning implausible parameter values\" looks technically inaccurate to me. Actually, leveraging prior knowledge for physical parameters is now a necessary step for system identification tasks. For example, because of the huge numerical difference between Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio, [2] proposes a logarithm transform to alleviate the unbalancement.\n3. I am curious about the wall-clock time and memory footprint of the experiments. It will be helpful to note them.\n4. As I questioned in the summary: a physical simulator usually comes with a steep learning curve which disables following works by the implementational difficulty. I wonder if the source code will be released for future follow-up.\n5. My main concern is motivation. The yarn-level simulation was proposed for more accurate collision handling and detailed presentation. However, the experiments are too coarse to show these advantages, which makes me question why the yarn-level simulator is used. As a reference, [3] used much more yarns to represent their cloth. I expect a more valid explanation for motivation or a set of better results that are more complex than 25*25.\n\n[1] Li, Yifei, et al. \"DiffCloth: Differentiable Cloth Simulation with Dry Frictional Contact.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2106.05306 (2021).\n\n[2] Hahn, David, et al. \"Real2sim: Visco-elastic parameter estimation from dynamic motion.\" ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG) 38.6 (2019): 1-13.\n\n[3] Sperl, Georg, Rahul Narain, and Chris Wojtan. \"Homogenized yarn-level cloth.\" ACM Trans.

I would like to know more about why the authors chose the yarn-based method, how they would like to use this simulator, and where they see the simulator fits in.

Without being familiar with such simulations in the slightest, I feel that this could lead to free energy being trapped in entropy and therefore thermal loss. Did you ever encounter such behavior?\n\n* Why do differences between inter/intra parameters (Table 2) and ground truth as the grid size increases? Should it not be the other way around?\n\nWeaknesses:\n* In the Comparison video, I could not spot any significant difference between the different weaves. At least not more than between Ground Truth and Ours. Did you also experiment with a bit more extreme differences in fabric?\n\n* It seems that no real-world experiments were done.

This setting is unrealistic. What would happen if we were to fit a 3D mesh, or a 3D sparse scan, for which the positions q_i are not available?\n- An ablation study is missing: what would happen if the proposed differentiable forces were removed?

In paragraph-2 of section 4.2.1, the paper claims “When the training data increase from 5 frames to 25 frames, the error reduces by around 100 times.
