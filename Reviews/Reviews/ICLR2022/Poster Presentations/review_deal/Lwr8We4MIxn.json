        "comment": "In this paper, the authors present a method that combines genetic data (using a hierarchical, graph convolution approach) with imaging data to predict schizophrenia. The reviewers raised several concerns that the authors have addressed. Some of the concerns were relevant to writing, the authors have clarified these points. Another important concern was about the baselines. The authors added other baselines. One of the baselines they added was GUIDE with random dropout, this baseline performs as well as GUIDE, but the authors argue that GUIDE leads to robust features. \n\nI ask the authors to move the other baseline results, specifically the GUIDE with random dropout, and the relevant discussion to the main manuscript, and to consequently temper the discussion of the bayesian feature selection. Currently these additional results are only in the appendix, and not the text. Conditional on this, I recommend acceptance."

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes a novel end-to-end framework for whole-brain and whole-genome imaging-genetics. The genetics network uses hierarchical graph convolution and pooling operations to embed subject-level data onto a low-dimensional latent space. The imaging network projects multimodal data onto a set of latent embeddings. For interpretability, a Bayesian feature selection strategy is implemented to extract the discriminative imaging biomarkers; these feature weights are optimized alongside the other model parameters. The imaging and genetic embeddings are coupled with a predictor network, to ensure that the learned representations are linked to phenotype. Experiments on a schizophrenia dataset show that the proposed method hasthe better classification performance than state-of-the-art baselines, and the biomarkers identified are reproducible and confirmed to be closely associated with deficits in schizophrenia.",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes GUIDE for integrating imaging and genetics data for predicting phenotypes. GUIDE uses prior info from gene ontology to restrict connections between genes and biological processes under a graph convolution network (GCN) framework. The genetic and imaging representations are combined for phenotype prediction. Graph pooling and graph attention are used for finding key pathways, and Bayesian feature selection is used for finding key imaging features. GUIDE is evaluated on a schizophrenia dataset.",
            "main_review": "Strengths\n1. The paper is well written overall, with problems of existing methods nicely laid out and provides just the right level of details for intuition.\n2. Most existing methods stop at gene-to-geneset when incorporating prior info. GUIDE additionally encodes a hierarchy of relationships between biological processes.\n3. The experiments carefully test each property of GUIDE, i.e. compared structured vs. random vs. fully connected graph as well as with and without imaging data.\n4. GUIDE achieves better classification performance than some state-of-the-art baselines, and features highlighted by GUIDE match with what are known to be implicated in schizophrenia.\n\nWeaknesses\n1. The motivation for this work is partly flawed. While it is true that many existing methods do not consider phenotypes, this is not the intended application of those methods. Instead, those methods are for finding associations between imaging and genetics, which GUIDE does not do, i.e. GUIDE does directly not tell us which genes are associated with which brain regions. \n2. How was polygenic score computed? Are cis SNPs of each gene aggregated using univariate GWAS beta? Any pruning of SNPs prior to combining? How was LD accounted for?\n3. There are a lot of hyperparameters in the model. Which hyperparameters are important and which do not affect results (as) much? How to set the important ones?\n4. In Fig. 2, while prior info helps, the overall AUROC is not particularly high. What is the best reported AUC with comparable genetics data in the literature? For example, in “Artificial image objects for classification of schizophrenia with GWAS-selected SNVs and convolutional neural network”, seems like their proposed method achieved AUC > 0.7 with just genetics. Also, in “Application of deep canonically correlated sparse autoencoder for the classification of schizophrenia states”, accuracy of 95.65% for SNP data sets and an accuracy of 80.53% for fMRI data sets were attained.\n",
            "summary_of_the_review": "The paper proposes a useful tool for integrating imaging and genetics with improved accuracy shown on schizophrenia prediction. The proposed interpretability strategy also seems useful. While many parts are based on existing methods, working out the details for combining various components is nontrivial.\n\nPost-revision Summary\nWhile the authors have addressed all my comments, the results are not quite at the level for a score of 10.

            "main_review": "Overall, the paper is well-written and organized. \nIt is interesting to use the ontological gene hierarchy to define a graph for gene embedding and design imaging features selection in a Bayesian approach. However, the methodological contribution is limited, and several issues need to be justified or supported by experiments.\n\nThere should be more rigorous experiments to validate the proposed method, concerning the target classification task, (1) the existing GCN-based methods, (2) the use of preselected SNPs directly, instead of the hierarchical ontology representation, e.g., replacing G-EMBED with G-MIND in GUIDE, (3) random dropout in imaging feature selection in GUIDE.\n\nIn the full pipeline of preprocessing and network modeling, none of the test samples be involved in any of the steps in the pipeline. \nIn this sense, it should be clarified whether the contrast maps generation, regarded as a hyperparameter, was conducted on the training samples only.\n\nThe reported performance is relatively too low compared to the existing work on schizophrenia identification with task-/rest-fMRI (mostly higher than 80% in accuracy).\n\nIt would be interesting and more informative to illustrate the distribution of cosine similarities for different values of K, instead of a fixed value 50.\n\nIt is required to present the validity of handling missing modalities by using public datasets, possibly missing genetic or imaging data.\n",
