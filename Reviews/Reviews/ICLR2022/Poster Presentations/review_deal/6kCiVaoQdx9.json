        "comment": "This paper analyzes popular metric-based few-shot learning (FSL) methods from the perspective of computational geometry. Namely, viewing prototypical networks as Voronoi diagrams (VDs). This lends itself to incorporating extensions based on the recently proposed CIVD that allows for multiple centers per cell. The paper then discusses various aspects of the FSL pipeline (data augmentation, feature transformations, geometries and representations), referred to as heterogeneities, that can be efficiently ensembled via a cluster-to-cluster VD (CCVD). The resulting model produces state-of-the-art results.\n\nInitial concerns from the reviewers pointed to a potential lack of novelty (since it can be seen as applying existing ideas to FSL), lack of self-containment in the main paper, weak positioning in the context of other FSL methods (which ones can be interpreted under the VD framework) and a potentially impractical computational complexity. The discussion period settled these issues, with the paper receiving several updates, and the reviewers all ended up recommending acceptance.\n\nPersonally, I would like to see an addition to Figure 1 with the resulting decision boundaries from CIVD and CCVD. I think that this would greatly improve the ability of the reader to reason about the approach intuitively. Also, as a minor comment, I think that the argmax below eqs 1 and 7 should either be an argmin, or the distances should be negated. Otherwise, I think this is a valuable contribution to the FSL literature."

",
            "main_review": "Positive:\n- The use of the Cluster-induced Voronoi Diagram and its variant introduced in this paper are novel to FSL (to the best of my knowledge).\n- The resulting voronoi-diagram formulation is geometrically elegant, and allows the integration of various classifiers, heterogeneities and types of feature representations.\n- The results appear to be state of the art (at least relative to the compared works) and standard datasets used by the community.\n- The ablation study appears to be a good first order approximation of what I'd expect the authors to verify.\n\nNegative:\n- The paper is a bit difficult to read. I'd attribute this primarily to the extended use of the appendix. I agree that proofs can be included primarily in the appendix, but I do not particularly appreciate that much of the ablation results and tables are included only in the appendix.\n- Beyond the geometric point of view of FSL (which I do appreciate), to my understanding, the paper proposes a relatively straightforward aggregation of method/features/representations for FSL. Furthermore, the classifiers it integrates and the various heterogeneities are not novel, and neither is the cluster-induced Voronoi Diagram (which itself is a relatively straightforward generalization of voronoi diagrams).",

My main concern is the lack of details provided about the implementation, as I can see this approach would be useful in many future FS research techniques. It would also be valuable to add a discussion of how outliers would affect the method, computational complexity of the proposed technique. Can it be used for other tasks, such as segmentation?\n",

Usually, when adding new classes, old ones are not supposed to be forgotten (cmp. left and center panel). \n\nSome equations contain trivial errors, e.g. the optimization below (1) should be a minimization of distance. \n\nSome presentations confuse unnecessarily, e.g. (3) where an offset/bias for the distance is introduced, but it is called weight. The text below uses Dirichlet tessellation as a special case of PD, whereas before (3) they are identified.\n\nThe datasets used for the comparisons should be described in the main paper, not the supplementary material.\n\nThe overall results look impressive, but the paper needs a restructuring such that the following obvious questions are answered: How exactly are the methods DeepVoro(++) defined, what is their baseline and what modifications have been made? How are these modifications motivated from theory or experiments? Which of these modifications or theoretical insights are the main contributions of the paper?\n\nIn order to address these questions, include the dataset descriptions and the most relevant ablative results, section 3 needs to be streamlined and less relevant theoretical considerations need to be removed or moved to the supplementary material.",
