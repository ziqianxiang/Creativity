        "comment": "The paper presents an approach for learning inter-object relations. The relationships are represented in terms of scene graphs, and are processed with graph convolutional networks. All of the reviewers find the problem interesting and meaningful, which is the main strength of the paper. The approach assumes good object segmentations and state changes are provided to the agent, which the AC believes is a very dangerous assumption. Object segmentation or the change detection from raw data is still an active research area and lack of end-to-end training capability of the proposed approach is a limiting aspect. Still, the authors were able to convince all the reviewers that the problem formulation and the proposed approach is valid. Experimental results were provided to support the argument.\n\nRespecting the opinions from the reviewers, the AC recommends accepting the paper, although the AC himself/herself is very reluctant to give an accept rating."

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes a method to learn relationships between two objects, e.g., flipping a switch turns a light on. This is formulated as a binary classification task taking two objects as input and outputing a single a value $\\in [0,1]$ if the objects are related or not. The paper proposes a method to train this using RL to select the training (object_1, object_2) pairs. The paper also introduces a dataset for evaluation and provides a lot of experiments to study this.",
            "main_review": "The problem is interesting and well motivated. However, it is fairly simple. It requires point cloud inputs of the objects and then only needs to predict a binary classification if any two objects interact or not. This seems like a simplified version of \"Learning Affordance Landscapes for\nInteraction Exploration in 3D Environments\", Nagarajan et al. 2020 which predicts actions performable on an object (e.g., open, close, toggle, etc.) from images direction (e.g., without pre-segmented objects/point clouds). Such an approach could be applied to this setting, by additionally predicting the object that is changed, by making the output also capture the relationships/changes when an action is performed. Related, this work does not compare to any previous works. While the ablations are interesting and well done, the lack of other comparisons is a weakness. Especially given that this introduces a new dataset, comparing previous works to establish baselines is helpful.\n\nThere also aren't comparisons in the accuracy of different types of relationships (toggleable, many-to-many, one-to-one, functional, inter-object, etc). It would be interesting to see which of these the model does well on and which it does not do well on.\n\nThe experiments on transferring between environments are interesting and is an important ability for such an approach.\n\nThe paper would benefit from some proofreading and editing, there are some sentences with grammar mistakes, especially in the introduction. Otherwise, the paper is well written and easy to follow and understand.\n\nThe RL and self-supervised learning approach seem effective for this problem.\n",

However, the approach is not compared to any previous works and is fairly simple (e.g., predicting a binary value if two objects are related or not).

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes to study inter-object functional relationships such as a switch on the wall turning on or off the light. To tackle this task, this work designs a two-stage approach under a self-supervised interactive learning-from-exploration framework, which can predict functional relationships between objects in new 3D indoor environments. Furthermore, this work creates a dataset based on AI2THOR and AI2THOR to demonstrate the task. ",
            "main_review": "Strengths:\n-The task is interesting. Although I do not think exploring inter-object functional relationships in 3D indoor scenes is a new task (some previous works about causality modeling proposed similar tasks, such as \"Learning Perceptual Causality from Video\"), I appreciate the collected dataset and the designed pipeline of learning the relationships for inter-object. \n\n-The dataset and the proposed pipeline may inspire some applications such as home-assistant robots, intention prediction, and so on.\n\nWeaknesses:\n-Some details are missed which may affect the reproducibility o the work. For example. the reward design and shaping are not discussed. The FAST-INTERACTIVE-ADAPTATION is a little confusing. I am not sure what \"fast\" refers to or what makes the framework fast. It is nice if the authors could clarify this point.\n\n-The motivation of the design of some components could be discussed more clearly. For example, it is not intuitive for me why the input of binary-relationship prior network is a point cloud. It is not clear for me either why two objects nodes are connected because they are near(<0.5m)\n\n-The experiment does not evaluate the proposed framework over different types of relations. For example, I am wondering what is the performance of the framework on the many-to-many relationship prediction.\n\n\n",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper presents an interesting research problem of \"Learning Inter-Object Functional Relationships\" in virtual 3D indoor environments, where the goal is to make an agent understand the functional effect on an object by interacting with other objects in the scene. Two important (and related) questions arise: (a) How to understand which object(s) affects the functionality of which other object(s) in the room?, and (b) how to learn such inter-object functional priors to build a good knowledge base for reliable inference in unseen environments?\n\nThe paper addresses these two questions by presenting a reinforcement-based learning algorithm. \n\nThe technical summary of the paper is given below.\n\n===Goal===: \n\nLearning inter-object functional relationships, represented by scene graphs. That is, an agent is provided with large-scale scenes to explore for learning in the training stage and is asked to predict a functional scene graph, (S, R_s) for a new scene at test time. Here S is the scene and R_s is the relationship scene graph for the scene, S.\n\n\n\n===Assumptions===:\n\nObject segmentation and state changes (by \"state\", the authors refer to the functional outcome of an object) are provided to the agent apriori. Therefore, the functional effect of a relationship is directly observable.\n\n\n\n===Input===: \n\nA 3D scene as a set of objects {O_1, O_2, ..., O_n}, where each object O_i is explicitly modeled as (O_i^hat, c_i, s_i) where O_i^hat represents the point cloud of the object, c_i represents the 3D centroid, and s_i represents the object's isotropic scale.\n\n\n\n===Output===:\n\nFunctional scene graph, R_s, i.e., whether there exists a link between two nodes (objects) of the scene graph (scene).\n\n\n\n\n===Learning Style===: \n\nSelf-supervised learning framework\n\n\n\n\n===Neural Network===:\n\n1) Pretrained PointNet++ and an MLP (these two make up what is called a \"BR-Prior-Net\", which is short for Binary Relationship Prior Net) -- supervised training using observed GT data\n\n2) GCN, 3-layer (this is a part of what is called an \"SR-Prior-Net\", which is short for Scene Relationship Prior Net) -- Partly supervised using data from the above step and some rule-based heuristics\n\nThe goal of the above two networks is to propose functionally related objects.\n\n3) SR-Posterior-Net, which has the same architecture and weights as SR-Prior-Net. The only difference is that the input to SR-Posterior-Net, in the beginning, is the refined prediction output from SR-Prior-Net.\n\n4) A GCN trained using Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm to output action probability scores for each object that indicates the probability that this object triggers a state change on another object. Essentially, the RL-algorithm-based optimization on GCN is used to obtain supervision ground truth.\n\n\n\n===Dataset Used===: \n\nAI2Thor, PartNet-Mobility\n\n1) A total of 1200 scenes covering 23360 objects from 121 categories are used from the above datasets.\n\n2) Among these, 27 are trigger objects, 29 are responders, where 11 are both trigger and responders (e.g., desk lamp), and 79 are non-interactive background objects\n\n\n\n===Relevance of datasets===: \n\nThe above two datasets employed fit well for working on the proposed problem.\n\n\n===Loss===:\n\n1) For training the RL algorithm, a Policy Optimization loss is formulated.\n2) SR-Priori, BR-Priori, and SR-Posteriori are all simple link prediction tasks. So, standard binary cross entropy loss.\n\n\n\n===Objective Evaluation Metrics===:\n\nPrecision, Recall and F1-scores",
            "main_review": "===Quality of Results===:\n\nS: Extensive experiments on the design choices have been performed, which informs the reader of the need and functioning of incorporating such modules. The proposed method is a modular approach with simple networks, which is quite easy to follow.\n\nW: Well, it is difficult to objectively judge how good the results are. Although P, R and F1 scores have been used to measure the quality of results, they do not necessarily capture the \"goodness\" score, i.e,  P and R scores are biased, or rather, hide important flaws in the data stats that have a significant bearing on the result interpretation (and therefore the Model's learned ability). How about Matthew's Correlation Coefficient (MCC)? This metric correctly captures the quality of results and sidesteps issues prevalent with P and R scores.\n\n\n\n===Comparisons===:\n\nS & W: There is no comparison to prior works since the claim is that this is the first paper proposing this problem.\nHowever, experiments have been performed to validate the system design choices, such as the need for individual prior nets (binary, as well as, scene).\n\n\n===Novelty===:\n\nW: Problem statement -- The claim is that the problem is new. Application-wise, it may be, but it is nothing more than the task of link prediction. As such, I am not sold on the novelty of the problem.\n\nNeutral: Approach -- Good modular approach, but expected.\n\nNeutral: Results -- Interpretation could be better. \n\n\n\n===Limitations===:\n\nProblem novelty and Evaluations, as described above.\n\n\n\n\n\n===Relevant Literature Coverage===:\n\nS: \"Related work\" section is comprehensive and covers a lot of relevant papers in this field.\n\n\n\n===Writing===:\n\nS: The writing is good.\n\n",
            "summary_of_the_review": "Essentially, the problem of inferring inter-object functionality boils down to link prediction tasks, but the meat lies in the fact that supervisory GT signals are mined from the outputs of a developed system within. \n\nI give credit to the self-supervision part, but then, the problem itself pivots towards the theme of extracting priors from data for learning a different task. Plus, the evaluation is not reliably interpretable with the results shown. As such, I am sitting on a borderline score for this paper.",
