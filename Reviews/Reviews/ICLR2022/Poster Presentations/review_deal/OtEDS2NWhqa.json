            "main_review": "Strengths:\n- Interesting application of GNN in a clinical field where there is a great need of such applications.Clear clinical benefit.\n-Shows superior performance compared to prior methods with limited text data only.\n\nWeakness:\n- Details of prediction are missing.Is the performance better in patients with severe depression vs mild.While average and aggregated data results are presented, details of underperformance and opportinities for improvement could be identified in subsequent work.\n-Unclear why the performance is better compared to multimodal data approaches.Details of the comparison might be worth investigating.",
            "summary_of_the_review": "This paper has a very practical clinical context and if generalizable has good opportunity to for application.It is unclear why the performance is superior to other multimodal methods which should be investigated more with details of performance variability.Overall good work.",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes a schema-based GNN method to measure the severity of depression. To gain a global representation of each word, the proposed method constructs word nodes and uses schema structure to capture the context-level information. The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of the schema encoder. The experimental results show the superiority of schema GNN over other SOTA models.",
            "main_review": "+Ves\n+ The idea of using schema GNN is interesting for understanding depressive symptoms.\n+ The paper is a nice effort with visualizations and nice structure, the ablation studies have been well motivated by pointing out the difference of using different operations. \n+ The results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n-Concerns\n\n-Considering the size of dataset, I deem that, the authors should do more experiments on multiple other datasets about depression detection to prove the good performance of the proposed method.\n-The related works are insufficient.
