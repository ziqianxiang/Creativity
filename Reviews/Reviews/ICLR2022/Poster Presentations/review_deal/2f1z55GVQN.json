        "comment": "*Summary:* \n Study the location of local minima for quantum generative models. \n\n*Strengths:* \n- Rigorous analysis of an important question. \n- Clear writing with important conclusions. \n\n*Weaknesses:* \n- Technical writing might not be very accessible.\n\n*Discussion:* \n\nReviewers were mostly favorable about this submission. They found the topic important and the contribution significant. A main concern was that the writing might not be sufficiently self contained and the writing might not be accessible to a broad audience. Authors worked on the accessibility. In the initial review, zxWF expressed concerns about concepts, proposed methods, numerical experiments. zxWF found that the author responses carefully covered most of their comments and raised score as a consequence. zxWF still finds that some aspects could be improved, particularly in regard to experiments. F6sD found the question well motivated, the techniques impressive, and the claims important. \n\n*Conclusion:* \n\nThree reviewers are favorable about this work. Two of them find it good and one marginally above the acceptance threshold. I find the topic and the nature of the claims important. Considering the unanimously positive reactions from the reviewers I am recommending this article to be accepted. I ask the authors to take the comments from the reviewers carefully into account when preparing the final version of the paper."

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper analyzes a general class of variational quantum circuits using random matrix theory, and gives a theoretical characterization of the distribution of high-quality local minima of the associated Hamiltonian loss function. A type of phase transition is predicted, where the model exhibits an abundance of high-quality local minima only at very large parameter counts, and a wide gap between global and typical local minima at more typical parameter counts. These predictions are compared with small numerical experiments, as well as previous works on this topic.",
            "main_review": "### Strengths\n\n* The paper gives a rigorous analysis of a general result connected to an important open question in quantum machine learning, namely the ease or difficulty of finding high-quality solutions via gradient-based learning of parameterized quantum circuits. The paper's (mostly negative) result provides a useful starting point for researchers to build better quantum generative models, by avoiding the same assumptions used to derive results here.\n\n* The writing and presentation are very clean and polished, with important results given a more accessible informal statement in the main text, along with a precise and fully rigorous statement in the appendices. This goes a long ways towards making the difficult results presented more accessible to general readers.\n\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n* Despite the quality of the writing, the paper's results are still quite technical, and likely not accessible to most readers (even those working in quantum machine learning). This isn't necessarily a fault of the paper, but rather a consequence of the high technical level needed to derive results based on a non-trivial application of random matrix theory.\n\n* On the above note, I would encourage the authors to work a bit harder on including a more self-contained and accessible summary of their results for readers who can't or won't take the time to follow the entirety of the paper's technical development. This summary information is already available in a distributed form throughout the paper, with the description in the abstract doing a good job of qualitatively summarizing the main findings, and the last paragraph of Section 4.1 (along with Equation 16) doing a good job of defining the overparameterization factor and its defining role in this phase transition. However, it would be very useful to have a one-paragraph description in a more prominent place (end of introduction?), simply stating the expected quality of local minima as a function of (a) Hilbert space dimension (or number of qubits) and (b) quantum circuit parameter count.",

Some theoretical and numerical analyses are provided. \n\nThe major idea is to apply random matrix theory for variational quantum circuits. When the authors provide some numerical experiments, overall the validation is not very strong and could be improved. \n\nThe connection between applying random fields and quantum circuit training is not very direct based on the current writing. Some related references in the field are missing. (e.g., [1,2]).\n\n***\n\n**Reference**\n\n1.

            "main_review": "### Pros\n\nThe work leverages the concepts of random matrix theory to analyze the optimization\nperformance of quantum generative models.\n\n### Cons\n\n1. The paper is really hard to read. Several English grammar and word mistakes prevent\nthe readers from clearly understanding the main idea in the paper.\n\n2. A few concepts introduced in this work are either incorrect or imprecise and detailed descriptions of quantum generative circuits\nare totally missing.\n\n3. The proposed methods are not very technically sound because the barren plateau associated\nwith the optimization of QNN mainly arises from the quantum noise of NISQ devices.\nBut the work does not consider the noisy quantum circuits, which makes the work\ninsignificant in practice.\n\n4. Terminologies are introduced for granted without any explanation.\n\n5. The numerical experiments are not linked to the quantum simulation at all, and the\nexperimental simulation cannot corroborate the quantum theorems.\n\n6. I believe the paper including the abstract needs a major rewritten.\n\n## Feedbacks\n\n1. The abstract and each section contain some space that could be improved. \n\nFor example, \n\n(1) the claim “The clustering of local minima of the loss function near the global minimum” is imprecise\nbecause the local optimal minima are found but not clustered; \n\n(2) The sentence “...to local minima that are good approximations of the global minimum” is wrong because the\nlocal minima should be close to the global one but not an approximation. (e.g., approximation means you use other functions and methods to get the result.)\n\n2. The connections between local minima to the random matrix theory are still not very clear. \n\n- In particular, the authors do not take into account how to make use of their theory to improve optimization performance.\n\n3. Some key concepts related to QNN on NISQ devices are missing, e.g., barren plateau problems.",
            "summary_of_the_review": "When the paper provides some attempts to combine random matrix to VQC training, the theoretical findings are not very correlated to their empirical findings. The current version is not very ready to get published and several claims and description need to be modified. \n\n\n**Additional Comments**\n\n1. The information on optimization settings (optimizers and initialization) is not provided in\nthe paper.\n\n2. Since the quantum generative model refers to a large model family, the ‘critical points’\nfor each concrete one are not the same. The paper does not show what specific models are\nused. Is it a quantum Bayesian network? Quantum hidden Markov model? Or anything\nelse?\n\n3. Many important related papers are not cited, e.g, for the expressiveness of QNN, which has to be credited from\n\n“The effect of data encoding on the expressive power of variational quantum machine learning models,” Physical Review A, 2021 - APS\n\n***\n\n### Post-Author Response \n\nI think most of my comments have been carefully covered by the authors. Thank you for your efforts during the rebuttal period. \n\nWith the current version, some of the writing, reproducible discussion, and presentation have been largely improved. \n\nI therefore increase my score to 6; one remaining place that would still improve is the current VQA experiments is limited to a single empirical case. \n\nSome of the variational circuit works have been studied in a classical-quantum format. The author could consider to add some connection to enhance potential impact of the works. \n\n",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper obtains rather impressive results about the problem of estimating a quantum ground state energy using a variational method which could be implemented on a quantum computer.  Given a Hamiltonian H, the method generates quantum states by applying a succession of n-qubit Pauli operators to a random initial state (both chosen without knowledge of H), and measure the expectation of H.\nPrevious work suggested that there is a critical (and exponentially large) number of parameters required to get a good estimate. \nHere a theorem is formulated and proven that there is a phase transition of this type, with good estimates only above a threshold in the number of parameters, and with an explicit expression for the threshold.  The proof uses a combination of physics methods (series expansions), random matrix theory and the Kac-Rice method to count critical points of a random function.",
            "main_review": "The main results are stated and proven in theorems 1,2 and 3.  Theorem 1 defines a randomized set of quantum variational problems and asserts that their loss landscape is the same as that of a random potential model with potential given by a complex Wishart random matrix.  Theorem 2 then computes the distribution of critical points of this random potential model, while theorem 3 gives its asymptotics.   This result is then interpreted to demonstrate the phase transition discussed in the summary.\nIn section 5 a numerical confirmation of the results is done on a 1d Hubbard Hamiltonian.\nIt is also suggested that a similar algorithm but using operators adapted to the Hamiltonian might do significantly better, and this suggestion is supported with citations and another numerical experiment.\n\nI found the main question well motivated and clearly asked, and an impressive variety of techniques were brought to bear on it.\nI was surprised by the basic claim that this class of models is sufficiently random to justify dropping all of the higher moments in computing the ground state energy.  The arguments given for this are explicit but intricate and while they look reasonable, I did not check them in complete detail.  I suspect that there is a much simpler argument waiting to be found, perhaps building on the comments in Appendix A.3.\nGiven this claim, the rest is conceptually straightforward but rather nontrivial to carry through successfully.",
