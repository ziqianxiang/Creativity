            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper's goal is to evaluate the sample-efficiency of planning-based and policy-based approaches, as well as hybrid versions of each, in several multi-task continuous control environments. The paper shows that for the tasks investigated and the specific computational budget allocated to the planner, the planner performs significantly worse without a good proposal distribution (policy sampler), even when employed with ground-truth access to dynamics and rewards. Then, the paper presents multi-task experiments with variations of their proposed hybrid planning-amortized method that concurrently learns a proposal distribution, model, and critic; these experiments show that the MPC-based variants outperformed a model-free method to varying degrees.",
            "main_review": "Strengths\n--\n- The paper investigates a topic that is interesting and timely\n- The results illustrate settings in which the quality of the policy proposals are very important to the final performance\n- The proposed hybrid method is straightforward\n- The paper includes exhaustive ablations\n\nWeaknesses\n--\n- W1 Some writing issues: **W1.1 Missing proposal terminology** and **W1.2 Dubious justification of model determinism**\n- W2 The presented evidence doesn't fully validate the claims: **W2.1 Missing evidence of computational burden**,  **W2.2 Narrow set of environments used**, and **W2.3 Narrow set of tasks used**\n\nWeakness 1:\n--\n-  **W1.1 Missing proposal terminology** The terminology \"proposal\" used in the abstract and introduction needs a clear definition if it's going to be used here. Is it a single action sampled from a policy? Is it a stochastic policy? Unfortunately, the current introduction forces the reader to guess.\n- **W1.2 Dubious justification of model determinism** S4.2 The use of deterministic models here is fine, but I'd argue that it's a reasonable assumption mainly because of determinism (I assume) in the true environment dynamics. If the MDPs investigated had significant stochasticity in the environment dynamics, then perhaps it would not be a great assumption, and performance would be significantly worse. S4.2 should be explicit about the degree of stochasticity in the actual environment dynamics. If the degree is insignificant (or none), it'd be great to get the authors' take on whether they agree that the main reason deterministic dynamics models work well is simply that the modeling class can represent the true dynamics models employed in the target MDPs.\n\nWeakness 2:\n--\n- **W2.1 Missing evidence of computational burden** S4.3 The claim that planning in these tasks cannot be performed alone with the ground-truth dynamics model and reward function requires more detail and requires more evidence. It is fair to assume that with enough search time/compute, a long-enough planning horizon, and access to ground-truth dynamics and rewards, the tasks can be solved e.g. via brute force search. Thus, the claim needs to be more specific about the computational restrictions that necessitate the use of a proposal-generating policy. This issue also appears in the first paragraph of S6 -- there's no actual discussion or experimentation of what constitutes 'limited' computation time. Because this claim is central to the paper's message -- that a good dynamics model is insufficient for transfer -- the paper would be much stronger if it presented evidence across a clear regime of computational time constraints that the result holds. For example, a plot of Performance vs. Computation time, with the 'optimal' and 'best proposal-based method' performance as single points (or sets of points), accompanied by the performance of MPC with GT dynamics and rewards with different computational budgets plotted as a curve. By the paper's claims, the latter MPC curve should be significantly below the 'optimal' and 'best proposal-based method' for reasonable computational regimes, and above the 'best proposal-based method' when an 'unreasonable' amount of compute is assumed (if feasible).\n- **W2.2 Narrow set of environments used** The employed set of multi-task evaluation environments in the paper is quite small. While it's good that the single-task environments are presented in the appendix, without a broader set of multi-task environments, we cannot draw broad conclusions about these methods in other multi-task settings\n- **W2.3 Narrow set of tasks used** The multi-task evaluation is limited to tasks in which the multi-task nature is target-goal reaching. Results presented on different MDPs in which the reward function variation is more sophisticated than goal reaching would provide more support for the claims.\n\nMinor weaknesses\n--\n- The DAGGER reference in 4.1 is too tangential (neither necessary nor particularly useful).\n- S4.3 Near \"We can then improve our proposal by minimizing the KL divergence\", the optimization variables need to be clarified, since it's unclear if the $\\pi_\\theta$ contained within $\\tilde{\\pi}_{\\mathcal B}$ is optimized. However, Eq. 1 clarifies this, so perhaps just call it a 'forward' KL divergence.\n- S4.1 says more details about the planner are in Sec B of the supplement, but the supplement didn't contain a .pdf (I found Sec B in the appendix of the .pdf)\n- Fig 2 needs more details in the caption or in the main text to describe the difference between 'actor' and 'proposal'. My understanding is that the 'actor' is the MPC actor if MPC is used, or equivalent to the policy (and the 'proposal') if MPC is not used.\n- Footnote 2 requires a citation or evidence for the claim \"MPO has a known problem with shrinking policy variances\". Furthermore, this hypothesis could be tested simply by adding a policy-entropy bonus to objective function, no?\n",
            "summary_of_the_review": "While the research question and initial evidence are promising, the main issue with the paper is Weakness 2 above, particularly W2.1. Evidence is required to support the claimed computational burden of planning with ground-truth dynamics model and rewards. Furthermore, the multi-task experimental results are only conducted in two environments (W2.2) and only for goal-directed tasks (W2.3), which doesn't support the claim that the quality of the proposal distribution is critical to planning in *general* **multi-task** settings; it instead only constitutes evidence that the quality of the proposal distribution is critical to planning in *some* **goal-directed tasks**. \n\nIn my opinion, this missing evidence weakens the paper slightly below the bar of acceptability.",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper performs a careful study of the advantages of integrating model-based components into an RL system.  In particular, they clearly distinguish between the effects of learning a predictive model and learning a proposal distribution for a forward-sampling planner.   They sensibly focus on what seems like the \"sweet spot\" for model-based methods:  transfer of a model from one task to another in a domain with the same basic dynamics.   They find that, when using forward-sampling planners, the proposal distribution is the driving factor of success, so that learning and transferring a good model does not, in itself, improve performance much.",
            "main_review": "This paper is very clearly written, well argued, and well executed.    The experiments are well-designed and clearly illuminate the points being made.  The paper adds an increment to the collective knowledge of the field about RL methods.\n\nI also find it deeply unexciting and not at all imaginative.    I would have been more enthusiastic about a less well executed paper with a really new idea.   Surely the fact that transfer isn't working very well tells us that we need some new insights (or I guess, an argument about why all of our intuition about transfer in problems like these is wrong).   Is there a way to improve the planner so that it's less stupid, for example by learning landmarks or making it hierarchical?  Could we make the proposal distribution depend on the goal in the GTTP tasks?\n\nI have some small comments/questions, but none of them are critical:\n- In the early parts of the paper it would be good to clarify what you mean by \"learning proposals\" (it's made clear later)\n- I found it jarring that the word \"proposal\" is used frequently when really \"proposal distribution\" is what is intended;  to me a \"proposal\" would be a single sample from a \"proposal distribution.\"\n- When you discuss \"target poses\" do you really mean \"target configurations\"?   (This is ambiguous, I guess, but in robotics it's most common to use \"pose\" for a 6DOF pose of a rigid object and \"configuration\" for anything more complicated.   \n- Do you think anything different would have happened if the goals were a bit more naturalistic (e.g., get the centroid of the agent into a region)---it's rare in any natural situation or application that the entire configuration of a complex agent would need to be copied.\n- The design of the model was interesting---I was eager to read more about it in the paper body.\n- I am concerned that stochasticity was \"waved away\" without enough consideration.  In many important domains, the distribution of possible outcomes is not at all well summarized by the mean.  It seems important to at least acknowledge this.\n- It was a bit confusing to read the phrase \"task-agnostic proposal pre-trained with a behavioral-cloning objective.\"   It's hard to imagine a situation in which behavioral-cloning is task-agnostic unless, for example, you train on BC data from a whole mixture of tasks.  Perhaps that's what you did.\n\n(To the degree that I lack confidence it is with respect to the detailed novelty of this paper---I don't keep up with this sub-part of the literature and so I can't attest to whether or not this was already all well-known, for example.  But I think I understand the methods described at a sufficient level and get the experiments and their overall message.)",
            "summary_of_the_review": "Whether or not to accept this paper depends on what we think conference publications are for.  \n\nThis paper contributes some clear and well justified knowledge.  But the increment is small and it seems likely to me that substantially new and different techniques will arise soon and render this irrelevant.    It seems unlikely that this paper will inspire or excite new research.\n\nUltimately, this decision is above my pay grade, and depends on the program chairs' views about the role of paper acceptance.\n\nMy guess is that a good but not hugely exciting paper is thought to be on the positive side, so I'll lean positive.",
