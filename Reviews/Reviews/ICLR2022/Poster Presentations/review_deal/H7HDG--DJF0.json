        "comment": "The paper proposes some interesting ideas about decomposing the global symmetries of multi-agent MDP to local symmetries using a method called the Homomorphic Networks. The paper is well-writing and can be followed easily. However, there are a number of weaknesses of the paper. Below, we list some of the outstanding ones.\n\n(1) Both some of the reviewers and the AC find there are some clarity issues in the paper, for instance, it is hard to see why using keeping relative communication and local transformation would guarantee symmetry (it would be good to show this with a theorem); it is hard to understand the algorithmic structure due to the use of codes instead of diagram in Appendix D, especially when some definitions in the code are not defined in this paper; the AC also finds it is hard to understand how communication is performed during both training and executing. After the rebuttal, the structure of the paper has been improved but we encourage the authors to keep improving the presentation.\n\n(2) Another weakness is the experiment implementations, which the reviewers found were a bit too simple and contrived -- the traffic light example may not be symmetric in the real world. It might be good to demonstrate the effectiveness of the setting in a more realistic setting -- perhaps show that the method also works with a slight violation of symmetry.\n\nThat being said, the contribution of the paper remains significant, and the AC recommends borderline but slightly leaning toward acceptance."

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The authors give a generalization of MDP Homomorphic Networks (van der Pol, 2020) to multi-agent distributed settings.  This is not a special case of previous work as the agents are not assumed to be able to communicate freely.  The symmetry constraints of the single-agent case generalize to the multi-agent case with the twist that the group action also induces a permutation of the agents.  To create a neural network which matches this symmetry, the authors use a message-passing NN with equivariance constraints.  The method shows improved sample efficiency relative to networks which are only permutation equivariant trained with and without augmentation.  Only the discrete 90-degree rotation group is considered.  \n\n",
            "main_review": "### Strengths:\n- The authors identify symmetries which arise in multi-agent settings and identify ways to exploit them.  \n- The type of symmetry identified in Figure 1 is more interesting than those in MDP Homomorphic networks.  It is similar to the type of actions considered in Steerable CNN, in which the group acts on both a spatial base space and on a fiber space as well.  \n- The method is well-motivated and well-designed in that the architecture reflects and enforces both the global permutation symmetries and local rotational symmetries the authors identify in the problem.  \n- The experiments show a clear improvement in data efficiency which is quite important in RL. \n- The scope section in the conclusion does a nice job identify limitations in the current work and pointing the way to interesting future work. \n\n### Weakness/Limitations: \n- The symmetry in Figure 1, while interesting, is not really outside the framework of MDP with symmetry.  By simply assuming full communication and making a single centralized agent, we can still consider this symmetry by permutation/rotation as an MDP symmetry of a single-agent MDP with symmetries.    \n- The test domains are both fairly simple and feel a bit contrived.  In particular the traffic light scenario is only symmetric because the traffic lights have exactly symmetric lay out.  City grids notwithstanding, actual road segments are usually distinguishable in the real world.  \n- The authors point out they only use discrete groups, but the work is actually more limited than that.  They only use permutation actions and the discrete rotation group $C_4$.  Since the method is formulated to work with many groups, I’d like to see it tested with more groups.  In particular, for image data, $C_4$ is a best case for equivariant networks.  Using different groups would involve more complexity and potential downsides.   \n- It seems like data augmentation only involved randomly transforming each sample.  In practice, often additional samples are used with many transformations.  The argument could be made that this is not really less data efficient although it takes longer to train.  It might be good to compare to augmentation with additional samples.  \n\n### Questions\n- The action in equation (6) is only each local state and edge attribute.  So the new local state at node $i$ is computed in terms of the old local state at node $i$.   But the permutation action as in Figure 1 also permutes the local states.  Is some permutation missing from this defn?   \n- If the MPN has M layers and M is sufficiently large, then how distributed or constrained is communication practically?  For example, in the traffic light setting, I assume the lights can talk to their neighbors, so after M layers of an MPN, can’t all lights effectively communicate?  So isn’t that the same as a centralized control?  From the definition of MMDP, it seems logical that the information sharing constraint is per action step not per layer.   \n- What is the advantage of using Symmetrizer?  It seems a basis of linear $G$-intertwiners here would not be difficult to derive analytically (as most authors do). \n- In general, an MPN is fully permutation equivariant and, moreover, equivariant to permutation of node labels independent of actions or other features.  So using an MPN would seem to give too much symmetry.  In the traffic light setting, you want to be equivariant only to simultaneous cyclic permutations of agents and rotations of features.  However, I believe the edge features do the job of breaking the full symmetry of MPN and give exactly the symmetry you want.  Is this the case?  If so, can it be made more explicit or proved? \n- I assume the non-linearities are pointwise and applied only to regular representations?  If so, it should be explained. \n- Since only $C_4$ symmetry is used, I assume the Equivariance error is very small for the fully equivariant method.  Did you empirically verify this?  Also, how small is the equivariance error for the other baselines?  \n\n### Small Notes:\n\n- Sec 3.1/ para 3: what is $\\Delta(A)$? \n- Sec 3.2/ para 3: $e$ is not defined.  Also it seems a bit strange to be explicit with $\\cdot$ for composition but only use juxtaposition for the group action. \n- Sec 3.2/ para 3: this is a nitpick, but it is not “the same group action” if it is on a different space\n- Page 3 last para/ Page 4: The notion of “equivalent” state-action pairs doesn’t seem precisely defined to me.  In particular, it’s not clear to me what the sentence after Defn 2 is saying.  \n- Page 6, sentence after eqn 10: this is a nitpick, but linear combinations of equivariant functions are only equivariant if the output space is a group representation.  This would not hold for arbitrary equivariant functions between spaces with non-linear actions.   \n- Eqn 14.: Is $H_g$ defined? \n\n\n\n",
            "summary_of_the_review": "Overall, I tend towards accept.  The work appears to be sound and the method is well-motivated and well-designed.  I feel the extension from MDP Homomorphic Networks is not so large.  I believe the symmetries considered here may also be essentially considered as symmetries in the setting of van der Pol, 2020.  I feel the experiments are also somewhat limited.  They consider only the group $C_4$, compare only to versions of the proposed model, and the domains seem a bit contrived.  It is thus hard to evaluate how useful the method would be in practice.      \n",

Is Multi-Agent MDP Homomorphic Network a simple combination of Graph Neural Networks and Symmetrizer? What are the main challenges to exploiting symmetry in MARL?\n\n(2) The writing is not clear. Why is there a $|G|$ in $\\phi_e$'s output in Sec. 4.3.2? Can the authors use framework diagrams instead of codes in Appendix D to show the architectural details?  These obscurities are very confusing, especially when some definitions in the code are not defined in this paper.
