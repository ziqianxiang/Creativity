            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper introduces a method to leverage multi-modal offline data to boost exploration with TD3.  They train a BC agent on this multi-modal data with multiple levels of performance and show that by deferring to this policy with a form of time-varying epsilon-greedy policy for exploration, TD3 performance can be increased in a set of simple Gym control tasks.",
            "main_review": "## Goals\nThe goal of this paper is to demonstrate a method to leverage offline multi-modal behavior data that contains varying qualities of demonstrations.  The authors choose to leverage this data by creating an exploration policy that is the unimodal average of this data, and deferring to it for epsilon-greedy exploration.  They show that this exploration policy can increase TD3 performance by a significant margin on gym tasks.\n\n## Strengths\n* I am unfortunately not well-versed in exploration literature, but the idea seems interesting, and potentially demonstrates that offline data can be leveraged for more structured exploration, even when it is of poor quality.\n* Experiments, although relatively basic, seem to show the increased performance of the proposed method relative to its baseline (TD3).  \n\n##  Weaknesses\nThe paper reads like a student's project thesis.  I want to make clear this isn't a critique on the authors, but it is not up to the level of a conference such as ICLR.  I however appreciate the idea and the effort so would like to provide some constructive criticisms and encourage resubmission to a workshop which is more aligned with the level of the contribution.\n*  The main issue might be that this paper is presented as a demonstration-learning paper, but my understanding is that it is fundamentally an exploration-oriented paper and should be presented as such.  The proposed exploration method is not a bad idea, but in that case it should be compared with other similar exploration methods.  DDPGfD is specifically designed to leverage high-quality expert demonstrations, /not/ to be particularly good at exploration.  TD3fG does /not/ leverage high-quality expert demonstrations, and is aiming to rather explore quickly.  These are not the right things to compare to show the incremental value of your contribution relative to existing exploration methods.\n* There was little or no related work, and therefore especially for a reviewer who is not particularly well-versed with exploration methods it is hard to help you situate your method better.  For information, reviewers bid according to paper title and abstract, but rarely actually give the paper a read.  Had there been more emphasis on exploration in the title/abstract I likely would not have bid on the paper (which would be a good thing for you).\n\n## Readability\n* The paper has many form-based flaws that, although not fundamentally problematic for science, do make the paper a bit messy to read:\n  * There are numerous typos throughout ('Replay buffer', not 'Reply buffer' :)  for example).\n  * Figures seem to be copy/pasted form Tensorboard.  Although this is probably not fundamentally an issue it does make the figure less readable.  Ideally data should be exported and figures generated with something like matplotlib where the authors can better manage plot legibility, legend size etc.\n  * Please do not include aknowledgement sections as these de-anonymize you.  In this case it was more touching than de-anonymizing, but in the future this section is added on for the final paper submission, /after/ the review process.\n",
            "summary_of_the_review": "This paper proposes a potentially novel idea in terms of leveraging multimodal offline data for generating an exploration policy, however it does not present this idea as exploration but rather as LfD, and does not contextualize its contribution relative to the correct related works. \n\nThe idea is however interesting, and I encourage the authors to restructure their submission and consider submitting to a workshop related to exploration or deep RL as the ideas could be of interest to the community.",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper is an imitation learning + reinforcement learning (RL) paper. It cites several shortcomings of the behavioral cloning (BC) algorithm and proposes an approach of integrating BC with a popular RL algorithm to overcome those shortcomings. The algorithm essentially makes the agent balance between listening to the expert and listening to its own experience when interacting with the environment. The paper includes experiments on various gym environments.",
            "main_review": "Strengths:\n1. The paper attempts to tackle an important issue. Deploying an agent trained only with behavioral cloning does indeed cause a lot of issues in practice.\n2. The paper is very explicit in the hyperparameters, network architectures, etc used.\n3. The paper makes an attempt to do an ablation study, which is important for any paper claiming empirical success.\n4. The paper’s intention of using a policy trained with BC to guide the RL agent’s exploration is an intuitive idea.\n\nWeaknesses:\n1. [Paper structure]. This work is missing a placement relative to other work. The paper does not mention past work of incorporating experience with BC? This information could have been included in the introduction or explicitly in a related works section. \n\n2. [Correctness]. The paper makes several claims but the current experiments do not provide sufficient support for those claims. Specifics:\n- Page 2. The paper stresses the issue of “sub-optimality” and “non-Markovian properties” of learning from demonstrations, but there are no experiments showing how the proposed algorithm deals with these issues explicitly (e.g. varying optimality of demonstrations and measuring the algorithm’s performance, varying the number of demonstrations, or measuring sensitivity of method wrt. quality of demonstrations). \n- Page 2. The paper claims that the generator would give “informative actions in unfamiliar states”, but it does not define what “informative” means, nor does it include empirical tests of how an agent performs in “unfamiliar” states. There are no experiments to test the claim on “generalization” (as specified again on page 9, Section 7). \n- Page 6. The reported results for online training are based on only a single seed, possibly contributing to high variance in the results. The experiments should have been conducted and averaged over multiple seeds with confidence intervals. Results based on a single seed for online training and no confidence intervals gives little confidence on the reliability of their algorithm.\n\n3. [Technical details]. The paper lacks much consistency in technical details, and things seem largely glossed over. The many issues below have made it difficult to truly understand the main contribution of the paper and technical details of the method. Specifics:\n- Page 3. Section 2 does not define notation at all. Some of the notation seems overloaded (e.g. use of “i” on equation 5 is used as a counter variable and used to index time, gamma is first used as the discount factor and then weighting factor for their algorithm on page 4).\n- Page 3. The authors say they use 100 expert demos, but then say they use 50 later, which also seems arbitrary (Page 3, Section 3.A. vs. page 5, Section 4.A., below equation 14).\n- Page 4. Equation 11 uses the constant “1.2”, but based on equation 12 and the line just below equation 12, it seems the constant should be “2”. \n- Page 5. Figure 1 (right side) seems to be incomplete (missing a block between noise generator and BC error).\n- Page 7. All the tables (that describe performance, say Table 1 or 9), give averages/max/min but do not specify over how many trials.\n- Page 8. While clear implicitly, it would be nice if the graphs clearly specified which domain the results were for (e.g. figure 3 should label the leftmost as Ant-v2, middle as HalfCheetah-v2, and so on).\n- Page 8. Figure 4 (middle) uses the same color for two different methods, making it confusing to read the graph.\n- Page 16. In the appendix in figure 8, there is a missing graph for one of the seeds for HalfCheetah-v2.\n\n4. [Writing Quality]. The writing quality in general is quite low, and the paper reads more like a report than a complete paper.\n- Page 1. Words are misspelled/duplicated (e.g. in the abstract and introduction).\n- Page 5. Formatting is inconsistent (e.g. on page 5, Section C is not separated from Section B).\n- Page 7. Figures are wrongly referenced (e.g.: on page 7, I suspect the authors are referring to figure 3, and not figure 4 (similar issue on d. page 8)).\n- There are several atypical choices, including paragraph formatting and using Section titles like A. and B.\n",
            "summary_of_the_review": "While the issue the paper addresses is important, my recommendation is for rejection due to the specified weaknesses. The paper is highly unpolished and is presented more like a course project report instead of work ready to be published. Even if the technical details and writing quality issues were resolved, it is very hard to place this work in the context of similar work due to the lack of comparison to other works and the absence of a literature review. The related works section would also confirm if the issues raised have already been resolved. Moreover, there are several claims that would require more experiments, which would require another in-depth review.",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper proposes to explore two ideas which are biasing the exploration noise towards imitative actions and slowly transition from using demonstrations/generated data to pure RL. The paper compares its method with classical methods such as Behaviour Cloning (BC) and DDPGfD on a set of MUJOCO tasks.",
            "main_review": "Ideas:\nThe high level idea of slowly transitioning from using demonstrations/generated data to pure RL is indeed an interesting route to pursue. However, the implementation proposed by the authors is not really significant as it consists in simply weighting the different imitation terms by some decay functions with fixed hyperparameters (T1, T2, T3). This would need careful tuning for different qualities of demonstrations, choices of RL algorithms as well as RL tasks. The approach will be more convincing if it was data driven and those decay functions will depend on the task at hand and the demonstrations provided.\nSecond, biasing the exploration noise towards imitative actions seems an idea quite close to initializing the network with the pretrained BC network. It would be interesting to compare those approaches in the experiment section.\n\nWriting:\nSeveral typos still remains in the paper as well as in the abstract. This shows that the paper is not quite ready for submission.\n\nExperiments:\nThe experiments are minimal. The proposed method is not particularly sound theoretically and therefore we expect strong empirical evidence that it works well. The range of tasks if very limited (3 MuJoco tasks), more baselines could be added (example: RL starting with BC) and the ablation study could be improved by introducing some decay mechanisms also for the ratio between RL/expert trajectories in the replay.\n\nOverall, there are lot of avenues to still improve the paper for a future submission.",
