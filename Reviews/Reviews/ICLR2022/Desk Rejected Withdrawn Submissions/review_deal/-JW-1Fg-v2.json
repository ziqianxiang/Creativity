            "summary_of_the_paper": "In order to increase accuracy of image clustering using object attributes, the paper introduces:\n- A language-guided image clustering method (i.e. clustering guided with text (phrases) eliciting varies modalities (possible values) of object attributes to be recognized.\n- The clustering method is borrowed from the operations research facility location problem. And\n- a procedure to prune less-discriminant phrases used in image clustering guidance.",
            "main_review": "Questions:\n- Q1: “... model is provided with an exhaustive list of phrases describing all the possible values of a specific attribute.”. Exhaustiveness for all attributes? 1 phrase per attribute? Type of phrases impact on results?\n- Q2: “in Fig.1 taken from the ”Stanford Activity” data set- note that two distinct groupings are possible. To resolve this ambiguity, language guidance is needed.” Justification of the problem is too simplistic using just 4 images. I suppose the 2 groupings you refer to are 2 tops images (2 people pattern) and 2 bottom ones (1 toddler each).  Based on the 4 images your problem is clear but with multiple thousand image data sets showing brushing various teeth situations and other activities (drinking), one image-only clustering approach would have success.\n- Q3: “Current clustering methods typically wish to cluster the images according to the image category.”: Could you please clarify your definition of “image category”? Provided with image exemplars of varying features could deemed representing various categories or at a more granular level various features values (images of people of varying age groups, brushing their teeth, drinking takes care of representation of age feature in the image data set. Approaches described in “2. RELATED WORK” give some answer too.\n- Q4: “there may not be a simple data augmentation for removing every undesired attribute.” Is this this only justifying option? This not the only avenue (agreed that its very costly as you state it in 3.1 THE SINGLE-PHRASE PRIOR, paragraph 1) as usually one rather than “removing” every undesired attribute, emphasizes the desired grouping attributes though the representative input images fed to the clustering algorithm. Your approach is therefore an analog rather than a cure to specific inputs selection albeit more explicit (and possibly costly) in attribute modality description (various values of each attribute).\n- Q5: “the model is provided with an exhaustive list of phrases describing all the possible values of a specific attribute” and “this ”allow-list” does assume some prior knowledge about the relevant attributes” Does this seem a little contradictory? The exhaustiveness of text descriptions of attribute values assumes a rather good knowledge and “in context” of your intended application to select the relevant descriptive phrases and values.\n- Q6: In “for the task of person re-identification in surveillance, color names were used as a prior in order to define better similarity metrics, which led to better performance (Yang et al., 2014), and scalability (Prates et al., 2016). Our approach can be seen as extending these ideas from pixel colors to whole images.” Are you extrapolating to attribute of importance in your case? Because this tends to justify such approach for use cases where the attribute object of quantization is an important/dominating attribute (skin color for face recognition)  in terms of discrimination power for the use case and pixel quantity? For time of day, weather pattern images, whole image color could be an important feature but for activity, that might be debatable.\n- Q7: “we define a ”single-phrase” prior. We utilize a pre-trained network for mapping images and phrases into a common feature space.” Is this mapping used for all clustering use cases (one size fits all approach)? Use cases could be as varied as activity, object recognition based etc. In other words could you clarify  “we evaluate our method on several attribute clustering tasks...... where the ground truth class attribute is often not the largest object in the image.” as clustering by activity in the image for example goes beyond the presence of a single object/attribute.\n\nLanguage precision:\nPaper is fairly clear but has a few occurrences of unclear language like:\n- In “image category.  Yet, grouping by other attributes such as activity or age” you tend to mix global image attributes with image objects attributes. One might deduce “image age or image activity”.  2 or 3 occurrences.",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes a method for clustering images by assigning them to phrases. The proposed scheme first extracts image embeddings and phrase embeddings using a pre-trained CLIP (Radford et al., 2021), and then assigns each image embedding to one of the phrase embeddings. The optimization problem, which is formulated as an uncapacitated facility location problem, is solved using a heuristics of finding centroids with K-means and then replacing them with their nearest neighbor phrases. The proposed method is compared with four existing methods of zero-shot classification and clustering in terms of clustering performance on four different image datasets, showing the superiority of the proposed method.",
            "main_review": "** Major Strengths **\n\nS1. The motivation of this paper is to control image clustering results so that they conform to one's desired semantic meaning, which is an open and practically useful problem in clustering.\n(However, as discussed later in W1, it is questionable whether the proposed method is suitable for this motivation since it does not have a mechanism to control the phrases to be assigned.)\n\nS2. While the connection between the uncapacitated facility location problem and K-median/K-means clustering has long been discussed in the literature (e.g., [1]), the idea of formulating the problem of guiding image clustering by phrases as an uncapacitated facility location problem is interesting and reasonable.\n(However, as discussed later in W2, the proposed solution is essentially K-means + post-processing, and no theoretical guarantees are discussed).\n\nS3. This paper is well organized and well written.\n\n\n\n** Major Weaknesses **\n\nW1. Although the motivation of this paper itself (to control the image clustering results by phrases) is practical and useful, the proposed method is not a direct solution to realize this.\nThe proposed method performs clustering by assigning images to K phrases out of a larger set of phrases, where the assignment of image features to phrases is automatically determined based only on the feature similarities. The example in Fig. 1 shows that by including phrases such as \"drinking\" and \"brushing teeth\" in the phrase list, clusters relevant to these concepts can be obtained. However, if the phrase list contained other phrases like \"male\" or \"child\", these images would still likely be assigned to the clusters relevant to these phrases, which is not desirable in the sense of the motivation of this paper.\nIn the end, the proposed method alone is not sufficient to realize the motivation of this paper, and another mechanism such as a \"deny-list\" is needed to ensure that the phrases \"male\" or \"child\" are not included in the phrase list, or that clusters associated with these phrases are not formed.\nIt would be necessary to reconsider the discussion so that the motivation and the proposed method are consistent, or to clarify the position of the proposed method with respect to the motivation.\n\n\n\nW2. There are some unclear points in the proposed method.\n\n  W2-1. The problem is formulated as an uncapacitated facility location problem, but the solution is essentially K-means + ad hoc post-processing (i.e., replacing centroids with its nearest neighbor phrase and special care for empty/large clusters). Theoretical properties of this algorithm (guarantees of approximation, for example) are not discussed at all.\n\n  W2-2. The cluster update algorithm (Sec. 4.3) is ambiguous and needs to be clarified. It says to select K-p and p phrases from the previous clusters and the current clusters, respectively, and terminate if the loss does not decrease. Does it mean that after K-means, once all the centroids are replaced with their nearest neighbor phrases, up to K-p of them will be swapped with the phrases in the previous clusters? The order in which the centroids are swapped should change the results, but is there any rule about the order? There should be a possibility that the exact same phrase is included, but no special care is taken about that?\n\n  W2-3. I could not find how the \"excessively large cluster\" is detected.\n\n\nW3. The comparisons are insufficient.\nThe proposed method uses both image and phrase features for image clustering, but the compared clustering methods only use image features, which does not demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\nThere are several clustering methods that use multiple features. For example, majority of co-clustering / bi-clustering methods (e.g., spectral co-clustering, information theoretic co-clustering, non-negative tri-factorization, Bayesian co-clustering, bipartite graph segmentation [2], etc.) can be compared. The CLIP features map both images and phrases into a common space, and thus can naturally compute the similarities between arbitrary images and phrases in this space. Also, some of multi-modal / cross-modal clustering methods are applicable to unpaired data (e.g., [3]), so they can be compared too.\n\n\n\n** Other minor issues **\n\nEq. 5: The variable in the set-builder notation should not be v_i, but c_k'.\n\n\n** References **\n\n[1] Sara Ahmadian, Ashkan Norouzi-Fard, Ola Svensson, and Justin Ward, Better Guarantees for k-Means and Euclidean k-Median by Primal-Dual Algorithms, FOCS 2017.\n\n[2] Feiping Nie, Xiaoqian Wang, Cheng Deng, and Heng Huang, Learning A Structured Optimal Bipartite Graph for Co-Clustering, NeurIPS 2017.\n\n[3] Yangbangyan Jiang, Qianqian Xu, Zhiyong Yang, Xiaochun Cao, and Qingming Huang, DM2C: Deep Mixed-Modal Clustering, NeurIPS 2019.\n",
            "summary_of_the_review": "Overall, I would recommend rejection.\n\nThe motivation of controlling the clustering results by phrases is practical (S1), and the formulation of the problem as an uncaptitated facility location problem is interesting (S2).\n\nHowever, the proposed method does not necessarily yield clusters related to the semantic content desired by the user, and thus does not provide a direct solution to the earlier motivation (W1). Moreover, the proposed algorithm is essentially K-means plus ad-hoc post-processing, and there is no discussion on theoretical validity or approximation guarantees for the algorithm (W2). Last but not least, even though the proposed method uses both image and phrase features for image clustering, the experiments only compare the proposed method with the clustering methods using image features only. It is hard for me to say that the effectiveness of the proposed method is sufficiently demonstrated (W3).\n\nDue to these major problems, I cannot recommend acceptance.\n",
