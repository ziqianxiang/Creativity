            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper aims to improve semantic segmentation results on foggy scenes by introducing fog-invariant features. The proposed FIFO is composed of a fog-pass filter and a segmentation model. By alternatively optimizing the two networks, the model is able to improve segmentation results by reducing the style gap between different fog conditions. Experimental results demonstrate the robustness to fog conditions and effectiveness in improving semantic segmentation.",
            "main_review": "[Paper strength]\n+ The motivation is clear as the investigation into fog conditions is the most important part in foggy scene sementation. The paper is tightly oriented to this, with solid analysis and justification.\n+ The proposed fog-pass filtering module is intuitive and effective. The core idea is to close the gap between different fog conditions, so the fog-invariant features can be learned. A direct advantage is the synthetic fog only requires a fixed value of density level, which reduces the costs of generating training samples. Besides, it also significantly outperforms baselines without this module.\n+ Experimental results can well demonstrate the effecitveness of the proposed method. It achieves competitive performance in both visual and quantitative evaluation. \n\n[Paper weakness]\n- The novelty is not well highlighted. The core of the fog-pass filter is the Gram matrix, which is quite common in style transfer works. The direct application to foggy scenes is not very attractive. Moreover, calculating the Gram matrix is normally computationally expensive, especially when the number of feature channels is large. \n- Concerns on the robustness to various fog density levels. It is true that the proposed fog-invariant method can be theoretically robust to fog densities. However, it is not sufficiently validated by experiments. It is necessary to provide visual and quantitiatve comparison in different fog density levels.\n- Over-saturated effect in Figure 4. It is obvious that the reconstructed images by FIFO present over-saturated effect, especially around object edges (white halo artifacts). This should be reduced or even avoided as it may affect the segmentation results on boundaries. Also, there is no reason for this effect in the paper.\n- No discussion of efficiency. The authors indicate that the method has good efficiency but there is no evidence for that.",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This work proposes a semantic segmentation approach focussing on the images under foggy conditions. One of the major contributions of this work is the end-to-end module which does not entirely depend on the synthetic foggy image dataset, rather it uses them as an anchor to segment actual foggy images. In this work, the fog pass filtering module learns the representation of foggy images, and the alternating optimization of this fog pass filter-segmentation module ensures a robust segmentation in the presence of fog. The proposed work is evaluated on standard datasets and compared with the existing methods.",
            "main_review": "In my opinion, the following are the major strengths of the paper\n1) The use of end-to-end learning for incorporating robustness in foggy conditions.\n2) The paper is very well written and easy to follow. I would like to appreciate the authors who have ensured all the required experiments are included in the manuscript\n\nI would highly recommend this paper for acceptance. The only minor suggestion from my end will be the comparison of the computational complexity of the proposed method with respect to other methods.",

Specifically, this paper proposes a method for learning semantic segmentation models robust against fog. A fog-pass filter module is proposed to extract a fog-relevant factor from the fog style. Comparisons against mainstream methods are shown with qualitative and quantitative evaluations. ",

My primary concern with this work is the limited novelty of the proposed fog-pass filter, and, in terms of its structure, there seems no reason why it can deal with the hazy condition. What's more, the concept of fog-invariant features is ambiguous, and the article's logic is not very clear and not easy to understand.\n\nIn addition, the author claim that the proposed method has advantages over the previous work in terms of both efficiency and efficacy.
