        "comment": "This paper receives recommendations from four experts who are actively working on the Re-ID problem.  Two reviewers give more positive comments, while the comments of the remaining reviewers are relatively negative. The paper aims to achieve generalizable Re-ID without demographics (DGWD-ReID). However, two Reviewers, umsc and Cuay, pointed out that, the claimed novelty of such a problem setting is oversold, and some relevant works are not cited and compared in the original submission. More specifically, the concept of DGWD-ReID in the paper is not fully convincing, and reviewers umsc and Cuay both think DGWD-ReID setting seems to be a special case of DG-ReID, and may not need to be considered totally independently. Though the reviewer eLS6 gives more positive recommendation, an issue is still raised by this reviewer - the method is general and does not have much specific design for Re-ID, but the authors only used Re-ID datasets for evaluation. In experiments, the authors used powerful techniques/tricks in their backbone model to improve the performance. This also brings some difficulties for the readers to assess which part is really working in their method. It will be good if authors can further improve the paper."

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This work provide a distributionally robust optimation (DRO) based algorithm to address the generalized person re-identification without demographics. The key difference in experimental settings is all of demographics (e.g. domain ID, camera ID) are not accessible in the training stage. To address the problem, the authors propose Unit DRO to minimize the upperbound of the expected risk on an uncertainty set (DRO algorithmic framework). The solution for intractable optimization is adopting step \\tau^\\star and weights queue. ",
            "main_review": "PROS 1) The DGWD-ReID setting is novel, especially the privacy problem. 2) The analysis is sufficient. 3) The paper is well organized and easy to follow.\n\nCONS 1) Although Unit DRO achieves the superior performance compared with the previous methods, it is not clear, at least theoretically, why Equ. 6 could used when convex condition is not held. 2) In Table 4, when using only step \\tau^\\star, the performance is close to baseline, could you discuss the reason? And in Appendix C.1, distribution diagram of step \\tau^\\star represents the weights are close to 1, which means all samples in the dataset are treated equally when calculating loss, it seems contradict with the motivation in the introduction part. 3) About checkpoint used on test datasets. As discussed in Section 4.2, it is unfair to adopt model selection in testing. Simply selecting the last checkpoint is acceptable, but the optimization may not stable in the training stage. In my opinion, selecting the checkpoint with the best performance on a validation dataset (different from the train and test dataset) is a better way.",

The authors propose an interesting setting, solving domain generalizable Re-ID tasks without using demographic information (DGWD-ReID). This new setting is based on the concern of privacy risk for safe-critical applications. The paper introduces Unit DRO to construct the uncertainty set for possible distributions of unseen domains and reweight samples to learn robust domain-invariant features under the new setting.\n\n",
            "main_review": "Advantages:\nThe problem setting is interesting, and the proposed method is novel. It does not require the demographic knowledge, which is used in most generalizable person Re-ID methods, nor predefined distribution shifts assumed in Fairness problems. The proposed Unit DRO method overcomes the problem of optimizing on implausible worst-case distributions under DGWD-ReID setting. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of the method and shows the impact of hyperparameters with abundant experiments. The performance of the proposed method surpasses SOTA methods under various settings.\n\nDrawbacks:\n1.\tThere is a formulation error in METHODOLOGIES.\n2.\tThere are a few typo problems.\n3.\tThe method is highly hyperparameter sensitive.\n4.\tThe method is vulnerable to against relatively large camera perspective changes\n\n\n",

And the numerical domain labels are hard to expose geographical locations and environment information.\n2.\tThe authors claim that \"KL DRO is not held for over-parameterized neural networks\", please provide a demonstrate on that.\n3.\tAs the problem mentioned in Drawbacks.3, is there an easy way to find the optimized hyperparameters for the proposed framework?

However, this setting is not novel because it is the variant of Domain Generalizable Person Re-identification (DG ReID) that does not utilize the domain labels, camera ID and video timestamps. The existing DG ReID work [1] has not considered the above demographics and the work [2] has conducted the single-domain generalization ReID setting without domain labels. As a result, the proposed Domain Generalizable Person Re-identiﬁcation Without Demographics (DGWD) setting in this paper cannot serve as a contribution. This DGWG setting can still be included in the existing DG ReID setting.\n\n(2)\tThe DRO method has been studied in the field of domain generalization, as shown in [3]. Many works about DRO have been proposed to tackle the problem of domain generalization while these key references have not been cited in this paper. This paper does not clearly clarify why DRO can help tackle the problem of DG ReID and the motivation of this paper is not clear. For another word, DRO has been utilized to tackle the problem of domain generalization and it can be directly applied to DG ReID. Thus, the proposed method is not specifically designed for DG ReID. \n\n(3)\tFrom the baseline algorithms, we can see that both the cross-entropy loss and the triplet loss are used but why is the Unit DRO only enforced on the cross-entropy loss instead of the triplet loss?\n\n(4)\tThough this paper has cited the references of DG ReID [4, 5], this paper has not compared with their results on the large-scale multi-source settings proposed in [4, 5]. As a result, the existing results are not convincing to me.\n\n(5)\tMany key references about the domain generalization have not been cited.

This paper provides comprehensive experiments, including both qualitative analysis and quantitative results. \n\n\nCons:\n1. One of my confusing points is why the authors choose person re-id as the task, for me, the proposed framework is general, and it is more straightforward to consider more general domain generalization tasks, e.g., image classification. Maybe a more thorough comparison can be made with KL DRO methods in general DG tasks.\n\n2. For DG re-id, there is another setting M3L, RaMoE [a,b].
