        "comment": "The paper proposes an initialization method to initialize residual networks in an expressive subspace of weights. Although the reviewers highlighted some positive aspects, they found the contribution to be limited compared to prior work. Some reviewers also raised some concerns regarding the experimental results not backing up the claims made in the paper. The authors did not respond, so I can therefore not recommend acceptance. This will hopefully provide useful feedback for a potential revision."

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The authors propose an initialization method called random asymmetric anti-correlated initialization (RAAI), which initializes residual networks in an expressive subspace of weights. RAAI is a combined initialization of anti-correlated initialization (ACI) and random asymmetric initialization (RAI), where the last initialization method is already proposed. Through both theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations, the authors show that RAAI has both a chaotic phase and low dead node probability, which accelerates the rate of convergence.",
            "main_review": "Pros:\n1. Very interesting theoretical results. Through mean-field theory, the author shows that a Relu network with anti-correlated weights can be more expressive by taking advantage of a chaotic phase. \n2. The paper is well-written and the proofs are clear.\n\nCons:\n1. Poor empirical evaluations. I think the main drawback of this paper is that the proposed initialization is poorly evaluated empirically. The authors only evaluate RAAI in a simple teacher-student learning setup with non-standard residual structures. I suggest authors at least evaluate RAAI using a standard ResNet-18 on CIFAR-10 as a baseline comparison. A large-scale evaluation such as Imagenet would be better.\n2. Unclear relationship between ACI and RAI. I am not sure why the authors need to combine RAI with ACI. From section 2, it seems ACI can achieve a chaotic phase by itself. I suspect it is because combining ACI and RAI can provide more expressive initial weights. It's good to clearly state their connections in the paper. Since RAI has been proposed before, it would also be good to disentangle ACI and RAI by comparing them separately.\n3. (Possibly) unstable signal propagation. It seems RAAI is hard to be generalized to a deep network setting due to signal exploding. According to Figure 5, RAAI only accepts very small \\sigma^{2}_{w} to ensure finite signals. \n4. The difficulty of choosing k. The authors mentioned that some experiments need to tune the anti-correlation strength k. How hard is this tuning? Would be great to provide some ablation studies about hyperparameters.\n5. Why expressiveness of initialization is needed? Although this work proposes to initialize weights in an expressive subspace, it would be better to explain why expressiveness is needed for initialization.",
            "summary_of_the_review": "Overall, I think this is an interesting work that proposes an anti-correlated and asymmetric initialization. The paper is well-motivated, and theoretical results and numerical verifications are well-desgined. Anti-correlation is a good and novel way to improve the expressiveness of initialization, and thus it improves the rate of convergence. My major concern is its empirical evaluation given only a teacher-student setting with shallow residual networks considered. I would like to raise my score if more experiment results are provided.",

            "main_review": "This paper develops an initialization scheme which combines the anti-correlated weights with the asymmetric initialization to reduce the dead node probability of ReLU networks. It is claimed to reduce the training times on both synthetic and real-world datasets. However, the experimental results contradicts the claims. \n\n1. For the results on synthetic data shown in Figure 6, 7, 8, the best results are achieved with Adam, but the proposed RAAI does not converge faster than ACI and sometimes is slower than RAI.\n\n2. For the result on real-world dataset, RAAI seems better, but no details of the hyper-parameter tuning process is given. Since different methods use different $\\sigma_w^2$, it is reasonable to believe these initializations may correspond to different optimal learning rates.\n3. It is unclear to me why the experiments in the main content only focus on the synthetic teacher-student setting. \n\n4. The analysis seems only applicable to feed-forward ReLU networks without normalization layers. For many practical systems, best result is achieved for networks with normalization layers, skip connections, and even attention mechanisms.\n\n5. The concept of expressivity is not well-explained in the paper. It is not clear to me why a network with less dead nodes is more expressive. For feedforward ReLU networks, if there is no dead node, then it degenerates into a linear network, which might be the least expressive.\n\n6. The claim \"...it performs better than the best-known initialization schemes on tasks of varying complexity\" seems too strong. The only compared baselines are He, ACI and RAI. ",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper studies the signal propagation properties of deep ReLU networks at initialization time. For a standard ReLU network, the correlation between activations of two training examples converges to one as the depth goes to infinity. To resolve that, the authors proposed to use correlated weights at initialization time to avoid this pathology. With correlated weights, the correlation could instead converge to a value smaller than one (so-called chaotic phase). Empirically, the authors found the networks initialized with correlated weights train faster.",
            "main_review": "Strengths:\n- The idea of using correlated weights is interesting. However, this was first proposed by Li & Saad.\n\nWeaknesses:\n- The paper is poorly written and very hard to follow. There are many typos and grammar errors (see detailed comments below). Other than that, the misuse of \\citet and \\citep makes it unreadable. The random asymmetric initialization is one important component of the proposed initialization scheme, but the authors do not clearly explain what it is in the paper.\n- The motivation is relatively weak. One can achieve a chaotic phase with many other activations. For example, ELU activation function has similar advantages as ReLU and can be initialized carefully to be in the chaotic phase. In addition, deep networks in the chaotic and ordered phase are either hard to train or impossible to generalize (see [1]). Both chaotic and ordered phases should be avoided when designing an initialization scheme.\n- The contributions are neither novel nor significant. This work basically combined random asymmetric initialization with anti-correlated initialization, both of which were proposed before by other papers. \n- The experiments are all run on toy problems with relatively shallow networks (10 layers). No implementation and tunning detail is provided. The improvement of using the proposed initialization scheme is marginal on three real-world datasets.\n\n\nDetailed comments:\n1.
