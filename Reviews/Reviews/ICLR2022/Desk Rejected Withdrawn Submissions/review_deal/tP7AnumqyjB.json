            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes a novel method to do 3D shape reconstruction without using strong supervision such as ground truth SDF, Occupancy of points sampled around the object. This is an important problem since such sources of strong supervision are not available in the wild. This method represents shapes implicitly as a scalar field which is a solution of a Poisson partial differential equation. Instead of directly estimating the scalar field, they transform the field into a fourier domain and subsequently make predictions for the fourier coefficients by means of a 3D CNN. The paper gives step by step details of the spectral differentiation which is the theoretical basis for their methodology and proposed architecture. The authors test their proposed method on three categories of ShapeNet dataset and show comparisons with prior methods and show that their method is competitive. They also perform an ablation to test one of their claims i.e. whether making predictions in the fourier domain actually makes a difference or not?\n",
            "main_review": "Strengths:\n\nThis paper builds on the line of research wherein shapes are represented as a scalar field which are solutions to a partial differential equation. In particular, while prior methods have mainly studied Eikonal equation to get such scalar fields [1], this paper proposes to use poisson equation since the latter does not need supervision for the normals. The paper provides a sound theoretical explanation for enabling their network to learn in the fourier domain which is quite novel and interesting. \n\nWeakness:\n\nPoor writing: The paper is poorly written with several typos and seems to be missing important details. Moreover, some parts are largely unwritten which gives an impression that the paper is unfinished and therefore not ready for publication in its current form without a major overhaul. In particular, the caption for the architecture figure [Fig. 1]  is missing and the figures are numbered incorrectly. The paper lacks important implementation details such as defining what the variables sigma [eq 8.], tau [Eq 10] are and what were their values in the experiments?\n\nMissing Literature and insufficient comparisons: The paper seems to have missed important recent advances in learning implicit representations from raw point cloud data by Matan et.al. In my view, two of these are (1) Sign Agnostic Learning (CVPR 2020) and Sign agnostic learning with derivatives (ICLR 21). Note that both of these methods demonstrate their advantage over IGE. To better support the claims, I believe discussion and comparisons to these methods is quite crucial for this work. \n\nLack of sufficient experimental validation: The paper shows comparison with IGR which is also a semi-supervised method capable of learning implicit representations from raw point clouds. However, the proposed method gives inferior results compared to IGR on both Chamfer and Normal consistency metrics. This raises questions about the effectiveness of using the proposed method. It would be interesting if the authors could highlight why using their proposed method is beneficial despite a decrease in performance compared to a method from 2 years ago. Since this work uses relatively dense point clouds for shapes (4096 points) I think it becomes important that they also show comparison with Poisson Surface Reconstruction. The normals for point cloud can be computed either using some heuristics or using one of the SOTA point cloud normal prediction methods to highlight the effectiveness of the proposed method. I am also curious to see what happens when the point cloud density is gradually decreased (to say 256 points). Authors should also add ablation studies about the effect of changing the variance of source function [Eq. 8]. \n\nBaseline method better than proposed: From Table 1, it seems that the proposed baseline (SDF Regress) performs even better than the proposed method of computing the fourier coefficients. This raises serious doubts about the effectiveness of learning in fourier domains which is a core contribution of this paper.\n\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Vincent Sitzmann, Julien N.P.

            "summary_of_the_review": "While the paper proposes a novel method to do 3D shape reconstruction without using strong supervision -- which is an important problem in the current literature, it is poorly written, lacks crucial comparisons (SAL 2020, SALD 2021) to recent prior works. It  lacks adequate ablation and experimental validation -- in spite of novelty, the network seems to give inferior results compared to baseline model (SDF Regress) and prior art (IGR)  trained with similar supervision. As such, the authors do not provide any theoretical justification of choosing their method over prior art (IGR). I think the idea presented in this paper has potential, however in its current form, this paper is not suitable for publication at ICLR due to the above mentioned limitations. \n",

Rather than working on the space domain, the authors first extract the SDF in a discretized frequency domain, and then apply IDFT to get the SDF function. The boundary condition loss and the PDE loss are derived to train the network.",
            "main_review": "I have several concerns about the paper.\n\nLosses:\n\nIn SDF learning, commonly used losses are: 1) a data term loss for point cloud on the surface; 2) a data term loss for point cloud normal (if available); 3) the Eikonal loss to force the SDF gradient to be 1; 4) a loss to ensure off-surface points with SDF away from 0. \n\nFrom my understanding, the derived boundary condition loss is equivalent to 1) the data term loss. Meanwhile, the PDE loss serves similar function to 3) and 4). Then, it is necessary to compare the PDE losses with 3) and 4). Although IGR is a combination method of the 1) + 2) + 3) + 4), it uses MLP in the network which is a complete different framework to the proposed paper. Thus, the authors should design ablation study to use losses 3) and 4) in their framework to demonstrate advantages of the proposed PDE loss.  \n\nFramework:\n\n1. The authors introduce the 3D CNN and an intermediate frequency domain volume (64^3) in the network. Will the explicit volume restrict the resolution of the method? How about using an implicit neural function (MLP)? A comparison or more explanations should be needed to compare the explicit 3d volume with the implicit MLP.\n\n2. The authors first regress the volume in frequency domain. What is the advantages of using the frequency rather than the space domain? Also, as far as I know, positional encoding (in NERF) and SIREN are two commonly used frequency-like methods. Comparison with these two methods is a must.\n\n3. What does \"self-supervised\" mean in this paper? Does it mean the PointNet is pretrained and other parts are online trained?\n\nExperiment:\n\n1. The authors conduct experiments, but just conduct the experiments. There is no discussion on any of the results, and the results are obvious inferior to the mentioned baselines.\n\n2. Experiments only performed in the toy ShapeNet dataset. More datasets should be tested.",

The method is well motivated and representing shapes in the spectral domain has potential applications on a range of other related problems.\n\n### Cons\n\nThe evaluation of the method is very limited and the presented results do not support the claim that the method can accurately reconstruct surfaces.\n\n- In table 1, the proposed method rarely outperforms the provided baselines, making it difficult to evaluate how well the method performs. \nIt would have been interesting to compare the method with baselines that support similar input: point clouds without normal supervision nor ground truth distances. While IGR without normal supervision is mentioned, the method is not compared to this baseline (only with IGR with normal supervision). Moreover, in Hanocka, Rana, et al. \"Point2mesh: A self-prior for deformable meshes.\" 2020, surfaces are also reconstructed from point clouds in a  self-supervised way.\n- In figure 3 the shape reconstructed on the last row is quite far from the ground truth. The advantages of the proposed method compared to baselines are not easily noticeable nor described in the text. It would be useful to further describe the presented qualitative and quantitative results.   \n- The limitations of the method are not clearly addressed while the results clearly suggest some limitations. In what conditions will the method fail? What are the reasons and are there potential solutions/improvements? \n- Section 1: The method from Gropp et al., 2020 does not rely on ground truth supervision. It would be valuable to state this point in this section. \n- Figure 1 and Figure 2 seem to be referring to the same figure\n",

The main contribution is to define iso-surface as the solution of a Poisson partial differential equation with a formal proof.

Limited experiments are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method over the SOTA works. ",
            "main_review": "Strength: \n\n+ The proposed method is theoretically interesting. The minimum principle in proposition 1 guarantees the unity of the solution to the Poisson equation. This avoids the critical solutions problem that exists in previous work. \n\nWeakness: \n\n- Writing. \n1. This paper is somewhat premature and looks like not yet finished. There are significant typos shown in the paper. More incredibly, fig. 2 is even missing from the paper.  \n\n2. The presentation is inconsistent. For example, in the abstract and introduction, the authors describe the proposed method as semi-supervised in the title and conclusion while stating it as a fully unsupervised learning scheme. \n\n\n-Methodology\n1. The PDE loss is interesting but somewhat hard to train. It looks like we need a huge point cloud set (high density) to ensure the coverage with PDE loss. Besides, it will lead to high time-consuming training as well. These limit the application of the proposed method. \n\n- Experiments \n1. The effectiveness of the novel designs in the proposed method, such as learning the Fourier coefficients instead of inferencing the values of distance function, etc. have not been experimentally studied and verified. Comparing the full model against SDF regress is not sufficient to evaluate the power of each component. A formal ablation study should be presented.\n\n2. The results of IGR without surface normal supervision are absent from the paper. If the proposed method outperforms such kind of IGR? \n\n3. I am curious if the density of the input point cloud will affect the performance of the proposed method significantly or not? Intuitively speaking, the coverage of the proposed cost function requires high point density for the training. Note that OccNet needs only 300 sample points over 4096 surface and 5e4 additional points for PDE loss in this paper. \n\n4. The inference time should be reported and compared to the baselines. \n\n5. In general, the submitted paper lacks experiments. The evaluation is only conducted in ShapeNet 2, which is not sufficient to verify the performance fully. More related datasets should be included. ",

Current experiments can not demonstrate the ability of the proposed method. For example, in figure 3, the chairs produced by ours have some artifacts.\n2. How many sampling points are used for training the model should be regarded as an ablation experiment. And the criteria of selecting the sampling point for training is also missing in the paper.\n3. A similar idea of using the spectral method to solve the Poisson equation appeared in Section 3.1 of [1].\n\nDiscussion:\n1. The framework uses PointNet as an encoder to extract the input shape information. This design is robust to the noise because of the max pooling operation.
