        "comment": "Four reviewers have reviewed this submission. Three of them recommended to reject the paper and one was marginally above the acceptance threshold. The authors have not responded to the criticisms or questions of reviewers. Among many concerns were the issues with the use of '`lean and single target object' images, lack of discussions on related models such as adaptive bilinear pooling and multi-domain pooling, lack of evaluations on datasets such as  large-scale iNaturalist. Given the above criticisms and the lack of authors' response, this submission falls below the acceptance bar."

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper is tackling the topic of fine-grained representation. In contrast to comparable methods, ARP focus on sub-sampled via strided operation to represent fine-grained information. \nARP is an intuitive strategy to extract critical regions and is more concise compared with multi-stage cascade architecture. This fact facilitates the efficiency.",
            "main_review": "Strong points of the submission\n\n- Well written paper, which is easy to follow, based on clear formulation for proposed method.\n\n- The work provides a detailed description of the implementation. \n\nWeak points of the submission\n\n- Lacking extensive use cases to demonstrate that ARP can crop a more discriminative region. It would be useful to provide a visualization that compares with other methods, especially the hard and tiny critical key regions. \n\n- While ARP assists in fine-grained representation, this idea technically is usable for other image tasks. Given sec.2 and compared baseline in sec.4, I am concerned that there are similar approaches proposed in the field of non-fine grained recognition. If this paper is to be accepted, I believe it needs a comprehensive survey about adaptive pooling strategy.",
            "summary_of_the_review": "- Why the baselines in Tables 1 and 2 do not include approaches in 2021, for example [1].\n\n- It is good and necessary that compare ARP with a functionally similar method, in sec 4.3. STN is well-known but old. According to the author's survey, is there not a better and closer method in follow-up works of STN? \n\n- ARP seems to be a plug-and-play module, can the original results be boosted if apply it to existing architectures? This experiment could help prove the applicability of ARP.\n\n[1] Huynh S V. A Strong Baseline for Vehicle Re-Identification[C]//CVPR. 2021: 4147-4154.",

This module has two procedures:\n  - (a) learn to crop image regions;\n  - (b) downsampling various size regions using bilinear operation.\n\n\n- **Experiments**.\nThe proposed method is verified in two tasks: fine-grained classification and re-identification. ",
            "main_review": "Experimental results show that the improvements are promising. But I have three considerations:\n- (a) The proposed method is mainly based on the assumption that there is only one target object in an image. But this is a limitation of the paper. Is there a potential limitation that the module could not work well on the images with multiple isolated objects, or the ARP is sensitive to the noise in images?\n- (b) Most of the datasets used in the paper's experiments are small. Please verify the proposed method on a large-scale dataset like iNaturalist, used in competitive methods, such as [TASN]. To verify on large-scale datasets is also helpful for erasing the above limitation. ",
            "summary_of_the_review": "The generalization of the proposed method is the biggest concern due to the fact that images used in the experiments have a clean and single target object.

In recent years, many pooling-based methods have been proposed to explore the fine-grained classification task, such as adaptive bilinear pooling, multi-domain pooling and so on. The ideas of ARP are similar to these methods. However, the details are not discussed in this paper. \n\n2) In the experiments, it seems unfair to compare the proposed method with the state-of-the-art methods.

The authors apply the ARP module to fine-grained image recognition and Vehicle Re-Id tasks.",
            "main_review": "Indeed, the ARP module is an attentional mechanism to adaptively locate discriminative regions to facilitate learning fine-grained representation. It first crops the feature from the most critical region and then downsampled to a consistent size through bilinear downsampling. It is quite similar to current work [1], which proposes a context-aware attentional feature pooling (CAP) module that learns to locate discriminative regions with different scales and map to fixed-size feature maps. The advantage of the ARP compared with CAP should be presented and discussed. Besides, this work achieves quite well performance, e.g., 91.8% on CUB. The performance comparisons with this work should also be provided.\n\nFigure 3 presents the network architecture that shows how to integrate the ARP module. However, why using such an architecture is not discussed. Besides, are there other ways to integrate the module? I think more discussion and experiments on how to integrate the APR module should be provided.\n\nTo compute the confidence map, the authors utilize instance normalization to normalize the feature maps. The motivation of this point is not well explained and its contribution is not verified.\n\n[1] Behera et al., Context-aware Attentional Pooling (CAP) for Fine-grained Visual Classification, in AAAI, 2021.",
