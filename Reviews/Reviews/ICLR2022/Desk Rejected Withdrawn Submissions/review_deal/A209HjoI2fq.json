All the techniques introduced in this paper, especially the transformer-based entity matching method, have been well-studied in other works. The key claimed contribution is integrating geolocation information. But the integration of textual and geolocation information is directly applying attention mechanisms over them. The concern here is textual embedding and geolocation embedding are from two modalities, which should be in two embedding spaces. Attention without space transformation may not be propriated.\n2. The performance of the proposed method cannot beat the literature in some cases. The results may not support the effectiveness of the method. ",

            "main_review": "Strengths:\n1. The model encodes geographic information for POI matching. Geographic information is an important component in POIs and should be considered and is proven to be very helpful in this task\n2. The results on POI entity matching datasets look promising.\n\nWeaknesses:\n1. There are other existing methods in encoding geographic information (coordinates) into vector spaces (e.g., https://openreview.net/forum?id=wAiAsCNMJea), what about using them in the model and compare?\n2. POI names, categories, and addresses usually contain a lot of proper nouns and very domain specific, it seems that it would be better to have a pretrained domain specific embedding for them. Instead of using BERT-Base Chinese model, it might be better to use a domain specific model? or is there any comparison among them when used to extract semantic features?\n3. It looks like POI transformer model does not perform very well in entity matching datasets, do these datasets have geographic information? how is geographic information handled if they don't have them? what about POI transformers*? is POI transformer* doing well in entity matching datasets?\n4. It would be great if there could be more analysis and understanding (e.g., visualizations, proofs, etc) to explain why the model is working, especially the geographic information encoding part, for example, how is the encoding preserving geospatial semantics.",

The proposed approach is shown to perform near SotA but in significantly shorter computation time.",
            "main_review": "[Methodology]\n- Currently, the text (semantic) embedding and the location embedding are performed individually. However, when considering PoI, the range of the location should be considered depending on the context (e.g. Considering the location of \"USA\" registered at the center of the country does not make much sense, while the location of \"Times square\" makes sense; the range of the location changes according to the context.) Accordingly, if both text and location are embedded together considering the context, the proposed method would become very interesting, but in the current form, the contribution is limited.\n\n[Evaluation]\n- Although the proposed method performs better than simple entity matching methods like iForest, the computation time is significantly longer than them (more than 100 times slow). Similar to the proposed method being more than 100 times fast than deep learning-based embedding methods, there should be cases that simple but fast methods are needed. It is difficult to simply claim that the proposed approach is the best, since the simple methods do not perform so bad. Thus, it is needed to explain the merit of each type of methods based on the application and use-cases, and to make clear what the proposed approach is targeting.\n\n[Writing]\n- There are grammatical errors throughout the paper, so the authors should proofread the paper again.\n- Section 4.3: What does \"BS\" indicate? Does it indicate \"DeepMatcher\"? Please define or correct. ",
