            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper proposes a new loss - denoted KFIoU - for rotated object detection. The paper exploits the ideas presented in [Yang 2021c] and [Yang 2021d] where arotated bounding box is instead modelled by a Gaussian distribution, and the intersection with the ground truth at the training time is approximated by the area (volume) of the intersecting predicted and ground truth Gaussians.",
            "main_review": "Rotated object detection is an interesting and important topic with many applications, and indeed the SkewIoU loss frequently used in the literature has its limitations which need to be addressed, as discussed in the paper. \n\nThe idea to approximate a rotated bounding box with a Gaussian distribution is neat and simple, but this idea is already presented in [Yang 2021c] and then further improved in [Yang 2021d]. Even more importantly, training the Gaussian approximation using Kullback-Leibler\nDivergence (KLD) as done in [Yang 2021d] seems to lead to higher accuracy on the standard datasets; yet for some reason the paper completely omits the results of KLD - for instance, using identical network architecture (RetinaNet) and training setup, on the aerial image DOTA-v1.0 dataset the proposed KFIoU loss achieves accuracy of 70.64 (Table 2), but KLD loss [Yang 2021d] achieves 71.28. I have not done thorough comparison of KLD vs KFIoU numbers on all the datasets, as I believe this should have been done in the paper, but KLD seems to consistently outperform the proposed loss where I checked (MLT, UCAS-AOD, DOTA-v1.0 datasets in Table 2)\n\nThe omission goes even further in some cases - for example for MRA-TD500 dataset (Table 5), even GWD [Yang 2021c] results are not listed (even though for other datasets GWD is included - Table 2, Table 7). The full results for AP@50, as per [Yang 2021c,d], are: Smooth L1 70.98, GWD 76.76, KLD 76.96 and KFIoU (proposed) 76.30, all using the same training setup. \n\nSince the KFIoU loss is the main contribution of the paper, the above issues unfortunately raise lot of questions and might leave the reader puzzled as to what is the benefit of using KFIoU vs GWD or KLD.\n\n",
            "summary_of_the_review": "The paper addresses an interesting problem of training rotated object detection, but it mainly exploits the idea of approximating the bounding box with a Gaussian distribution, which was already introduced in prior work. Moreover, the prior work seems to partially or even fully on some datasets outperform the proposed method, yet these empirical results are neither included nor discussed in the paper, even though the prior work is properly referenced so the authors are aware of it.\n\nThis leaves the paper with very little contribution left, and as such I am leaning toward rejection.",

The paper assumes that \"SkewIoU is undifferentiable\" and thus proposes a differentiable approximation to it, while to my best knowledge, there is an analytical solution to the derivative of the IoU between two rotated rectangles, as developed in [1]. Given the existence of an accurate solution, it's hard to see the reason for developing an approximation method.\n\n[1] https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.03851.pdf",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "To develop a differentiable SkewIoU-loss calculation method, this paper focuses on a novel approximate loss based on Gaussian modeling and Kalman filter. There are two main contributions: (1) For two arbitrary-oriented bounding box, convert them to Gaussian distribution, and then calculate the distribution function of the overlapping area using Kalman filter. Finally, according to KFIoU in the previous step, KFIoU loss can be calculated. (2) KFIoU loss have a similar trend with IoU loss, and also used in 3D object detection, it is a better way to realize the differentiable SkewIoU loss function. The overall and ablation experiments on several representative benchmark validates it.",
            "main_review": "Strengths:\n(1) Kalman filter is used in rotation object detection for the first time, and has greater improvement compared with similar methods, such as GWD. This method is an extension of the regression loss based on Gaussian distribution representation.\n(2) KFIoU loss designed by the author is an effective SkewIoU loss. To calculate the SkewIoU, the authors uses Kalman filter to obtain the overlap of two Gaussian distributions.\n\nWeaknesses:\n(1) The article mentioned that the center loss provides distance information of two Gaussian distributions for KFIoU loss, but the paper does not describe, analyze or quote the relevant information of center loss.\n(2) The main analysis of OpenCV and Long Edge definition methods focuses on summarizing the previous work. Authors need test their method with Long Edge definition method.\n(3) This paper analyzes the advantages of the proposed method compared with GWD. KLD seems to be better than their method.\n\nSuggestion:\n(1) Compared with GWD, the effect of the proposed method is significantly improved, but it is seems lower than KLD method. The authors could provide a detailed comparative analysis between the two methods.\n(2) OpenCV definition and Long Edge definition methods may have different performance for different loss designs. Therefore, the authors can do more experiments to show its effectiveness.\n",
            "summary_of_the_review": "Overall, I vote for \"marginally above the acceptance threshold\". I think this current submission is explained the performance of KFIoU loss in rotation object detection, and done some experiments to prove its effectiveness. However, the performance comparison and analysis of their method are not detailed enough and need to be further supplemented and modified.",
