Therefore, the novelty of this work is extremely limited. \n\nThe approach is applied to the hydrodynamics and stellar evolution applications, for which the time-series can be modeled by Eqs (9), (10), (11). I am wondering how exactly the cutoff frequencies were chosen for the elliptic HPF. \n\nEvaluation on additional time-series is required to show the effectiveness of the proposed architecture.",

It seems to me that the only novel part is Equ6, which simply extends mean output signals from the previous work to the weighted average. \n2. There is very little background provided and a lack of references. \n3. The paper should be better organized. For example, subsection 2.3 should be moved to the experiments section and some of the discussion in section 4 should be moved to the results section.\n",

            "main_review": "Major issues:\n\n1. Major innovation of this work lies in the optimal weights learning from parallel ESNs. I do not think it is significant enough to push the time series modeling/analysis/prediction area forward. The problems like hydrodynamic and stellar evolution simulation studied in the experiments may have considerable merits and are important. However, I am not an expert in these areas and cannot make recommendations.\n\n2. In the experiments, I do not see comparisons with state-of-the-art algorithms. For example, for time series prediction problems, the authors may want to compare their method with algorithms like DeepAR, Transformer, NBeats, etc.\n\nMinor issues:\n\n● Section2.3 is not a part of the method, it is background about the experiment.\n\n● Section2.1 actually describes related work.\n\n● For ESN, the space complexity is a challenge issue in training and testing, especially for parallel ESN. So can we reduce the number of ESNs according to optimal weights? In another word, will pruning the ESNs help to improve the computational performance?",

The presented pipeline is tested in a highly chaotical astronomical problem that is well characterized. Hence it is easy to use it as a benchmark.
