            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper develops a system to generate a complete and realistic human pose based on a sparse set of inputs such as look-at direction and end-effector positions. It proposes a prototypical residual network dubbed \" ProtoRes\" to handle variable input length based on the user-specified parameters. A look-at-loss, randomized weighting scheme, and two datasets based on MoCap are proposed to learn the designed system, and a usable system for authoring realistic human poses is built. Experiments show that the network design and loss outperform baselines such as Transformer and existing Inverse Kinematics methods. The graphical demo built inside Unity also showcases the utility of the learned pose networks. ",
            "main_review": "**Strength**\n\n1. **Impressive demo and usable system:** this work focuses on a practical and important problem: inverse kinematics based on a sparse set of user-specified constraints, and builds a usable system in Unity that shows impressive results in generating realistic and natural-looking human poses based on fast-changing inputs.  The proposed system looks complete and deployable for graphics and animation use-cases. \n2. **Proposed network:** the use of prototypical networks in the task of human pose generation or pose infilling, to the best of my knowledge, is novel, though it would be beneficial if the authors can provide more in-depth motivation and in-depth analysis of why such network design is more suitable in the proposed task. What inductive bias is prototypical networks leverage in this specific task? \n3. **Comprehensive ablation:** the ablation studies provided in the paper and supplement substantiate the benefits of the proposed learning procedure and loss weighting schemes. \n\n**Weakness**\n\n1. **Missing simple baselines:** based on the problem setup, one simple baseline is to use nearest neighbors to retrieve the closest pose from the dataset that satisfies the given input. Since MoCap data is continuous, it is highly possible that some realistic pose already exists in a large enough human motion database (such as AMASS [3], around 3 million frames). If no exact match exists, another naive approach could be finding close samples and interpolating between them either through simple linear interpolation or learned embeddings such as VPoser [4]. \n2. **Missing motivation and analysis for the proposed \"ProtoRes\" architecture**: as mentioned in the strength section, it is interesting the prototypical networks are used for this task. However, it is not well-motivated and not fully studied why the proposed network architecture is chosen for this task. Given the recent progress in Transformers, it is possible that the Transformer requires more data (which a dataset like AMASS can provide) but can learn a better embedding space for the pose synthesis/infilling task. \n3. **Missing generative aspect:** for such an under-constrained problem, it is natural to assume that generative models such as normalizing flow [5] or VAE [6] are a more suitable model for generating diverse pose that conforms to the same user input. \n\n**Minor Issues**\n\n1. **Multi-task learning:** I am not sure if multi-task learning is the right term for describing the loss terms: the look-at, rotation, position loss for joints are largely the same objective expressed in different modalities. Since all loss is calculated in a root-relative coordinate system, the rotation term should contain all information available to reconstruct 3D positions through forwarding kinematics. Using both rotation and positions more likely served as a more explicit representation of the objective. This objective has also been utilized in some recent works in pose estimation [1][2]. \n2. **Variable input length:** while variable input length is mentioned as a feature of the proposed system, it is not demonstrated via demo or experiments. Since there is only a fixed number of joints, I presume the system can use a fixed number of inputs (all the joints) and use a mask to indicate whether there is an input for that specific joint? \n\n\n==================================================\n\n\n**After author response**\n\nAfter reading the author's response and other reviews, most of my concerns are resolved. Thus, I would like to raise my score to 8 for this work for its novel use of prototypical networks in human pose modeling and the practical use case of the results. \n\n\n[1] Li, Jiefeng, Chao Xu, Zhicun Chen, Siyuan Bian, Lixin Yang and Cewu Lu. “HybrIK: A Hybrid Analytical-Neural Inverse Kinematics Solution for 3D Human Pose and Shape Estimation.” CVPR 2021\n\n[2] Rempe, Davis, Tolga Birdal, Aaron Hertzmann, Jimei Yang, Srinath Sridhar and Leonidas J.

            "summary_of_the_review": "Overall, the proposed system is a practical and usable system for pose authoring based on sparse input. The demo is impressive and seems a great addition to inverse kinematic systems. On the other hand, the technical novelty seems lacking and some important baselines are missing. In all, I think this work is borderline and would like to hear the author's response before making the final decision. ",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper focuses on the learnable neural representation of the 3D human pose. A proto-residual network is proposed to construct a full human pose from sparse body part constraints. Several modifications are performed to improve the accuracy of the proposed model, such as look-at loss, two-stage decoder, residual scheme, etc. In the experiment, two new datasets for the static human pose modeling task are conducted and will be released publicly. The experimental results prove the effectiveness of the proposed methods.",
            "main_review": "Pros:\n\n(1) This paper focuses on an interesting and important task in human animation. The proposed method and animation tool may alleviate the workload of animation by the artists. \n\n(2) Several modifications about the model architectures are clearly described, and most of them make sense to me. \n\n(3) This paper provides comprehensive materials, including the experiments, appendix, and demo videos. The effectiveness of most of the proposed modules is proved by the experiments. \n\nCons:\n\n(1) The proposed method is a new way for human animation, so the comparison with FinalIK should be more detailed. \nThe speed of both methods should be clearly shown in Table 1. \n\nAs mentioned in the paper,  the proposed method satisfies the constraints approximately (P.9 The limitation of the current work). The construction results for both methods with full constraints may help to clarify the limitation. \n\nThe generalization ability of both methods should also be investigated. How about performing both methods on non-human skeletons with similar structures.\n\n(2) Although this paper has provided very comprehensive results, some comparisons and analyses should be further shown in the experiment part.\n\nIn Table 1, the inference speed & parameter numbers should be provided for machine learning-based methods. \n\nQuantitative evaluation for the look-at-loss should be presented to prove the effectiveness. \n\nTable 2 shows the ablation study for GPD, but how about only using GPD (without IKD) for the final result.\n\n(3) The dataset is one of the most important contributions in this paper. It is better to show more details about the dataset, especially the 'miniAnonymous' dataset.  \n\nHow many instances are included in the dataset? \n\nWhat kinds of actions for each instance are captured?\n\nDoes the motion style have a big difference with the 'miniMixamo' dataset?\n\n(4) Some descriptions of the proposed unity tool should be presented. Does it just show the results of the neural network? Or some animation functions in the unity is also used as post-processings?\n\nDetailed questions:\n\n(1) What is the minimal number of the input constraints?\n\n(2) What kind of results will be output if a sequence of the ambiguous input constraints is given?\n\n(3) There are many interesting comparisons in the demo videos, so it is better to show some of them in the main paper.\n\n(4) In Table 5 and Table 6, there are some distinct results, i.e. 1.27 e-6. Are those typoes?",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes a DNN-based framework to handle the challenging task of recovering 3D human poses (joint positions and local rotations) from sparse and variable user inputs (joint positions, orientations of a subset of whole body joints). The paper proposes a neural-network architecture with an encoder to extract pose encodings from partial user inputs and a decoder to generate complete poses from the encoded features. The paper further proposes two new datasets to train and evaluate the proposed models. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework over previous methods. ",
            "main_review": "Pros:\n1. The paper solves an interesting and long-standing inverse-kinematics problem. To solve the problem, the paper novelly proposes a neural-network-based method to automatically handle the problem.\n2. In general, the paper is technically sound with experiments to support its argument. Additionally, the paper proposes two datasets to train and validate the proposed methods.\n2. In general, the paper is easy to follow.\n\nCons:\n1. The organization of the paper could be further improved. For example, the definition of 6D rotations is only explained in Sec 1.2. It would be better to mention it the first time this term appeared, otherwise, it is slightly confusing. Besides, it is suggested to merge the five contributions into three or four. e.g. merge the fourth and fifth contributions.\n2. Some important details are missing. a). How are the metrics L^{det}_{gpd}, L^{det}_{ikd}, L^{det}_{loc} defined and what are the units of them? b). How are the two datasets split into train and evaluation?\n3. It would be great if the paper could show more qualitative results. For example, the qualitative comparison between the proposed method and the previous methods.\n4. It would be great if the paper could show more analysis on the relation between inputs and model performances. For example, how is the performance influenced by the number of input joints and input types (joint positions or joint rotations which are better)?\n5. I have a concern about the overall framework. The paper resolves an ill-posed problem, i.e. there could be multiple feasible outputs given the one input. However, the paper uses the encoder-decoder framework which is only able to generate one output given the input. Therefore, I am wondering would it be better to change the current AE architecture to VAE so that multiple outputs could be produced? I would like to hear about the authors' options.",
