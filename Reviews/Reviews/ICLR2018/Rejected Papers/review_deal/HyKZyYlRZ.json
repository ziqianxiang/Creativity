        "comment": "\nPros:\n+ Interesting and promising approach to multi-domain, multi-task learning.\n+ Paper is clearly written.\n\nCons:\n- Reads more like a technical report than a research paper: more space should be devoted to explaining the design decisions behind the model and the challenges involved, as this will help others tackle similar problems.\n\nThis paper had extensive discussion between the reviewers and authors, and between the reviewers.  In the end, the reviewers want more insight into the architectural choices made, either via ablation studies or via a series of experiments in which tasks or components are added one at a time.  The consensus is that this would give readers a lot more insight into the challenges involved in tackling multiple domains and multiple tasks in a single model and a lot more guidance on how to do it.\n"

Section 2 of the same paper also notes it (depthwise convolutions can be traced back to at least 2012).",

            "review": "The paper describes a neural end-to-end architecture to solve multiple tasks at once.  The architecture consists of an encoder, a mixer, a decoder, and many modality networks to cover different types of input and output pairs for different tasks.  The engineering endeavor is impressive, but the paper has little scientific value.  Below are a few suggestions to make the paper stronger.\n\nIt is possible that the encoder, mixer, and decoder are just multiplexing tasks based on the input.  One way to analyze whether this happens is to predict the identity of the task from the hidden vectors.  If this is the case, how to prevent it from happening?  If this does not happen, what is being shared across tasks?  This can be analyzed by embedding the inputs from different tasks and looking for inputs from other tasks within a neighborhood in the embedding space.\n\nWhy multitask learning help the model perform better is still unclear.  If the model is able to leverage knowledge learned from one task to perform another task, then we expect to see either faster convergence or good performance with fewer samples.  The authors should analyze if this is the case, and if not, what are we actually benefiting from multitask learning?\n\nIf the modality network is shared across multiple tasks, we expect the learned hidden representation produced by the modality network is more universal.  If that is the case, what information of the input is being retained when training with multiple tasks and what information of the input is being discarded when training with a single task?\n\nReporting per-token accuracies, such as those in Table 2, is problematic.  It's unclear how to compute per-token accuracies for structured prediction tasks, such as speech recognition, parsing, and translation.  Furthermore, based on the results in Table 2, the model clearly fails on the speech recognition task.  The author should also report the standard speech recognition metric, word error rates (WER), for the speech recognition task in Table 1.\n",

            "review": "The paper presents a multi-task, multi-domain model based on deep neural networks. The proposed model is able to take inputs from various domains (image, text, speech) and solves multiple tasks, such as image captioning, machine translation or speech recognition. The proposed model is composed of several features learning blocks (one for each input type) and of an encoder and an auto-regressive decoder, which are domain-agnostic. The model is evaluated on 8 different tasks and is compared with a model trained separately on each task, showing improvements on each task.\n\nThe paper is well written and easy to follow.\n\nThe contributions of the paper are novel and significant. The approach of having one model able to perform well on completely different tasks and type of input is very interesting and inspiring. The experiments clearly show the viability of the approach and give interesting insights. This is surely an important step towards more general deep learning models. \n\nComments:\n\n* In the introduction where the 8 databases are presented, the tasks should also be explained clearly, as several domains are involved and the reader might not be familiar with the task linked to each database. Moreover, some databases could be used for different tasks, such as WSJ or ImageNet.\n\n* The training procedure of the model is not explained in the paper. What is the cost function and what is the strategy to train on multiple tasks ? The paper should at least outline the strategy.\n\n* The experiments are sufficient to demonstrate the viability of the approach, but the experimental setup is not clear. Specifically, there is an issue about the speech recognition part of the experiment. It is not clear what the task exactly is: continuous speech recognition, isolated word recognition ? The metrics used in Table 1 are also not clear, they should be explained in the text. Also, if the task is continuous speech recognition, the WER (word error rate) metric should be used. Information about the detailed setup is also lacking, specifically which test and development sets are used (the WSJ corpus has several sets).\n\n* Using raw waveforms as audio modality is very interesting, but this approach is not standard for speech recognition, some references should be provided, such as:\nP.

Proceedings of the Annual Conference of the International Speech Communication Association (INTERSPEECH), 2015.\n\nRevised Review:\nThe main idea of the paper is very interesting and the work presented is impressive. However, I tend to agree with Reviewer2, as a more comprehensive analysis should be presented to show that the network is not simply multiplexing tasks. The experiments are interesting, except for the WSJ speech task, which is almost meaningless. Indeed, it is not clear what the network has learned given the metrics presented, as the WER on WSJ should be around 5% for speech recognition.\nI thus suggest to either drop the speech experiment, or the modify the network to do continuous speech recognition. A simpler speech task such as Keyword Spotting could also be investigated.\n",
