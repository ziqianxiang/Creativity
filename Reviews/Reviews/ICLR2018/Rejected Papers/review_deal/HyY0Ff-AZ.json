            "title": "The paper presents a concise proof of the equivalence between entropy-regularised policy gradients and soft-max Q learning. It first shows the results in the bandit-case and extend it to the MDP case. The presentation is a little bit more general and related to works outside the field of machine learning. However, the results are not new and are a survey of previous works (e.g., Neu 2017).",

            "review": "Clarity: The paper is easy to follow and presents quite well the equivalence. \n\nOriginality: The results presented are well known and there is no clear contribution algorithmic-wise to the field of RL. The originality comes from the conciseness of the proof and how it relates to other works outside ML. Thus, this contribution seems minor and out of the scope of the conference which focus on representation learning for ML and RL.\n\nSuggestion: I strongly suggest the authors to work on a more detailed proof for the RL case explaining for instance the minimal conditions (on the reward, on the ergodicity of the MDP) in which the equivalence holds and submit it to a more theoretically oriented conference such as COLT or NIPS.   \n",

            "review": "This paper uses a well-known variational representation of the relative entropy (the so-called Donsker-Varadhan formula) to derive an expression for the Bellman error with entropy regularization in terms of a certain log-partition function. This is stated in Equation (13) in the paper. However, this precise representation of the Bellman error (with costs instead of rewards and with minimization instead of maximization) has been known in the literature on risk-sensitive control, see, e.g., P. D. Pra, L. Meneghini, and W. J. Runggaldier, “Connections between stochastic control and dynamic games,” Math. Control Signals Systems, vol. 9, pp. 303–326, 1996. The same applies to contraction results for the \"softmax\" Bellman operator -- these results are not novel at all, see, e.g., D. Hernandez-Hernandez and S. I. Marcus, “Risk sensitive control of Markov processes in countable state space,” Systems and Control Letters, vol. 29, pp. 147–155, 1996.\n\nAlso, there are some errors in the paper: for example, the functional of $\\pi(a|s)$ in Eq. (2) is concave, not convex, since the expression for the Shannon entropy in Eq. (3) has the wrong sign.",

There is no doubt that all the tools that are detailed here are extremely useful and powerful results in mathematical statistics. But they are all known.\n\nThe Gibbs variational principle is folklore, Proposition 1,2 are available in all good text books on the topic, \nand Proposition 4 is nothing but a transportation Lemma.\nNow, Proposition 3 is about soft-Bellman operators. This perhaps is less standard because contraction property of soft-Bellman operator in infinite norm is more recent than for Bellman operators.\nBut as mentioned by the authors, this is not new either. \nAlso I don't really see the point of providing the proofs of these results in the main material, and not for instance in appendix, as there is no novelty either in the proof techniques.\n\nI don't get the sentence \"we have restricted so far the proof in the bandit setting\": bandits are not even mentioned earlier.\n\nDecision\n********\nI am sorry but unless I missed something (that then should be clarified) this seems to be an empty paper: Strong reject.",
