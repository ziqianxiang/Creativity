        "comment": "This paper brings recent innovations in reinforcement learning to bear on a tremendously important application, treating sepsis.  The reviewers were all compelled by the application domain but thought that the technical innovation in the work was low.  While ICLR welcomes application papers, in this instance the reviewers felt that the technical contribution was not justified well enough.  Two of the reviewers asked for a more clear discussion of the underlying assumptions of the approach (i.e. offline policy evaluation and not missing at random).  Unfortunately, lack of significant revisions to the manuscript over the discussion period seem to have precluded changes to the reviewer scores.  Overall, this could be a strong submission to a conference that is more closely tied to the application domain.\n\nPros:\n- Very compelling application that is well motivated\n- Impressive (possibly impactful) results\n- Thorough empirical comparison\n\nCons:\n- Lack of technical innovation\n- Questions about the underlying assumptions and choice of methodology"

            "review": "The paper presents a reinforcement learning method that uses Q-learning with deep neural networks and a multi-output Gaussian process for imputation, all for retrospective analysis of treatment decisions for preventing mortality among patient with sepsis.\n\nWhile the work represents a combination of leading methods in the machine learning literature, key details are missing: most importantly, that the reinforcement learning is based on observational data and in a setting where the unconfoundedness assumption is very unlikely to hold. For example, an MGP imputation implicitly assumes MAR (missing at random) unless otherwise specified, e.g. through informative priors. The data is almost certainly MNAR (missing not at random). These concerns ought to be discussed at length.\n\nThe clarity of the work would be improved with figures describing the model (e.g. plate/architecture diagram) and pseudocode. E.g. as it stands, it is not clear how the doubly-robust estimation is being used and if it is appropriate given the above concerns. Similar questions for Dueling Double-Deep Q-network, Prioritized Experience Replay.\n\nThe medical motivation does frame the clinical problem well. The paper does serve as a way to generate hypotheses, e.g. greater use of abx and vasopressors but less IVF.\n\nThe results in Table 1 suggest that the algorithmic policy would prevent the death of ~1 in 12 individuals (ARR 8.2%) that a physician takes care of in your population. The text says \"might reduce mortality by as much as 8%\". The authors might consider expanding on this. What can/should be done convince the reader this number is real.\n\nAdditional questions: what is the sensitivity of the analysis to time interval and granularity of the action space (here, 4 hours; 3x3x5 treatments)? How would this work for whole order sets? In the example, abx 1 and abx 2 are recommended in the next 4 hours even after they were already administered. How does this relate to pharmacologic practice, where abx are often dosed at specific, wider intervals, e.g. vancomycin q12h? How could the model be updated for a clinician who acknowledges the action suggestion but dismisses it as incorrect?",

The paper is very clear and well written, with a thorough review of related work. However, the approach is mainly an application of existing methods and the technical novelty is low. Further, the methods are applied to only a single dataset and there is no comparison against the state of the art, only between components of the method. This makes it difficult to assess how much of an improvement this collection of methods provides and how much it would generalize to data from other hospitals or applications. As written, the paper may be more appropriate for an application-focused venue.",

            "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold",
            "review": "This paper presents an important application of modern deep reinforcement learning (RL) methods to learning optimal treatments for sepsis from past patient encounters. From a methods standpoint, it offers nothing new but does synthesize best practice deep RL methods with a differentiable multi-task Gaussian Process (GP) input layer. This means that the proposed architecture can directly handle irregular sampling and missing values without a separate resampling step and can be trained end-to-end to optimize reward -- patient survival -- without a separate ad hoc preprocessing step. The experiments are thorough and the results promising. Overall, strong application work, which I appreciate, but with several flaws that I'd like the authors to address, if possible, during the review period. I'm perfectly willing to raise my score at least one point if my major concerns are addressed.\n\nQUALITY\n\nAlthough the core idea is derivative, the work is executed pretty well. Pros (+) and cons (-) are listed below:\n\n+ discussion of the sepsis application is very strong. I especially appreciated the qualitative analysis of the individual case shown in Figure 4. While only a single anecdote, it provides insight into how the model might yield clinical insights at the bedside.\n+ thorough comparison of competing baselines and clear variants -- though it would be cool to apply offline policy evaluation (OPE) to some of the standard clinical approaches, e.g., EGDT, discussed in the introduction.\n\n- \"uncertainty\" is one of the supposed benefits of the MTGP layer, but it was not at all clear how it was used in practice, other than -- perhaps -- as a regularizer during training, similar to data augmentation.\n- uses offline policy evaluation \"off-the-shelf\" and does not address or speculate the potential pitfalls or dangers of doing so. See \"Note on Offline Policy Evaluation\" below.\n- although I like the anecdote, it tells us very little about the overall policy. The authors might consider some coarse statistical analyses, similar to Figure 3 in Raghu, et al. (though I'm sure you can come up with more and better analyses!). \n- there are some interesting patterns in Table 1 that the authors do not discuss, such as the fact that adding the MGP layer appears to reduce expected mortality more (on average) than adding recurrences. Why might this be (my guess is data augmentation)?\n\nCLARITY\n\nPaper is well-written, for the most part. I have some nitpicks about the writing, but in general, it's not a burden to read.\n\n+ core ideas and challenges of the application are communicated clearly\n\n- the authors did not detail how they chose their hyperparameters (number of layers, size of layers, whether to use dropout, etc.). This is critical for fully assessing the import of the empirical results.\n- the text in the figures are virtually impossible to read (too small)\n- the image quality in the figures is pretty bad (and some appear to be weirdly stretched or distorted)\n- I prefer the X-axis labels that Raghu uses in their Figure 4 (with clinically interpretable increments) over the generic +1, +2, etc., labels used in Figure 3 here\n\nSome nitpicks on the writing\n\n* too much passive voice. Example: third paragraph in introduction (\"Despite the promising results of EGDT, concerns arose.\"). Avoid passive voice whenever possible.\n* page 3, sec. 2.2 doesn't flow well. You bounce back and forth between discussion of the Markov assumption and full vs. partial observability. Try to focus on one concept at a time (and the solution offered by a proposed approach). Note that RNNs do NOT relax the Markov assumption -- they simply do an end run around it by using distributed latent representations.\n\nORIGINALITY\n\nThis work scores relatively low in originality. It really just combines ideas from two MLHC 2017 papers [1][2]. One could read those two papers and immediately conclude this paper's findings (the GP helps; RL helps; GP + RL is the best). This paper adds few (if any) new insights.\n\nOne way to address this would be to discuss in greater detail some potential explanations for why their results are stronger than those in Raghu and why the MTGP models outperform their simpler counterparts. Perhaps they could run some experiments to measure performance as a function of the number of MC samples (if perhaps grows with the number of samples, then it suggests that maybe it's largely a data augmentation effect).\n\nSIGNIFICANCE\n\nThis paper's primary significance is that it provides further evidence that RL could be applied successfully to clinical data and problems, in particular sepsis treatment. However, this gets undersold (unsurprising, given the ML community's disdain for replication studies). It is also noteworthy that the MTGP gives such a large boost in performance for a relatively modest data set -- this property is worth exploring further, since clinical data are often small. However, again, this gets undersold.\n\nOne recommendation I would make is that the authors directly compare the results in this paper with those in Raghu and to point out, in particular, the confirmatory results. Interestingly, the shapes of the action vs. mortality rate plots (Figure 4 in Raghu, Figure 3 here) are quite similar -- that's not precisely replication, but it's comforting.\n\nNOTE ON OFFLINE POLICY EVALUATION\n\nThis work has the same flaw that Raghu, et al., has -- neither justifies the use of offline policy evaluation. Both simply apply Jiang, et al.'s doubly robust approach [3] \"off the shelf\" without commenting on its accuracy in practice or discussing potential pitfalls (neither even considers [4] which seems to be superior in practice, especially with limited data). As far as I can tell (I'm not an RL expert), the DR approach carries stronger consistency guarantees and reduced variance but is still only as good the data it is trained on, and clinical data is known to have significant bias, particularly with respect to treatment, where clinicians are often following formulaic guidelines. Can we trust the mortality estimates in Table 1? Why or why not? Why shouldn't I think that RL is basically guaranteed to outperform non-RL approaches under an evaluation that is itself an RL model learned from the same training data!\n\nWhile I'm willing to accept that this is the best we can do in this setting (we can't just try the learned policy on new patients!), I think this paper (and similar works, like Raghu, et al.) *must* provide a sober and critical discussion of its results, rather than simply applaud itself for getting the best score among competing approaches.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n[1] Raghu, et al. \"Continuous State-Space Models for Optimal Sepsis Treatment - a Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach.\" MLHC 2017.\n[2] Futoma, et al. \"An Improved Multi-Output Gaussian Process RNN with Real-Time Validation for Early Sepsis Detection.\" MLHC 2017.\n[3] Jiang, et al. \"Doubly robust off-policy value evaluation for reinforcement learning.\" ICML 2016.\n[4] Thompson and Brunskill. \"Data-Efficient Off-Policy Policy Evaluation for Reinforcement Learning.\" ICML 2016.",
