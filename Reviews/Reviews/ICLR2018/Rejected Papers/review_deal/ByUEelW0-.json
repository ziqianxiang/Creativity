            "review": "The paper proposes to add a rotation operation in long short-term memory (LSTM) cells. It performs experiments on bAbI tasks and showed that the results are better than the simple baselines with original LSTM cells. There are a few problems with the paper.\n\nFirstly, the title and abstract discuss \"modifying memories\", but the content is only about a rotation operation. Perhaps the title should be \"Rotation Operation in Long Short-Term Memory\"?\n\nSecondly, the motivation of adding the rotation operation is not properly justified. What does it do that a usual LSTM cell could not learn? Does it reduce the excess representational power compared to the LSTM cell that could result in better models? Or does it increase its representational capacity so that some pattern is modeled in the new cell structure that was not possible before? This is not clear at all after reading the paper. Besides, the idea of using a rotation operation in recurrent networks has been explored before [3].\n\nFinally, the task (bAbI) and baseline models (LSTM from a Keras tutorial) are too weak. There have been recent works that nearly solved the bAbI tasks to perfection (e.g., [1][2][4][5], and many others). The paper presented a solution that is weak compared to these recent results.\n\nIn a summary, the main idea of adding rotation to LSTM cells is not properly justified in the paper, and the results presented are quite weak for publication in ICLR 2018.\n\n[1] Sainbayar Sukhbaatar, Jason Weston, Rob Fergus.

            "review": "The paper proposes an additional transform in the recurrent neural network units. The transform allows for explicit rotations and swaps of the hidden cell dimensions. The idea is illustrated for LSTM units, where the transform is applied after the cell values are computed via the typical LSTM updates.\n\nMy first concern is the motivation. I think the paper needs a more compelling example where swaps and rotations are needed and cannot otherwise be handled via gates. In the proposed example, it's not clear to me why the gate is expected to be saturated at every time step such that it would require the memory swaps. Alternatively, experimentally showing that the network makes use of swaps in an interpretable way (e.g. at certain sentence positions) could strengthen the motivation.\n\nSecondly, the experimental analysis is not very extensive. The method is only evaluated on the bAbI QA dataset, which is a synthetic dataset. I think a language modeling benchmark and/or a larger scale question answering dataset should be considered.\n\nRegarding the experimental setup, how are the hyper-parameters for the baseline tuned? Have you considered training jointly (across the tasks) as well?\n\nAlso, is the setting the same as in Weston et al (2015)? While for many tasks the numbers reported by Weston et al (2015) and the ones reported here for the LSTM baseline are aligned in the order of magnitude, suggesting that some tasks are easier or more difficult for LSTMs, there are large differences in other cases, for task #5 (here 33.6, Weston 70), for task #16 (here 48, Weston 23), and so on.\n\nFinally, do you have an intuition (w.r.t. to swaps and rotations) regarding the accuracy improvements on tasks #5 and #18?\n\nSome minor issues:\n- The references are somewhat inconsistent in style: some have urls, others do not; some have missing authors, ending with \"et al\".\n- Section 1, second paragraph: senstence\n- Section 3.1, first paragraph: thorugh\n- Section 5: architetures",

            "review": "Summary: This paper introduces a model that combines the rotation matrices with the LSTMs. They apply the rotations before the final tanh activation of the LSTM and before applying the output gate. The rotation matrix is a block-diagonal one where each block is a 2x2 rotations and those rotations are parametrized by another neural network that predicts the angle of the rotations. The paper only provides results on the bAbI task. \n\nQuestions:\nHave you compared against to the other parametrizations of the LSTMs and rotation matrices? (ablation study)\nHave you tried on other tasks?\nWhy did you just apply the rotations only on d_{t}.\n\nPros:\nUses a simple parametrization of the rotation matrices.\n\nCons:\nNot clear justification and motivations\nThe experiments are really lacking:\nNo ablation study\nThe results are only limited to single toy task.\n\n\nGeneral Comments:\n\nThis paper proposes to use the rotation matrices with LSTMs. However there is no clear justification why is this particular parametrization of rotation matrix is being used over others and why is it only applied before the output gate. The experiments are seriously lacking, an ablation study should have been made and the results are not good enough. The experiments are only limited to bAbI task which doesnâ€™t tell you much. This paper is not ready for publication, and really feels like it is rushed.\n\nMinor Comment:\nThis paper needs more proper proof-reading. There are some typos in it, e.g.:\n1st page, senstence --> sentence\n4th page, the the ... --> the\n\n",
