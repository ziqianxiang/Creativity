            "review": "## Review summary\n\nOverall, the paper makes an interesting effort to tightly integrate\nexpectation-maximization (EM) training algorithms with evolutionary algorithms\n(EA). However, I found the technical description lacking key details and the\nexperimental comparisons inadequate. There were no comparisons to non-\nevolutionary EM algorithms, even though they exist for the models in question.\nFurthermore, the suggested approach lacks a principled way to select\nand tune key hyperparameters. I think the broad idea of using EA as a substep\nwithin a monotonically improving free energy algorithm could be interesting,\nbut needs far more experimental justification.\n\n\n## Pros / Stengths\n\n+ effort to study more than one model family\n\n+ maintaining monotonic improvement in free energy\n\n\n## Cons / Limitations\n\n- poor technical description and justification of the fitness function\n\n- lack of comparisons to other, non-EA algorithms\n\n- lack of study of hyperparameter sensitivity\n\n\n## Paper summary\n\nThe paper suggests a variant of the EM algorithm for binary hidden variable\nmodels, where the M-step proceeds as usual but the E-step is different in two\nways. First, following work by J. Lucke et al on Truncated Posteriors, the\ntrue posterior over the much larger space of all possible bit vectors is\napproximated by a more tractable small population of well-chosen bit vectors,\neach with some posterior weight. Second, this set of bit vectors is updated\nusing an evolutionary/genetic algorithm. This EA is the core contribution,\nsince the work on Trucated Posteriors has appeared before in the literature.\nThe overall EM algorithm still maintains monotonic improvement of a free\nenergy objective.\n\nTwo well-known generative models are considered: Noisy-Or models for discrete\ndatasets and Binary Sparse Coding for continuous datasets. Each has a\npreviously known, closed-form M-step (given in supplement). The focus is on\nthe E-step: how to select the H-dimensional bit vector for each data point.\n\nExperiments on artificial bars data and natural image patch datasets compare\nseveral variants of the proposed method, while varying a few EA method\nsubsteps such as selecting parents by fitness or randomly, including crossover\nor not, or using generic or specialized mutation rates.\n\n\n## Significance\n\nCombining evolutionary algorithms (EA) within EM has been done previously, as\nin Martinez and Vitria (Pattern Recog. Letters, 2000) or Pernkopf and\nBouchaffra (IEEE TPAMI, 2005) for mixture models. However, these efforts seem\nto use EA in an \"outer loop\" to refine different runs of EM, while the present\napproach uses EA in a substep of a single run of EM. I guess this is\ntechnically different, but it is already well known that any E-step method\nwhich monotonically improves the free energy is a valid algorithm. Thus, the\npaper's significance hinges on demonstrating that the particular E step chosen\nis better than alternatives. I don't think the paper succeeded very well at\nthis: there were no comparisons to non-EA algorithms, or to approaches that\nuse EA in the \"outer loop\" as above.\n\n\n## Clarity of Technical Approach\n\nWhat is \\tilde{log P} in Eq. 7? This seems a fundamental expression. Its\nplain-text definition is: \"the logarithm of the joint probability where\nsummands that do not depend on the state s have been elided\". To me, this\ndefinition is not precise enough for me to reproduce confidently... is it just\nlog p(s_n, y_n | theta)? I suggest revisions include a clear mathematical\ndefinition. This omission inhibits understanding of this paper's core\ncontributions.\n\nWhy does the fitness expression F defined in Eq. 7 satisfy the necessary\ncondition for fitness functions in Eq. 6? This choice of fitness function does\nnot seem intuitive to me. I think revisions are needed to *prove* this fitness\nfunction obeys the comparison property in Eq. 6.\n\nHow can we compute the minimization substep in Eq. 7 (min_s \\tilde{logP})? Is\nthis just done by exhaustive search over bit vectors? I think this needs\nclarification.\n\n\n## Quality of Experiments\n\nThe experiments are missing a crucial baseline: non-EA algorithms. Currently\nonly several varieties of EA are compared, so it is impossible to tell if the\nsuggested EA strategies even improve over non-EA baselines. As a specific\nexample, previous work already cited in this paper -- Henniges et al (2000) --\nhas developed a non-EA EM algorithm for Binary Sparse Coding, which already\nuses the truncated posterior formulation. Why not compare to this?\n\nThe proposed algorithm has many hyperparameters, including number of\ngenerations, number of parents, size of the latent space H, size of the\ntruncation, etc. The current paper offers little advice about selecting these\nvalues intelligently, but presumably performance is quite sensitive to these\nvalues. I'd like to see some more discussion of this and (ideally) more\nexperiments to help practitioners know which parameters matter most,\nespecially in the EA substep.\n\nRuntime analysis is missing as well: Is runtime dominated by the EA step? How\ndoes it compare to non-EA approaches? How big of datasets can the proposed\nmethod scale to?\n\nThe reader walks away from the current toy bars experiment somewhat confused.\nThe Noisy-Or experiment did not favor crossover and and favored specialized\nmutations, while the BSC experiment reached the opposite conclusions. How does\none design an EA for a new dataset, given this knowledge? Do we need to\nexhaustively try all different EA substeps, or are there smarter lessons to\nlearn?\n\n\n\n## Detailed comments\n\nBottom of page 1: I wouldn't say that \"variational EM\" is an approximation to\nEM. Sometimes moving from EM to variational EM can mean we estimate posteriors\n(not point estimates) for both local (example-specific) and global parameters.\nInstead, the *approximation* comes simply from restricting the solution space\nto gain tractability.\n\nSec. 2: Make clear earlier that hidden var \"s\" is assumed to be discrete, not\ncontinuous.\n\nAfter Mutation section: Remind readers that \"N_g\" is number of generations\n",

Your use of crossover operators seems quite unimaginative. Genomes have a linear order but in the case of 2D images you use it is not obvious how that should be mapped to 1D. Combining crossovers in different representations or 2D crossovers might fit your problem much better.\n\n3.
