However, the submission has issues in the following main aspects:\n\n1. Regarding the validation of the idea/method, only circle detection is considered in the submission. This is not enough, in particular considering the fact the circle is one most regular 2D shape.\n\n2. Regarding the writing quality, there are a large number of expression/language issues in the submission. For instance, there already exhibit quite a few obvious problems in the abstract. To name a few:\n        - Convolution Neural Networks\n        - Understanding the role of these layers, â€¦, are all ongoing research questions.\n        - Complex value kernel functions\n        - is robustness to\n\nAlso, the formatting of the citations within the text (in particular in the case where the authors or the publication are not included in the sentence) does not follow the formatting Instructions for ICLR2018.\n\n3. It lacks a necessary review of related works. In total, only 12 papers are cited, in which only 5 are published after 2000.",

            "review": "Abstract: The paper presents an interesting, but very preliminary idea, to use quantum inspired complex kernels that can be potentially used inside CNNs.\n\nFormat review: The paper is well written in general, has clear language and explanations. The figures and tables are well formatted and are visually appealing.\n\nMethod review: It is very hard to assess the validity of the method for anyone not familiar with the quantum physics field. The proposal seems sound, but it is also not complete, as the title of the paper suggests.\n\nExperiments review: The experiment is too limited to derive any meaningful conclusions. Even with the extensions (experiments with noisy data) the authors offer, the problem proposed is too simple to demonstrate that the method is really useful.\n\nConclusion: It is a very interesting idea that should be further developed and tested. The paper is possibly the tip of an iceberg in a novel, promising field. However, the validity of the method is hard to assess theoretically and the experiments are very weak to prove anything.\n",

            "review": "This paper presented the study on complex kernel for shape detection, which is inspired by quantum theory. This paper started from the description of the shape detection problem, then introduced the traditional Bayesian and Hough transform approaches. In Section 4, the proposed quantum inspired complex kernel was described.\n\nOverall I like the study on complex kernel and expect deeper study and real application to convolutional neural networks. At this stage, I cannot recommend \"accept\", but it would be accepted if the study of the application to CNNs is conducted. ",
