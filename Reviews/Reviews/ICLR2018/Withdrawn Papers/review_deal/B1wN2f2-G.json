            "review": "This paper provides a survey of attribute-aware collaborative filtering. In particular, it classifies existing methods into four different categories, according to the representation of the interactions of users, items and attributes. Furthermore, the authors also provide the probabilistic interpretation of the models. In addition, preliminary experiments comparing among different categories are also provided. \n\nThere have existed several works which also provide surveys of attribute-aware collaborative filtering. Hence, the contribution of this paper is limited, although the authors claim two differences between their work and the existing ones. In particular, the advantages and disadvantages of different categories are not systematically compared, and hence the readers cannot get insightful comments and suggestions from this survey.\n\nIn general, survey papers are not very suitable for publication at conferences. \n",

The author categories the existing works int four categories.\n\nWhile the categorization is reasonable, there is no proposed new work beyond the existing approaches. No new insight is being discussed. Such survey style paper is not appropriate to for ICLR.",

            "review": "This paper surveys models for collaborative filtering with user/item covariate. \n\nOverall the authors seems to have captured the essence of a large number of popular CF models and I found that the proposed model classification is reasonable. The notation also make it easy to understand the differences between different models. In that sense this paper could be useful to researchers wanting to better understand this field. It may also be useful to develop further insights into current models (although the authors do not go that route). \n\nThe impact of this paper may be limited in this community since it is a survey about a fairly niche topic (a subset of recommender systems) that may not be of central interest at ICLR. Overall, I think this paper would be a better fit in a recsys, applied ML or information retrieval journal.\n\n\nA few comments: \n\nI find that there are several ways the paper could make a stronger contribution: \n1) Use the unifying notation to discuss strengths and weaknesses of current approaches (ideally with insights about possible future approaches).\n2) Report the results of a large study of many of the surveyed models on a large number of datasets. Ideally further insights could be derived from these results.\n3) Provide a common code framework with all methods\n4) Add a discussion on more structured sources of covariates (e.g., social networks). This could probably more or less easily be added as a subsection using the current classification.\n\n- A similar classification of collaborative filtering models with covariates is proposed in this thesis (p.41):\nhttps://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/bitstream/1807/68831/1/Charlin_Laurent_201406_PhD_thesis.pdf\n\n- The paper is well written overall but the current version of the paper contains several typos.",
