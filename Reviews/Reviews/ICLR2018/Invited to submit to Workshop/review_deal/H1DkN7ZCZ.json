        "comment": "Authors present a method for representing DNA sequence reads as one-hot encoded vectors, with genomic context (expected original human sequence), read sequence, and CIGAR string (match operation encoding) concatenated as a single input into the framework. Method is developed on 5 lung cancer patients and 4 melanoma patients.\n\n\nPros:\n- The approach to feature encoding and network construction for task seems new.\n- The target task is important and may carry significant benefit for healthcare and disease screening.\n\nCons:\n- The number of patients involved in the study is exceedingly small. Though many samples were drawn from these patients, pattern discovery may not be generalizable across larger populations. Though the difficulty in acquiring this type of data is noted.\n- (Significant) Reviewer asked for use of public benchmark dataset, for which authors have declined to use since the benchmark was not targeted toward task of ultra-low VAFs. However, perhaps authors could have sourced genetic data from these recommended public repositories to create synthetic scenarios, which would enable the broader research community to directly compare against the methods presented here. The use of only private datasets is concerning regarding the future impact of this work.\n- (Significant) The concatenation of the rows is slightly confusing. It is unclear why these were concatenated along the column dimension, rather than being input as multiple channels. This question doesn't seem to be addressed in the paper.\nGiven the pros and cons, the commitee recommends this interesting paper for workshop.",

They key innovation is a convolutional architecture that represents the invariance around the target base. The method is validated on simulations as well as in cfDNA and is s\nhown to provide increased precision over competing methods.\n\nWhile the method is of interest, there are more recent mutation callers that should be compared. For example, Snooper which uses a RandomForest  (https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-016-3281-2) and hence would be of interest as another machine learning framework. They also should compare to Strelka whic\nh interestingly they included only to make final calls of mutations but not in the comparison.\n\nFurther, I  would also have liked to see the use of standard benchmark datasets for mutation calling ( https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms10001).\n\nIt appears that the proposed method (Kittyhawk) has a steep decrease in PPV and enrichment for low tumor fraction which are presumably the parameter of greatest interest. The authors should explore this behavior in greater detail.",

Maybe the manuscript part with the definition of the accuracy measures may be skipped. Moreover, the authors themselves suggest how to proceed along this line of research with further improvements.\nI would only suggest to expand the experimental section with further (real) examples to strengthen the claim.\nOverall, I rate this manuscript in the top 50% of the accepted papers.",

            "title": "The paper offers a multi layer CNN to identify DNA sequence reads that capture cancer mutations and not sequencing errors.",
            "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection",
            "review": "Summary:\n\nIn this paper the authors offer a new algorithm to detect cancer mutations from sequencing cell free DNA (cfDNA). The idea is that in the sample being sequenced there would also be circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) so such mutations could be captured in the sequencing reads. The issue is that the ctDNA are expected to be found with low abundance in such samples, and therefore are likely to be hit by few or even single reads. This makes the task of differentiating between sequencing errors and true variants due to ctDNA hard. The authors suggest to overcome this problem by training an algorithm that will identify the sequence context that characterize sequencing errors from true mutations. To this, they add channels based on low base quality, low mapping quality. The algorithm for learning the context of sequencing reads compared to true mutations is based on a multi layered CNN, with 2/3bp long filters to capture di and trinucleotide frequencies, and a fully connected layer to a softmax function at the top. The data is based on mutations in 4 patients with lung cancer for which they have a sample both directly from the tumor and from a healthy region. One more sample is used for testing and an additional cancer control which is not lung cancer is also used to evaluate performance.\n\nPros:\n\nThe paper tackles what seems to be both an important and challenging problem. We also liked the thoughtful construction of the network and way the reference, the read, the CIGAR and the base quality were all combined as multi channels to make the network learn the discriminative features of from the context. Using matched samples of tumor and normal from the patients is also a nice idea to mimic cfDNA data.\n\nCons:\n\nWhile we liked both the challenge posed and the idea to solve it we found several major issues with the work. \n\nFirst, the writing is far from clear. There are typos and errors all over at an unacceptable level. Many terms are not defined or defined after being introduced (e.g. CIGAR, MF, BQMQ). A more reasonable CS style of organization is to first introduce the methods/model and then the results, but somehow the authors flipped it and started with results first, lacking many definitions and experimental setup to make sense of those.  Yet Sec. 2 “Results” p. 3 is not really results but part of the methods. The “pipeline” is never well defined, only implicitly in p.7 top, and then it is hard to relate the various figures/tables to bottom line results (having the labels wrong does not help that).\n\nThe filters by themselves seem trivial and as such do not offer much novelty. Moreover, the authors filter the “normal” samples using those (p.7 top), which makes the entire exercise a possible circular argument. \n\nIf the entire point is to classify mutations versus errors it would make sense to combine their read based calls from multiple reads per mutations (if more than a single read for that mutation is available) - but the authors do not discuss/try that. \n\nThe entire dataset is based on 4 patients. It is not clear what is the source of the other cancer control case. The authors claim the reduced performance show they are learning lung cancer-specific context. What evidence do they have for that? Can they show a context they learned and make sense of it? How does this relate to the original papers they cite to motivate this direction (Alexandrov 2013)? Since we know nothing about all these samples it may very well be that that are learning technical artifacts related to their specific batch of 4 patients. As such, this may have very little relevance for the actual problem of cfDNA. \n\nFinally, performance itself did not seem to improve significantly compared to previous methods/simple filters, and the novelty in terms of ML and insights about learning representations seemed limited.\n\nAlbeit the above caveats, we iterate the paper offers a nice construction for an important problem. We believe the method and paper could potentially be improved and make a good fit for a future bioinformatics focused meeting such as ISMB/RECOMB.\n",
