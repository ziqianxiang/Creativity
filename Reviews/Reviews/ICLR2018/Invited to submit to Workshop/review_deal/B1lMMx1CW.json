            "review": "Authors describe a procedure of building their production recommender system from scratch, begining with formulating the recommendation problem, label data formation, model construction and learning. They use several different evaluation techniques to show how successful their model is (offline metrics, A/B test results, etc.)\n\nMost of the originality comes from integrating time decay of purchases into the learning framework. Rest of presented work is more or less standard.\n\nPaper may be useful to practitioners who are looking to implement something like this in production.",

            "review": "The paper proposes a new neural network based method for recommendation.\n\nThe main finding of the paper is that a relatively simple method works for recommendation, compared to other methods based on neural networks that have been recently proposed.\n\nThis contribution is not bad for an empirical paper. There's certainly not that much here that's groundbreaking methodologically, though it's certainly nice to know that a simple and scalable method works.\n\nThere's not much detail about the data (it is after all an industrial paper). It would certainly be helpful to know how well the proposed method performs on a few standard recommender systems benchmark datasets (compared to the same baselines), in order to get a sense as to whether the improvement is actually due to having a better model, versus being due to some unique attributes of this particular industrial dataset under consideration. As it is, I am a little concerned that this may be a method that happens to work well for the types of data the authors are considering but may not work elsewhere.\n\nOther than that, it's nice to see an evaluation on real production data, and it's nice that the authors have provided enough info that the method should be (more or less) reproducible. There's some slight concern that maybe this paper would be better for the industry track of some conference, given that it's focused on an empirical evaluation rather than really making much of a methodological contribution. Again, this could be somewhat alleviated by evaluating on some standard and reproducible benchmarks.",

            "review": "This paper presents a practical methodology to use neural network for recommending products to users based on their past purchase history. The model contains three components: a predictor model which is essentially a RNN-style model to capture near-term user interests, a time-decay function which serves as a way to decay the input based on when the purchase happened, and an auto-encoder component which makes sure the user's past purchase history get fully utilized, with the consideration of time decay. And the paper showed the combination of the three performs the best in terms of precision@K and PCC@K, and also with good scalability. It also showed good online A/B test performance, which indicates that this approach has been tested in real world.\n\nTwo small concerns:\n1. In Section 3.3. I am not fully sure why the proposed predictor model is able to win over LSTM. As LSTM tends to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem which most likely would exist in the predictor model. Some insights might be useful there.\n2. The title of this paper is weird. Suggest to rephrase \"unreasonable\" to something more positive. ",
