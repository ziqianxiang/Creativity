        "comment": "This paper provides a simple technique for stabilizing GAN training, and works over a variety of GAN models.\n\nOne of the reviewers expressed concerns with the value of the theory. I think that it would be worth emphasizing that similar arguments could be made for alternating gradient descent, and simultaneous gradient descent. In this case, if possible, it would be good to highlight how the convergence of the prediction method approach differs from the alternating descent approach. Otherwise, highlight that this theory simply shows that the prediction method is not a completely crazy idea (in that it doesn't break existing theory).\n\nPractically, I think the experiments are sufficiently interesting to show that this approach has promise. I don't see the updated results for Stacked GAN for a fixed set of epochs (20 and 40 at different learning rates). Perhaps put this below Table 1.",

            "review": "This work proposes a framework for stabilizing adversarial nets using a prediction step. The prediction step is motivated by primal-dual algorithms in convex optimization where the term having both variables is bi-linear.  \n\nThe authors prove a convergence result when the function is convex in one variable and concave in the other. This problem is more general than the previous one in convex optimization.  Then this prediction step is applied in many recent applications in training adversarial nets and compared with state-of-the-art solvers. The better performance of this simple step is shown in most of the numerical experiments. \n\nThough this work applies one step from the convex optimization to solve a more complicated problem and obtain improved performance,  there is more work to be done. Whether there is a better generalization of this prediction step? There are also other variants of primal-dual algorithms in convex optimization; can other modification including the accelerated variants be applied?",

            "review": "This paper proposes a simple modification to the standard alternating stochastic gradient method for GAN training, which stabilizes training, by adding a prediction step. \n\nThis is a clever and useful idea, and the paper is very well written. The proposed method is very clearly motivated, both intuitively and mathematically, and the authors also provide theoretical guarantees on its convergence behavior. I particularly liked the analogy with the damped harmonic oscillator.  \n\nThe experiments are well designed and provide clear evidence in favor of the usefulness of the proposed technique. I believe that the method proposed in this paper will have a significant impact in the area of GAN training.\n\nI have only one minor question: in the prediction step, why not use a step size, say \n$\\bar{u}_k+1 = u_{k+1} + \\gamma_k (u_{k+1} âˆ’ u_k)$, such that the \"amount of predition\" may be adjusted?\n",

            "review": "NOTE:\nI'm very willing to change my recommendation if I turn out to be wrong \nabout the issues I'm addressing and if certain parts of the experiments are fixed.\n\nHaving said that, I do (think I) have some serious issues: \nboth with the experimental evaluation and with the theoretical results.\nI'm pretty sure about the experimental evaluation and less sure about the theoretical results.\n\n\nTHEORETICAL CLAIMS:\n\nThese are the complaints I'm not as sure about:\n\nTheorem 1 assumes that L is convex/concave.\nThis is not generally true for GANs.\nThat's fine and it doesn't necessarily make the statement useless, but:\n\nIf we are willing to assume that L is convex/concave, \nthen there already exist other algorithms that will provably converge\nto a saddle point (I think). [1] contains an explanation of this.\nGiven that there are other algorithms with the same theoretical guarantees,\nand that those algorithms don't magically make GANs work better, \nI am much less convinced about the value of your theorem.\n\nIn [0] they show that GANs trained with simultaneous gradient descent are locally asymptotically stable, \neven when L is not convex/concave. \nThis seems like it makes your result a lot less interesting, though perhaps I'm wrong to think this?\n\nFinally, I'm not totally sure you can show that simultaneous gradient descent won't converge \nas well under the assumptions you made.\nIf you actually can't show that, then the therom *is* useless, \nbut it's also the thing I've said that I'm the least sure about.\n\n\nEXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION:\n\nRegarding the claims of being able to train with a higher learning rate:\nI would consider this a useful contribution if it were shown that (by some measure of GAN 'goodness')\na high goodness was achieved faster because a higher learning rate was used.\nYour experiments don't support this claim presently, because you evaluate all the models at the same step.\nIn fact, it seems like both evaluated Stacked GAN models get worse performance with the higher learning rate.\nThis calls into question the usefulness of training with a higher learning rate.\nThe performance is not a huge amount worse though (based on my understanding of Inception Scores),\nso if it turns out that you could get that performance\nin 1/10th the time then that wouldn't be so bad.\n\nRegarding the experiment with Stacked GANs, the scores you report are lower than what they report [2].\nTheir reported mean score for joint training is 8.59.\nAre the baseline scores you report from an independent reproduction?\nAlso, the model they have trained uses label information. \nDoes your model use label information?\nGiven that your reported improvements are small, it would be nice to know what the proposed mechanism is by \nwhich the score is improved. \nWith a score of 7.9 and a standard deviation of 0.08, presumably none of the baseline model runs\nhad 'stability issues', so it doesn't seem like 'more stable training' can be the answer.\n\nFinally, papers making claims about fixing GAN stability should support those claims by solving problems\nwith GANs that people previously had a hard time solving (due to instability).\nI don't believe this is true of CIFAR10 (especially if you're using the class information).\nSee [3] for an example of a paper that does this by generating 128x128 Imagenet samples with a single generator.\n\nI didn't pay as much attention to the non-GAN experiments because\na) I don't have as much context for evaluating them, because they are a bit non-standard.\nb) I had a lot of issues with the GAN experiments already and I don't think the paper should be accepted unless those are addressed.\n\n\n[0] https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04156 (Gradient Descent GAN Optimization is Locally Stable)\n\n[1] https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.07215.pdf (On Convergence and Stability of GANs)\n\n[2] https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.04357 (Stacked GAN)\n\n[3] https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1QRgziT (Spectral Regularization for GANs)\n\nEDIT: \nAs discussed below, I have slightly raised my score. \nI would raise it more if more of my suggestions were implemented (although I'm aware that the authors don't have much (any?) time for this - and that I am partially to blame for that, since I didn't respond that quickly).\nI have also slightly raised my confidence.\nThis is because now I've had more time to think about the paper, and because the authors didn't really address a lot of my criticisms (which to me seems like evidence that some of my criticisms were correct).",
