        "comment": "The reviewers concerns regarding novelty and the experimental evaluation have been resolved accordingly and all recommend acceptance. I would recommend removing the term \"unsupervised\" in clustering, as it is redundant. Clustering is, by default, assumed to be unsupervised.\n\nThere is some interest in extending this to non-vision domains, however this is beyond the scope of the current work.",

The idea is to introduce the notion of pseudo labelling. \nPseudo labelling can be obtained by transformations of original input data.\nThe key point is the definition of the transformations. \nOnly whether the design of transformation captures the latent representation of the input data, the pseudo-labelling might improve the performance of the unsupervised learning task.\nSince it is not known in advance what might be a good set of transformations, it is not clear what is the behaviour of the model when the large portion of transformations are not encoding the latent representation of clusters.",

            "review": "This paper presents a method for clustering based on latent representations learned from the classification of transformed data after pseudo-labellisation corresponding to applied transformation. Pipeline: -Data are augmented with domain-specific transformations. For instance, in the case of MNIST, rotations with different degrees are applied. All data are then labelled as \"original\" or \"transformed by ...(specific transformation)\". -Classification task is performed with a neural network on augmented dataset according to the pseudo-labels. -In parallel of the classification, the neural network also learns the latent representation in an unsupervised fashion. -k-means clustering is performed on the representation space observed in the hidden layer preceding the augmented softmax layer. \n\nDetailed Comments:\n(*) Pros\n-The method outperforms the state-of-art regarding unsupervised methods for handwritten digits clustering on MNIST.\n-Use of ACOL and GAR is interesting, also the idea to make \"labeled\" data from unlabelled ones by using data augmentation.\n\n(*) Cons\n-minor: in the title, I find the expression \"unsupervised clustering\" uselessly redundant since clustering is by definition unsupervised.\n-Choice of datasets: we already obtained very good accuracy for the classification or clustering of handwritten digits. This is not a very challenging task.\nAnd just because something works on MNIST, does not mean it works in general. \nWhat are the performances on more challenging datasets like colored images (CIFAR-10, labelMe, ImageNet, etc.)?\n-This is not clear what is novel here since ACOL and GAR already exist. The novelty seems to be in the adaptation to GAR from the semi-supervised to the unsupervised setting with labels indicating if data have been transformed or not.\n\n\nMy main problem  was about the lack of novelty. The authors clarified this point, and it turned out that ACOL and GAR have never published elsewhere except in ArXiv.  The other issue concerned the validation of the approach on databases other than MNIST. The author also addressed this point, and I changed my scores accordingly. ",

            "review": "This paper utilizes ACOL algorithm for unsupervised learning. ACOL can be considered a type of semi-supervised learning where the learner has access only to parent-class information (for example in digit recognition whether a digit is bigger than 5 or not) and not the sub-class information (number between 0-9). Given that in many applications such parent-class supervised information is not available, the authors of this paper propose domain specific pseudo parent-class labels (for example transformed images of digits) to adapt ACOL for unsupervised learning. The authors also modified affinity and balance term utilized in GAR (as part of ACOL algorithm) to improve it. The authors use multiple data sets to study different aspects of the proposed approach.\n\nI updated my scores based on the reviewers responses. It turned out that ACOL and GAR are also originally proposed by the same authors and was only published in arxiv! Because of the double-blind review nature of ICLR, I didn't know these ideas came from the same authors and is being published for the first time in a peer-reviewed venue (ICLR). So my main problem with this paper, lack of novelty, is addressed and my score has changed. Thanks to the reviewer for clarifying this.\n",
