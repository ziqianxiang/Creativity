            "review": "The paper proposes a two-step method to determine which floor a mobile phone is on inside a tall building. \nAn LSTM RNN classifier analyzes the changes/fading in GPS signals to determine whether a user has entered a building.  Using the entrance point's barometer reading as a reference, the method calculates the relative floor the user has moved to using a well known relationship between heights and barometric readings.\n\nThe paper builds on a simple but useful idea and is able to develop it into a basic method for the goal.  The method has minimal dependence on prior knowledge and is thus expected to have wide applicability, and is found to be sufficiently successful on data collected from a real world context.  The authors present some additional explorations on the cases when the method may run into complications.\n\nThe paper could use some reorganization.   The ideas are presented often out of order and are repeated in cycles, with some critical details that are needed to understand the method revealed only in the later cycles.   Most importantly, it should be stated upfront that the outdoor-indoor transition is determined using the loss of GPS signals.  Instead, the paper elaborates much on the neural net model but delays until the middle of p.4 to state this critical fact. However once this fact is stated, it is obvious that the neural net model is not the only solution.\n\nThe RNN model for Indoor/Outdoor determination is compared to several baseline classifiers.  However these are not the right methods to compare to -- at least, it is not clear how you set up the vector input to these non-auto-regressive classifiers. You need to compare your model to a time series method that includes auto-regressive terms, or other state space methods like Markov models or HMMs.\n\nOther questions:\n\np.2,  Which channel's RSSI is the one included in the data sample per second?\n\np.4,  k=3, what is k?\n\nDo you assume that the entrance is always at the lowest floor? What about basements or higher floor entrances?  Also, you may continue to see good GPS signals in elevators that are mounted outside a building, and by the time they fade out,  you can be on any floor reached by those elevators.\n\nHow does each choice of your training parameters affect the performance?  e.g. number of epoches, batch size, learning rate.   What are the other architectures considered?  What did you learn about which architecture works and which does not?  Why?\n\nAs soon as you start to use clustering to help in floor estimation, you are exploiting prior knowledge about previous visits to the building.  This goes somewhat against the starting assumption and claim.",

However I still feel like the novelty is somewhat limited, hence the recommendation.\n\n======================\n\nThe paper introduces a system to estimate a floor-level via their mobile device's sensor data using an LSTM to determine when a smartphone enters or exits a building, then using the change in barometric pressure from the entrance of the building to indoor location. Overall the methodology is a fairly simple application of existing methods to a problem, and  there remain some methodological issues (see below).\n\nGeneral Comments\n- The claim that the bmp280 device is in most smartphones today doesn’t seem to be backed up by the “comScore” reference (a simple ranking of manufacturers).  Please provide the original source for this information.\n- Almost all exciting results based on RNNs are achieved with LSTMs, so calling an RNN with LSTM hidden units a new name IOLSTM seems rather strange - this is simply an LSTM.\n- There exist models for modelling multiple levels of abstraction, such as the contextual LSTM of [1]. This would be much more satisfying that the two level approach taken here, would likely perform better, would replace the need for the clustering method, and would solve issues such as the user being on the roof.  The only caveat is that it may require an encoding of the building (through a one-hot encoding) to ensure that the relationship between the floor height and barometric pressure is learnt. For unseen buildings a background class could be used, the estimators as used before, or aggregation of the other buildings by turning the whole vector on.\n- It’s not clear if a bias of 1 was added to the forget gate of the LSTM or not. This has been shown to improve results [2].\n- Overall the whole pipeline feels very ad-hoc, with many hand-tuned parameters.  Notwithstanding the network architecture, here I’m referring to the window for the barometric pressure, the Jaccard distance threshold, the binary mask lengths, and the time window for selecting p0.\n- Are there plans to release the data and/or the code for the experiments? Currently the results would be impossible to reproduce.\n- The typo of accuracy given by the authors is somewhat worrying, given that the result is repeated several times in the paper.\n\nTypographical Issues\n- Page 1:  ”floor-level accuracy” back ticks\n- Page  4:   Figure  4.1→Figure  1;  Nawarathne  et  al  Nawarathne  et  al.→Nawarathne et al.\n- Page 6:  ”carpet to carpet” back ticks\n- Table 2:  What does -4+ mean?\n- References.
