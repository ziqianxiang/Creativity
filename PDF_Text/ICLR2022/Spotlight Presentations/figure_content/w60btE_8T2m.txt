Figure 1: (left) Benzaldehyde, (middle) its spanning tree (blue) and residual edges (red), and thecorresponding constructive decisions (right). Open circle represent atoms and bonds in the molecule.
Figure 2: Demonstration of executing a sequence of decisions C-C(=O)(-C*-C-C-C-C-2). Here,we use the numbers 1 and 2 to mark vertices for the purpose of illustration. Next, {"C", "O"},{" — "," = "},"(",")","*", and "2" correspond to attach_atom, attach_bond, branch_start,branch_end, res_atom, and res_bond operations, respectively. The decision "2" denotes res_bondoperation selecting the vertex marked by "2". Decisions that are not executed at the respective time-step are faded out (gray). Location of the pointer vertex ipoint is indicated by an arrow (red).
