Figure 1: This simple data generating process illustrates that if we know the set of mechanisms thatgovern the evolution of an environment, this constrains the set of possible representations to anyequivariances of these mechanisms. At each time step, we observe an environment of bouncing ballsin pixel space as images, xt . These images are produced by some rendering engine, g, as a functionof the true latent representation zt , which in this case gives positions and velocities of each ball(illustrated by the location and length of the arrows in the latent representation). At each time step, thestate evolves according to a mechanism, mt . Any candidate model that is consistent with the observeddata has to satisfy the observation identity. If an encoder produces either the true representation(shown in green), or a representation transformed by some equivariance of the mechanism (e.g. theblue rotated representation) then the observation identity is satisfied. However, models that producerepresentations that are arbitrary transformations of the true representation (e.g. the pink warpedrepresentation) can be discarded as they are not consistent with the observation identity.
