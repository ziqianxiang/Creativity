Figure 1: A geometric view of the post-activation neurons. Level sets are parallelhyper-planes.
Figure 2: Coordinate systems: O0 (new) vs. O(old). normal vectors ni and gradients Nai arealong an axis of O0.
Figure 3: Absolute cosine of the angle between two neurons, averaged over all neuron pairs and datasamples. Left: 4-layer fully-connected neural network, all hidden layers of which have equal widthm; Right: Bottleneck network with three hidden layers, m1 = m3 = 1000 and m2 = mb. In bothcases, the average absolute cosine | CoS θ∣ monotonically decreases towards zero, consistent With thetheoretical prediction of orthogonality between neuron gradient in Theorem 3.
