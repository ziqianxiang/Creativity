Figure 2: Top: A Neural ODE constitutes a two-point boundary value problem over t ∈ [p, q].
Figure 3: Left: samples from ‘Rotating MNIST’ experiment with pmin = -4 and a two-layer MLP.
Figure 4: Bouncing balls experiment. Left: reported MSE for the proposed InImNet and state-of-the-art methods, results from other methods are taken from Yildiz et al. (2019) and Vialard et al.
Figure 5: Extrapolation beyond and before chosentraining depth at pmin = -4.
Figure 6: Plotted curves are given as training samples, where the InImNet’s task, trained only on endpoints, is to identify the curves’ height h(t; p, x) at t = q = 1. The InImNet outputs are representedby correspondingly coloured triangular markers.

Figure 8: Bouncing balls experiment. Left: reported MSE for the proposed InImNet and state-of-the-art methods, results from other methods are taken from Yildiz et al. (2019) and Vialard et al.
