Figure 1: Finite Element Networks predictthe instantaneous change of each node by esti-mating the effect of the unknown generatingdynamics on the domain volume that the nodeshares with its neighbors.
Figure 2: Solving a PDE with the Galerkin method and method of lines consists of three steps.
Figure 3: Predictive accuracy of mod-els trained on 1000 nodes and evalu-ated on increasingly fine subsamplingsof the test data.
Figure 4: Evolving the learned dynamics of FEN modelsand the strongest baseline trained on 10-step forecastingforward for 60 time steps reveals the differences betweenthese models to the human eye.
Figure 5: Contribution to âˆ‚ty from thefree-form and transport term in a T-FEN on a snapshot of ScalarFlow.
Figure 6: Learned temperature flow field in a T-FEN after10 steps on Black Sea data. The model recognized thephysical relationship between the features.
Figure 7: A sample from the CylinderFlow dataset. The upper and lower boundaries are impenetrablewalls. The left-hand boundary is an inflow with a constant velocity profile over time. The meshresolution increases towards the boundaries at the top and bottom as well as in the immediate vicinityof the cylinder.
Figure 8: All models were trained on 1000 node subsamples of the data for 10-step prediction andthen evaluated on the same task but on increasingly fine meshings of the domain.
Figure 9: A visual comparison of the data when subsampled at 1000 nodes and at 5000 nodes.
Figure 10: Predictions of all models for a rising smoke plume after 1, 20, 40 and 60 time steps.
Figure 11: Delaunay triangulation can produce elongated, splinter-like cells when interior nodesare close to the boundary of the convex hull as in this example. We post-process the Delaunaytriangulations with Algorithm 1 to filter these cells out.
