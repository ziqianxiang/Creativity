Figure 1: Illustration of differences between the final configurations of distribution alignment andsupport alignment procedures. p(x) is a fixed Beta distribution p(x) = Beta(x | 4, 2) with support[0, 1]; qθ(x) is a “shifted” Beta distribution qθ(x) = Beta(x - θ | 2, 4) parameterized by θ withsupport [θ, θ + 1]. Panel (a) shows the initial configuration with θinit = -3. Panel (b) shows the resultby distribution alignment. Panel (c) shows the result by support alignment. We report Wassersteindistance DW (p, qθ) (7) and SSD divergence D4(p, qθ) (1).
Figure 2: Visualization of learned 2D embeddings on 3-class USPS→MNIST with label distributionshift. In source domain, all classes have equal probability 1. The target probabilities of classes '3’,‘5’, ‘9’ are [23%, 65%, 12%]. Each panel shows 2 level sets (outer one approximates the support) ofthe kernel density estimates of embeddings in source (filled regions) and target domains (solid/dashedlines). We report the average class accuracy of the target domain, DW and D4 between embeddings.
