Figure 5: Robustness and immunizability: red/blue plots show, on CelebA, the fingerprint detectionof our original/immunized model in bitwise accuracy w.r.t. the strength of perturbations. Green plotsshow those of (Yu et al., 2021) as references. The data points are directly copied from their paper.
Figure 6: Fidelity and disentangled control: generated samples from five generator instances. Foreach row, we use a unique fingerprint to instantiate a generator. For each column, we feed in the samelatent code to the generator instances.
