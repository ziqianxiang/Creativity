Figure 1: We present a provably expressive graph learning framework based on representing graphsas bags of subgraphs and processing them with an equivariant architecture composed of GNNs andset networks. Left: A pair of graphs not distinguishable by the WL test. Right: The correspondingbags (multisets) of edge-deleted subgraphs, which can be distinguished by our framework.
Figure 2: The symmetry structure of abag of subgraphs, in this case the set ofall m = 3 edge-deleted subgraphs. Thisset of subgraphs is represented as anm × n × n tensor A (and additional nodefeatures that are not illustrated here).
Figure 3: DSS-GNN layers and architecture. Left panel: the DSS- GNN architecture is composedof three blocks: a Feature Encoder, a Readout Layer and a Set Encoder. Right panel: a DSS-GNNlayer is constructed from a Siamese part (orange) and an information-sharing part (yellow).
Figure 4: Graphs CSL(8, 2) and CSL(8, 3) (left) and their node-deleted subgraphs (right).
Figure 5: Graphs C6, 2 × C3 (left) and their edge-deleted subgraphs (right).
Figure 6: The Rook’s graph (left) and Shrikhande graph (right) (Arvind et al., 2020) are non-isomorphic strongly regular graphs of the same parameters. They thus cannot be distinguishedby 3-WL.
Figure 7: Ego-nets of CSL(12, 3) (left) and CSL(12, 5) (right) for depths 1, 2, and 3. These areused in Proposition 8.
