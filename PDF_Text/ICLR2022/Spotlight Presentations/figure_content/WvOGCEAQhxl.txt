Figure 1: GDE on CIFAR-10: The scatter plots of pair-wise model disagreement (x-axis) vs the testerror (y-axis) of the different ResNet18 trained on CIFAR10. The dashed line is the diagonal linewhere disagreement equals the test error. Orange dots represent models that use data augmentation.

Figure 5: GDE under distribution shift: The scatter plots of pair-wise model disagreement (x-axis) vs the test error (y-axis) of the different ResNet50 trained on PACS. Each plot corresponds tomodels evaluated on the domain specified in the title. The marker shapes indicate the source domain.
Figure 6: Calibration on CIFAR10: Calibration plot of different ensembles of 100 ResNet18trained on CIFAR10. The error bar represents one bootstrapping standard deviation (most are ex-tremely small). The estimated CACE for each scenario is shown in Table 1.
