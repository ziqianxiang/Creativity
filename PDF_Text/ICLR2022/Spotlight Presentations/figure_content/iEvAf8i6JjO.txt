Figure 1: Layer-wise task correlation for the case where the subspace spanned by the representationsis a two-dimensional plane. The subspaces are weakly correlated if they are nearly orthogonal andstrongly correlated if they are nearly parallel.
Figure 2: Trust region for a 2-dimensional subspace canbe interpreted as: if the angle θ between VW1 Lt andProjS1 (VW1Lt) is less than θtlh (larger projection onSjl ), old task j is selected to TRlt ; otherwise not. θtlhcan be set as a large value, and we can pick tasks withtop-K smallest θ to TRlt .
