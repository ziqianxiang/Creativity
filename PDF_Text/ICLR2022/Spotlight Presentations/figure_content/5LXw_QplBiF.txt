Figure 2: Cross-entropy difference in nats onthe test set, binned by string length. Thesemodels are the same as those shown in Figure 1.
Figure 1: Cross-entropy difference in nats be-tween model and source distribution on valida-tion set vs. training time. Each line correspondsto the model which attains the lowest differencein cross-entropy out of all random restarts.
Figure 3: Visualization of the first 30 epochs of training (top to bottom) on the marked reversal task. Ineach plot, the horizontal axis is the string position (time step). Darkness indicates the weight assignedto the correct stack action type, normalized by the weight of all actions at time t (black = correct,white = incorrect). The white band in the middle occurs because “replace” is considered the correctaction type for the middle time step, but the models apparently learned to perform a different actionwithout affecting the results. Both models were trained with learning rate 0.005.
Figure 4: SG score vs. test perplexity, shown on all 10 random restarts for an LSTM and an RNS-RNN.
