Figure 1: Graphical illustration of the recovered normal vectors of S by (left) the proposed DPCP-PSGM approach and (right) methods that use spectral initialization and impose orthogonality con-straints . Initial vectors b01 , b20 , b30 are randomly initialized and are non-orthogonal in (left) and spec-trally initialized (hence orthogonal) in (right). Note that in (left) rank(B*) (where B* = [bɪ,与,bɜDequals to the true codimension C = 2 of S and SPan(B *) ≡ S⊥ while in (right) B * is orthogonalhence rank(B*) = 3 with b2* ∈ S.
Figure 2: Distances of the recovered B from the true orthogonal complements S⊥ as recovered bythe proposed DPCP-PSGM algorithm provided an overestimated of the true c i.e., c0 = 10 (left),RSGM provided the true c (middle) and RSGM provided c0 = 10 (right). Darker colors reflect highervalues of distances while lighter colors indicate successful recoveries of B .
Figure 3: Estimated by DPCP-PSGM codimensions for two dif-ferent outliers, ratios r = MMN (a) r = 0.6 (left) and (b) r = 0.7(right)(PSGM) induces implicit bias and converges to a matrix that spans a basis of the orthogonal comple-ment of the inliers subspace even as long as a) we overestimate it codimension, b) lift orthogonalityconstraints enforced in previous DPCP formulations and c) use random initialization. Empiricalresults that corroborate the developed theory and showcase the merits of our approach.
