Figure 1: We construct a high rank and a low rank target from the temporal product. Forboth (1a) and (1b), we plot the inputs xt together with the corresponding outputs Ht (x).
Figure 2: In (a), (b), (c) we consider target relationships with different singular valuesindicated in the respective caption. For (a), (b) we also consider targets with different rank,where N0 = 2, 4, 6, 8. We use models with fixed width m = mE = mD = 128 and codingvector size N. Detailed settings are found in Appendix E.2.
Figure 3: K, J are the parameters of the Lorenz 96 system. They describe the numberof independent and coupled variables in the system, which can be viewed as a complexitymeasure. Detailed settings are found in Appendix E.3.
