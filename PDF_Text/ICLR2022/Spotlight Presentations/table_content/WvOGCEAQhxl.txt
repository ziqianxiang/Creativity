Table 1: Calibration error vs. deviation from GDE for CIFAR10: Estimated CACE for en-sembles with different number of models (denoted in the superscript) for ResNet18 on CIFAR10with 10000 training examples. Test Error, Disagreement statistics and ECE are averaged over 100models. Here ECE is the standard measure of top-class calibration error, provided for completeness.
Table 2: Calibration error vs. deviation from GDE under distribution shift: Test error, dis-agreement rate, the gap between the two, and CACE for ResNet18 on PACS over 10 models each.
Table 3: Calibration error vs. deviation from GDE for CIFAR100: Test error, disagreementrate, the gap between the two, and ECE and CACE for ResNet18 on CIFAR100 with 10k trainingexamples computed over 100 models.

We see that while 4 pairs of models doesimprove the correlation, the improvement is only marginal. This suggests that only using a singlepair of models may be sufficient for estimating the generalization error.
