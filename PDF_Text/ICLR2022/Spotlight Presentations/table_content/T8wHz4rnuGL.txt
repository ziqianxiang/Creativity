Table 4: Test performance (median and standard deviation) on two set of unrelated tasks on MNISTand SVHN, across ten different runs.
Table 5: Complete results (median and standard deviation) of different competing methods onMNIST/SVHN on all tasks, see Appendix C.1.2 and Appendix C.2.
Table 6: Complete task-improvement statistics in CIFAR10 for all competing methods and RotoGradwith different dimensionality for Rk, see §6.
Table 7: Complete f1-score statistics and training hours in CelebA for all competing methods andtwo different architectures/settings (median over five runs), see §6. For the convolutional network weuse m = 256, and m = 1536 for the residual network.
Table 8: Results for different methods on the NYUv2 dataset with a SegNet model. RotoGrad obtainsthe best performance in segmentation and depth tasks on all metrics, while significantly improvingthe results on normal surfaces with respect to the vanilla case.
