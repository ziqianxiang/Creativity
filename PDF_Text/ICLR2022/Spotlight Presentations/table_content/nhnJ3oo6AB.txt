Table 1: Generalization. We evaluate the generalization ability of all methods by evaluating on unseenenvironments. Our method significantly outperform baselines on both metrics (longer distance & less collision).
Table 2: Evaluation on environments with spheres. We evaluate the final policy of all methods. Our methodachieved the best performance on almost all environment for all metrics.
Table 4: Ablation study on Thin Obs. & Sph.: We performablations on Thin Obs. & Sph. environment and adopt the bestsetting (N = 4, L = 2) for all environments, which includes 16visual tokens and 2 Transformer encoder layers.
