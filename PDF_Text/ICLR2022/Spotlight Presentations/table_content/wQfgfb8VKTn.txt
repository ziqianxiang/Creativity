Table 1: Multi-agent coordination benchmark.
Table 2: Percentage of commu-nication saved for each task.
Table 3:	Approximate running time of CASEC on tasks from the MACO benchmark.
Table 4:	Approximate running time of CASEC on tasks from the SMAC benchmark.
Table 5:	Average time (millisecond) for 1000 action selection phases of CASEC/DCG. CASECuses a graph with sparseness 0.2 while DCG uses the full graph. To ensure a fair comparison, bothMax-Sum/Max-Plus algorithms pass messages for 8 iterations. The batch size is set to 10.
