Table 1: Correspondence between likelihood-free inference and black-box optimization.
Table 2: Mean rank of evaluated algorithms with regard to the area under the top score curve forTfBind problems. The rank ranges from 1 to 10. Higher rank is better.
Table 3: Comparison of the area under top-100 curves for UTR, AMP and Fluo benchmarks. Largerarea means better sample efficiency.
Table 4: Top-10 score ranking for the TfBind instances that we adopt. “Evo.” stands for theevolution algorithm.
