Table 1: Performance comparison between FO-DS (Salman et al., 2020) and its direct ZO imple-mentation ZO-DS on (CIFAR-10, ResNet-110).
Table 2: SA (standard accuracy, %) and CA (certified accuracy, %) versus different values of '2-radius r. Notethat SA corresponds to the case of r = 0. In both FO and ZO blocks, the best accuracies for each '2 -radius arehighlighted in bold.
Table 3: CA (certified accuracy, %) vs. different '2-radii for imageclassification on STL-10.
Table 4: ZO-AE-DS using different denoiser trainingschemes under (CIFAR-10, ResNet-110).
Table 5: Performance of image reconstruction using different methods at various attack scenarios. Here‘standard’ refers to the original image reconstructor without making any robustification. Four robustificationmethods are presented including FO-DS, ZO-DS (RGE, q = 192), FO-AE-DS, and ZO-AE-DS (CGE, q = 192).
Table A1: CA (certified accuracy, %) vs. different '2-radii for different combinations of denoisers and classifier.
Table A2: CA (certified accuracy, %) vs. different '2-radii for FO-AE-DS With different AutoEncoders.
Table A3: CA (certified accuracy, %) vs. different `2 -radii for FO-AE-DS With different training schemes.
Table A4: CA (certified accuracy, %) vs. different '2-radii for FO-AE-DS on ImageNet Images.
