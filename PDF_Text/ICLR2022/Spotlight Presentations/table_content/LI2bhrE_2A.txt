Table 1: Left: Language modeling results. We report perplexity (PPL) and root mean square de-viation (RMSD) for each CDR in the heavy chain. Right: Results on the antigen-binding antibodydesign task. We report the amino acid recovery (AAR) for all methods.
Table 2: SARS-CoV-2 neutralization optimization results. For each method, we report the PPL onCoVAbDab after pretraining on SAbDab and then report the average neutralization score after ITAfinetuning. The average neutralization probability of original CoVAbDab antibodies is 69.3%.
Table 3: SARS-CoV-2 neutralization optimization results. Here we show examples of new CDR-H3 sequences generated by our model and their predicted neutralization improvement over originalantibodies S1D7 and C694 in the CoVAbDab database.
