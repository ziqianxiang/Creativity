Table 1: Classification results (average accuracy) on CIFAR-100 dataset for buffer-based methods and ablativemodels with adopting MRP as a buffer booster.
Table 2: Classification results (average accuracy) for IL benchmarks, averaged across 10 runs. ”-” denotesexperiments we were unable to run, because of compatibility issues. Best performance is marked in bold ineach section. We use public code (Buzzega et al., 2020) to reproduce results. Sections show joint training,model growing, parameter isolation, memory replay, regularization, and pseudo memory replay from the top.
