Table 1: The differences between traditional single task learning and meta learning frameworkproposed by Baxter (Baxter, 2000), where erQ(H) - erz (H) = infh∈H erP (h)dQ(P) -pn=ι infh∈H erPi(h). The proposal of our task relatedness notion comes from the motivationthat probabilities measures {Pi}in=1 sampled from the environment (P, Q) need to be equivalent,namely, almost Π-related.
