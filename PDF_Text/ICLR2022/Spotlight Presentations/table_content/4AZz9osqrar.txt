Table 1: Results of the proposed rwSAM. (a) Results on CIFAR-10-LT with linear probe andID evaluation. SimSiam+rwSAM on imbalanced datasets performs even better than SimSiam onbalanced datasets with the same number of examples. Note that rwSAM closes the generalizationgap on the rare examples (0.081 vs. 0.066). (b) Results on ImageNet-LT with fine-tuning and OODevaluation. rwSAM improves the performance of MoCo v2 and SimSiam on the target datasets.
