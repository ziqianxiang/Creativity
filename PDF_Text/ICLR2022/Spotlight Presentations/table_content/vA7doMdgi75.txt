Table 1: Results on Washinghton DC AVIRIS hyperspectral imageMethods	F1-scoresr=80%^^r = 90%DPCP-PSGM (unknown c)	0.994	0.993RSGM (unknown c)	0	0DPCP-IRLS (unknown c)	0	0RSGM (c = 5)	0.999	0.993DPCP-IRLS c = 5	1	0.995Proof By Assumption 1 we have that all columns of B0 will satisfy the sufficient condition forconvergence of DPCP-PSGM (Algorithm 1) to a normal vector of S. From Lemma 6 and we use theinequality q。，(Bo) > ∣∣∆∣∣2 which ensures full-rankness of B*, which is the key ingredient in orderto prove that SPan(B*) = S⊥. We can then Use Theorem 9 for matrix B°. Note that columns of Boare drawn independently and are uniformly distributed on the unit sphere. Hence, columns of B0 aresampled by subgaussian distribution and the LHS of the inequality of the theorem appears if we scalewith √√d so that to create unit-norm columns and use LHS of the inequality of Theorem 7. The RHSof the inequality is due to the upper bound of ∣∣∆∣∣2 as stated in Lemma 8. The absolute constantsC1, C2 depend only the subgaussian norm of the uniform distribution (they is no dependency on thedimensions of the problem).
