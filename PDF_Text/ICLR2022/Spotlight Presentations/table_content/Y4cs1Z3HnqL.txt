Table 1: Average normalized score and the standard deviation of all algorithms over five seeds inGym. The highest performing scores are highlighted. The score of TD3-BC is the reported scoresin Table 7 of Fujimoto & Gu (2021). The scores for other baselines are obtained by re-training withthe ‘v2’ dataset of D4RL (Fu et al., 2020).
