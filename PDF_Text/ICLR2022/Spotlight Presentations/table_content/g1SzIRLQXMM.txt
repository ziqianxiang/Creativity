Table 1: Number of clusters used for each layer by Weight Compression, determined by the elbowmethod. Note that for V1.conv1, there are four components of a multivariate Gaussian as describedin Appendix B.1xrot and yrot are the orthogonal and parallel orientations relative to the grating, θ is the angle of thegrating orientation, f is the spatial frequency of the grating, φ is the phase of the grating relative tothe Gaussian envelope, σx and σy are the standard deviations of the Gaussian envelope orthogonaland parallel to the grating, which can be defined as multiples (nx and ny) of the inverse of the grat-ing frequency and C is a scaling factor.
