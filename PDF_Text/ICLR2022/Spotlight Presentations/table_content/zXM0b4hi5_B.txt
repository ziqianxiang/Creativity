Table 1: Evaluating autoencoders trained with both uniform distribution U (x) and the OpenImagesdataset (Krasin et al., 2017) P(x) at two different rates. Reported are the PSNR, MS-SSIM andNLPD evaluated for all networks. These networks use the approximate in Eq. 15. Bold valuesindicate the best value for each evaluation metric at a certain rate (bpp) with a certain distribution.
