Table 1: Quantitative evaluation of clustering performance. * denotes that the values are reportedones in the original papers, and the rest scores are obtained by experimenting with the released codesof baselines on our set of evaluation datasets. Please note that the original methods of FineGAN,MixNMatch, and OneGAN utilize human-annotated labels.
Table 2: Result of an ablation study. We observed that the largest performance degradation was causedby changing the formulation of the information-theoretic regularization to a trivial softmax function.
