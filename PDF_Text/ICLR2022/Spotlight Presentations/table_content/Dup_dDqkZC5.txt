Toprow: birds-eye-view of road network with groundtruth trajectory data where given trajectory is cyanand held-out trajectory information is pink. Bottomrow: diverse trajectories generated by the differentmodes of AutoBot-Ego. The model generates trajec-tories that adhere to the road network and capturesdistinct possible futures.

Table 3: TrajNet++ ablation studies for a multi-agent forecasting scenario. We investigate the impact ofusing the social attention in the encoder and in the decoder. We found that AutoBot is able to cause significantlyfewer collisions between agents compared to variants without the social attention, and improves the predictionaccuracy on the scene-level metrics while maintaining strong performance on the ego-agent. Metrics are reportedon the validation set.

Table 6: NuScenes Quantitative Results by Entropy Regularization. We study AutoBot-Egoâ€™sperformance when varying the entropy regularization term on nuScenes, and see that increasedentropy improves model performance (particularly Min ADE 10 and Off Road Rate) up to a limit.
Table 7: TrajNet++ ablation studies for a multi-agent forecasting scenario. We investigate the impact of thenumber of social/temporal layers in the encoder and the decoder.
Table 8: TrajNet ablation studies for a multi-agent forecasting scenario. We evaluate the impactof using the extra social data as a set and the actual multi-agent modelling on this context. We foundthat AutoBot is able to cause fewer collisions between agents compared to variants without the socialattention.
