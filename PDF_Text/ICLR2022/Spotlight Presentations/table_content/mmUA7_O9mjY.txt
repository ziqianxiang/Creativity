Table 1: The averaged Wasserstein-1 distance and the standard deviations of each method.
Table 2: We compare our contact point discovery backbone with human-defined contact points fromPlasticineLab on single-stage tasks. We show the averaged normalized incremental IoU scores andthe standard deviations of each method.
