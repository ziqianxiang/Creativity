Table 1: Accuracy on the CIFAR10 test set under different attacks. Comparison between the pro-posed method (fx-a; fx-b), traditional adversarial training (adv train), feature denoising blocks (dns)and distribution regression network (drn). All models are trained using D[t1r0%] (except for base,which is trained on Dtr). The columns to the right report the accuracy on the subset of samples thatare correctly classified by the base model when clean.
Table 2: Summary of investigated hyperparameters and their values. Combinations of these param-eters have been explored in the ablation experiments; not all combinations have been investigated,due to some being redundant.
Table 3: Augmention details for the CIFAR10 dataset.
Table 4: Augmentation details for the HIST dataset.
Table 5: Architecture of ConvBlock(channels, pool). Operation blocks are sequential.
Table 6: Architecture of ResidualBlock(channels, pool). Operation blocks are sequential.
Table 7: Architecture of FixerModule(channels, δ, ζ, ρ). Operation blocks are sequential. Refer tofigure 1 for visual representation. In all the experiments ρ = 4.
Table 8: Architecture of ResNet9 with hyper-parameters δ, ζ, ρ and dataset. In all the experimentsρ = 4. Operation blocks are defined in tables 5 to 7. Base model architecture can be obtained byremoving the FixerModules or equivalently setting δ = 0.
