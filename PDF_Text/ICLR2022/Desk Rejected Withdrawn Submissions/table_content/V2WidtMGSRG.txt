Table 2: Performance comparison on theNN-generated data, in terms of the aver-age mean squared error for different σ .
Table 1: Performance comparison on the NN-generated data, in terms of the number of correctly(‘TP’) and wrongly (‘FP’) selected features for differ-ent σ. The standard errors are within 0.3, except forthe ‘FP’ of ‘LASSO’, which is 0.6.

Table 3: Performance comparison on the linear data,in terms of the number of correctly (‘TP’) and wrongly(‘FP’) selected features for different σ. The standarderrors are within 0.1.
Table 5: Performance comparison on the Friedmandata, in terms of the number of correctly (‘TP’) andwrongly (‘FP’) selected features for different σ. Thestandard errors are within 0.15, except for ‘FP’ of‘LASSO’, which is around 0.3.
