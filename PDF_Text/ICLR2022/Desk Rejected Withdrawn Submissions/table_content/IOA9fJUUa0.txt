Table 5: Results of the two-way ANOVANote. * < .05We conducted additional by-postposition pairwise comparisons through a two-sample t-test. As Ta-ble 6 shows, the model performance in -eyse is significantly better than in the other two postposi-tions. Considering the different number of functions (e.g., two for -eyse, six for -(u)lo, and eightfor -ey), this finding indicates an inverse relationship between the classification accuracy and thenumber of functions that each postposition manifests.
Table 6: Statistical comparison of each postposition: Two-sample t-testNote. *** < .0014.2	Do the asymmetric proportions of the functions in each postpositionaffect the model performance?The answer is they do. The average classification accuracy of each function for -ey is the highestfor LOC (0.947) and the lowest for AGT (0.041); for -eyse, it is the highest in LOC (0.948) and thelowest in SRC (0.535); for -(u)lo, it is the highest in DIR (0.938) and the lowest in LOC (0.106)(Tables 2-4). As for the occurrences of individual functions per postposition, LOC for -ey, LOC for-eyse, and DIR for -(u)lo account for the larger portion of the entire corpus than other functions(see Table 1). This finding thus indicates that the model performance is affected by the asymmetricproportions of the functions comprising the use of each postposition.
