Table 1: Complexity analysis of operations. Numbers in column ‘BOPs’ represent the numbers ofbinary operations. Numbers in column ‘FLOPs’ indicate the numbers of floating operations. Theanalysis is mainly based on the GNN model defined in (1), and we only show the complexity oflayer `.
Table 2: Statistics of datasets.
Table 3: Impact of computation orders. ‘FP’ denotes the full-precision models. ‘B1’ denotes thebinary models performing forward propagation with the computation order defined in (2). ‘B2’ de-notes the binary models performing forward propagation with the computation order defined in (3).
Table 4: Comparison with baselines.
