Table 2: Accuracy of different scheduling methods on 16 domains, compared to its Fully-Shared-MTLbaseline (First, second, and third ranks). Our QLS method outperforms others in almost all of tasks.
Table 3: Accuracy of fully shared representation learned with different strategies on all-but-onedomains tested on the remaining unseen domain. φ(DOMAIN) means that we transfer the knowledgeof other 15 tasks to the target task DOMAIN. Using the proposed scheduling of all tasks while training,we improved the overall accuracy of the MTL classifier on unseen data by 2.2% compared to baseline.
