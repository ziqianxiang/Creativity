Table 1: A comparison of different initialization schemes for ReLU networks. The dead node prob-abilities are calculated numerically for input signals drawn from the standard normal distribution.
Table 2: A comparison betWeen the decision boundaries obtained by approximating sl-l-l1 by itsjRMS and mean value. The RMS approximation underestimates the length boundary for RAI,Whereas it overestimates both the phase boundaries for RAAI. On the other hand, the mean ap-Proximation overestimates the phase boundaries for RAI and RAAI both.
