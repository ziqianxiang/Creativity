Table 6: Comparison between ground-truth baseline values and incorrect baseline values. The lastcolumn shows ratios of multi-variate interaction patterns of different orders rmEs⊆N,∣S∣=m II(S)IPs⊆N,S=0 II(S)IWe consider interactions of input samples that activate interaction patterns. We find that Whenmodels/fUnctions contain a single complex collaborations between multiple variables (i.e. high-order interaction patterns), incorrect baseline values usually generate a mixture of many low-orderinteraction patterns. In comparison, ground-truth baseline values lead to SParSe and high-orderinteraction patterns.
