Table 1: Privacy-Utility comparison: We report normalized hypervolume scores (higher is better)to compare the privacy-utility trade-offs for our sanitizer framework against baseline. ‘*’ we adaptthe method in original paper for this task with implementation details in section 4.2. Proposedmethod outperforms all baselines in all experiments.
Table 2: Classification Accuracy Score (CAS)evaluation: We train classifier on privatized datasamples and evaluate them on non-privatized sam-ples.
Table 3: CAS on sensitive attribute estimation asutility. Note that this setup is not possible for thebaselines hence we only evaluate our proposed fourmechanisms.
