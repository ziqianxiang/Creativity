Table 1: (FID (1),IS (↑)) of sparse BigGAN and SNGAN on CIFAR-10. We divide sparse methodsinto two groups, post-training pruning (PF and GAN Tickets) and sparse training (Static Sparse GANand STU-GAN). “sD(%)” and “sG(%)” refers to the sparsity of the discriminator and the generatorused to train GANs, respectively. Results of GAN Tickets are obtained from Chen et al. (2021b). Theexact sparsity of GAN Tickets at sG = 90% is 87%. The best sparse results are bolded.
