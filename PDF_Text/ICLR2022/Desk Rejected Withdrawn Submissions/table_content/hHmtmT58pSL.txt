Table 1: gf-tuning outperforms all published base-lines on the few-shot FLIP benchmark tasks (Dal-lago et al., 2021). The few-shot tasks in FLIPcorrespond to 1-vs-rest fitness prediction for GB1and AAV with a Spearman correlation metric. Thegf-tuned model was trained four times and the av-erage and best performance is reported.
Table 2: Measurements of homology and epistasis of protein fitness prediction tasks. We considerdatasets with a higher number of sequences and sequence clusters to be higher homology, becausethis indicates a large number and diversity of evolutionarily related proteins. We consider datasetswith a lower the Spearman of the additive model to be more epistatic because this means that muta-tional effect cannot be predicted as well by adding the effects of single mutations.
