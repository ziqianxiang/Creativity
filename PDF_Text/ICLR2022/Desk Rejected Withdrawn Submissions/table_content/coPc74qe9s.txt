Table 1: Spearman correlation coefficients (œÅ). Average of 5 fine tuning runs.
Table 2: Search results on NAS-Bench-101, 201 and 301 using the same EA search algorithmbut with different performance estimation methods. #Q represents the number of unique networksqueried during search. Note that the #Q for CL-fine-tune also counts the fine-tuning instances.
