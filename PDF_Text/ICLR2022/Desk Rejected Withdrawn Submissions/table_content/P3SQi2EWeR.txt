Table 1: Test error (%) of ResNet-18 and ResNet-50 with standard square kernels and the modifiedversions with circular kernels or integrated kernels on the ImageNet dataset (lower error rate is better).
Table 2: Test error (%) of the baselines with square kernels (Square) and the corresponding circularkernel (Circle) versions in kernel size k âˆˆ {3, 5, 7} on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. With the incrementof kernel size, the advantage of circular kernel over square kernel becomes more distinct.
