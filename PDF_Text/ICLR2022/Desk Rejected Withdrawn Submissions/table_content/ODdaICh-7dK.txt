Table 1: Results on increasing the amount of smile for SeNT-Gen and baselines on StyleGAN. Higher valuesfor the changes on smile (underlined green column) is better and lower values of undesired changes (shownas absolute values) on other attributes (red columns on changes of age and pose) indicate a more successfulpreservation of image identity.
Table 2: Results on decreasing the amount of age on StyleGAN. As the age is decreased, lower negativevalues of changes in the age (underlined green column) is better and lower values of undesired changes(shown as absolute values) on other attributes (red columns on changes of smile and pose) indicate a moresuccessful preservation of image identity.
Table 3: Attribute ranges in base-lines and SeNT-Gen.
Table 4: Ablation result on the sparsity parameter Î³. Higher values of changes on smile and lower changes onuntargeted attributes are better. The Sparsity column indicates the ratio of dimensions that are thresholded(not selected) to all dimensions.
Table 5: Ablation results on (1) using a different architectures of neural network, (2) using a different linearactivation function. Higher values of changes on smile and lower changes on untargeted attributes are better.
