Table 1: Ablation study on variation-specific benchmarks, OC-LFW for occlusion, CFP-FP for head pose, andRFW for ethnicity. *: self-implemented CosFace baseline. "Ours (single)" means “Ours (occlusion)”, “Ours(pose)”, or “Ours (ethnicity)” for the respective variation-specific dataset. “Ours (all)”: adding all the proposedvariations for MvCoM.
Table 2: Ablation study on in-the-wild IJB-A dataset withmultiple variations. *: self-implemented CosFace serves asbaseline for all our ablation methods for a fair comparison.
Table 3: Challenging variation-specific face recognition benchmarks comparison. “-”: original work doesnot report performance on the corresponding protocol. “*"： our self-implemented methods. “]”: testingperformance using models obtained from corresponding authors. In RFW, CA, AA, EA and IN are abbreviationsfor Caucasian, African American, East Asian and Indian, respectively.
Table 4: General face recognition benchmarks comparison. The MegaFace verification rates are computedat FAR=0.0001%. “*”: self-implemented methods. “-”: the authors did not report the performance on thecorresponding protocol. Notice that MegaFace1 is based on uncleaned protocol, of which numbers are lowerthan the cleaned protocol.
