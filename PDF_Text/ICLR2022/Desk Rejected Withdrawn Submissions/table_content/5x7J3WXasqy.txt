Figure 6 is an examplefor understanding the hashing algorithm. Our hash function can hash a position in two-dimensionto a bin, which can be represented as a blue rectangle of the smallest possible unit size. To storethe information of quadrilaterals in bins, we hash the vertices of the rectangular bounding box thatcovers a quadrilateral and put the quadrilateral in the bin of each vertex so that the quadrilateral isstored in one to four bins. The grey boxes in the dashed line and the red dots are examples of thebounding boxes for quadrilaterals and the vertices of a bounding box, respectively. Practically, theduplicate storing of a quadrilateral in one bin is avoided for fast search. The width and height ofany bin are kept longer than those of the bounding box that covers any quadrilateral, ensuring thatvertices of any bounding box are hashed to the same bin or bins that are adjacent to each other. Thisalso guarantees that for a position p, the hashing function b = H(p) can give the bin that containsthe quadrilateral to which p belongs because p is inside the bounding box that aligns with the bins.
