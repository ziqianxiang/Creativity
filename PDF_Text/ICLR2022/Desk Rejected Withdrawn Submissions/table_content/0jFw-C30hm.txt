Table 1: Statistical results obtained for each pair of algorithms where all 108 datasets are used inthe comparison. Each cell presents 1 or 0, where 1 indicates that there is no statistical significancebetween the performance of the pair of algorithms and 0 otherwise.
Table 2: Bootstrapping statistical results obtained for each pair of algorithms where the sample sizeof the representative datasets is selected with threshold of 90%. Each cell presents the number ofcomparisons (out of 30) where there is no statistical significance observed between the pairs.
Table 3: Statistical results obtained for each pair of algorithms when all representative datasets fromeach cluster are involved in the comparison separately (selected with threshold 90%). Each cellpresents 1 or 0, where 1 indicates that there is no statistical significance between the performance ofthe pair of algorithms and 0 otherwise.
Table 4: Bootstrapping statistical results obtained for each pair of algorithms where the samplesize of the representative datasets (selected with threshold 90%). Each cell presents the number ofcomparisons out of 30, where there is no statistical significance between the performance of the pairof algorithms.
