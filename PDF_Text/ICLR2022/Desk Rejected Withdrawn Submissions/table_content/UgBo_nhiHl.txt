Table 1: L2R results in Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain for top 5 and 10 queries(NDCG@5 & 10), on Microsoft Learning to Rank with 10K queries and Yahoo LTR datasets.
Table 2: Regression results in root mean squareerror (RMSE). GrowNet results are average of 5iterations and the values in the parenthesis repre-sent standard deviation.
Table 3: Classification results, in AUC, on Higgsbozon dataset. For our model, we preset 3 dif-ferent results: using all the data, 10% of the data(1M), and 1% of the data (100K).
Table 4: Ablation study experiment results on Higgs 1M and Microsoft (Fold 1) datasets. All modelshave two-layer shallow networks as weak learners. Hidden layer dimension is 16 for classificationand 64 for ranking task. The third column is the final GrowNet model that all different versions arecompared against. Reported results are AUC scores for classification and NDCG for ranking.
