Table 1: Power of Tuning Multiple Objectives Simultaneously: The “Single Objective Optimiza-tion” columns show the results of each of the three metrics when tuning with respect to each of thesingle metrics. The diagonal values (0.773, 0, 0) represent the best attainable values for each metric.
Table 2: Hyperparameter Variable Description. In this table We specify the hyperparameters usedto perform multi-objective optimization and their corresponding range, type, and role. The first fiveare primarily used when perform classic model tuning to improve accuracy. We include the numberof cores as this can affect the solution found and hence the corresponding objective values. The lastvector of hyperparameters represents the mitigation hyperparameters used by Agarwal et al. (2018b)to perform grid search over the space of Lagrange multipliers. The dimension is typically small butdepends on the definition of the constraints formulated by Bird et al. (2020).
