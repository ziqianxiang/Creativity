For monocular 3D detection, it lacks the depth dimension,thus performing worse on unseen data. We further use a depth error lower bound for monocularimagery to demonstrate this point. Therefore we propose to reformulate the previous discrete outputrepresentation as the spatial probability distribution to take depth estimation uncertainty into con-sideration. We also propose two sampling strategies to sample locations from location distribution.
