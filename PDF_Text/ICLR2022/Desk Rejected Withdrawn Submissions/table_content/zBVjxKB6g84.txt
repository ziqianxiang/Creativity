Table 1: The testing accuracy of a) FedAvg and clipping-enabled FedAvg, on IID and Non-IID data. The 4thand 6th columns display both the accuracy of clipping-enabled FedAvg, and its difference with FedAvg.
Table 2: The accuracy difference between a) FedAvg and cliP-enabled FedAvg and b) cliP-enabled FedAvgand DP-FedAvg. The cliPPing threshold is 0.5 of the average magnitude and Privacy budget = 1.5 for MLP,AlexNet and MobileNetV2 and = 5 for ResNet-18.
Table 3: The accuracy difference between a) FedAvg and CE-FedAvg and b) CE-FedAvg and DP-FedAvg. ThecliPPing threshold is 0.5 of the average magnitude and Privacy budget = 1.5 for MLP, AlexNet and ResNet-18.
Table 4: Stationary points of FedAvg with gradient clipping for (24) under different parametersettings.
