Table 1: Attack success rates (in percentage) on ModelNet40 against PointNet, PointNet++, andDGCNN. Success rates are reported for every pair of constraint boundaries (, n).
Table 2: Attack success rates (in percentage) on ScanObjectNN against PointNet. Success rates arereported for every pair of constraint boundaries (, n).
Table 3: Attack success rates (in percentage) of existing methods and their step-size schedulingenhanced counterparts. Success rates are reported for different pairs of constraint boundaries (, n)on ModelNet40 against PointNet.
Table 4: Attack success rates (in percentage) against outlier removal defense and salient point re-moval defense. Success rates are reported for every pair of constraint boundaries (, n) on Model-Net40 against PointNet. Best success rate for each number of points n is chosen for comparison.
Table 5: Attack success rates (in percentage) of the proposed methods and their variants. Successrates are reported for every pair of constraint boundaries (, n) on ModelNet40 against PointNet.
Table 6: Attack success rates (in percentage) for different number of steps values M and differ-ent number of points values n with = 0.05. Success rates are reported on ModelNet40 againstPointNet.
