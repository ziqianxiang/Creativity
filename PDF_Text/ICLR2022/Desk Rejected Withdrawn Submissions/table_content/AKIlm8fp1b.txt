Integrating PaTNet into an adversarial patch generator is straight-forward. Following (Xu et al., 2020), we define the attack loss J of Eq. 1 byJ (x0i )= Bjm∩Paix>ηmax(p(Bj),ν)}(5)where p(∙) denotes the confidence score of the jth 'person' bounding box Bj and V is a confidencethreshold. The use of max{p(∙), V} enforces the optimizer to minimize the bounding boxes of highprobability (≥ ν). |Bj ∩ Pi | > η indicates that Bj has at least η-overlapping with the person Piwearing an adversarial T-shirt. η is set to be a small number 0.1 in both training and test. Therational behind Eq. 5 is that the probability of person detection would be suppressed only if a ‘person’bounding box associated with the adversarial T-shirt has a high confidence.

These T-shirts were used to collect test data with the T-shirt designed by our approach atthe same time and in the same scenes. So the experimental setting is fair for all methods. All scenesconsider the lightning, distance and poses changes. For the digital world experiments, we use thepublic datasets COCO (Lin et al., 2014) and Inria (Dalal & Triggs, 2005), and apply all patches to thelargest person object in an image by an affine transformation, follow the setting in (Thys et al., 2019).
