Table 2: Our method with and without filtering non-specific phrases (see Sec.3.2)5.1	Implementation detailsOptimization: We run our algorithm with P = #"Sses swaps per iteration. For every experimentwe run our algorithm for 30 iterations which was found to be enough for convergence for all datasets.
Table 3: Comparison between PAM and our method (All-Age-Faces Dataset)Ours PAMTrain Accuracy (%)	58.6	58.4Loss	1.451 1.4507 ConclusionWe proposed language-guided image clustering for attribute clustering. We reduce the task to awell-studied discrete optimization task, the uncapacitated K-facility location problem. To solve thistask with acceptable runtime, we suggested an efficient optimization method for solving it. Thephrases we find optimize the loss well. Therefore, a further improvement of our method is morelikely to be achieved by improving our loss function or by extending our method’s expressivity. Amore expressive method may utilize a language model to produce more specific phrases, or combineour method with other clustering methods for finetuning the visual features based on the data.
