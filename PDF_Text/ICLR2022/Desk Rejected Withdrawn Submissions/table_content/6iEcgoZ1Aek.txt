Table 1: BLEU scores of IWSLT translation tasks. On the left, a demonstration of the soft guidance via theregularization. On the right, we present the results of Crossformer-Hard Guidance as an utmost regularizationcross-layers.
Table 2: Test results on WMT’14 benchmarks, in terms of BLEU. We further show the comparison ofCrossformer All where Crossformer incorporates all three hard-guided blocks and increases the number of layersto have the same number of parameter as the Transformer.
