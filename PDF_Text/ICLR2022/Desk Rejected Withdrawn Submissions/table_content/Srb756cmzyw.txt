Table 1:	Effect of learning explicit region-token alignment in pre-training, testing on VOC2007.
Table 2:	Effect of integrating multimodal instance discrimination task in WSOD.
Table 3: Contribution of different mechanisms to clean up the signal image-caption pairs provide.
Table 4: Our method outperforms Cap2Det on all three settings without utilizing any ground-truthlabels. Best performer except upper-bound (GT) is bolded. Gains shown for our methods (last tworows) are compared to the Cap2Det baseline (third row).
