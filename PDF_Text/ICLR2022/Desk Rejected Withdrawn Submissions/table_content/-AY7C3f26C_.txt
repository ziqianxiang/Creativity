(ii) Our approach consistently gives the best restora-tion quality even when we set the neighborhood size k = 1, meaning that restored faces with ourapproach are the closest ones among all 3K testing images to the sources. (iii) Varying neighbor-hood size would not change ranking order of different methods, demonstrating the robustness ofproposed metrics, therefore in our experiments, we set k = 4. Moreover, as is shown in Figure 7(b),
