Table 1:	Linear classification when limited training data are available for CL. Available data arelabeled and used for learning the classifier on the fixed encoder and top-1 accuracy is reported.
Table 2:	Linear classification when the full dataset is available for CL. 100% labeled data areused for learning the classifier on the fixed encoder. And top-1 accuracy is reported.
Table 3: Transfer learning to downstream tasks with limited training data for learning theencoder on the source datasets. Top-1 accuracy of linear classification on top of a fixed encoder isreported.
Table 4: Transfer learning with the full dataset for learning the encoder on the source datasets.
