Table 1: Linear classification on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and FMNIST under the IID and twonon-IID settings. 100% labeled data are used for learning the classifier on the fixed encoder andtop-1 accuracy is reported.
Table 2: Semi-supervised learning under IID setting (left) and non-IID setting 1 (right). Wefinetune the encoder and classifier with different ratios of labeled data and report the top-1 accuracy.
Table 3: Federated finetuning under IID FL setting (left) and non-IID FL setting 1 (right). Wefinetune the encoder and classifier with different ratios of locally labeled data on clients by supervisedFL and report the top-1 accuracy.
