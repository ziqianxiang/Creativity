Table 1: Different methods’ performance on solving Rubik’s Cube. Mean values are reported forsolution length, number of nodes, and time taken to solve per test scramble. Optimal (%) indicatesthe percentage of optimal solutions. The last row shows the calculation time normalized in compar-ison to DeepCubeA as in Figure 4.
Table 2: Different methods’ performance on solving 15 puzzle. Mean values are reported for solu-tion length, number of nodes, and time taken to solve per test scramble. Optimal (%) indicates thepercentage of optimal solutions.
