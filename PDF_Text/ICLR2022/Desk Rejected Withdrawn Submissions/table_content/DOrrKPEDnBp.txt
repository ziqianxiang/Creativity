Table 1: The impact of type and location of audio augmentations applied before temporal augmenta-tions. RE was applied for pre-training all models. Top-1/5 accuracy of linear classifiers pre-trainedon AVE dataset for 500 epochs.
Table 2: The impact of Î± variable for each of the augmentations. Top-1 accuracy of linear classifierspre-trained on AVE dataset for 500 epochs.
Table 3: Investigating the impact of location and alignment of the spatio-temporal augmentations.
Table 4: Investigating the impact of temporal resolution of audio and video streams. Temporalresolution for video frames is adjusted through number of frames given to the model during pre-training on AVE dataset. For the audio signal, we adjusted the spectrogram hop size and samplingrate (kHz) during pre-training. Each section shows the effect of increasing temporal resolution withand without spatio-temporal augmentations on performance.
Table 5: Investigating the impact of number of self-supervised pre-training epochs and the type ofself-supervised methods used. The same augmentations were used for all the models.
