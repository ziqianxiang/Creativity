Table 1: Results on the computer vision task. Attsuc is the attack success rate without defense. Wereport accuracy on the attack test set.
Table 2: Results on three natural language processing benchmarks - SST2, AGNeWs and IWSLT’14En-De. For all experiments, we set εN = 0.1. Attsuc is the attack success rate without defense. ForSST and AGNeWs, the evaluation metric is accuracy; for IWSLT’14 En-De, the metric is BLEU.
Table 3: The effect of different εN . Experiments are done on the SST2 dataset.
Table 4: The effect of number of triggers for Insert. Experiments are done on the SST2 dataset andεN = 0.1.
