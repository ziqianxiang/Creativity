Table 1: Results in average precision (AP) on link prediction for datasets w/ edge features. In allcases,OGN is either the best method or is closely behind. * denotes the original standard deviation0.04 rounded to the first decimal. Boldface indicates the best one or two average results (two if theyare less than a standard deviation away from each other), and underline the second best.
Table 2: Inference time (seconds) in the transductivesetting. Similarly to training time (Figure 4), test timefor OGN is much faster than TGAT, TGN, and CAW.
Table 3: Results for node classifica-tion (AUC). OGN is the best method onWikipedia and second best on Reddit.
Table 5: Results of CAW in transductive setting (average precision).
Table 6: Summary statistics for temporal link prediction datasets. * Corresponds to edge featuresfilled with zero values.
Table 7: Hyperparameters for CAW.
Table 8: Results with different aggregation modules (transductive setting). Using attentioneither brings marginal gains or winds UP hurting performance (TGAT on MOOC). The * denotesstd < 0.05 rounded to the first decimal.
Table 9: Average precision (AP) for link prediction on datasets that do not contain edge features.
Table 10: Time (seconds) per epoch with batch-size 32 (transductive setting). We report theaverage value over 3 epochs. Numbers in parentheses indicate the relative training time wrt OGN.
Table 11: Results (AP) using negative sampling on visited nodes in the transductive setting.
