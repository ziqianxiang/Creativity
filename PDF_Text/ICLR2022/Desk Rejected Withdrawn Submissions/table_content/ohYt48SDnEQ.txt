Table 1: The attack success rates (%) of adversarial examples against the hold-out model. We studyfour normal models: Inc-v3, Inc-v4, IncRes-v2 and Res-101. The adversarial examples are craftedvia an ensemble of the other three. We run the SVR-Ens attack for 5 times with different randomseeds to reduce the randomness.
Table 2: The attack success rates (%) of adversarial examples against seven models in the multi-model setting. We run the SVR-Ens attack for 5 times with different random seeds to reduce therandomness.
Table 3: The attack success rates (%) of adversarial examples against nine models with advanceddefense mechanism. We run the SVR-Ens attack for 5 times with different random seeds to reducethe randomness.
