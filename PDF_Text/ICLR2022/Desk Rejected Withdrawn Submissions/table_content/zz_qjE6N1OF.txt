Table 1: Comparison of our P4O agent with top single GPU agents on Seaquest (Hessel et al.,2018; Dabney et al., 2018; Hafner et al., 2020). Gamer-normalized score based on the human gamerscore reported by Hafner et al. (2020). Scores in parentheses for P4O are achieved when runningthe trained agent in deterministic mode (only exploitation). P4Oâ€™s performance is reported in twocases: when trained with the same number of Atari frames and when trained for the same numberof accelerator days as the competitors.
