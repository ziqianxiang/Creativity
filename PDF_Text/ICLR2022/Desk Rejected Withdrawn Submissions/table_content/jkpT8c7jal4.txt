Table 1: Joint evaluation for calibration and refinement. We highlight the values which are on anaverage worse than the baseline in bold. The arrows indicate that higher (â†‘) and lower Q) values arebetter respectively.
Table 2: Joint evaluation for calibration and refinement for STL-10(VGG-16), CUB-200(ResNet-50) and ImageNet(ResNet-50).
Table 3: Joint evaluation for calibration and refinement under natural data shift. For CIFARs we usethe VGG-16 models trained on CIFAR-10 and for ImageNet-v2 we employ the Resnet-50s trainedon ImageNet.
