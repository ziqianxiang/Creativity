Table 1: Comparison of the problem setting we consider to other common settings.
Table 2: Comparison of fidelity of generated images, measured by the Frechet Inception Distance(FID) between the observed images and the samples generated by our method (TIM) and the leadingIMLE-based and task-specific baselines. Lower values of FID are better. We compare favourablyrelative to the baselines.
Table 3: Comparison of faithfulness weighted variance of the samples generated by our method(TIM) and other one-to-many baselines on different tasks. Higher value shows more variation inthe generated samples that are faithful to the original image. Ïƒ is the bandwidth parameter for theGaussian kernel used to compute the faithfulness weights.
Table 4: Comparison of LPIPS diversity score of the samples generated by our method (TIM) andother one-to-many baselines on different tasks. Higher value shows more variation in the generatedsamples.
Table 5: Comparison of FreChet Inception Distance (FID) of two tasks: super-resolution (SR) andimage decompression (DC) by gradually remove (1) hierarchical sampling (HS), (2) mapping net-work (MN), (3) intermediate supervision (IS), (4) weight normalization (WN).
