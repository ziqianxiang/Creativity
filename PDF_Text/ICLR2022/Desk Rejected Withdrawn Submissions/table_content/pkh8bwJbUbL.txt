Accuracy-Fair Trade-off6.2.2	CelebA DatasetThe CelebA dataset (Liu et al., 2015) contains around 200K images of celebrity faces, where eachimage is associated with 40 human-annotated binary attributes including gender, hair color, young,etc. In this paper, we designate gender as the sensitive attribute, and attractive as the binary clas-sification task. We randomly select around 82K and 18K images as the training and validation set.

Table 5: Comparison with Fairness Aware Decision TreeMethod Accuracy (↑) ∆Sufc (1)FAHT	0.596	0.397Implicit	0.760	0.051The implicit approach demonstrates the considerable better results, which may come from two as-pects: (1) the Toxic task is a high-dimensional classification problem (x ∈ R748), where the deeplearning based approach is more effective in handling the high-dim dataset. (2) The FAHT aims torealize the statistical parity (the independence rule), which is not compatible with the sufficiency.
