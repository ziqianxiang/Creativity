Table 1: Statistics of entirely seen, partially seen and unseen triples in validation, test, and aug-mented test sets of NYT and WebNLG datasets.
Table 2: Precision, recall and f1 score of recent RTE models on standard and augmented NYT andWebNLG test sets. Numbers in ( ) are from their papers, other numbers are from our reproduction.
Table 3: Statistics of entirely seen, partially seen, and unseen triples in each overlap sifted NYT andWebNLG test sets including standard test sets.
Table 4: F1 scores of recent RTE models on original and overlap sifted datasets. To make the triplesare completely unseen even for the underlying BERT, we used randomly initialized BERT.
