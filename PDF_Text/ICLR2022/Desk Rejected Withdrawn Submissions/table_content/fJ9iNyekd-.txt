The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 50,000 training images and10,000 testing images with size 32 × 32 × 3 from 10 categories. The training strategy is the sameas that on the MNIST dataset. As shown in Table 4, experiments on different settings (e.g., datadistribution, division of positive classes, overlap), are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of theproposed method.
