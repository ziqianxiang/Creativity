Table 1: Results for different kinds of models under defferent adversarial attacks, arranged accord-ing to distance metrics. Each entry shows the accuracy of the model for the threshold of L0 = 12,L1 = 8, L2 = 1.5, and L∞ = 0.3. For each Lp, p = 0, 1, 2, ∞ norm, we also summarize allattacks in the type, calculating both the median adversarial distance (left value) between all sam-ples and the overall accuracy (right value). The last row shows the minimal accuracy of each modelacross all the attacks. The best results for the overall performance are shown in bold. Due to thespace limit, we only display 15 important attacks out of the total 42 in this table and leave the fullresults in the appendix.
Table 2: Results for ablation study, including six models: the vanilla CNN, the single-head Inter-nal Model (single-IM), the Internal Model without denoiser, the single-head Internal Model withdenoiser (Dn-singleIM), the DIM, and the biDIM. The rest settings are the same as those in Table 1.
