As shown in Table 1, the performance gains of VDTN+GPT2 indicates thebenefits of large-scale language models (LMs). Another benefit of using pretrained GPT2 is fastertraining time as we observed the VDTN+GPT2 converged much earlier than training it from scratch.

We also tested with Lobj (tracking), in which we assumed bounding box anno-tations during training, and simply passed unmasked visual features to VDTN for an object trackingtask. All output representations are used to predict the ground-truth bounding box coordinates of allobjects. Interestingly, we found Lobj (tracking) only improves the results significantly, as comparedto the self-supervised learning objective Lobj . This indicates that our self-supervised learning tasksdo not heavily rely on object boundary annotations. Finally, we found combining both segment andobject-level self-supervision is not useful. This is possible due to our current masking strategy thatmasks object and segment features independently. Therefore, the resulting context features might notbe sufficient for recovering masked representations.

For instance, “Object IdentityF1” shows almost stable performance lines through dialogue turns. Interestingly, we noted that theprediction performance of dialogue states with temporal slots only deteriorates dramatically afterturn 2 onward. We expected that VDTN is able to learn short-term dependencies ( 1-turn distance)between temporal slots, but failed to deal with long-term dependencies (> 1-turn distance) betweentemporal slots. In all metrics, we observed VDTN outperforms both RNN baseline and UniConv (Leet al., 2020b), across all turn positions.

In Table 10a, we observed the benefits of using the Markovprocess to decode dialogue states based on the dialogue states of the last turn Bt-1. This strategyallow us to discard parts of dialogue history that is already represented by the state. We noted that theoptimal design is to use at least 1 last dialogue turn as the dialogue history. In a hypothetical scenario,we applied the oracle Bt-1 during test time, and noted the performance is improved significantly.

Table 12 and 13 display 2 sample dialogues and state predictions. Wedisplayed the corresponding video screenshots for these dialogues in Figure 5. To cross-referencebetween videos and dialogues, we displayed the bounding boxes and their object classes in videoscreenshots. These object classes are indicated in ground-truth and decoded dialogue states indialogues. Overall, we noted that VDTN generated temporal slots of start and end time such that theresulting periods better match the ground-truth temporal segments. VDTN also showed to maintainthe dialogue states better from turn to turn.
