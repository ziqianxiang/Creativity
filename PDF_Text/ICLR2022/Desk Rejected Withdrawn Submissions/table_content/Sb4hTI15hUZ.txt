Table 1: Top-1 and top-5 accuracy (%) and complexity comparison by changing the network depth.
Table 2: Top-1 and top-5 accuracy (%) and complexity comparison by changing the network width.
Table 3: Top-1 accuracy (%) of ResNet-50 on Places365, ImageNet, and Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 by changing network width.
Table 4: Top-1 accuracy (%) using ResNet with different depth and width. The number of parametersis in million. The numbers within parenthesis are the width scaling factors.
Table 5: Top-1 accuracy (%) using Deep-Narrow Network and Lossless Pooling (LP) module. Thenumber of parameters is in million.
Table 6: Top-1 accuracy (%) on Place365 using different backbones. The number of parameters isin million. Note that We calculate the number of parameters base on 365-Class models (På±±ce365).
