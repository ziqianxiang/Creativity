Table 1: Comparison on fine-grained image classification. We report Top-1 classification ac-curacy (%) on CUB-200-2011 (Wah et al., 2011), Stanford Cars (Krause et al., 2013), and FGVC-Aircraft (Maji et al., 2013). We also compare floating-point operations (FLOPs) with the recentwork using an input image size of 224 Ã— 224. All models are from the official repositories.
Table 2: Comparison on vehicle re-identification. We report Mean Average Precision (Zhenget al., 2015) (%) and rank-1 and rank-5 accuracy in Cumulative Matching Characteristics (%) onVeRi-776 (Liu et al., 2016b;c) and VehicleID (Liu et al., 2016a). We use ResNet-50 as the backbone.
Table 3: Effectiveness analysis of the proposed components. We validate the components in theproposed model including the usage of local view branch (LVB) and the pooling operation in Conv4.
Table 4: Effectiveness of MSGN with different number of LVBs.
