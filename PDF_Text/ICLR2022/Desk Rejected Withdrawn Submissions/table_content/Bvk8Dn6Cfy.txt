Table 1: Quantitative results comparison. Dice similarity indices by state-of-the-art methods. Re-sults were stratified by scanner vendor and heart substructure. There are labeled data from VendorA and B, unlabeled data from Vendor C, and no data from Vendor D. We denote best results asbold. Baseline represents the classical approach training the task network with labeled data only.
