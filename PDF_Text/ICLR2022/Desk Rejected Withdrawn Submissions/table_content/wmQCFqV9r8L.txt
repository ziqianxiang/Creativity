Table 1: Quantitative measure of DR performance by SpaceMAP and other reference methods: Mt ,Mc , Ms and Mσ indicate the trustworthiness, continuity, Shepard goodness and normalized stress,respectively. Mt and Mc are local metrics (left side of the table) while Ms and Mσ are globalmetrics (right side of the table) for the evaluation of the DR performance. Detailed introduction ofthe metrics is in Appendix A.7.
