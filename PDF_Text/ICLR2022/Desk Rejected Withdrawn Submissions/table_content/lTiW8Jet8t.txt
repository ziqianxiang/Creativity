Table 1: Results of semi-supervised and full-supervised node classificationDataset	Best Single Model	Ensemble without ENI	GEENI	Speedup from ENICora (full-supervised)	88.2	88.7	89.6	2.1×Cora (semi- supervised)	83.3	83.7	85.3	2.4 ×CiteSeer (full-supervised)	80.5	81.4	83.5	2.3 ×Citeseer (semi- supervised)	72.7	73.1	75.5	2.6×PUbmed (full-supervised)	91.6	92.0	92.8	2.3 ×Pubmed (semi- supervised)	79.5	80.3	84.1	2.8×Reddit	95.42	95.97	96.72	2.1×models. The variation in speedup across different tasks is caused two factors: the number of nodesisolated by ENI (the less accurate semi-supervised models have greater speedup than full-supervisedmodels since more nodes are isolated), and the connectivity of the isolated nodes (isolation of well-connected nodes provides greater speedup).
