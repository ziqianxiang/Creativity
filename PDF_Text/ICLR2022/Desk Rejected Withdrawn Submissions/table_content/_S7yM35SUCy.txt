Table 1: The AUC for different values of α and β on the AUC of CIFAR-10, averaged over the OODdatasets. Due to space constraints, we only include results for α = β.
Table 2: A posthoc sensitivity analysis of the effect of Beta loss λ on various algorithms’ AUC forCIFAR-10, averaged over the five OOD datasets.
Table 3: Full results of AUC averaged over 5 random splits. A Beta loss (indicated with a β) shows aconsistent improvement over log loss for nearly every dataset with pure classification loss. Theseresults are mainly significant (see the supplement for full standard deviations, TNR at TPR95, andOOD results). The top third of the table is as reported in (Guo et al., 2021), including the emptycells. * denotes our own runs of the experiment.
Table 4: AUC of Mars tasks averaged over 5 trials. Beta loss generally provides a consistentimprovement over the baseline loss functions.
Table 5: Comparing the latent representation of a baseline sigmoid model with a beta-weightedsigmoid model λ = 1 on the cifar10 dataset.
Table 6: Full AUC results on cifarlθ and cifarlOO OOD detection datasets averaged over 5 splits with standard deviations.
Table 7: Full TNR at TPR 95% results on cifarlθ and cifarlOO OOD detection datasets averaged over 5 splits with standard deviations.
Table 8: Full AUC results on OSR tasks averaged over 5 splits with standard deviations.
Table 9: Full TNR at TPR 95% results on OSR tasks averaged over 5 splits with standard deviations.
Table 10: Full accuracy results of our experiments on all OSR datasets the with standard deviations.
