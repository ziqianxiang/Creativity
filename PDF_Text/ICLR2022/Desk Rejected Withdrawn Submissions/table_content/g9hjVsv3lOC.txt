Table 1: Comparision of Different ModelsMODELS	VALIDATION MAE (MEAN ± STD)2D CNN	29.43 ± 1.813D CNN	29.72 ± 1.76Autoencoder with Random Forest	30.16 ± 1.65Autoencoder with XGBoost	29.99 ± 1.91SVM (Bajaj et al., 2020)	29.65 ± 4.75 (approx.)validation, we had performed during training. While the mean provides a good measure of how ac-curately the model predicted the attention score on average, the standard deviation shows the amountof variance in the predicted values over the 12 folds of validation data. A higher variance would typ-ically mean that the trained model is prone to be affected by outliers and have a lesser generalizationability.
