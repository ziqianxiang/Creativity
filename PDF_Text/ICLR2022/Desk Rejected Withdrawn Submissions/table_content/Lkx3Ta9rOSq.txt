Table 1: Mean absolute error for multi-distribution density ratio estimation among five multivariateGaussian distributions. Results are averaged across three random seeds.
Table 2: Results for CIFAR-10 OOD detection, MNIST multi-target generation and multi-distribution off-policy policy evaluation error based on learned density ratios. â†‘ means higher isbetter and J means lower is better. Results of top 3 methods for each task are bold. Results areaveraged across three random seeds.
