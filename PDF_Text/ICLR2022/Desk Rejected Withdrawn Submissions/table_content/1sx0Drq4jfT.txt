Every category in the first sub-training set contains 2500 imagesand every category in the second sub-training set contains the remaining 2500 images. Therefore,there is no overlapping samples between the two sub-training sets, and the two sub-training sets shareonly the label set. We use the first sub-training set to train the source models and the meta-surrogatemodel, and use the second sub-training set to train the target models. Thus the source models andthe meta-surrogate model does not use the training images of the target models. The source modelsare ResNet-10, ResNet-18, ResNet-34, SeResNet-14, SeResNet-26, SeResNet-50, MobileNet-V1,MobileNet-V2 with testing accuracies of 86.8%, 86.7%, 87.2%, 84.2%, 85.4%, 87.7%, 80.7%,and 80.9%, respectively. The target models are MobileNet-V3, ShuffleNet-V1, ShuffleNet-V2,

The source models are ReSNet-10 (ReS-10), ReSNet-18 (ReS-18), ReSNet-34 (Res-34), SeResNet-14 (SE-14), SeResNet-26 (SE-26), SeResNet-50 (Res-18), MobileNet-V1 (MB-V1),and MobileNet-V2 (MB-V2). The target models are MobileNet-V2, ShUffleNet-V1, ShUffleNet-V2,SqueezeNet-A, and SqueezeNet-B.
