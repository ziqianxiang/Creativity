Table 2: Effectiveness and efficiency evaluation in the main setting. VF2 generates exact ground-truth counts, thus with the perfect MAE (0) and Q-error (1). Time refers to the total inference timeon all test triples, in seconds. Except VF2,the best method is bolded and the runner-up is underlined.
Table 3: Effectiveness and efficiency evaluation in the secondary setting. Time refers to the totalinference time on all test triples, in seconds. The better method for each query is bolded.
Table 4: Parameters for the data generation of SMALL and LARGE.
Table 5: Comparison of training time in main setting.
Table 6: Comparison of training time in secondary setting with LRP.
