Table 1: Analysis of the loss functions for trainingMixBlock. L and PL denote ground-truth labels and pseudolabels respectively. K is the number cluster assigned to theclustering algorithm (ODC). The upper part of the tabledemonstrates the analysis for parametric losses, while thelower part is for non-parametric losses.
