Table 1: Results on class-incremental learning. Accuracy and forgetting are reported. All methodsstart from the same pre-trained ViTB/16 model and train on each task for 5 epochs. Methods areseparated based on whether rehearsal is applied. All results are shown in percentage (%) and areaveraged over 3 runs.
Table 2: Results on task-agnostic continuallearning, in terms of test accuracy. We useGaussian scheduled CIFAR-100 as the evalua-tion benchmark. All results are shown in per-centage (%) and are averaged across 3 runs.
Table 3: Results on domain-incremental learn-ing, in terms of test accuracy. We use CORe50as the evaluation benchmark. All results areshown in percentage (%) and are averagedacross 3 runs.
Table 4: Ablation study on 5-datasets. All results are shown in percentage (%).
