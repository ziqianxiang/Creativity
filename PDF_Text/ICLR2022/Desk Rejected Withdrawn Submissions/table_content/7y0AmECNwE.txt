For (3), since the dimensionalities of ΘSEIR and xt are different, xt is first passed to an FFN, theoutput of which has the same dimensionality with ΘSEIR. Results for the three strategies are shown inTable 4. As can be seen, ΘSEIR incorporated only at the first time step significantly underperformsthe strategy that incorporates ΘSEIR at every time step. This is because of the gradient vanishingeffect of recurrent nets: reminding the model of ΘSEIR at each time leads to better performances. Theconcatenation strategy obtains comparable performances to the Hadamard product strategy.
