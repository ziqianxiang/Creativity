Table 1: Comparison of different augmentation approaches (left) and negative samples (right) on AIST++.
Table 2: Comparison with baseline method BLSTM (Liuet al., 2017) on PKU-MMD on mAPa with varying θ.
Table 3: Comparison with baseline methods. Accuracy refers to genre classification accuracy on AIST++ inSection 5.3 with K=100, averaged over 6 trials. mAPa refers to action detection score on PKU-MMD.
