Whereas in the 500-grasp experiment, wedefined q2 over the group C16/C2, we now define q2 over C32/C2, i.e. 16 rotations ranging from 0to π. We also augment each experience with 16 additional transformed images instead of just 8. Weuse the same Boltzmann action sampling parameters as in the 500 grasp experiment. After trainingis complete, the learned policy is frozen and evaluated on both held-out “easy” test set of Figure 8cand the held out “hard” test set of Figure 8d. Figure 7b shows the learning curve from training andTable 2 shows the results on the novel object test sets. The results indicate that our method learns agrasp function that generalizes well to novel objects.

The first goal, maximize the probability of successgrasp is implemented by a0z = max(rec) - dgripper. Where recis the image crop corresponding to the rectangle that the gripperpad will sweep when close in the depth image. The dgripper is thedepth of the gripper pad. The second goal, protecting the gripper, is
