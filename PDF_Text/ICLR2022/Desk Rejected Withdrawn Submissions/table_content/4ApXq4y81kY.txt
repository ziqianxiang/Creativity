Table 1: Comparison of state-of-the-art and related techniques with our Co-variance method. In thefirst column, “small loss”: regarding small-loss samples as “clean” samples; “double networks”:training two networks simultaneously; “cross update”: updating parameters in a cross mannerinstead of a parallel manner; “disagreement”: restricting two networks to diverge during training;“agreement”: restricting two networks to be converged during training.
Table 2: Mean and standard deviations of test accuracy (%) on five balanced noisy datasets withdifferent noise levels. The test accuracy is calculated over the last ten epochs. The results are reportedover five trials. The best mean results are in bold.
