Table 1: Average confidenceMETHOD	AVERAGE CONFIDENCEBasic Training	0.81811Continuous Training 0.80952The average confidence from basic training is higher than the continuous training. It is becausethe model is better to adjust the weight on the data if the training process is executed in a single runwithout any significant additional data, even though the average confidence from continuous trainingis almost the same (Gepperth & Hammer, 2016). There are two false negatives occurrence for thebasic method and two false positives for the continuous ones. For the confidence model assessmentitself, if the model predicts correctly and accordingly, the calculation of the average confidencewould be performed. Contrary when the model prediction is incorrect, the confidence score will beconsidered 0.
