Table 1: Performance results in terms of false negative rate (FNR), false positive rate (FPR), Re-call, Precision and F1-measure of VulDeePecker (VULD), MMD, D2GAN, DIRT-T, DDAN, SC-DAN, Dual-GD-DDAN, Dual-GD-SDDAN and DAM2P methods for predicting vulnerable andnon-vulnerable code functions on the testing set of the target domain (Best performance in bold).
Table 2: Performance results in terms of false negative rate (FNR), false positive rate (FPR), Re-call, Precision and F1-measure of five cases including (i, VulDeePecker), (ii, DDAN), (iii, Kernel-Source), (iv, Kernel-Source-Target), and (v, DAM2P) for predicting vulnerable and non-vulnerablecode functions on the testing set of the target domain (Best performance in bold).
Table 3: Performance results in terms of false negative rate (FNR), false positive rate (FPR), Recall,Precision and F1-measure of DDAN, SCDAN, Dual-GD-DDAN and Dual-GD-SDDAN methodsin two cases of using over-sampling (OS) and without using over-sampling (OS) for predictingvulnerable and non-vulnerable code functions on the testing set of the target domain.
