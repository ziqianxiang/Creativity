Table 1: Table showing the amount of novelty of each data batches collected between each deploymentfor cheetah_run. Novelty is measured as cosine distance between each observation (state) in B(i)versus the previous aggregated batches (B(1).. S B(i-1)), averaged over the number of transitions.
Table 2: Hyper-parameters for MUSBO AlgorithmOther Hyper-parameters We searched α over the set of {0.28, 0.028, 0.0028} and we used thesame α = 0.028 (the temperature parameter for eq.(5)) for all environments. Similarly, for theaction parameterization eq. (16), we used the same constant σ = 0.01 (variance term of const) for allenvironments. The σ of const is searched over the set of {0.01, 0.05, 0.1}.
