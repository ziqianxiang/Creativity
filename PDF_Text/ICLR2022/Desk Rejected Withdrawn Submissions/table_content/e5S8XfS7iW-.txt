Table 1: Semantic alignment of convolutional architectures. We report the number of distinct alignedconcepts and we classify them according to their depth in the reference taxonomy (i.e. leaves or not).
Table 2: Comparison of the results of the circuits retrieval algorithm on the three target models.
Table A.1: Each subtable reports for each measure, as the alignment threshold decreases, the numberof units from the last four hidden layers of AlexNet aligned with an highly specific concept, namelyaqueduct.n.01 which has depth equal to eight, and a more general one, namely food.n.01 withdepth four.
