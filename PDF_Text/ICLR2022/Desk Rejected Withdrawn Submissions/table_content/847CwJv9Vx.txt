Table 1: Standard Re-ID training datasets. Characteristics of the standard Re-ID training datasetsevaluated in this benchmark paper.
Table 2: Single dataset evaluations. Results obtained by training and evaluating Re-ID approacheswith the train and test splits of the same dataset. For each dataset, the best Re-ID approach is inbold.
Table 3: Cross-dataset evaluations. Results obtained by training Re-ID approaches on one datasetand evaluating on another. For each evaluation dataset: the best Re-ID approach for a given datasetis in bold; the best training dataset for a given approach is in blue. R10 means Rank-10.
Table 4: Live Re-ID evaluation. Results obtained by training Re-ID approaches on one standardRe-ID dataset and evaluating on m-PRID for the live Re-ID setting. For each training dataset, thebest approach is in bold and for each approach, the best dataset is in blue.
