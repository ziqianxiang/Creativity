Table 1: Performance when trained from random initialization for fully connected (FC) mod-els and convolutional (conv) models. “Direct” models use direct (explicit) weight representation.
Table 2: Results for training to 2-layer reference network. An embedding dimension of 64 is suffi-cient to match the performance of this network within margin of error, while decreasing the embed-ding dimension degrades the performance. MSE refers to the mean squared deviation of the weightscalculated by neuron embedding from the weights in the reference network. The mean-squaredamplitude of the weights in the reference network is 0.0152.
Table 3: Results for transferring a hidden layer neuron by neuron. 50% crossover refers to transfer of50% of the neurons in the hidden layer from a source network to a target network, without modifyingthe other layers. 100% crossover means that the entire layer has been transferred.
