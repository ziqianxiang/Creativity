Table 1: GNN benchmark results (accuracy)6.1	ICGNN on the public benchmarksWe investigate the predictive performance of input convex reformulation of the famous GNN on thepublic benchmark domains. As the IC reformulations restrict the parameter space, it may harms thepredictive performances of the GNN. However, from our experimental results, the performance dropmay not be severe and, surprisingly, for some cases, the IC reformulation shows better predictiveperformance than original GNNs.
