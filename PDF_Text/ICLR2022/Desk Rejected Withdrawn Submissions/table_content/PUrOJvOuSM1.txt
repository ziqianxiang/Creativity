Table 1: Summary of the anomaly detection results. We have compared the proposed A2B-GAN with existing state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods, ALAD (Zenati et al., 2018b),Ganomaly (Akcay et al., 2018), f-AnoGAN (Schlegl et al., 2019), PatchCore (Roth et al., 2021),and PaDiM (Defard et al., 2021) using AUC metric on 2 medical imaging datasets. The best resultsare shown in bold and the second best results are underlined. PatchCore and PaDiM throw out-of-memory error for Cardiomegaly dataset on our 500GB machine. Therefore, we have run them on asmaller subset of the Cardiomegaly dataset. These results are shown with an asterisk. On average,the proposed A2B-GAN performs better than all the baseline methods.
Table 2: Summary of image-to-image translation results. We have compared the proposed A2B-GAN with existing state-of-the-art image-to-image translation methods. We have used FID score forthe evaluation. Our quantitative results show that the proposed A2B-GAN performs competitivelywith the existing methods even though using only 1 generator and 1 discriminator network.
