First consider a graph property as f : Gn → [0, T), e.g., thenumber of edges, diameter, etc. To approximate it with a GNN, let’s consider the discrepancy of itsquantization to a p-level function:fp(G) ：= P0 iff T (p0 - 1) ≤ f (G) <Tp0,	(18)ppfor any p0 ∈ [p]. If f as a multi-class graph classifier can be approximated by GNNs, then fp can be
