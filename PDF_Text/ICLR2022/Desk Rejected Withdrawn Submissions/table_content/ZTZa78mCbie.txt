Table 1: Our results on synthetic data. We provide the ρ value for 5 different synthetic distributions,on train, test and transfer (i.e., unseen Ys). We also note the normalized distance of ∣∣γ - Y∣∣ where Yis a linear classifier on top of the representation layer attempting to recover γ. We are able to nicelyrecover the Mixture, Sine and Exp distributions, while recovering the cos(x) and log((1 + x2)/2)proves more difficult. The reason is that we fail to recover Y for these functions is that they are even,so there is an ambiguity of whether the sign is positive or negative.
