Table 1: Unsupervised classification results on Im-ageNet. All numbers are reported on the valida-tion set of ImageNet. Comparison methods includeSCAN (Van Gansbeke et al., 2020), SeLa (Asanoet al., 2019), and Self Classifier (Amrani & Bron-stein, 2021).
Table 2: Linear classification results onResNet-50. We show results with andwithout multi-crop training.
Table 3: Linear classification results with the back-bones of wider ResNet-50 and Vision Transformer.
Table 4: Semi-supervised classification results on ImageNet. We report top-1 and top-5 one-cropaccuracies. Detailed settings can be found in Appendix.
Table 5: Transfer learning results on eleven datasets, including linear evaluation and fine-tuneing.
Table 6: Object detection and segmentation results. ^means that We download the pre-trained modelsand conduct the experiments. For the VOC dataset, we run five trials and report the average. Theperformance is measured by Average Precision (AP). DC-v2 denotes the DeepCluster-v2.

Therefore, all three terms are indispensable for Twist.
Table 11: Object detection and instance segmentation results with different architectures. For meth-ods marked with *, We download the pre-trained models and run the detection and segmentation byourselves. We report results both with C4 architecture and FPN architecture. For VOC dataset, werun 5 times and report the average.
