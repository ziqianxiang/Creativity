Thereare two reasons behind this phenomenon. First, CapsGNN and AdaGCCN have more complexstructures than normal GNNs due to the vector-based capsule modules in them, resulting in moremodel parameters generated during training that the GPU can not hold. Second, both CapsGNN andour model set the batch size to 32 on small graphs, which is not appropriate on large ones. If weuse a smaller batch size on D&D and REDDIT, the accuracy results would be affected compared toadopting a larger batch size, and the time costs would be unbearable, e.g., more than 3 GPU days onREDDIT-M12K. Here we provide probable directions in optimizing our work, e.g., designing fine-grained parallelism to improve the utilization of GPU, or refining the rewards evaluation function inthe assistant module to increase the efficiency of the search process.
