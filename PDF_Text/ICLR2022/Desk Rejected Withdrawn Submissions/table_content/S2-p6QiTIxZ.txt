Table 1: Settings for data and acquisition size. Acquisition size denotes the number of initial labeledsamples + query size for each step (the size of pool data) → the number of final labeled samples.
Table 2: The mean ± standard deviation of the performance differences (%) relative to DRAL+for each algorithm and each dataset. The negative value indicates lower performance compared toDRAL+, and the asterisk (*) indicates that the P-Value ls less than 0.05 in one-sample t-test for theperformance differences. DRAL+ consistently and significantly outperforms other algorithms forall datasets, while the performance of the algorithms except DRAL+ vary depending on datasets.
Table 3: Settings for training.
Table 4: The mean of running time (minutes) for aCtive learning are given for all algorithms anddatasets. The value in parentheses is the ratio to Entropy. We observe that DRAL+ operates as fastas Entropy, and that ENS-VarR or BADGE require a large computational load.
