Table 1: Comparison of popular ResNet and ViT models: The difference in model robustness cannot be blindly attributed to the model architectures. It can be caused by different training settings.
Table 2: Fair base models: DeiT and counter-part ResNet are trained with the exact same setting.
Table 3: Fooling Rates (in %) are reported. DeiT is more robust to naturally corrupted patches thanResNet, while it is significantly more vulnerable than ResNet against adversarial patches.
Table 4: Quantitative Evaluation: Each cell lists the percent of patches in which the maximumgradient value inside the patches is also the maximum of whole gradient map. SUM corresponds tothe sum of element values inside patch divided by the sum of values in the whole gradient map. Theaverage over all patches is reported.
Table 5: Transferability of adversarial patch across different patch positions of the the image. Trans-lation X/Y stands for the number of pixels shifted in rows or columns. When they are shifted tocover other patches exactly, adversarial patches transfer well, otherwise not.
Table 6: Study of the training factors on the relation to model robustness: While the input size hasminor impact on model robustness, Weight Standardization (WS) and Group Normalization (GN)can change model robustness significantly.
Table 7: Transferability of adversarial patch across different imagesThe transferbility of adversrial noise between Vision Transformer and ResNet has already exploredin a few works. They show that the transferability between them is remarkablely low. As shown inTab. 8, the adversarial patch noise created on a given image does not transfer to other models.
Table 8: Transferability of adversarial patch across modelsWhen they are transfered to another patch, the adversarial patch noises are still highly effective.
Table 9: Transferability of adversarial patch across patch positionsH Convergence Speed in Each Patch on ResNet50 and DeiT-smallAs shown in Fig. 14, the required attack iterations on DeiT is also less than counter-part ResNet.
Table 10: Adversarial Patch Attack with Imperceptible Perturbation . FRs are reported in percentage.
