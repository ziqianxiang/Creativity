Table 1: When used as the architecture evaluation scheme in random search, FEAR can achieve sameor more top-1 accuracy as shortreg while using ≈ 2.4 times less search duration on CIFAR100and ImageNet16-120. On CIFAR10 it takes ≈ 3.8 times less duration. Each experiment was run 10times with different random seeds. (*shortreg on CIFAR10 had finished 7 runs at the time ofwriting).
Table 2: When used as the architecture evaluation scheme in random search, FEAR can achievesimilar top-1 accuracy as shortreg while being ≈ 1.33 times faster on CIFAR100 and ≈ 1.9 fasteron CIFAR10. On ImageNet16-120 shortreg was slightly better with slightly less time. Eachexperiment was run 10 times with different random seeds.
Table 3: (Left) Spearman’s correlation (‘spe’) comparison between FEAR and the nearest point on thepareto-frontier etched out by shortreg variants with respect to average wall-clock time (s). (Right)Ratio of overlap in bins between rankings of FEAR and nearest pareto-frontier point of shortreg .
Table 4: Zero-Cost measures on Synthetic CIFAR10 achieve low correlation while FEAR still getsreasonable performance. This phenomenon is especially not amenable for data-agnostic measureslike synflow which ignore the dataset completely.
