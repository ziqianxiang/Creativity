Table 1: The experiments on the two datasets with the embedding dimensions of all methods being256. The dimensions of vectors of HIMEN, HIME_4, HIME_8 are 128, 64 and 32 respectively,satisfying the constraint that all methods have 256 dimensions.
Table 2: The experiments on preserving node-label relationships. HIME_k refers to HIME using kbranch vectors. All results are shown in percentage.
