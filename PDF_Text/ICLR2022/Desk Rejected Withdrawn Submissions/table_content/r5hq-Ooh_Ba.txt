Table 1: Accuracy for CIFAR-10, CIFAR100 and SVHN averaged on 5 different folds. Results with* were reported in CoMatch (Li et al., 2020), while results with t are using our own reimplementa-tion. Other results were reported in FixMatch (Sohn et al., 2020). Results with DA are achieved bycombining the distribution alignment technique (Berthelot et al., 2020).
Table 3: Accuracy on STL-10 averaged on 5pre-defined folds with ResNet-18 backbone.
Table 2: Accuracy on CIFAR-10 with largeramounts of labels and CNN-13 backbone.
Table 4: Accuracy of MutexMatch on a single 1-label split of CIFAR-10 with different randomseeds. Results are ordered by accuracy.
Table 5: Accuracy on CIFAR-10 with noisy labels averaged on 5 different folds. All experimentswere based on 40 labeled data with varying radio of noisy labels.
