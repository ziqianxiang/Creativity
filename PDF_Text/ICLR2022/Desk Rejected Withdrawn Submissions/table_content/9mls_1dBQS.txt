Table 1: We report the mean and standard deviation of rewards across a range of OpenAI Gymlocomotion tasks. Values are rounded, and empty cells indicate no reported data. All results that fallwithin the 5th percentile lower confidence bound of the highest mean result are marked in bold.
Table 2: We compare the performance of our method with and without the joint action. Combiningindividual t-tests with Fisher’s method, we cannot conclude that the use of separate actions producessignificant improvement at the α = 5% level. Details in Appendix B.
Table 3: Performance over different reducing functions on various environments.
Table 4: Performance over different unrolling horizons on HalfCheetah-v2. H = 3 is reportedin the main results. H = 0 (not shown here) would be equivalent to MBPO without MVE.
