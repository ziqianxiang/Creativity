Table 1: Top-1 accuracy under linear classification and KNN 20 under K nearest neighbour classification onImageNet With ResNet-50 as backbone.t: The result is reported by Caron et al. (2021).
Table 2: Semi-supervised learning on ImageNet. We report top-1 and top-5 accuracy on the ImageNetvalidation set of self-supervised models that are finetuned on 1% or 10% of labeled data. The accuracy is themean of 5 independent runs. f: The result is produced by Us with the released pre-trained model under the samesetting.
Table 3: Transfer learning performance (%) on COCO detection and COCO instance segmentation.
Table 4: Ablation study. We ablate the components in SVIB: the re-initialization operation, IB andthe hyper-parameter Î². Models are run for 100 epochs with ViT-S/16. We report the kNN 20 result.
