The issue is how pre-trained model gets thenon-robust features during the pre-training phase. So this section investigates the feature preferenceof pre-trained model and the factors influencing the preference. A simple hypothesis: when the modelcapacity is too limited or the source task is too difficult, the pre-trained model itself tends to relymore on non-robust features and represents more risk to affect the robustness of fine-tuned models.
