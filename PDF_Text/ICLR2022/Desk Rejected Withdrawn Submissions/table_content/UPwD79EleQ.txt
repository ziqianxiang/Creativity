Table 1: Performance comparison of the previous methods with the proposed method on ImageNetand ImageNet-C. Fourth column indicates averaging for integrating the predictions from multipleaugmentations. Fifth column shows the performance with the EWM. Single TTA method refers tothe previous method by Kim et al. (2020). Cyclic refers to our method. It is bold when either cyclicmethod or EWM method shows performance improvement of 0.2% or more.
Table 2: Performance using hypothetically perfect loss predictor named Oracle-TTA. Resnet-50trained with the augmix data augmentation method was used as the target network. “Iteration" refersto the number of loss prediction done to each image. Clean and mCE refers to the error rate fromImageNet dataset and the mean corruption rate from ImageNet-C dataset. The lower values representbetter performance. The correlation between the “Iteration" and the performance indicates that, uponselecting suitable transformation, more opportunities for transformation allows the input image to bebetter ready for the target network, which increases the upper bound of the general performance.
