Table 1: Accuracy on whole test set. Accuracy (in %) evaluated on biased + unbiased test samples fordifferent bias ratios. Best performance are marked in bold.
Table 2: Results on unbiased test samples. Accuracy (in %) evaluated only on the unbiased samples fordifferent bias ratios. Best performance are marked in bold.
Table 3: Ablation analysis on the augmentation strategies. We report the accuracy resulting from differentaugmentation strategies and no augmentation, by varying the bias ratio. Our strategy results the winner over allthe other mixing policies.
