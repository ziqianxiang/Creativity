Table 1: Costs of the 6-input neuron (with activation quantized to binary digit) implementation withsix 32-bit float point addition VS 6-input LUT in terms of energy, latency, and area.
Table 2: Comparison BLUnet with traditional computation on different models.
Table 3: Comparison between the BLUnet and the state-of-the-art work. A negative value for â€˜Acc.
Table 4: Comparison between a prototype of BLUnet and other low energy classifiers on real hard-ware in terms of accuracy, energy per image, and images per second.
