Table 1: Validation accuracy and poison success for a baseline model, models trained with mixupand CutMix augmentations compared with Spectral Signature (Tran et al., 2018a) and ActivationClustering (Chen et al., 2018) defenses. The first two columns have 10% of one class poisoned, andthe latter two have all poisoned (filter defenses are inapplicable here). The results are averaged across20 runs.
Table 2: Poison success rates (lower is better forthe defender) for various data augmentations testedagainst the gradient matching attack of Geipinget al. (2020). All results are averaged over 20 trials.
Table 3: Poison success rates (lower is better forthe defender) for competing defenses when testedagainst the gradient matching attack compared tomixup. For DP-SGD, we consider a noise level ofn = 0.01. All results are averaged over 20 trials.
Table 4: Success rate for selected data augmen-tation when tested against the gradient matchingattack on the ImageNet dataset. All results areaveraged over 10 trials.
Table 5: On the left: poison success rate for Poison Frogs (Shafahi et al., 2018) and Convex Polytope(Zhu et al., 2019) attacks when tested with baseline settings and when tested with mixup and CutMix.
