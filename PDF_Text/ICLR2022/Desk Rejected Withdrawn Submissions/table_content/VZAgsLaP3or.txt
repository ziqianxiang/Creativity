We first report the average attack success rates (%) of our HIT w/Circle w.r.t tile-scheme in Tab. 4. From the result, we can observe that our HIT is also effective forattacking other datasets. Notably, our HIT can fool DCL with about 90% success rate on StanfordCars dataset. Besides, a relatively smaller tile-size is also helpful in improving the success rate ofthe attack, which is consistent with the conjecture given in Sec. 3.2.

Table 7: The top-5 label IDs that appear in classification results (range from 0 to 999) after HITattack (tile-size is 50 × 50, proto-pattern is concentric circle). The top row is victim’s models,ratio (%) represents the proportion of a specific prediction label to the total number of misclassifiedadversarial examples.
