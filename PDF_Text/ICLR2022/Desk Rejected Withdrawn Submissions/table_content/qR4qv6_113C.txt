Table 2: CIFAR-10 mean accuracy and std. error over 10 seeds, with J = 2 and multiple trainingsample sizes. Learnable scattering with TF initialization improves performance for all architectures,while randomly initialized scattering requires more training data to reach similar performance.
Table 3: COVIDx CRX-2 and KTH-TIPS2 mean accuracy & std. error with J = 4 over 10 seedsand 16 seeds respectively. (COVIDx CRX-2) TF-initialized learnable scattering network performsbetter than models that do not incorporate scattering priors. (KTH-TIPS2) Similarly, the WRN-16-8and ResNet-50 perform extremely poorly relative to hybrid models trained on KTH-TIPS2.

Table 5: Description of WRN hybrid architecture used for the experiments. Each conv layer repre-sents a 2D Convolution followed by a batch normalization and a ReLU non-linearity.
Table 6: CIFAR-10 mean accuracy and std. error over 10 seeds with J = 2 and multiple train-ing sample sizes. The table compares the effect of augmenting the training set with pre-specifiedautoaugment. When the scattering network is followed by a WRN, then using autoaugment is nec-essary to obtain better performance.
