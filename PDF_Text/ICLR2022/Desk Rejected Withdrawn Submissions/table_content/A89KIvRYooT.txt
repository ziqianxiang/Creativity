Table 1: Performance on the COCO novel classes. FoxInst (det.) + GrabCut (seg.) represents thebaseline model that replaces the mask branch of FoxInst to GrabCut.
Table 2: Performance on both base and novel COCO classes. In this setting, fine-tuning and querysets are sampled from both base and novel COCO classes while base training is the same as before.
Table 3: Performance on the COCO novel classes for Novel-only setting. In the Novel-only setting,the query set contains 3,992 images that have at least one novel object among the total 5,000 COCOquery images.
Table 4: One-shot performance on the COCO2VOC novel classes. COCO2VOC is a cross-datasetusing the COCO as base training and fine-tuning set, and VOC as query set.
Table 5: Ablation study of FoxInst according to fine-tuning components. The components of FoxInstare classifier, box regressor, controller, and backbone and mask branch.
Table 6: Initialization comparison of class-agnostic prediction heads. Class-agnostic predictionheads include the centerness, bounding box regression, and controller heads. Warm-start parametersare obtained from the base trained model.
Table 7: Performance of FoxInst and the GrabCut baseline on the VOC2VOC novel classes.
