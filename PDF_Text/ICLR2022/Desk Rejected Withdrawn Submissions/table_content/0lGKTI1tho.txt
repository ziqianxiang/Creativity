Table 1: V : number of state variables, σ: activation functions, M : number of hidden layers, n:number of neurons in each hidden layer. For each approach (POLAR, ReachNN*, Sherlock, Verisig2.0), we give the runtime in seconds if it successfully verifies the property. ‘Unknown’: the propertycould not be verified. ’-': the approach cannot be applied due to the type of σ.
