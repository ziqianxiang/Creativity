Table 1: Accuracy on the subset selected for our ex-periments correlates with the 2AFC score computedon the ComPIete BAPPS VaIidation dataset.
Table 2: FGSM, PGD, and One-pixel attack results. Larger allows more perturbations, and lowerRMSE relates to higher imperceptibility.
Table 3: Transferable adversarial attacks on perceptual similarity metrics. The adversarial exam-ples were generated by attacking LPIPS(AlexNet) via FlowAdv. In total, there are 1061 samples.
Table 4: Comparing samples where the rank by metric was the same as assigned by humans versussamples where it was not.
Table 5: Comparing PSNR of adversarial images generated via FGSM versus PGD. For adversarialimages generated via FGSM, is < 0.05. Higher PSNR of PGD examples shows that adversarialperturbations are less perCeptible. Furthermore, we also Confirmed this through visual Comparison.
