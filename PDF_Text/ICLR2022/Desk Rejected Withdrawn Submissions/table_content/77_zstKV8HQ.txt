Table 1: CIFAR-10 top-1 linear evaluation test accuracy. All experiments use ResNet-18. * reportedin SimSiam. * reported in MoCo's original code repository.
Table 2: Mini-ImageNet top-1 linear evaluation test accuracy. All experiments use ResNet-50. *use original implementation. * uses implementation provided by Pytorch-Lightning.
Table 3: Mini-ImageNet 40 shot semi-supervised top-1 test accuracy. All experiments use ResNet-18. * are reported in Label Propagation. t are reported in their own original publications.
Table 4: Ablation study on CIFAR-10. All experiments use ResNet-18. We study the effect of αH,αR, number of views K, and batch size B. The first row serves as the basis for comparison, andshaded areas indicate changes of hyperparameters.
Table 5: Ablation study on the effect of different variants of LR conducted on CIFAR-10. Allexperiments use ResNet-18. By default, we use LR2, the nuclear norm, as LR. The index in thesubscript of loss weight αR indicates which variation the weight is acting on.
