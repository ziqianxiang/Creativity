Table 1: Proxy evaluation of representation learning using denoising as the downstream task.
Table 2: Proxy evaluation of representation learn-ing using SR and JDenSR as the downstream taskon the Stanford dataset.
Table 3: Standard SL (left) and RCL pre-training with SL fine-tuning (right), evaluated with denois-ing on the VOC dataset. # Labels denotes the number of labeled data available for SL.
Table 4: Proxy evaluation of representation learning using JDD, JDemSR, and JDDSR as the down-stream tasks on Stanford data.
Table 5: Label-efficient learning on real noisydata, evaluated with denoising on the SIDDdataset. SL (left) denotes SL with trained withthe full labeled training set. RCL + SL (right) de-notes RCL pre-training with full unlabeled train-ing set with SL fine-tuning with only 30% of la-beled data.
