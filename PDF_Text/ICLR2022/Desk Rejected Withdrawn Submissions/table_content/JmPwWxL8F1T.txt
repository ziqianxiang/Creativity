It is also interesting to note, thatwhile VON still enjoys one order of magnitude better sample efficiency in the beginning, gMOREis able to catch up during optimization. We believe that for the highly multi-modal planar robotexperiments, exploration is a bottleneck, where the improved sample efficiency from second-orderinformation is not helpful. For the approximately unimodal breast cancer and German credit exper-iments, all components of the GMM are highly overlapping, and hence, can make use of each otherssamples; the better sample efficiency for optimizing a single component, might therefore diminish.

The Becker-bound Jo,Becker(q(x|o)) is more convenient to implement, and theadditional term inside the KL, log q(x∣o) can be easily integrated into the natural gradient updatesof MORE, VOGN, VON and GM, since it relates to an additional Gaussian prior for which theexpected Hessian and gradient can be computed in closed form. Indeed, the only affect on ourMORE implementation is that the Lagrangian multiplier η is lower-bounded by 1 rather than 0, andthat we use ω = 0 instead of ω = 1. Please note, that both formulations yield the same naturalgradient update, except for negligible numerical errors.

The offsets are given in Table 4.
