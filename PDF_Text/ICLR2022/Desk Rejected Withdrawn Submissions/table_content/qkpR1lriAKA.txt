Table 1: Comparing VCN to previous state-of-the-art few-shot approaches on FSC147 dataset,including few-shot detectorsFan et al. (2020); Kang et al. (2019) and few-shot counting methods Ran-jan et al. (2021); Lu et al. (2018); Finn et al. (2017). Note that both FamNet and VCN* use the testtime adaptation strategy proposed by Ranjan et al. (2021). VCN does not use any test time adaptation.
Table 2: Comparing Vicinal Counting Nets with pre-trained object detectors, on FSC147-Val-COCO and FSC147-Test-COCO splits of FSC147 which contain images from COCO classes. VCNoutperforms all the object detectors and FamNet Ranjan et al. (2021) on the COCO classes.
Table 3: Comparing different augmentation strategies on the Val set of FSC147. For fair com-parison, we do not use test time adaptation for any of the methods. VCN outperforms the otherstrategies on both MAE and RMSE metrics.
