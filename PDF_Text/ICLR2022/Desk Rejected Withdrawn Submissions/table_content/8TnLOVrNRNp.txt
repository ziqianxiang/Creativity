Table 1: Performance on standard benchmarks of semantic matching. Higher PCK is better. Allresults except for ours are from (Min & Cho, 2021). Numbers in bold indicate the best performance,followed by the underlined numbers.
Table 2: Ablation results on augmentation and positional embedding.æµ† denotes small subsetof SPair-71k. The results show that using data augmentation and rotary positional embedding givesthe best results. Also, the trend of results from the small subset of SPair-71k is consistent in thestandard SPair-71k dataset.
Table 3: Ablation results on transformer architecture. M denotes small subset of SPair-71k.
