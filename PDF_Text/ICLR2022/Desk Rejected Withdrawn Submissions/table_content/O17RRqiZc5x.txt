Table 1: The table shows the performance of various structured pruning methods when trained on theImageNet dataset. aα in AN-50-Small denotes the mask matrix as defined in Eqn. 2.
Table 2: AN compared to various state-of-the-art KD methods on CIFAR-10. All AN-X-Smallmodels refers to models with α =2.
Table 3: aα denote the masking matrix (definedin Eqn. 2). Detailed results can be found in thesupplementary .
