Table 2: Downstream task results of BERT, V&L pretrained models and our ObjectGroundedBERT(OGBERT) on BERT-base architectures. MRPC and QQP results are F1 score, STS-B resultsare Pearson correlation, SQuAD v1.1 and SQuAD v2.0 results are exact matching and F1 scorerespectively. The ∆base and ∆voken column show the difference between our model and the baselines.
Table 3: Downstream task results of our method with different dimension of grounding embedding.
Table 4: Downstream task results of our ObjectGroundedBERT without training the Text-groundingModule. The first three rows report the fine-tuned results of our model without training with thevisual grounded datasets, the last three rows show the difference to the results reported in Table 3.
