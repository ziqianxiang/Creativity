Table 5: High-precision detection experiment under different regression loss. ‘R’, ‘F’ and ‘G’ in-dicate random rotation, flipping, and graying, respectiVely. The resolution of HRSC2016, MSRA-TD500 and ICDAR2015 are 500 × 500, 800 × 1, 000 and 800 × 1, 000.
Table 6: Accuracy (%) comparison on DOTA.t and + represents the large aspect ratio object and thesquare-like object, respectively. The bold red and blue indicate the top two performances. Doc andDle denotes OpenCV Definition (θ ∈ [-90°, 0°)) and Long Edge Definition (θ ∈ [-90°, 90°)) ofRBox. ‘H’ and ‘R’ denotes the horizontal and rotating anchors, respectively.
Table 7: AP of different objects on DOTA-v1.0. R-101 denotes ResNet-101 (likewise for R-50, R-152). RX-101 and H-104 denotes ResNeXt101 (Xie et al., 2017) and Hourglass-104 (Newell et al.,2016). MS indicates using multi-scale training/testing. Red and blue: top two performances.
