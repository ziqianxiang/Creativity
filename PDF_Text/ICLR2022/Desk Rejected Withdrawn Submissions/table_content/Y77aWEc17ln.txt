Table 1: Dataset statistics. We summarize the number of shape pairs of the Geometric Shape Assembly dataset.
Table 2: Experimental results of geometric shape assembly. R and T denote Rotation and Translation,respectively. Lower is better on all metrics. It is worth noting that many methods can get reasonably close inposition, but be completely off in orientation as demonstrated by the RMSE error in rotation. NSM outperformsthe best baseline in predicting the correct orientation by upto 5Ã—.
Table 3: Generalization: Unseen categories geometric shape assembly. The training set contains shape pairsfrom the bag and box categories. The test set contains shape pairs from the jar category. Results reported are onsolid objects. Results on shell/hollow objects are available in the appendix (Table 6).
Table 4: Generalization: Unseen cut types geometric shape assembly. The training set contains the planar,sine, square and pulse cut types. The test set contains the parabolic cut type. Results reported are on solid objects.
Table 5: Ablation study on Neural Shape Mating model design choices. Testing performance with each lossremoved. The training and test sets remain the same as in the main experiment (as presented in Table 2).
Table 6: Generalization: Unseen categories geometric shape assembly. The training set contains shape pairsfrom the bag and box categories. The test set contains shape pairs from the jar category.
Table 7: Generalization: Unseen cut types geometric shape assembly. The training set contains the planar,sine, square and pulse cut types. The test set contains the parabolic cut type.
