Therefore, the batch size B may affectmodel performance, we now investigate it. We use FATPP-MIX with 2-head attention, dimensionof hidden state d is set to 32, encoder layer is set to 1, training epoch T is set to 50, number of SGDsteps M is set to 5, q(π) update rate η is set to 0.01, minimum cluster size e is set to 5NK = 800,weights for prior a° is set to KK, Adam with learning rate 0.005 is used for SGD optimization, wepre-train each RMTPP for 5 epochs on the whole dataset. We then set B to [64, 128, 256, 512] andevaluate the CP and ARI, result is shown in Table 9, CP and ARI curves during training are shownin Fig 10.
