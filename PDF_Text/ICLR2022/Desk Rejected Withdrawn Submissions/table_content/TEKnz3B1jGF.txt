Table 2: Pereira Dataset StatisticsB Do multi-modal Transformers perform better encodingCOMPARED TO INTERMEDIATE LAYER REPRESENTATIONS FROMpretrained CNNs ?We present the 2V2 accuracy and Pearson correlation for models trained with representations ex-tracted from the last layer of multi-modal Transformers and all the lower to higher-level repre-sentations from pretrained CNNs on the two datasets: BOLD5000 and Pereira in Figs. 9 and 10,respectively.
