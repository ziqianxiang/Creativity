We study the problem of controllable text generation (CTG): steering a language
model (LM) to generate text with a desired attribute. Many existing approaches
either require extensive training/fine-tuning of the LM for each single attribute
under control or are slow to generate text. To this end, we first propose a frame-
work based on step-wise energy-based models (EBMs) that is efficient in sam-
pling and flexible in a wide range of practical CTG scenarios. Indeed, a number
of existing CTG methods are special instances of our framework with a specific
EBM design. In different control scenarios, we then design the respective energy
functions that strategically up- or down-weigh the probabilities of keywords as-
sociated with a certain control attribute at each generation step. In experiments,
we show that our simple and efficient approach is surprisingly competitive against
more computationally expensive strong baselines, and even achieving new state-
of-the-art performances in several cases. Our framework also provides a tuning
hyper-parameter that nicely trades off generation quality and control satisfaction,
enabling practitioners to easily adjust it to meet their needs.
1	Introduction
Large language models (LMs) pre-trained on web-scale data have now become an integral part of
many natural language processing (NLP) applications. However, most pre-trained LMs can only
perform generic generation that is unconstrained: after users provide the LM a piece of text as the
input prompt, they have little control over the generative process (Holtzman et al., 2020). In many
real-world cases, users may wish to impose some constraints or controls that guide the LMs towards
generating texts of their specified attributes on the fly. Interesting applications include poetry gener-
ation with specific rhythms and topics (Wang et al., 2016), story generation with a pre-specified story
line (Peng et al., 2018), and product review generation with a particular sentiment (Zang & Wan,
2017). Moreover, the ability to impose certain controls over the text generation process is critical for
the safe and responsible deployment of LMs in practice. For example, prior research has shown that
LMs may resemble or even amplify human biases (Sheng et al., 2019; Bordia & Bowman, 2019)
and that LMs can be easily triggered to generated toxic content (Bender et al., 2021; Gehman et al.,
2020). Both biased and toxic generated text should be avoided in most practical use cases.
In this paper, we focus on the problem of controllable text generation (CTG) that underlies the
above applications. Given one or more desired, user-specified control attribute(s), such as “pos-
itive sentiment” and “science topic”, we would like to steer an LM to generate text that satisfies
the control attribute(s). As an example, Table 1 illustrates the CTG problem with various control
attributes. Recently, a number of papers have proposed different methods to tackle this problem but
they suffer from many practical issues. For example, some of these methods either require extensive
training/fine-tuning for each CTG scenario (Khalifa et al., 2021; Bakhtin et al., 2021; Bhattacharyya
et al., 2021) or are computationally expensive during generation (Liu et al., 2021; Dathathri et al.,
2020; Shirish Keskar et al., 2019). Some methods (Ross et al., 2021; Liang et al., 2021; Ghazvinine-
jad et al., 2017) are only applicable to one or two selected CTG tasks. Our goal in this paper is
to develop a CTG method that is more efficient in sampling and more applicable to various CTG
scenarios than the previous methods, without sacrificing the overall performance.
We propose a framework based on a step-wise energy-based model (EBM) for CTG. Our framework
leverages the fact that modern LMs generate texts in an auto-regressive manner: they generate one
word (token) at a time based on the previously generated words (tokens). We thus formulate the

CTG problem as steering the word distribution at each generation step via a specially designed
energy function. Our framework is general: we show that many existing CTG approaches are in
fact special instances of our framework. Under our framework, we also develop a generic form of
energy functions that can be applied to a wide range of CTG tasks. Intuitively, the energy function
imposes a control of the generated text by adjusting the weights of keywords associated with the
desired attribute at each generation step.
Via a range of experiments, we show the wide applicability of our CTG method by instantiating it for
five commonly studied CTG tasks including i) word control, ii) topic control, iii) sentiment control,
iv) text detoxification, and v) compositions of multiple controls. Our method is highly effective:
on tasks iii) and iv), our method achieves competitive results compared to strong baselines. On
tasks i), ii), and v), our method establishes new state-of-the-art CTG performances. Our method
is also highly computationally efficient: it requires no training/fine-tuning, uses up to 18× fewer
parameters, and is up to 100× faster than the baselines. We summarize our contributions as follows.
[C1] We propose a new CTG framework based on the step-wise EBM that weights the sampling
distribution at each generation step through the energy function. Our framework unifies a number of
prior approaches and enables developing new ones via specific energy function designs (Section 2.2).
[C2] We develop a generic form of an energy function for our framework. Our energy function is
simple but powerful and flexible, which can be instantiated in different ways in a wide range of CTG
scenarios with infinitesimal computational overhead (Section 2.3).
[C3] We validate the effectiveness of our method on five CTG tasks. Extensive experiments show
that our method achieves highly competitive performance, often outperforming strong baselines, and
is the most efficient method among all baselines (Section 3).
2	Method
In this section, we describe our approach in detail. We first review language models and motivate
our approach with the sequence-level formulation of the CTG problem. We then introduce our step-
wise EBM framework and propose an efficient and flexible form of energy function for a variety of
CTG tasks. We close this section by reviewing related literature and, in particular, showing how our
framework unifies a number of prior CTG methods.
2.1	Preliminaries
Language models (LMs). Let x ∈ V be a word token, i.e., the smallest element we consider
in modeling language, from a pre-specified token set V that we denote as the “vocabulary”. Let
x = {x1, . . . xT} ∈ X be a sequence of T tokens representing a piece of text, where X denotes the
set of all such texts. An LM pθ then defines a probability mass function on X . In this paper, we
work with auto-regressive LMs, namely,
T
Pθ(x) = ɪɪpθ(Xt|xi：t-i), where xi：t-i = {xι,...,xt-ι}.	(1)
t=1
In particular, We denote xi：o = 0 such that pθ (xi|xi：o) := p(xi). Note that the dominant LMs, such
as GPTs (Radford et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020) and Recurrent Neural Networks (Mikolov et al.,
2010; 2011), are formulated in this way.

Sequence-level EBM for CTG. The CTG problem can be formulated as learning a joint distribu-
tion pθ(x, c) of the text x and the control attribute c, which we define as
Pθ(x, C) = Pθ(x)pθ(c|x) H Pθ(x)e-Eθ(c1x) ,	(2)
where pθ(x) is the base LM (such as GPT) and pθ(c|x) is a conditional distribution of attribute
given a sequence x, modeled with the conditional energy function Eg(c|x). Intuitively, low energies
indicate more control satisfaction; thus, this model steers the baseLMpθ(x) towards generating text
samples x with low energies.
The formulation in Eq. 2 is known as the joint energy-based model (EBM), which has been widely
explored in the vision domain (Grathwohl et al., 2020; Che et al., 2020). More recently, Khalifa
et al. (2021) adopted this joint EBM formalism for a sequence-level sampling of texts and proved
that Eq. 2 is the optimal solution to CTG as a constraint optimization problem. We thus term their
formulation as the sequence-level EBM. Notably, Eq. 2 also enables easy compositionality. If we
have multiple attributes {ci,…,cn} to control and if We assume conditional independence of the
their respective energy functions Eg (ci |x), then We can simply compute the resulting joint distribu-
tion by the summation of energies PN=I Eg (ci|x) in the exponential term via
N
Pθ(x,ci,...,cn ) = Pθ (x) Y Pθ (Ci |x) H Pθ (x)e-PL Eθ (ci |x) .	⑶

2.2	From Sequence-level EBM to Step-Wise EBM
Despite its appealing properties, such as theoretical optimality and compositionality, sequence-level
EBM suffers from computational inefficiency that hinders its practical usage. Indeed, sampling from
the joint distribution pg (x, C) poses a significant challenge because of the huge sampling space with
dT possible sequences where d and T denote the vocabulary size and sequence length. It becomes
more challenging to generate longer sequences with exponentially large sampling time.
We now introduce our step-wise weighting approach to approximate the expensive sampling step
in the sequence-level EBM. Our approach leverages the nature of auto-regressive LM pg (x) that
enables efficient sampling xt at each time step t while satisfying the attribute constraint. To see this,
we first decompose pg (x, C) as
T
pg(x, C) = p(C)	pg(xt|C, x1:t-1) ,
t=1
where, using Bayes’ Rule, each term inside the product on the right-hand side becomes
Pθ(Xt|c,xi：t-1)= 1 Pθ(Xt,c|xi：t-1),
Z
(4)
(5)
where Z := pg (C|x1:t-1) is a constant due to the independence assumption which states that the
previously generated text x1:t-1 and the control attribute C are independent at each step t during
generation, i.e., pg(C|x1:t-1) = p(C). Leveraging this assumption and plugging Eq. 5 into Eq. 4, we
have
T1
Pθ(X, C) = P(C) [ɪ zPθ(Xt, c|xi：t-i)
t=1
1T	T
=ZT-1 I [ɪ Pθ(xt, c|xi：t-i) I H ɪɪ Pθ(xt, c|xi：t-i).
(6)
t=1
t=1
Here, we also assume that ZT -1 is a constant. This is true due to the constant time assumption,
which states that T stays the same for all generation tasks. Following Eq. 2, we can similarly
decompose and represent pg (xt, C|x1:t-1) on the right-hand side in Eq. 6 in an energy function form

We denote Pθ(xt, c∣∙) as th step-wise joint EBM and Eq. 7 is the step-wise joint EBM approach to
CTG. The key difference between 2 and 7 is that instead of building a joint EBM with the entire
sequence, our joint EBM is formulated in each time step. This formulation enables very efficient
sampling: instead of sampling an entire sequence x to satisfy the control c, which is slow, we now
sample xt at each time step, which is easy because the step-wise joint EBM can be normalized and
computed exactly:
Pθ(xt,c∣∙) = ɪPθ(xt,c∣∙),	where Z = X Pθ(xt,c∣∙),
Zθ	xt∈V
(8)
where Zθ = 52xt∈v Pθ(xt, c∣∙) can be computed by enumerating all possible xt, which is a finite
set. Having an normalized energy function also removes the need to perform sampling via Langevin
Dynamics (Welling & Teh, 2011) which tend to be slow and unstable. To further improve compu-
tational efficiency, we can approximate Zθ in Eq. 8 by using only the top K xt ’s with the highest
probabilities, an idea similar to top-k sampling (Fan et al., 2018; Radford et al., 2019):
Pθ(xt,c∣∙) = ɪPθ(xt,c∣∙) for Xt ∈ Sk ：= x Xt|argmax Pq(x(k),c∣∙)
Zk	k=1:K
(9)
where Zk = Σxt∈Sk pθ(Xt, c|)
Remarks. The independence and constant time assumptions enable us to approximate the computa-
tionally expensive sequence-level EBM methods in Eq. 2 as our efficient step-wise EBM framework
in Eq. 7. The trade-off we have made here is that our step-wise EBM framework models a strictly
smaller class of functions and is therefore less expressive than sequence-level EBM methods. In par-
ticular, the independence assumption is a strong assumption, requiring Pθ(c∣χLt-ι) = Z ∀t. The
constant time assumption is milder and more natural: while allowing varying T enables more gener-
ation flexibility, we observe that 1) many previous works on CTG perform and evaluate generation
using a fixed T (Khalifa et al., 2021; Ziegler et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2021; Dathathri et al., 2020)
and 2) in practice, different generation lengths can be achieved simply by selecting a portion of the
length T generation for shorter texts or concatenating multiple generations of length T for longer
texts. However, empirically, we observe that various methods under our step-wise EBM framework,
including a number of existing CTG approaches, perform surprisingly well, with performance ri-
valing sequence-level EBM methods while saving long hours of training/fine-tuning required for
sequence-level EBM methods. We thus argue that, despite our strong assumptions, our step-wise
EBM framework is an efficient and effective approximation to sequence-level EBMs. Further anal-
ysis on the small performance gap between the two is left for future work.
Generality of our framework. We have now obtained a step-wise EBM framework for CTG. Our
framework simplifies the CTG problem into crafting suitable energy functions Eq (c|xi：t) and offers
significant flexibility in developing new CTG methods in the form of new energy function forms.
Indeed, through the lens of energy functions, our framework is highly general and unifies many ex-
isting step-wise CTG methods by viewing them as specific energy function designs. For example,
we can recover the control method in Dathathri et al. (2020) by implementing our energy function as
an latent classifier that takes the LM’s hidden states as input and running the approximated Langevin
dynamics on the resulting step-wise EBM. We can recover the methods proposed in Krause et al.
(2020) and Liu et al. (2021) by taking our energy function as an attribute classifier computed by two
other attribute conditional LMs. We can also recover the method proposed in Yang & Klein (2021)
by instantiating the energy function as a weighted combination of multiple attribute classifiers. De-
tailed derivations and the recovery ofafew other methods (Xu et al., 2021; Lin & Riedl, 2021) under
our framework are available in Supplementary Material A. We additionally include more extensive
review of related literature in Supplementary Material B.
2.3	Our Energy Function Design
We exploit the idea of “control with keywords” that strategically uses the selected keywords (tokens)
to steer generation towards the desired attribute. Prior research (Ribeiro et al., 2016; Wallace et al.,
2018; 2019; Wiegreffe & Pinter, 2019; Kumar et al., 2021) has shown that certain words carry
important attribute-sensitive information; their presence or absence in the generated text can thus
indicate the text’s attribute. In fact, Li et al. (2018) and Lu et al. (2021) have successfully applied
this “control with keywords” idea for the text style transfer and lexical control tasks, respectively.
These prior works provide strong empirical support for the adaption of this idea to CTG.

Suppose each attribute c is associated with a unique set of Kc keywords Vc, i.e., card(Vc) = Kc.
We then define a generic form of our energy function in Eq. 7
E(c\xi：t) = λtψc(x±t) + γtψc(xι∙.t)	(10)
where λt and γt are the weighting parameters for the desired and undesired attributes, respectively.
Also, ψc and ψc are indicator functions for the desired and undesired attributes, respectively. In-
tuitively, our energy function simply re-weighs probabilities of the keywords associated with the
desired and undesired attribute. This simple generic form enables a highly flexible design of spe-
Cific energy functions because We can easily adjust the parameters λt, γt, ψo and ψδ to suit different
CTG scenarios. Furthermore, in contrast to existing step-wise CTG approaches (Dathathri et al.,
2020; Krause et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021; Lin & Riedl, 2021; Yang & Klein, 2021; Xu et al., 2021),
our method requires no attribute classifiers or conditional LMs that increase the computational over-
head, sometimes significantly. This enables our method to be significantly more efficient than the
above methods. BeloW, We instantiate Eq. 10 for a number of practical CTG tasks.
For word and topic control, We use the folloWing configurations:
λt = -tλ, ψc(χ±t) = l{χt ∈ Vc}∙ l{Vc ∩ Xi：t-1 = 0} , Yt = 0,	ψc(χtt) = 0 .	(11)
Note that Kc = 1 in the Word control scenario. Intuitively, We up-Weigh the probability of Words in
Vc ifit has not yet appeared in the previously generated tokens x1:t-1. The energy function increases
linearly in t, such that We up-Weigh Words in Vc more toWards the completion of the generation if
none of keyWords still has not appeared. The hyper-parameter λ controls the aggressiveness of the
control: the higher the value, the more aggressive We up-Weigh the sampling of keyWords.
For sentiment control, We use the folloWing configurations:
λt = -λ ∀ t, ψc(xrt) = l{xt ∈ VJ , γt = ∞ ∀ t, ψc(xrt) = l{xt ∈ Vε} .	(12)
Intuitively, We up-Weigh the keyWords of the desired sentiment With the constant λ and avoid the
keywords of the undesired sentiment. To construct Vc and Vδ, we first predict each word,s sentiment
and pre-compute its sentiment probability With an external sentiment classifier. We then choose
two thresholds Tc and Tc for the desired and undesired sentiment, respectively, and include words
above each threshold into either Vc or Vδ. These hyper-parameters λ,τc,τc together control the
aggressiveness of satisfying the desired sentiment.
For detoxification, we denote c as the toxic attribute and use the following configurations:
λt = 0 ∀ t, ψc(χ±t) = 0, Yt = ∞ ∀ t, ψc(χι∙∙t) = l{χt ∈Vc}.	(13)
Intuitively, this configuration avoids words that are toxic. Similar to sentiment control, we construct
VC by pre-computing each word,s toxicity with an external toxicity classifier and then selecting
words above a preset toxicity score threshold TC into Vδ.
For composition of multiple controls, i.e., imposing multiple controls simultaneously, we extend
the compositionality property in Eq. 3 and construct the following energy function:
N
E(c1, . . . , cN \x1:t) =	Ei(ci\x1:t) ,	(14)
i=1
which enables a simple summation of multiple energy functions Ei(ci\xi：t) for i = 1,…，N such
as those instantiated above. Note that each energy function Ei(ci\x1:t) in 14 may correspond to a
separate control scenario, i.e., a composition of topic control and sentiment control.
3	Experiments
We now present extensive evaluation results to validate our proposed method, covering a variety of
control scenarios: i) single word control, ii) topic control, iii) sentiment control, iv) detoxification,
and v) composition of multiple controls. The overall theme of the experiments is threefold. First, our
method achieves competitive (sometimes superior) performance on each evaluation metric compared
to baselines (Sections 3.1 and 3.2). Second, our method nicely trades off control satisfaction and
generation quality, which can be easily user-adjusted by changing the hyper-parameter in the energy
functions (Sections 3.1 — 3.4). Third, our method uses (sometimes significantly) less computational
resources compared to baselines (Section 3.5). Supplementary Materials C and D contain additional
results including qualitative evaluations, analyses, and other control settings.

satisfaction, i.e., how early the control word appears in the generated text and whether it appears at all. Right:
how λ influences and language quality, i.e., perplexity. In general, we observe a trade-off between control
satisfaction and language quality.
Baselines and setup. We consider three categories of baselines. The first category, including RE-
INFORCE (WiniamS, 1992), REINFORCElx (Khalifa et al., 2021), PPO (Ziegler et al., 2019),
and GDC (Khalifa et al., 2021), performs control under the sequence-level EBM framework by
fine-tuning an LM through reinforcement learning techniques. The second category, including
CTRL (Shirish Keskar et al., 2019) and DAPT (Gururangan et al., 2020), adopts the “prompt engi-
neering” approach (Liu et al., 2021) and fine-tunes an LM using pre-specified prompts as the control
signal. The third category, including PPLM (Dathathri et al., 2020), GeDi (Krause et al., 2020),
FUDGE (Yang & Klein, 2021), PnB (Lin & Riedl, 2021), and DExperts (Liu et al., 2021), per-
forms step-wise control under the guidance of attribute classifiers during generation. Throughout
the experiments, whenever possible, we use a small GPT-2 as the base LM, use the same top-k
sampling where k = 10, and disable n-gram penalty (Paulus et al., 2018; Klein et al., 2017) for
all methods. Note that not all baselines are suitable for all five control scenarios and we thus use a
subset of baselines in each control scenario. More details are available in Supplementary Material C.
Metrics. We consider three types of metrics to evaluate i) control satisfaction, ii) language qual-
ity, iii) generation diversity. For control satisfaction, we use the accuracy metric. Specifically, in
single word and topic controls, accuracy denotes the percentage of generated samples that contain
the control word and any of the keywords associated with a topic, respectively. In sentiment con-
trol, accuracy is the percentage of sentiment predictions, computed by external sentiment (Wolf
et al., 2020), that matches with the desired control sentiment. In detoxification, accuracy is the av-
eraged probabilities of toxicity of the generated samples, computed using an external toxicity clas-
sifiers (Perspective, 2021). For language quality, we use the average perplexity over all generated
samples, computed using a pre-trained small GPT-2. For generation diversity, we use the distinct-N
metric (Li et al., 2016) with N ∈ {1, 2, 3}, which computes the total number of distinct N -grams
in each generated text, scaled by the total number of tokens and averaged over all generations. We
additionally perform human evaluations to evaluate on control satisfaction and language quality
for the sentiment control and detoxification experiments where the control is subtle and automatic
evaluations may be insufficient. We defer the detailed setup to Supplementary Material C.3.
3.1	Single Word and Topic Controls
In word control, we follow Khalifa et al. (2021) and choose nine control words with varying rar-
ity levels, including “US”, “China”, “Canada”, “restaurant”, “Paris”, “Vampire”, “Wikileaks”, and

Figure 2: Analysis of how the hyper-parameters λ, Tc, Tc in Eq. 12 influence control satisfaction and language
quality for positive (left plot) and negative (right plot) sentiments. Larger λ, Tc and lower Tc generally result
in better control satisfaction but worse language quality.
“amusing”. We list the above control words in the order from the most common to the rarest. In
topic control, we follow Dathathri et al. (2020) and use nine topics including “science”, “fantasy”,
“space”, “politics”, “military”, “religion”, “computers”, “kitchen”, and “legal”. We use the same
topic keywords as in (Dathathri et al., 2020). Each method generates 100 samples of40 tokens from
the empty prompt “|<endoftext>|”, totalling 900 generations for each control setting.
Results. Table 2 reports the evaluation results averaged over all 900 generations for each method
in word control and topic control, respectively. In terms of control satisfaction, we see that only
REINFORCE and our method fully satisfy the control requirement. However, REINFORCE tends to
produce degenerate samples consisting of only the control word, as evidenced by its high perplexity
and low dist-N scores. In terms of language quality and diversity, our method generates samples
of quality on par with the best performing baselines. Some baselines including PPLM and FUDGE
achieve high language quality and diversity but fail to satisfy the control attribute. These results show
that our method can generate high-quality samples and satisfy the desired control simultaneously
whereas most baselines cannot.
Analysis of hyper-parameters. We perform an empirical analysis to better understand how the
hyper-parameter λ in Eq. 11 impacts generated samples. Recall that λ controls the aggressiveness
of the control so we would expect that λ impacts i) how early the control word first appears in the
generation and ii) the language quality of the generation. By varying λ from 0.1 to 10, we plot
in Figure 1 the averaged first index of the control word in the generated samples and the averaged
perplexity of the generated samples. Overall, we observe a trade-off between control satisfaction
and language quality: the more aggressive (larger λ) we wish to impose the control, the earlier the
control word appears in the generation, and the worse the language quality. When λ is small, the
perplexity approaches that of GPT-2 but the word may not even appear in the generation, indicating a
failure to satisfy the control. Another observation is that for more frequent words, we need a smaller
λ to achieve high control satisfaction and language quality at the same time. These insights provide
a useful guideline for adjusting λ to achieve the desired trade-off in different word control scenarios.
We include similar analyses for topic controls in Supplementary Material D.
3.2	Sentiment Control
We follow Khalifa et al. (2021) and generate texts with two sentiments, i.e., positive and negative,
from six prompts including “The horse”, “The pizza”, “The lake”, “The chicken”, “The potato”,

and the empty prompt. Each method generates 100 samples of 40 tokens from one of the above six
prompts, totalling 600 generations for each sentiment.
Results. Table 3 reports evaluation results averaged over all 600 generations for each method.
Our method achieves highly competitive results, with the second best control satisfaction and the
third highest language quality for both positive and negative sentiment controls. Some baselines
(Dexperts, DAPT, GeDi, CTRL) are able to achieve better language quality by using more resources
than our method during generation. For example, CTRL and DAPT use a base LM (GPT-2 Large)
with 6.6 times the parameters than the one we use (GPT-2 small). GeDi and Dexperts and GeDi use
additional conditional generative LMs that are even larger than the base LM. The generated samples
of our method also have a decent diversity given that we do not use any extra resources other than the
base LM and pre-constructed sentiment keywords. Human evaluations also suggest that our method
achieves competitive performance in terms of sentiment satisfaction and fluency.
Analysis of hyper-parameters. We perform an empirical analysis to better understand the effects
of various hyper-paremters (λ, Tc, Tc) in Eq. 12 on the trade-off between control satisfaction and
language quality. Figure 2 demonstrates this trade-off with varying λ,Tc,τ values for both positive
and negative sentiments. We find that, the more aggressive we set these hyper-parameters, i.e.,
higher λ, TC and lower τ^δ, the better control satisfaction but worse language quality. This observation
confirms our intuition: more aggressive values of these hyper-parameters increase the chance that
the words indicative of the desired sentiment appear in the generated text but may also result in their
repetitive appearance. In the extreme case, the generation may completely neglect other words that
have no desired sentiment, leading to worse language quality and diversity. In practice, λ, Tc, Tc
serve as knobs that enables practitioners to tune the trade-off to suit different applications.
3.3	Detoxification
We generate 10 samples from 100 toxic prompts in the RealToxicPrompt dataset (Gehman et al.,
2020) for each method and show the detodification results in Table 4. Our approach achieves the
second lowest text toxicity, third best perplexity, and competitive diversity scores. The method GeDi
that achieves the lowest text toxicity score has a rather high perplexity, indicating unsatisfactory
language quality. In general, our approach best balances the effective detoxification and high-quality
language generation. We additionally test our method’s ability in detoxification for OpenAI’s GPT-
3 model “ada”, and achieves better performance compared to DExperts-guided GPT-3. Human
evaluations further corroborate the above observations, where our method achieves third lowest
toxicity and third best fluency as determined by human evaluators when using GPT-2 as base LM
and comparable performance with DExperts when using GPT-3 as base LM. Finally, we evaluate the
generated samples with 100 nontoxic prompts and the results resemble the observations in Table 4.
We also analyze the effect of the hyper-parameter Tcc and observe that, while higher value correlates
with more text toxicity, it does not significantly impact perplexity. This observation suggests that
removing toxic words does not impair language quality and that our keyword-based energy function
is highly effective in the detoxification task. Results on nontoxic prompts and hyper-parameter
analysis are in Supplementary Material D.
3.4	Compositions of Multiple Controls

topics and positive sentiment, and ii) two topics and negative sentiment. For each of the three

settings, we consider three sets of two topics that have no overlapping topic keywords, including
{space, military}, {politics, religion}, and {fantasy, computers}. Each method generates 500 sam-
ples of 60 tokens from the empty prompt for each set of topics, totalling 1500 generations for each
setting. Table 5 reports the results, averaged over all 1500 generations for each compositional control
setting. Our method better satisfies both topic and sentiment controls simultaneously and achieves
competitive or superior generation quality and diversity compared to baselines. In contrast, the base-
lines either do not satisfactorily fulfill all controls (PnB, GDC) or suffer from language quality and
diversity (PPLM). Therefore, our method achieves the best balance of good control satisfaction and
high language quality and diversity, an observation that corroborates earlier empirical results.
3.5	Computational Efficiency
Finally, we demonstrate the superior computational efficiency of our approach to supplement its out-
standing CTG capability. We compute the model size (number of parameters), training/fine-tuning
time (hours), and generation speed (in seconds per token) as the efficiency metrics. In Table 6, we
compare our approach with the top performing baselines. We can see that our approach requires no
training/fine-tuning, uses the least number of model parameters, and generates text the fastest among
all baselines. This is especially significant considering the strong baselines we compare with can
hardly maintain both the good CTG performance and high computational efficiency. For example,
GDC also nicely balances all metrics for most of the CTG experiments but requires 100+ hours of
fine-tuning. CTRL often achieves higher language diversity but use 10x more model parameters
than ours. DExperts achieves slightly better performance in the sentiment control experiment but
requires 20x more model parameters and are 8x slower in generation than ours. All the above evalu-
ation results suggest that our approach is highly appealing as an efficient and effective plug-and-play
method for a wide range of practical CTG scenarios.
4	Conclusions
In this work, we have studied the problem of CTG and proposed a step-wise EBM framework for
tackling this problem. Our general framework not only unifies a number of existing CTG approaches
but also inspires an efficient, effective, and flexible energy function design based on keywords asso-
ciated with a specific control attribute. We have demonstrated the wide applicability of our proposed
control approach on a five different CTG tasks. Our approach consistently achieves competitive
performance, provides an tunable hyper-parameter to easily adjust the trade-off between control
satisfaction and language quality, and adds an infinitesimal amount of computational overhead.
Our work suggests that a range of practical CTG tasks can be tackled with methods as simple and
efficient as ours. However, for CTG tasks with more nuanced constraints, the “control with key-
words” intuition that underlies our energy function design could fail. A future research avenue is to
investigate more elaborate energy function designs that will enable more complex CTG tasks, such
as text style transfer (Han & Lundin, 2021) and text rewriting (Coenen et al., 2021).

A How our Step-wise EBM framework Unifies Some Prior Works
In this section, we derive in detail how some prior works are special instances of our step-wise
EBM framework. We reminder the reader that, throughout our paper, We use pθ(∙) to denote proper
probability distribution and P§(∙) to denote unnormalized distribution.
A. 1 Relation to Dathathri et al. (2020)
To obtain the sampling method in Dathathri et al. (2020), we need to make a few approximations
and invoke the reparametrization trick. Let ot = g(Ht-1, xt-1) where g is the language model that
defines pθ(x), Ht-1 is the history (key, value) pairs at t, and ot is used to compute the multinomial
distribution parameter from which xt is sampled:
Xt 〜Softmax(W>ot) = f (θt)	(15)
Further, let et be the unique embedding associated with xt where et = E>xt and E is the
embedding matrix. So we can also write pθ (x) as pθ (et).
First, we approximate the hard sampling xt (or et) from a multinomial distribution parametrized by
ot as a soft sampling, i.e.,
et ≈ Eτ f (θt) = E> f (g(Ht-i,et-i)) = ETg(Ht-i, et-i) = ^t.	(16)
Next, we define the prior distribution over H as deterministic, i.e., p(H = Ht) = 1 and therefore
log p(H = Ht ) = 0. Third, we define the energy function as follows as:
Eθ(c|xi：t)：= λEθ(c|xi：t-i,xt,xt+i) = λEθ(c|oi：t—i,ot,ot+i),	(17)
which depends on the current generation and 1-step soft rollout. The rollout ot+1 is also computed
by using the soft sampling approximation in Eq. 16. Finally, we invoke the reparametrization trick,
which states that sampling Xt from the distribution defined by P(xt, c∣∙) is the same as first “sam-
pling” H- and then compute ^t by Eq. 16. Therefore, we have the joint EBM of H- and C
as
P(Ht-1,c)
e-λEθ (c|o1:t-1 ,ot ,ot+1 )
(18)
where ot = g(Ht-ι,et-ι) and ot+ι = Eτg(Ht,^t). Let Eθ = logp(c∣Ht-ι) be a classifier,
we recover the update rule on Ht-1 in Dathathri et al. (2020) by running a Langevin Dynamics
(LD) on Ht-1 with the initial Ht-1 computed using the previous history Ht-2 and previous token
embedding et-2 . Thus we see that the per-time-step sampling by updating the history proposed
in Dathathri et al. (2020) corresponds to “latent”-space LD under our step-wise EBM framework
with a few approximations.
The method proposed in Xu et al. (2021) takes the same idea of gradient-based steering and
extends (Dathathri et al., 2020); the method therein can be similarly derived as above.
A.2 Relation to Krause et al. (2020)
Krause et al. (2020) models CTG as a joint distribution defined as follows:
P(xt,c∣∙) = Pθ(xt∣∙)p(c∣x±t-ι,xt)ω ,
where ω is a weight hyper-parameter and p(c|X1:t-1, Xt) is an attribute classifier computed by Bayes
Rule using two pre-trained attribute-conditional LMs:
p(c) Qtj=1p(Xj|X1:j,c)
p(c|xi:t) = -------J-----------------.
'Pc P(C)Qj=Ip(Xj |xi：j ,c)
This method corresponds to our framework with the following energy function:
Eθ(c|xi：t-i) = -ωlogp(c|xi：t-i,xt).

A.3 Relation to Lin & Riedl (2021)
Lin & Riedl (2021) extends Krause et al. (2020) to enable compositions of N controls, with the joint
distribution defined as follows:
N
P(xt, Cl,...,CN ∣∙) = Pθ (Xt ∣∙) Upi(ci∣XLt-1,Xt)ωi .
i=1
This method corresponds to our framework with the following energy function
N
Eθ (ci,..., CN |xi：t-i) = E -ωilog Pi(Ci|xi：t-i,xt).
b=1
and the remaining sampling step follows from the derivation in Section A.2.
A.4 Relation to Yang & Klein (2021)
Yang & Klein (2021) proposes a control method similar to (Krause et al., 2020) by dictating the
attribute classifier to depend on past and future generation instead of only on past generation. The
method is defined as the joint distribution as follows:
P(χt,c∣∙):= pθ(xt|・)p(c|xi：t+s),
where s is the number of future time steps beyond the current time step t. This method corresponds
to our framework with the following energy function:
Eθ(c|xi：t-i)：= -ωlogp(clxi：t+s),
where the right hand side includes additional tokens generated for s future steps.
A.5 Relation to Liu et al. (2021)
Instead of modeling the joint distribution of text and attribute, the method in Liu et al. (2021) directly
augments a pre-trained base LM with a weight computed by two attribute-conditional LMs that steer
the base LM towards the desired attribute and away from the undesired attribute, respectively. The
method is define as follows:
P(Xt|xi：t-1)= Pθ(XtII (P-(XtI)),
'Pθ (x"∙"
whereP(xt∣∙) andP-(Xt∣∙) are attribute-conditional LMs for the desired and undesired attributes,
respectively, and ω is a weighting hyper-parameter. This method corresponds to our framework with
the following energy function:
Eθ(c|Xi：t-i)：= -ω(logp+(c\Xi：t+s) + logp-(c∣XLt+s)),
B	Other Related Prior Work
Our framework takes inspiration from prior methods that attempt to directly sample from the joint
EBM in Eq. 2. For example, Khalifa et al. (2021) propose to learn another LM π(X) to approximate
the joint distribution Pθ (X, C) such that we can directly sample from π(X). Other works (Bakhtin
et al., 2021; Bhattacharyya et al., 2021) use the so-called self-normalized sampling, which proceeds
by first sampling a set of samples from pθ(x), and then resample (rerank) using pθ(c|x). Kumar
et al. (2021) propose to sample text by a running a continuous optimization that resembles the
Langevin dynamics (Welling & Teh, 2011). Another line of works focus on fine-tuning LMs for
CTG. Shirish Keskar et al. (2019) fine-tune a conditional LM using a variety of control keywords
as the prompt. Chan et al. (2021) extend Shirish Keskar et al. (2019) to enable using phrases as
the control prompt. Chan et al. (2021) propose a latent space generative model with an encoder-
decoder framework. Cao & Wang (2021) fine-tune an LM for style-controlled summarization gen-
eration. Ross et al. (2021) train a T5 model (Raffel et al., 2020) on a custom corpus for a given task.

These methods require either extensive training/fine-tuning for each single attribute or expensive
sampling procedure, making them less useful in practice for flexible, efficient, plug-and-play CTG
use cases. For example, GDC (Khalifa et al., 2021) takes more than 100 hours to train on Quadro
RTX 8000 GPUs. In contrast, our method requires no training/fine-tuning.
There also exist a number of methods that only focus on a specialized CTG scenario. For exam-
ple, Ross et al. (2021) study text rewritting, and Ghazvininejad et al. (2017) specialize in poetry
generation. Notably, Liang et al. (2021) focus on understanding and mitigating the biases in LMs.
Liu et al. (2021) fine-tune pre-trained LMs for emotion-controlled text generation. Different from
the above methods that are either only applicable to or evaluated on the limited CTG use cases, our
approach is flexible for a wide range of commonly studied CTG problems.
C	Experiment Details
In this section, we include additional experiment details.
C.1 Configurations of Our Method
For the single word control and topic control experiments, we set λ = 1 for experiments in Table 2.
For analysis, we vary the hyper-parameter from 0.1 to 10, with steps of 0.1 from 0.1 to 1 and steps of
1 from 1 to 10. For clarity of presentation, we report results of selected values in Figure 1 because the
conclusion remains unchanged. For the sentiment control experiment, for positive sentiment, we set
λ = 15,τc = 0.995, Tc = 0.001. For negative sentiment, We set λ = 10,2=0.999,τf5 = 0.001.
For the detoxification experiment, for both toxic and non-toxic prompts, we use Tc = 0.1, i.e.,
We avoid all tokens above toxic probability of 0.1, as predicted by the perspectiveAPI. For the
composition of controls experiment, we use λ = 5 for topic control and λ = 10, TC = 0.999, Tc =
0.001 for both positive and negative sentiment controls.
Choosing keywords. Here, we clarify how we choose keywords for each control attribute under
consideration in this work. For topic control, we use the same keyword lists associated with each
topic as in (Dathathri et al., 2020). For sentiment control, building the keyword list proceeds as
follows. First, we select an external classifier, which in our case is the Huggingface sentiment clas-
sification pipeline (Wolf et al., 2020). Second, we select a threshold for positive and negative sen-
timent, respectively. The selected thresholds are discussed in the paragraph above. Third, we loop
through each word/token in the base LM’s vocabulary. If the word/token falls within the threshold
for positive (negative) sentiment, we add it to the keyword list associated with positive (negative)
sentiment. For detoxification, the procedure is almost identical to sentiment control, except that
here, we use the toxicity classifier from Perspective AI (Perspective, 2021).

C.2 Configurations of Baseline Methods
We largely follow the configurations from the official implementations of the respective baselines.
Below, we detail the setup for each baseline in each experiments. Unless otherwise stated, the base
language model is a small (12-layer) GPT-2.
GDC, REINFORCE, REINFORCE_Px, and PPO. We use the implementations1 and ConfigU-
rations of Khalifa et al. (2021), specifically, Table 5 in Section F in their Appendix. Note that some
configurations provided in the code repository2 do not match with the ones suggested in the paper;
in those cases, we try our best to change and match the configurations that appear in their paper.
GDC is used in all experiments while the other three baselines are used in all but the composition of
multiple control experiments.
PPLM. We use the official implementation of Dathathri et al. (2020) and the suggested configura-
tions therein.3 PPLM is used in all experiments. In particular, for the single word and topic control
experiments, we use the following configurations:
--length 40 --gamma 1.5 --num_iterations 3 --num_samples 100 --stepsize 0.03
--window_length 5 --kl_scale 0.01 --gm_scale 0.95 --sample --colorama
For the sentiment control experiment, We set class,label= 2 for positive sentiment and 3 for
negative sentiment, along with the following configurations:
--length 40 --gamma 1.0 --num_iterations 10 --num_samples 100
--stepsize 0.04 --kl_scale 0.01 --gm_scale 0.95 --sample
For the composition of multiple controls experiment, We use the folloWing configurations:
--length 60 --gamma 1.5 --num_iterations 5 --num_samples 500
--stepsize 0.03 --kl_scale 0.01 --gm_scale 0.95 --colorama --sample
For the sentiment control experiment, PPLM requires a larger GPT-2 (24 layers) as the base language
model to be compatible With the sentiment model they used Which is a 24-layer GPT-2 in PPLM.
For all other experiment, We use the same small GPT-2 (12 layers) as the base language model in
PPLM to be consistent With other methods under comparison.
Fudge. We use the implementation and the configurations of Yang & Klein (2021).4 We change
the condition-lambda hyper-parameter from the default value 1 to 4 as suggested in the
README in their code repository. We folloWing the experiment settings in Yang & Klein (2021)
and use Fudge in the single Word and topic control experiments in our paper.
GeDi. We use the implementation of Krause et al. (2020) With the default configuration in the code
repository.5 FolloWing the experiment settings in Krause et al. (2020), We use GeDi in the sentiment
control experiment in our paper.
Plug-and-blend. We use the implementation of Lin & Riedl (2021) With the default configuration.
This method extends GeDi to enable control over multiple topics. We have attempted to adapt this
method for multiple topics and sentiment controls but it generates the same samples regardless of
the sentiment. We have also attempted contacting the authors and Will add the topic-and-sentiment
control results once We hear back from the authors’ suggestions. For noW, We use Plug-and-blend
in the composition of multiple controls experiment in Which the controls are combinations of topics
Without sentiment.
Dexperts, CTRL, and DAPT. We use the implementation of Liu et al. (2021) for Dexperts and
their adapted implementations of CTRL and DAPT Which unifies the configuration,6 making it con-
venient to run and reproduce results. For CTRL and DAPT, We use the default configurations. For

Figure A1: Analysis of how the hyper-parameters λ in Eq. 12 influences control satisfaction (Left plot) and
language quality (right plot). We see that λ controls how early a keyword in the topic keywords list appears in
the generated text but does not impair language quality.
Dexperts, we use the example configuration provided in the README in their code repository. Fol-
lowing the experiment settings in the respective papers of these methods, we use all three baselines in
the sentiment control experiment and additionally use CTRL in the topic control experiment. Except
for CTRL which only provides the largest GPT-2 (48 layers) pre-trained model, we use the small
GPT-2 for Dexperts and DAPT. Note also that CTRL requires a special “control code” prepended
at the beginning of any prompt as a way to impose control during generation. The control codes
required to achieve topic and sentiment control are summarized in Table S7 in Section S7.1 in the
Appendix of Dathathri et al. (2020). Because only five out of nine topics we used are compatible
with the CTRL setting, we only evaluate CTRL on the subset of these five topics in the topic control
experiment.
C.3 Human Evaluation Settings
We perform human evaluation via Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk).7 for the sentiment controlled
generation and detoxification experiment. The evaluation proceeds as follows. First, we select
highly competitive baselines from all methods based on their performance on automatic evaluation
metrics in addition to our method. For sentiment controlled generation, we select GeDi, DAPT,
PPLM, CTRL, PPO, GDC and DExperts. For detoxification, we select PPLM, GDC, DExperts,
GeDi, DAPT, and PPO. We randomly sample 100 generations from each method for each controlled
setting, which include positive sentiment, negative sentiment, and detoxification. Thus, in total,
for sentiment controlled generation, we evaluate 100 × 8 × 2 = 1600 generated samples and for
detoxification, we evaluate 100 × 7 = 700 generated samples. Second, we determine our evaluation
criteria. For sentiment controlled generation, we ask human evaluators to rate on sentiment on a
scale from 0-4 ranging from “very negative”，“negative”，“neutral”，“positive”，and “very positive”
and on fluency on a scale from 0-2 ranging from “not fluent”，“somewhat fluent”，and “fluent”. For
detoxification， we ask human evaluators to rate on toxicity of the continuation generated by each
method without considering the prompt on a scale from 1 - 3 ranging from “non-toxic”， “toxic” and
“very toxic” and on fluency with the same setting as in the sentiment controlled generation. Third，
for each generated sample， we ask three different evaluators to provide their ratings on our evaluation
criteria， leading to a total of (1600 + 700) × 3 = 6300 individual ratings. We only invite highly
skilled evaluators to perform our evaluation. These workers are “master workers” on MTurk，8， have
cumulatively completed at least 1000 evaluation tasks on MTurk， and have at least 95% evaluation
acceptance rate. Finally， we collect all results and compute the average scores.
D Additional Experiment Results

titative evaluation results for each control word and each control topic.

Figure A2: Analysis of how the hyper-parameter λ impacts reducing toxicity and maintaining lan-
guage quality in the detoxification experiment, for both toxic prompts (left plot) and non-toxic
prompts (right plot). We see that, for various λ's we investigated, our method achieves better
trade-off between toxicity and perplexity compared to four strong baselines.
Hyper-parameter analysis for the topic control experiments. We show in Figure A1 how the
hyper-parameter λ impacts topic control satisfaction and generated texts’ language quality. Here,
we say the generated text satisfies the control when any word in keywords list associated with the
desired topic appears in the generated text. We observe that, for a more aggressive λ, i.e., when
λ is larger, we achieve better control satisfaction because a topic keyword appears earlier in the
generated text. For most of the λ values we investigate, the generated texts satisfy the topic control
for most of the control topics. We also see that λ almost has not impact on language quality. We
hypothesize that because each topic contains a sizable number of keywords, there is a high chance
some of these keywords are among the top predictions at each generation step in our base LM. Thus,
increasing the chance of sampling these words that are already among the base LM’s top predictions
will not significantly impact the perplexity scores. Future work will investigate using a combination
of keywords, instead of just one, to enforce topic control.
Detoxification results from non-toxic prompts. We show the quantitative evaluation results on
generated texts from non-toxic prompts, comparing our method with several baselines. Table A2
presents the results. Overall, these results align with those in Table 4: our method achieves compet-
itive performance in each metric and nicely balances a low toxicity score and high language quality
and diversity.
Hyper-parameter analysis for the detoxification experiments. We analyze how the hyper-
parameter λ trades off reducing toxicity and maintaining language quality. Figure A2 plots toxi-
city against perplexity for nine values of λ and compare them to four strong baselines. We can see
that, for both toxic and non-toxic prompts, the different λ values achieve better toxicity-perplexity
trade-off compared to strong baselines.
Qualitative Results. In Tables A5 - A15, we show a number of generated samples from our method
and selected strong baselines for various CTG scenarios.
