Figure 1: (a) Cross-entropy loss applied over a Softmax activation. To turn easier its reference in text,the name “Softmax loss” is used. (b) Triplet loss optimization schema. The same network is appliedto all instances.
Figure 2: (a) Genuine and Impostor distributions. The Euclidean Distance is used to calculate thedissimilarity between two pairs. If the Euclidean Distance calculated is greater than a criterion, then,the individual is rejected, otherwise, it is accepted. (b) Process of construction of a Histogram basedon images dissimilarities.
Figure 3: D-loss optimization schema.
Figure 4:	Architectures used during experiments.
Figure 5:	Distribution scores before (a) and after (b) training the model with D-loss on MNISTdataset. More distance between the mean of the curves implies better inter-class discrimination andthe reduction in the width of the genuine distribution curve implies intra-class improvement.
