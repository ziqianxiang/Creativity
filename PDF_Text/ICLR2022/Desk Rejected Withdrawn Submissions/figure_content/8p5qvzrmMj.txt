Figure 1: An overview of CoWA. During the evaluation, we compute JMDS scores for all fea-tures. Then, during training, we leverage the JMDS scores with SCE loss, weight mixup, and dataaugmentation to update the model M .
Figure 2: (a) An example of the limitations of Maxprob and Entropy scores. Red indicates a highconfidence, blue means low-confidence, and green means the same confidence. MINGAP showsbetter reliability in this case. (b) An example of the weakness of the Cosine score. Based on thecosine distance, (xc1 , xc2 ) has the same confidence-level with (xc1 , xc2 ). However, (xc1 , xc2 ) ismore confident when the data structure is considered.
