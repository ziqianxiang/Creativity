Figure 1: Illustration of the proposed method and related works. The points with dotted lines are not necessaryin the training process and are only shown for illustration. We further show in Section 4 that even We haveno information about the value of confidence scores, we can still conduct consistent SC-Conf classificationonly with the class with the maximum class-posterior probability: y0 = argmaXy∈γsp(y∣x). We also show inSection 5 that it is possible to learn from a subset of all the classes.
