Figure 1: FedMorph procedures applied on three fully connected layers. The server maintainednetwork weights and masks are backward updated according to the knowledge distilled from t roundaggregated network. The network for the (t + 1) round is morphed from the server maintainednetwork by the soft masks. The intra-layers are constrained by the masks to keep the layer coherentwith the activation dimensions. The color of yellow and green means the corresponding values aremasked and unmasked.
