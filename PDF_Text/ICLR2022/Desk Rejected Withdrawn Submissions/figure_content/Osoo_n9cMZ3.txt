Figure 1: The motivation of our proposed ContrastiveCrop. (a) and (c) are generated by typicalRandomCrop, while (b) and (d) are crops from our method. We address the false positive problem(object v.s. background) shown in (a) by localizing the object and restricting the crop center withinthe bounding box (the black dashed box) in (b). Moreover, we enlarge the variance of crops in (d)by keeping them away from the center, which avoids the close appearance as shown in (c).
Figure 2: The training dynamic of localization is shown from left to right in each subfigure. Weinitialize the localization box as the whole image, and update it at a regular interval using the latestheatmap. Note that our goal is not to derive precise localization, but to guide generation of crops byfinding the object of interest.
Figure 3: Visualization of RandomCrop, RandomCrop + Semantic-aware Localization and ourContrastiveCrop. We ShoW the sampling distributions and operable regions for three settings onthe left, and correspondent sampled pairs on the right. Pairs made by RandomCrop include sev-eral false positives that totally miss the object (marked in yelloW box). Using RandomCrop WithSemantic-aware Localization reduces false positives, but introduces easy positive pairs that sharelarge similarity. Last, our ContrastiveCrop could reduce false positive pairs While increasing vari-ance at the same time.
Figure 4: The relation between richnessof semantics and variance of crops. Bothscores are statistical results from supervis-edly trained ResNet-50 with large number oftrials. Our ContrastiveCrop conveys moresemantic information than RandomCrop atthe same level of variance, and yields largervariance with equal semantic information.

Figure 6: Ablation results on IN-200 w.r.t. k and α. Subfigure (a) compares RandomCrop +Semantic-aware Localization (blue plot) with the RandomCrop baseline (black plot). In subfig-ure (b), we fix the best k = 0.1 for localization (blue plot) and compare it with ContrastiveCrop tostudy the influence of different α.
