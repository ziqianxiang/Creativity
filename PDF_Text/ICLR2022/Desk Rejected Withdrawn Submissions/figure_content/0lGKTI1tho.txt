Figure 2: Executions over 4 control steps.
Figure 3: Exact dependency between the initial set and the control input range for a control step.
Figure 4: A running example: the numbers in blueare weights, and the numbers in red are biases.
Figure 5: Comparison between reachable sets of the 6-dimensional attitude control benchmarkproduced by POLAR (green) and Verisig 2.0 (gray). The red curves are simulated trajectories.
