Figure 1: (a) Overview of Predictive Consistent Representations. A view of observation o0t (ot) isencoded into a representation zt0 (zt) in the online branch in green (target branch in orange and red).
Figure 2: Learning of PCR, as well as two other SOTA methods (DrQ (Yarats et al., 2020) andCURL (Laskin et al., 2020a)). The results is averaged cross five different training seeds.The solidline and shaded regions represent the mean and standard deviation, respectively, across five runs.
Figure 5: Comparison of Loss between contrastive PCR and Predictive PCR. The y-axis shows thelog-loss for a fair comparison. The solid line and shaded regions represent the mean and standarddeviation, respectively, across five runs.
