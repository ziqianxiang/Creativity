Figure 1: Schematic RL workflow highlighting the interaction of Actor and Critic in our 3D-MolGNNRL model. The agent starts building the molecule from a scaffold (state SÂ°) andsubsequently builds the molecule by choosing an atom based on the reward assigned by the criticfor that intermediate state.
Figure 2: Comparison of generated compounds before and after optimization by 3D-MolGNNRLand PM-GNNRL . The unoptimized molecules were generated using the respective agents for eachmethod over the same data but without involvement of the critic.
Figure 3: Comparison of the properties of the molecules produced from 3D-MolGNNRL and PM-GNNRL models against the experimentally identified active compounds for Mpro target.
