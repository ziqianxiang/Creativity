Figure 1: CODFE framework: data-free model stealing process and attacking process.
Figure 2: Accuracy of substitute models.
Figure 3: Convergence ofCoDFe over training rounds:loss of the substitute model3Here we limit the number of queries for plotting according to the convergence of CoDFe. Actually thetraining process of DaST is far longer however its modeling stealing accuracy stays fluctuating below CoDFe.
