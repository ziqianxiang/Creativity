Figure 1: Different mixup methods. AlignMix retains the pose of image 2 and the texture of image 1.
Figure 2: Feature tensor alignment and interpolation. Cost matrix M contains pairwise distancesof feature vectors in tensors A, A0. Assignment matrix R is obtained by Sinkhorn-KnoPP (Knight,M/u2008) on similarity matrix e M/e. A is aligned to A0 according to R, giving rise to A. We theninterpolate between A, A. Symmetrically, We can align A0 to A and interpolate between A0, A0.
Figure 3: Visualizing alignment. For different λ ∈ [0, 1], we interpolate feature tensors A, A0without alignment (top) or aligned feature tensors (bottom) of two images x, x0 and then we generatea new image by decoding the resulting embedding through the decoder D. (a), (c) We align A toA0 and mix with (12). (b), (d) We align A0 to A and mix with (13). Only meant for illustration: Nodecoded images are seen by the classifier at training.
Figure 4: Calibration plots on CIFAR-100 using PreActResnet18: near diagonal is better. Baselineis clearly overconfident while Input and Manifold mixup are clearly under-confident. AlignMix hasthe best calibrated predictions.
