Figure 1: A depiction of the shortest path from a sample z0 to C(h) and Z (h). the point h-1 (c)represents the closest point on C to z0 .
Figure 2: 1D orthogonal and synchronized hypotheses on the complex plane. The black and whitecontours represent the contours of imaginary and real parts of the hypotheses, respectively. Thetraining samples are depicted using black dots. Hue and saturation of the colors represent the argu-ment and the magnitude of h(z), respectively.
Figure 3: 1D orthonormal and synchronized Chebyshev hypotheses on the real line. We have usedthe basis functions up to degree 30 and S6 in both cases.
Figure 4: 1D orthonormal and synchronized hypotheses on the complex plane. The domain ofconvergence of the hypotheses does not cover the whole unit disk contrary to expectation. In case oforthonormal features, the domain of convergence does not even cover the whole of [-1, 1] interval.
Figure 5: 2D orthonormal and synchronized hypotheses. We have used basis functions up to degree30 in both dimensions and 100 equispaced samples to train the classifiers.
Figure 6: The weighted average f1-score of the models in natural and adversarial settings on thedigits dataset.
Figure 7: Visualization of the slice of a Bergman kernel machine (BKM) and a multi-layer per-ceptron (MLP) in the adversarial direction in the complex plane for an arbitrary test sample. Thetriangle and the circle represent the position of the natural and adversarial samples respectively.
