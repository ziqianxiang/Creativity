Figure 1: The overview of our method. The observation ot is represented as a knowledge graph.
Figure 2: The testing results on the games of seen and unseen levels with respect to the trainingepisodes. The dashed line denotes the random agent, which is non-learnable. The first row showsthe results on games in the seen levels. The second row shows the results on games in the unseenlevels. The third row shows the summary results for different methods. Our GoalRand significantlyoutperforms the BeBold method and the random baseline.
Figure 3: The ablation results on the games of seen and unseen levels with respect to the trainingepisodes. The first row shows the results on games in the seen levels. The second row showsthe results on games in the unseen levels. The third row shows the summary results for differentmethods. For most of the games, the results show that the goal time limit can contribute to theperformance and our method works better than GATA.
Figure 4: The initial observation of four games, where “S1 Game1” and “S1 Game2” belong to level“S1”, “S2 Game1” and “S2 Game2” belong to level “S2”.
Figure 5: The initial observation of two games belonging to level “S3”.
