Figure 1:	Activation correlation of first layer neurons in the encoder, using the active-passive dataset.
Figure 2:	Manipulating the outputted translation to be active voice when feeding passive voice asinput. Lines present BLEU change with active and passive references, as a function of the amountof neurons manipulated (x-axis)5.2	ExperimentsWe present experiments manipulating passive voice inputs towards active voice translations. Theopposite manipulation (active input to passive translation) and the results on the clause/noun-phraseset can be found in Appendix C.
Figure 3: Top ParaCorr neurons are better for manipulation. Manipulating the output translation tobe active voice when feeding passive voice as input. Comparing the choice of neurons to manipulatewhen starting from the top or bottom according to the rank given by ParaCorr. (1) Measuring byBLEU against active voice references and (2) measuring passive score that automatically detectspassive voice.
Figure 4: Top ranked neurons have a strongerimpact on the translation quality of a test set,measured in BLEU. Erasure of neurons fromthe top or bottom of the rank given by thevalue of correlation between paraphrases.
Figure 5: Top ParaCorr neurons intersectwith neurons most related to token embed-dings and positional encoding. The x-axisrepresents the amount of top ParaCorr neu-rons as a percentage of all the neurons inthe encoder. The y-axis shows how manyof these x neurons are also in the set of topx TokenCorr neurons or top x PosCorr neu-rons. The y-axis scale is a percentage out ofx. Results are reported for the active-passiveset.
