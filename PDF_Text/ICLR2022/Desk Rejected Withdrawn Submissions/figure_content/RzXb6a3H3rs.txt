Figure 1: Overview of the L2P framework. Compared with typical continual learning methods (left)that adapt model weights to tasks sequentially, L2P (right) uses a single backbone model and learnsa prompt pool to adapt tasks.
Figure 2: The illustration of L2P at test time. During training time, we follow the same procedureand optimize the model as described in Section 4.3.
Figure 3: Prompt selection histograms for (left) Split CIFAR-100 and (right) 5-datasets. Note thatwe only show the first 5 tasks for Split CIFAR-100 for better readability.
Figure 4: Left-Middle: Average accuracy w.r.t prompt length Lp and prompt selection size N forSplit CIFAR-100 and 5-datasets, respectively, given M = 20. Right: Average accuracy (%) w.r.t.
