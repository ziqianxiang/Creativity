Figure 1: Feature maps obtained after first, third and fourth convolutions for 4 rotated versions of anMNIST digit with steerable networks (E2CNN), CNN and Implicitly Equivariant Network (IEN).
Figure 2: Schematic representation showing the working of Implicitly Equivariant Networks. Hereψg, φ-ι and G(∙) denote rotation, rotation in opposite direction and group-pooling, respectively.
Figure 3: Extended results for the MNIST feature map representations shown in the main paper. Weshow here the feature maps for all 6 layers of the network for the 4 orientations of the input image.

Here R4 and R8 denote equivariance to 4 and 8 equidistant orientations, respectively,and R4R denotes equivariance to 4 equidistant rotations and reflections. Numbers for conv layersdenote channels per orientation. Channels per layer in all variant are chosen such that the totalparameters in the model are same as the base VGG model.
