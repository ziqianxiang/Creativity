Figure 1: KGExplainer explains the target KGE via learning a multi-step surrogate model withlatent rules and providing paths from head entity to tail entity as explanations.
Figure 2: Overview of KGExplainer. f and g are the translation and similarity function from the tar-get KGE. zr is the rule emebdding for relation r and r(zir) is the ithe compositive relation embeddingfrom rule decoder D.
