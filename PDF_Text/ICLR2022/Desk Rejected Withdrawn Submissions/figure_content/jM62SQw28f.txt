Figure 7: For Power demand dataset, (a) shows two cycles of normal data (0-1200 frame) whereineach cycle contains 5 peaks. (b) shows two cycles with anomaly with missing peaks highlightedusing red arrows. The waveform of original data (light blue) is overlaid on the prediction result (lightred). Lower color bars show the ground truth (GT) label and our detection result (Result).
