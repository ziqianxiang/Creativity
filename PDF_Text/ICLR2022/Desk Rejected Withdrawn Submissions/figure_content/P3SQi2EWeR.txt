Figure 1: The receptive fields of circular kernels in size k ∈ {3, 5, 7}. All receptive fields areconcentric and isotropic. A larger circular kernel has a more round receptive field.
Figure 2: Approximation of a 3 × 3 circular kernel on a 3 × 3 square kernel.
Figure 3: The searched normal cells and reduction cells of PC-DARTS-Circle on CIFAR-10 (left-handside) and ImageNet (right-hand side). The circular kernels are marked in red.
Figure 4: Comparison of classification error on rotated or sheared images.
Figure 5: The searched normal and reduction cells of DARTS (left-hand side) and DARTS-Circle(right-hand side) on CIFAR-10. The large circular kernels are marked in red.
Figure 6: The searched normal and reduction cells of PC-DARTS (left-hand side) and PC-DARTS-Circle (right-hand side) on CIFAR-10. The large circular kernel is marked in red.
