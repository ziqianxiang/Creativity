Figure 1: Left: Comparison of representation learning of subgraphs and partial subgraphs. Thelatter learns subgraph representations with partial observation of nodes and edges. Middle & Right:Real-world examples of partial subgraph learning: fake news early detection and disease diagnosiswith partial observation. See Real-world examples in §2.2 for a more detailed description.
Figure 2: Overview of Intra- and Inter-SGL Given node representations h, both SGI methodsmaximize MI between the summarized representation of the subgraph and its nodes. (1) Intra-SGIuses the observed subgraph representation sobs as the summary vector and k-hop neighbors that arenot part of the subgraph VglObk as negative samples. (2) Inter-SGI uses the reconstructed subgraphrepresentation ssub as the summary vector and nodes from other subgraphs V- as negative samples.
