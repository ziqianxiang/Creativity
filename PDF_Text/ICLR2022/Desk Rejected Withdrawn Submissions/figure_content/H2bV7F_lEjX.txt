Figure 1: (a) Evolving manner among RMNIST domains. (b) Accuracy of traditional DG methodson evolving domains. These methods cannot generalize well on outer domains (0° and 75°). (c)Comparison between the performance of our method and baselines on outer domains. The proposedmethod outperforms all the baselines.
Figure 2: Visualization of the EvolCircle data set. (a) 30 domains indexed by different colors, wherethe left bottom one is target domain. (b) Positive and negative instances are denoted by red andblue dots respectively. (c) The decision boundaries learned by ERM. (d) Decision boundaries oflast model on all domains. (e) Decision boundaries of models in each domain. (the results of firstdomain are missing due to the lack of prototypes.
Figure 3: Visualization of the RPlate data set. (a) The true decision boundaries evolves over do-mains. (b) & (c) The decision boundaries learned by ERM and DPNets on the target domain.
