Figure 4: Results from the CIFAR10 (a-c) (M = 8) and MIMIC3 (d-f) (M = 4) datasets. GALsignificantly outperforms 'Alone' and performs close to the centralized case 'Joint.’ The gradientassisted learning rate diminishes to zero as the overarching loss converges. A constant gradientassisted learning rate (η = 1) converges much slower. The gradient assistance weights of the centralimage patches (m = {2, 3, 6, 7}) are larger than the boundary ones in the first few rounds.
