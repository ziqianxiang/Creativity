Figure 1: VORTEX uses supervised and consistency paths for robust accelerated MRI reconstruction.
Figure 2: Sample image-based, physics-driven (motion, noise), and composed (image + physics)augmentations applied to a fully-sampled image. Motion and noise were simulated at difficulty levelsof α = 0.2 and σ = 0.2, respectively.
Figure 3: Example reconstructions for simulated scans with heavy motion (top) and heavy noise(bottom). M and M+N correspond to motion and motion+noise augmentations, respectively. Su-pervised, MRAugment, SSDU, and Noise2Recon amplify motion ghosting artifacts (blue arrow).

Figure 5: Simulated augmentation dif-ficulty scheduling over training periodof 200 epochs using linear and expo-nential (exp) schedulers defined in §4.2.
