Figure 1: Our approach adjusts the desired attributes of an image, preserving the identity.
Figure 2: Analysis of latent vs. smile semantic space. (left) Most of latent space dimensions do not showa strong (positive/negative) linear correlation to the smile attribute. (right) The average values of threehighest correlated dimensions of the latent codes with respect to the amount of smile, confirming even highlycorrelated dimensions do not show a strict linear relation with smile attribute. Shaded region shows onestandard deviation.
Figure 3: Adjusting the amount of smile by manipula-tion of a latent sample. Whilst all approaches increasethe amount of smile, SeNT-Gen preserves the identityof the image better than others. e.g. The color of thehat and preserving the eyeglasses.
Figure 4: Adjusting the amount of pose:Whilst SeNT-Gen and Directional-GAN successfullyachieve all degrees of pose, Interface-GAN fails atextreme values. It also affects the identity preserva-tion by Directional-GAN.
