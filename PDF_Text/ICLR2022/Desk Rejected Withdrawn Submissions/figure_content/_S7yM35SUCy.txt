Figure 1: A diagram of the architecture used for Beta loss with a σ =sigmoid inverse link function.
Figure 2: (Left): The Beta weight function for a few values of α and β. (Right): The derivative ofpartial loss `0 (the plot for the derivative of `1 is similar but reflected). Beta losses with lowervalues of α and β place much more emphasis on instances that are close to 0 (i.e. close to correctpredictions) than Focal and Log loss.
