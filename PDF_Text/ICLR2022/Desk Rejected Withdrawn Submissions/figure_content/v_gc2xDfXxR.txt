Figure 1: Visualization of top-10% patches obtained by thresholding self-attention maps of querypatches (top) in the last layer of ViT-S/16 trained with DINO (middle) and DINO + PASS (bottom).
Figure 2: Illustration of the proposed framework, Patch-Aware Self-Supervision (PASS). Top:image-level self-supervision, which minimizes the distance between the final representations of twodifferently augmented images. Bottom: patch-aware self-supervision (ours) which minimizes thedistance between the final representations of each patch and its positives. We use both types ofself-supervision for learning image-level and patch-level representations simultaneously.
Figure 3: Illustration of positive matching. For a given query patch, we find semantically similar(i.e., positive) patches from its neighborhood using the cosine similarity on the representation space.
Figure 4: Visualization of segmentation results. Top: input video frames. Middle and Bottom: seg-mentation results obtained by DINO and DINO + PASS (ours), respectively. PASS clearly improvesthe segmentation results, which is an evidence that PASS encourages the patch representations tolearn semantic information of each object.
