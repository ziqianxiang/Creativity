Figure 1: Simulations using OGA in network extensive form games, where each player is involved in 2 or more differentgames and must select their strategy accordingly. The plots shown are: (Left) Day-to-day convergence to the Nash in3-player random network extensive form games. (Center) Day-to-day convergence to the Nash in 4-player randomnetwork extensive form games. Note the significantly longer time needed to achieve convergence compared to the3-player experiment. (Right) Convergence to the Nash in 5-player Kuhn poker.
Figure 2: 4-node graph for randomized EFGs. Each node represents a player and each edge represents a game Gibetween the corresponding players.
Figure 3: Extensive form representation of Kuhn poker from the perspective of one player. The blue nodes representdecision points for the player, green nodes represent observation points (either the player observes their card or theother player takes an action) and finally the black nodes denote the terminal states of the game.
