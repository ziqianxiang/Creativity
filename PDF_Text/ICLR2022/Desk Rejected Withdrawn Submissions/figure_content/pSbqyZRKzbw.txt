Figure 1: The weight and regularizer curves of Focal loss ((a) and (b)) and SPL ((c) and (d)).
Figure 2: (a-c) show the weight curves of FlexW under three priority modes. (d) shows the weightcurves of SPL, Focal loss, and FlexW.
Figure 3: Accuracies of the three methods on noisy(left) and clean (right) samples under 40% flip noise.
Figure 4: (a) showsshow the accuraciesthe accuracies of ten categories in their respective optimal epochs; (b) and (c)of Categories 1 and 10, respectively. More results are presented in the Appendix.
Figure 5: (a) and (b) show the average weights of the first/last five head/tail categories on CIFAR100.
