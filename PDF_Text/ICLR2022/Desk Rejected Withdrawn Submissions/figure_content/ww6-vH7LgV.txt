Figure 1: Image samples from the MSC-LNCaP and MSC-Impurities datasets and the correspond-ing uncertainty estimation generated by the ensemble method. The first row highlights boundingboxes (drawn to highlight the ground truth inaccessible to models) in an image from MSC-LNCaP.
Figure 2: Comparison of some widely used ensemble methods and Bayesian inference algo-rithms. Notice the naive ensemble method performs similarly to batch ensemble or SGLD in MSC-Impurities data and significantly better in MSC-LNCaP data. In practice, we want to control thefalse positive rate to a small value, so we mainly look at the AUC when false positive ≤ 0.2.
Figure 4: Comparing our method with other ensemble or Bayesian methods under a distributionshift setting. Left: Training on the “very sparse” subset and evaluation on each subset (Model A ofFig. 3). Right: Training on the “very dense” subset (Model B) and evaluation on each subset. Theerror bar is computed over all images. We can see the correlation drops more quickly for the ”verysparse” training set (Left); this is because the “very sparse” subset contains mostly dark backgroundsand so less meaningful information can be extracted.
Figure 5: Loss landscape around a local mini-mum. There are multiple directions (in red ar-rows) we can choose to escape the local mini-mum while staying in the low loss “valley”.
Figure 6: CIFAR10-C: accuracy and ECE (the lower the better) degrade as image skewness inten-sifies. The box plot is made by aggregating the measurements over 15 kinds of corruptions madeby Hendrycks & Dietterich (2019).
Figure 7: Source and target images of MSC-Clean paired dataset.
Figure 8: Left: sample from MSC-Imurities dataset, we can observe the impurity area near thecenter of image. Right: sample from MSC-LNCaP dataset. Although not very visible, there is asmall patch in the bottom left (where the LNCaP cells are near-round, but normal MSC cells areslim).
