Figure 2: Framework of our proposed MDFNet including multiple local clients and one globalserver. For each client, there are three components (encoder, decoder, classifier). The encoderextracts high-level features to achieve domain-specific/invariant feature separation with two orthog-onal masks, while the decoder takes the combination of separated features to reconstruct the originaldata. The server adopts progressive weight to execute the model integration.
