Figure 1: LPR & LPR-T value in four different models. Step size α is equal to perturbation radiusdivided by 255 for CIFAT10. LPR value is measured with k = 0.1. PGD and FGSM without COhave a similar LPR-T curve, which is almost linearly increasing. LPR-T value of standard model isalso monotone increasing but the curve is concave. The FGSM with CO has a completely differentLPR-T curve, and the value for a large radius is even negative.
Figure 2: Distorted Perturbation Loss Curve and Geometric Interpretation of LPR & LPR-T. In (a)and (b), loss w.r.t. perturbation are plotted along direction found by FGSM and PGD7 respectively.
Figure 3: Underlying connection between CO and LPR, FOSC metric during training. LPR valueare measured under k = 0.1. For FGSM-AT, the network fell in CO at epoch 23 and recovered atepoch 29, and fell in CO again at epoch 43.

Figure 5: The LPR value w.r.t. perturbation radius along direction found by PGD with various k andα. The left part of each subplot is model without CO, while the right part is model with CO.
Figure 6: Training process of PGD variant version. PGD-corner suffer from CO after learning ratedecay, while PGD-large still maintain robustness.
Figure 7: Loss surface along FGSM direction u and PGD-7 direction v for different models. (a) and(b) are the model before and after the CO occurrs. (c) and (d) are the model 1 epoch after the model(b) trained with FLAT under different λ.
