Figure 1: The four types of selected samples, including the images and their corresponding scatterdiagram of probabilities sequence. The textboxes on the images represent their predictive labels,where the red text denotes a correct prediction while the black texts denote incorrect ones. Theexperiments are conducted on ImageNet trained using 〜3% labeled samples.
Figure 2: The accuracy of the selected pseudo la-bels by four kinds of methods, namely confidence,entropy, consistency and the fused vibration mea-sure. The ”Consistency” is calculated by the L2distance between the two kinds of augmentationson one image.
Figure 3: Active learning test accuracy on CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and Mini-ImageNet. The compari-son methods are random selection, the maximal predictive paobabilities, and the k-center approach,as well as the vibration measure using probability sequence.
Figure 4: Analysis to the sequence position, balance coefficient μ and fused weight a. The first rowlists the results of CIFAR10, and the second row lists the results of CIFAR100. Experiments areconducted on the first iteration of active learning on the two datasets.
