Figure 1: The three popular modeling schemes for task-oriented response generation.
Figure 2: An overview of the proposed decoupling framework DSSR. The network Ï† maps thedialogue context C to latent content Z in agent action space. Z is shared in responses Ri and R2 intwo styles si and s2. Encoder E extracts the content while stripping off the indicated surface styles,and generator G generates the response back when given the original style. When indicating with adifferent style, transferred Ri and R2 will be generated respectively.
Figure 3: The latent content vectors of DSSR and HDNO clustered in six categories visualized viathe T-SNE algorithm. We randomly show three turns of system utterances for each cluster.
