Figure 1: The siamese network (left) and the parasiamese network (right) diagrams. Fθ correspondsto a neural network with parameters θ and d a distance function (e.g Euclidean).
Figure 2: Diagram of the here proposed repelling parasiamese network. d corresponds to a distancefunction (e.g Euclidean) and c is a function that contrasts the siamese and parasiamese outputs (e.g.
