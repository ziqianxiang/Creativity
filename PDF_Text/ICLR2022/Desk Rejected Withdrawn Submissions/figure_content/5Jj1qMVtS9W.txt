Figure 1: All existing methods can produce rank inconsistent predictions, whereas CONDOR sitsatop any DNN architecture and produces universally rank consistent results. This improves perfor-mance and interpretability of the ordinal model.
Figure 2: Converting a categorical code base into a CONDOR ordinal code base is straightforward.
