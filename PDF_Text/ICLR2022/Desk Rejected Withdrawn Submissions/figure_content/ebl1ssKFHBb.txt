Figure 1: Illustration of the proposed framework in training a five-layer DONNS system WithGumbel-SoftmaX and complex-domain regularization - (a) In the inference path, input signal willbe modulated by each layer in both amplitude and phase encoded by optical devices controlled bydiscrete voltage values. In backpropagation path in training, starting from loss function, the gradientswill flow through Gumbel-Softmax over the approximated differentiable representation of the one-hotencoded discrete voltage levels; (b) Detailed illustration of discrete device-to-system mapping viaGumbel-Softmax in both forward and backpropagation.

Figure 4: Runtime analysis of Gumbel-Softmax based discrete optical neural network training,measured on 2080 Ti and 3090 Ti GPU. The complexity of training a 5-layer ONNs is almost linearto the number of discrete size of the targeted hardware devices on 3090 Ti, and linear on 2080 Ti upto device with less than 384 discrete values.
