Figure 1: The difference between single-vector embedding and multi-vector embedding. Given anetwork node with five circled labels in a taxonomy (a), single-vector embedding learns a vectorin the middle of all the five labels, which leads to under-fitting (b). However, by learning multiplevectors for a node, the under-fitting problem can be overcome in a POinCare disk (c).
Figure 2: An illustration of the LRU replacement policy. Three red branch vectors are allocated tofit the blue labels, with one continuously being lazy (a). After two LRU periods (b)-(c) and (d)-(e), finally each branch vector fits a small set of labels (f). In real cases, the label vectors are alsoupdated, and the geodesic line between any two points in a 2D POinCare disk is actually a curve.
Figure 3: The research areas of an author in a 2D Poincare disk. The blue points are the hierarchicallabels, with the red points being the author’s active branch vectors. ’Information retrieval’ and,retrieval tasks and goals, are embedded apart in HIME_8.
