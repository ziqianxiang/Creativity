Figure 1: Overview: Considering multiple source domains, our proposed method applies time se-ries augmentations on input samples and enforces prediction consistency between similar domainsthrough selective regularization of logits (pre-softmax classifier outputs). We encourage similardomains to share predicted class relationships, while allowing diverse predicted class relationshipsacross dissimilar domains.
Figure 2: Conventional domain alignment methods align all source domains equally and can resultin over-regularization. Our proposed method allows greater diversity in output predictions.
