Figure 1: Average forgetting rate (%). Thelower the rate, the better the method is.
Figure 2: (a) and (b) show decision boundaries for two classes (best viewed in color). The solid lineand dashed line are decision boundaries found using individual covariance per class Σc and sharedcovariance Σ, respectively. (a) shows that the decision line by shared covariance (i.e. dashed line) isseverely shifted when the covariances construct different shapes whereas the solid line separates theclusters properly. (b) shows that the two decision lines are equally good when class covariances forma similar shape. (c) shows accuracy change over the number of saved eigenpairs per class.
Figure 3: Average forgetting rate (%) on CIFAR100-20T and ImageNet-10T. The lower the value,the better the system is.
