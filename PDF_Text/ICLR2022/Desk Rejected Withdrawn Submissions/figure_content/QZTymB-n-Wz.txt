Figure 1: After an over-approximated solver it-eration Zn+ι = g# (X, Zn) (blue) is containedin the previous state Zn (green). This impliesthat any (exact) iteration ofgα (X, Zn+1) (orange)will not escape from Zn+1 . This implies contain-ment of the true fixpoint set (red) Z * ⊆ Zn+1 .
Figure 2: Over-approximations of animproper M-Zonotope (blue) by aproper one With (green) and Without(red) Box component and Box (orange).
Figure 3: Illustration of checking the containment of an improper M-Zonotope (red) in a properM-Zonotope (green), by consolidating errors (blue), or concretizing to Box (orange). In Fig. 3b Weshow how the proper M-Zonotope can be decomposed into their Box and Zonotope components. InFig. 3c we illustrate the containement check of these components individually.
