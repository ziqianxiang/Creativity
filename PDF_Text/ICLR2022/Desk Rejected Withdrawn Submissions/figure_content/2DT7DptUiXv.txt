Figure 1: Convolution neural network Architecture. Yellow represents the convolution layers, or-ange the pooling layers, and purple the fully connected layers. K is the number of classes. Thesoftmax fully connected layer is only used for Center Loss. For the other loss functions, we use thenetwork up to fc3.
Figure 2:	The feature extractor is the convolutions layers of our VGG11 network. After initialtraining on the base-training set the feature extractor is frozen except the last set of convolutionallayers Huo & van Zyl (2021).

Figure 4:	CARS196: mean average precision (mAP@R) on base-test plus inc-test for (a) Triplet,(b) Contrastive, and (c) Center loss combined for each incremental learning step.
