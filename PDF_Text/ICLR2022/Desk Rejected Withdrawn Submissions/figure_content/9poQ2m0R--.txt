Figure 1: An decode example of original CRF VS PCRF, at the index of character 军，the emissionscore for the label ”I” is smaller than ”B”, unfortunately, the CRF module fail to rectify the illegalpath after the dynamic decoding process ended. In contrast, the perplexity score calculated by thelanguage model, together with the aforementioned two scores, managed to justify that the character军 should be the middle of a word rather than the start of a word.
