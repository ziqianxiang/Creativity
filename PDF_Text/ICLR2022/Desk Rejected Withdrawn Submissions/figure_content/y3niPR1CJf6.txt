Figure 1: Weisfeiler-Lehman subtree with blue node as root, When the number of iterations is 3.
Figure 2: T(vι) and T(v2) areWL subtrees whose root nodes are vι and v2, respectively. φ(T(vι))and φ(T(v2)) are feature vectors for trees. The original figure was created by FUkagaWa et al.
Figure 3: Left: When we visit V twice in the EUler tour of a WL subtree, we calculate '(1)(v) usingEq. (4). Right: Polynomials of a WL subtree.
