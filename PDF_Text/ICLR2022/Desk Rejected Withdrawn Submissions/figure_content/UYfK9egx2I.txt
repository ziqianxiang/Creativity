Figure 1: An overview of the proposed framework. The framework is composed of three steps: (1)computing the influence scores between training data points; (2) constructing the influence graphaccording to the scores; and (3) extracting the maximum average sub-graph. εN is the pre-givennumber of poisoned training examples, and ε is the attack ratio.
