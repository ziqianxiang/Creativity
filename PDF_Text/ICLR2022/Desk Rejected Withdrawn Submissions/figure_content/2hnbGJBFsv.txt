Figure 1: Overview of SIDA framework for training. Only encoder and classifier are involved ininference. The dashed arrow shows the path of the gradient backpropagation.
Figure 2: From left to right are the feature visualizations on task D→A of ResNet50, CDAN, andSIDA, respectively. Red represents source domain, and blue representsthe target domain.
Figure 3: From top to bottom are the feature visualizations on task D→A of ResNet50, CDAN, andSIDA, respectively.
Figure 4: The result of task W→A is similar to task D→A.
