It reduces the size of thelibrary of models and thus helps the ensemble selection algorithm. When the pruning factor is above20% it does not reduce accuracy and reduce the ensemble selection time, while the threshold under15% reduces the target metric in some experiments. Therefore, for all experiments of this paper, thepruning factor is set to 20%.

Indeed, when we target the best ensemble at any cost or any size, theobjective of the two algorithms converges. On the opposite when the budget is small, SMOBF informsthe greedy algorithm to go toward efficient models before the budget is consumed.
