Figure 1:	Diagonal and Stochastic Lanczos Quadrature (SLQ) approximate log determinant ofGGNmatrix accurately. (Left) We trained a three-layer MLP and a variant of LeNet until convergence for100 epochs. (Right) We computed exact Hessian and GGN matrices of these networks and comparetheir log determinants with approximated ones.
Figure 2:	SLQ (m) can approximate the exact log determinant more efficiently and accurately thanChebyshev (m). Log determinant of the exact GGN matrix, SLQ, and Chebyshev of a trained three-layer MLP are presented.
Figure 3: SLQ with minibatches can estimate the exact logdeterminant accurately. Log determinantsof the exact GGN matrix, SLQ, and Diag of a trained three-layer MLP are presented.
Figure 4: Estimated log determinants of Rademacher-based SLQ and a Chebyshev polynomial. Wefound no significant difference from Gaussian-based ones presented in Fig. 2.
