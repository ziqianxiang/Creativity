Figure 1: The overall framework of DyG-ODE. Given a sequence of historical observations, We firstmap them to the latent space and learn an associated graph structure. Then, the continuous dynam-ics of spatial and temporal clues are modeled by coupling two ODES from different perspectives.
Figure 2: Model parameters and averaged performances w.r.t. graph propagation and temporal ag-gregation depths on the METR-LA dataset. DyG-ODE* is a variant of our method with the attentivetransformation disabled in Eq. 7. DyG-ODE discrete denotes the discrete variant of our methodby combining Eq. 4 and the padding version of Eq. 8.
Figure 3: The ablation study on three time series datasets. We replace the continuous temporal ag-gregation and graph propagation in DyG-ODE with their discrete implementations, denoted as w/oCTA and w/o CGP. We further remove the attentive and continuous regime in CGP to construct thew/o CGP & Attn. A lower RSE and a higher CORR are expected.
