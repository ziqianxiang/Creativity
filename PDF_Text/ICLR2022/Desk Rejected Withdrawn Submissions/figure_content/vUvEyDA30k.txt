Figure 1: We generate adversarial examples by I-FGSM and our proposed I-FGS2M. The Red high-light denotes the pre-set target label.
Figure 2: Sign function vs. Staircase sign function (take K = 2 for example). Left & Middle: thegraph of functions. Right: illustration of the gradient direction of the substitute model gA, black-box model gB, and the resultant update directions of sign and staircase sign function w.r.t gA . Toexpress more visually, here we ignore the magnitude of each perturbation. For sign function, eachunit of the resultant direction is the same. By contrast, our method reflects the difference betweenunits, and is more close to both gA and gB.
Figure 3: We visualize the perturbations of an image at the first iteration. All perturbations arenormalized to [0, 1]. (a): the gradient of an ensemble of Inc-v4 (Szegedy et al., 2017), IncRes-v2 (Szegedy et al., 2017) and Res-152 (He et al., 2016); (b)&(c): the results of SM and S2M w.r.t(a). The numbers in the lower right corner indicate the average cosine similarity between (a) andthe other two perturbations on 1,000 images. Notably, our S2M not only keeps the perturbationmagnitude but also has higher cosine similarity to (a).
Figure 4: The success rate (%) of targeted black-box attack (Hold-out) for different methods w.r.tstaircase number K (K = 1 denotes SM and K ≥ 2 denotes S2M). For (a) and (b), the adversarialexamples are crafted via an ensemble of Inc-v4, IncRes-v2 and Res-152, and the hold-out modelis Inc-v3. For (c), the white-box models are an ensemble of Inc-v3, Inc-v4, IncRes-v2, Res-152,Res-101, Res-50, Inc-v3ens4 and IncRes-v2ens, and the hold-out model is Inc-v3ens3.
Figure 5:	The success rate (%) of targeted white-box attack (AoE) for different methods w.r.t stair-case number K (K = 1 denotes SM and K ≥ 2 denotes S2M). For (a) and (b), the adversarialexamples are crafted via an ensemble of InC-V4, InCReS-V2 and Res-152, and the hold-out modelis Inc-v3. For (c), the white-box models are an ensemble of Inc-v3, Inc-v4, IncRes-v2, Res-152,Res-101, Res-50,Inc-v3ens4 and InCReS-V2ens, and the hold-out model is InC-V3ens3.
Figure 6:	The success rate (%) of targeted white-box attack (Ensemble) for different methods w.r.tstaircase number K (K = 1 denotes SM and K ≥ 2 denotes S2M). For (a) and (b), the adversarialexamples are crafted via an ensemble of InC-V4, InCReS-V2 and Res-152. For (c), the white-boxmodels are an ensemble of Inc-v3, Inc-v4, IncRes-v2, Res-152, Res-101, Res-50, InC-V3ens4 andInCReS-V2ens.
