Figure 1: (Left) Test accuracy of SGC on 20 randomly sampled nodes of Citeseer. The X-axis is thenode id, and Y-axis is the propagation steps (layers). The color from white to blue represents the ratioof being predicted correctly in 50 different runs. (Right) The local graph structures for two nodes indifferent regions; the node in the dense region has larger RF within two iterations of propagation.
Figure 2: Overview of the proposed GAMLP, including (1) feature and label propagation, (2) combinethe propagated features and labels with RF attention, and (3) MLP training. Note that both the featureand label propagation can be pre-processed.
Figure 3: Test accuracy on PubMed dataset under different levels of label and edge sparsity.
Figure 4: The architecture of GAMLP with JK Attention.
Figure 5: Test accuracy when the propagation depth increases from 10 to 100.
Figure 6: The average attention weights of propagated features of different steps on 60 randomlyselected nodes from ogbn-products.
