Figure 1: Given a 2D line drawing, face identification aims to find edge loops which correspondto actual faces of the 3D object. (a) A case where several faces (including the one indicated bya red arrow) are enclosed by two or more loops. (b) A case where multiple topologically correctinterpretations exist.
Figure 3: Our model, Faceformer, takes as input the set of all co-edges, and current sequence ofco-edge indices, and outputs a distribution over the co-edge indices.
Figure 4: Incorrect predictions made by our face identification model. For each case, we show theinput line drawing, followed by predictions with wrong face loops (blue), predictions with wrongface types (black), and missed faces (red).
