Figure 2: Sensitivity results on CIFAR-100 dataset, trained with the Resnet50 model. It shows thesensitivity of the network before and after using our linear transformation module.
Figure 3: We find that our approach works worst on the ISIC’19 skin cancer dataset. Under furtherexamination, most classes in CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 coincide with ImageNet classes, whereasin ISIC’19 we find that skin cancer images are mostly associated with ticks which, although visuallysimilar, will not lead to features representative of the presence of skin cancer. This demonstratesthat our algorithm allows vanilla transfer learning to best utilise the information that is present in theinitial dataset, but it cannot learn new information.
