Figure 1: Trajectories in the 3-dimensional state space of a recurrent neural network trained topredict personality from aggregated transactions. While (a) shows the clustering of the trajectoriesof many customers according to the most dominant personality trait, (b) shows two trajectories forthe same customer being identically classified over two different time periods: one year vs. sixyears.
Figure 2: Hierarchical clustering for trajectory angles in 2-dimensional space. Each axis representsan angle (in radians) which describes the direction of the trajectories in 3-dimensional space andeach data point represents a trajectory. We show all the levels of hierarchical clustering: (a) showsthe highest level, while (b) through (d) show sub-clustering within each of the subsequent parentclusters.
Figure 3: Two trajectories - long-term and short-term - for the same customer that seem to convergeto a common attractor in the last year. In the long-term trajectory, the customerâ€™s dominant person-alty trait is neuroticism as derived from annual aggregated spending patterns for the first five years.
