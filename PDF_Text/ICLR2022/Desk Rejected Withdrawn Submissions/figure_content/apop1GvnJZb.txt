Figure 1: Divergence of the NS loss function of a given (x, y). This figure indicates the divergencebetween f = 1.0 and g = exp(S 1(Xj)) in dΨG) (f, g) when 甲(Z) = Zlog(Z) - (I + Z) log(I + Z)3	Non Convexity of Negative SamplingIn this Section, we theoretically investigate how the NS loss affects the model and reveal its problem.
