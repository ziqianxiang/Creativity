Figure 1: Tabula replaces garbled circuits in standard private neural network inference pro-tocols. Compared to garbled circuits, Tabula obtains lower communication costs, betterstorage savings, and higher speedups while maintaining security. Source code is released athttps://github.com/tabulainference/tabula.
Figure 2:	TABULA table size vs achieved accuracy on corresponding tasks. In this plot, we use Fbto represent the number of bits b of p of the finite field. Using a 15-bit finite field prime achieveswithin 4 % error of the baseline accuracy, leading to a table size of 18 GB.
