Figure 1: A motivational experiment. In each plot, we swept the hyperparameter λ2 on the hardwarecost from 0.001 to 0.010. The results from three searches done in identical settings are depicted withsame colors with the average in the center as a larger dot. It is clear that the trajectory is not strictlylinear to λ2. Moreover, the variation within the same setting often overlaps that of the other settings,demonstrating the difficulty of satisfying the hard constraint of the co-exploration problem.
Figure 2: Our proposed method for hard constrained co-design. Left is a close-up of our co-designmodule, and right is the depiction of gradient manipulation. Gradient of the loss from the co-designmodule is manipulated using the gradient of the constraint to obtain a new gradient. This is used toupdate the module in the direction of lowering the value of the constrained metric.
Figure 3: Co-exploration results. (left) and (mid) represent the Latency and (right) represent thehardware cost. Colored marks are hard-constrained and should result in a lower value than thehorizontal line of the same color.
Figure 4: Sensitivity to p on ConCoDE. The red lines represents latency constraint at 33.3 ms.
