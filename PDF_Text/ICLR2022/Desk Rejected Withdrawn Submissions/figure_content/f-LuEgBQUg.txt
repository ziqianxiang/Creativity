Figure 1: The introduced language-driven image style transfer (LDIST) task. LDIST allows ma-nipulating colors and textures of a content image (C), guided by a style instruction (X).
Figure 2: Contrastive language visual artist (CLVA), including language visual artist (LVA) andcontrastive reasoning (CR). LVA learns to jointly embed style images (S) and style instructions (X)by the patch-wise style discriminator (D) and perform LDIST for content images (C). CR comparescontrasitve pairs ({C1, X1}, {C2, X2}) to improve the relativeness between transferred results (O).
