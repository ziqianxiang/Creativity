Figure 1: Comparison between αt = 1 and αt = 1K∕ηtin (3). Set the stepsize ηt = 1/√1 + t and the same privacybudget at final iteration. The blue curves corresponding to theright vertical axis show the overall privacy for αt = 1 (DP-SGD), represented by the dashed line, and at = 1 /√ηt (ADP-SGD), represented by the solid line. The green curves corre-sponding to the left vertical axis show the actual Gaussian noise(i.e., ηtαtZ ) added to the parameter θt for αt = 1 (dash line)and at = 1/√ηt (solid line). The variance of the Perturba-tion using our proposed ADP-SGD decreases much slower thanthat using DP-SGD. Note that the privacy value we used here isbased on the theoretical upper bound.
Figure 2: Detailed performance ADP-SGD/DP-SGD with polynomially decaying stepsizes. The top rowis for gradient clipping CG = 1.0 and bottom for CG = 2.5. Each plot corresponds to a fixed T (see x-axis)and a privacy budget ε (see title). The solid orange and light-blue curves, which correspond to the right verticaly-axis, show the averaged test accuracy for ADP-SGD (solid line) and DP-SGD (dash line). The shaded regionis one standard deviation. Same as Figure 1, the monotone green curves, which correspond to the left verticaly-axis, show the actual noise for at = 1/√ηt (ADP-SGD, the solid line) and at = 1 (DP-SGD, the dashedline). The top/bottom rows from 1st to 4th column correspond to the privacy budgets from 0.8 (epoch 60), 1.2(epoch 60), 1.6 (epoch 120), and 3.2 (epoch 200).
