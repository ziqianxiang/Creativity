We nowshow the result for the manifold without boundary e.g. 2-sphere. Note that we only need one roundof FPLM to finish the entire process. This is because we assumed that the sample X is a subset of themanifold, hence the triangulation conducted on X is always with a boundary. Thus, it is reasonablefor us to only use one round of FPLM given any single triangle can be served as the boundary.

Given that all the d-manifolds we considered in this paper can at least be embedded intoRd+1; hence the points that we simulated in the manifold latent space can always be embedded inat least R4 without self-intersection. Note that the boundary of tetrahedral mesh can be detectedas the 2-simplex that is not shared in tetrahedral mesh. Due to the variety of embedding functionsfrom R3 to R4 , the boundary detect from R3 will be, in general, different from the boundary of themanifold in R4 or higher. Moreover, for the first round of FPLM, the fixed points will be the verticesof randomly selected tetrahedral; for the second round of FPLM, the fixed points will be the verticesof the polytope directly detected from tetrahedralization mesh. The following figure shows FPLMresults on tetrahedral mesh of 3-ball.

Second round FPLM8Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 20226	DiscussionBoundary Advantage of FPLM To get the manifold structure, we apply a simplex decompositionalgorithm (if exist) on M. By our definition of the simplex decomposition, the boundary of thedecomposition result will be a (d - 1)-dimenional closed polytope formed by those (d - 1)-simplicesthat are not shared. However, in practice, when d is large, constructing a bijective mapping betweenboundaries can be as challenging as the original manifold learning problem. Fortunately, when GSis strongly connected, we evade this problem by two rounds FPLM in Algorithm 1 because the theboundary of the decomposition result is automatically determined. This is also the reason for the firstround.

Figure 12: Boundary triangle for a triangulation of the subset of 2D-sphereA.4 Piece-wise linear mapping of FPLMAs we mentioned earlier, the connectivity between simplices formed on manifold should remain thesame in both image and pre-image of a bijective function over the entire simplex decomposition. We14Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2022let the image set of the chart map as Z = {z1, z2, ..zN} ∈ Rd. The exact position of every point inZ is unknown; however, from the bijectivity of the chart map, we know that Z perfectly preservesthe connectivity between simplices. This means if we repeat the graph in Z using the adjacencyinformation from the simplex decomposition (S) on M, the integrity, connectivity, and neighboringrelations between simplices will remain unchanged. We write the simplex decomposition in Rd as S0although it is the same as S. Then for the points in both S and S0, they are linearly related, e.g. theweights on the edges, which is apparent in equation (5) equal to ADj.

We test on three levels of noise variance,σ = 0.001, 0.005, 0.01 and the mapping results are shown in Figure 22. We observe that when thenoise level is relatively small (σ = 0.001), the simplex decomposition generated by TC is still validand hence FPLM can guarantee a valid mapping. When the noise level increases, we see TC fails togenerate a valid decomposition and thus, FPLM fails to preserve the bijectivity. From the theoreticalanalysis in this paper, as long as the simplex decomposition is valid, FPLM is guaranteed to succeedregardless of the noise level.
