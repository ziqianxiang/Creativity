Figure 1: Algorithm Overview: Given the graph, our proposed method first cluster the nodes basedon node embeddings. Then rebuild the coarsened graph with the weighted edges, averaged featuresand summed labels. After that the most impacting edge entry in the coarsened graph is selectedcalculated by meta-gradients. The selected clusters are split into new clusters, and the new coarsenedgraph is rebuilt. The clustering, rebuilding, selecting and splitting procedures are repeated until theselected edge entry is connecting two single nodes. Finally, the perturbation is added to the graph.
