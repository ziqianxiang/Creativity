Figure 1: Overview of the proposed Efficient Point Transformer (EPT).
Figure 2: ComPutational graPh of ESA.
Figure 3: HeatmaP visualization of consistency score (CScore) of MinkowskiNet (Choy et al., 2019)and the proposed efficient point transformer. Points with high CScore (consistently predicts the sameclass) are colored blue and points with low CScore (the predicted class is not consistent with arbitraryrigid transformations) are colored red. Table 1 shows quantitative evaluation.
