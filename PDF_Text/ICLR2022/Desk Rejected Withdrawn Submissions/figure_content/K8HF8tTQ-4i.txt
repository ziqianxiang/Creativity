Figure 1: Analysis of the hyper-parameter λ of Eq. 11 in word control. Left: how λ influences controlsatisfaction, i.e., how early the control word appears in the generated text and whether it appears at all. Right:how λ influences and language quality, i.e., perplexity. In general, we observe a trade-off between controlsatisfaction and language quality.
Figure 2: Analysis of how the hyper-parameters λ, Tc, Tc in Eq. 12 influence control satisfaction and languagequality for positive (left plot) and negative (right plot) sentiments. Larger λ, Tc and lower Tc generally resultin better control satisfaction but worse language quality.
Figure A1: Analysis of how the hyper-parameters λ in Eq. 12 influences control satisfaction (Left plot) andlanguage quality (right plot). We see that λ controls how early a keyword in the topic keywords list appears inthe generated text but does not impair language quality.
Figure A2: Analysis of how the hyper-parameter λ impacts reducing toxicity and maintaining lan-guage quality in the detoxification experiment, for both toxic prompts (left plot) and non-toxicprompts (right plot). We see that, for various λ's we investigated, our method achieves bettertrade-off between toxicity and perplexity compared to four strong baselines.
