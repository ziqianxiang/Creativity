Figure 1: The illustration of SGTR pipeline paradigm. We formulate SGG as a bipartite graphconstruction process. First, the entity and predicate nodes are generated respectively. Then Weassemble the bipartite scene graph from two types of nodes.
Figure 2: Illustration of overall pipeline of our SGTR model. Left) We use CNN backbonetogether with transformer encoder for image feature extraction. The entity/PrediCate node generatorare introduced to produce the entity node and entity-aware predicate node. A graph assemblingmechanism is develoPed to construct the final biPartite scene graPh. Right) The Predicate nodegenerator consists of a) Predicate query initialization, b) Predicate encoder, and c) structural Predicatedecoder, which is designed to generate entity-aware Predicate nodes.
