Figure 1: T-SNE plots of embedding space of aBERT reranker for q-d pairs and ANCE dense re-triever for queries and documents. All models aretrained on MS MARCO web search as the sourcedomain (blue) and applied on TREC-COVID med-ical search as the target domain (orange).
Figure 2: Momentum adversarial training provides a more accurate and robust estimation of thedomain boundary in dense retrieval’s embedding space.
Figure 3:	Global and Local Domain-Acc when momentum is/isn’t used at different training steps.
Figure 4:	T-SNE of the representation space with different continuous training (steps) after ANCE,with or without momentum. Blue: source (MARCO); orange: target (TREC-COVID).
Figure 5:	Target domain effectiveness and Global-Domain-Acc at different training steps (x-axis).
