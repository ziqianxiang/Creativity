Figure 1: I1 is more similar to Iref than I0 ac-cording to all perceptual similarity metrics andhumans. We attack I1 by adding imperceptibleadversarial perturbations (Î´) such that the metric(f) flips its earlier assigned rank, i.e., in the abovesample, I0 becomes more similar to Iref .

Figure 5: FlowAdV attack.
Figure 6: Adversarial examples (Iadv) generated via FlowAdv+PGD(20) to attack LPIPS(AlexNet)transfer successfully to most perceptual similarity metrics. A successful attack is marked in red. Forthe above samples, the RMSE between Iprey and Iadv is 0.050, 0.037, and 0.038 (left to right).
