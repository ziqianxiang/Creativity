Figure 1: For the tennis racket example, SPIRE iden-tifies this pattern by observing that, when we removethe people from images with both a tennis racket and aperson, the model,s prediction changes 63% of the time.
Figure 2: Based on the SalienCy map (Simonyan et al., 2013) (Left), one might mistakenly infer that the modelis not relying on the person. However, the model fails to detect the racket after the person is removed (Center)and inCorreCtly deteCts a raCket after it is removed (Right).

Figure 4: A comparison of the baseline model to various mitigation methods. The results shown are averagedacross both the pairs accepted for our benchmark and across eight trials. Left - Balanced Accuracy. Forp ≤ 0.2 and p ≥ 0.8, SPIRE produces the most accurate models. None of the methods have much of an impactfor p =0.4 or p = 0.6, likely because those create weak SPs. Center/Right - Recall/Hallucination Gaps.
