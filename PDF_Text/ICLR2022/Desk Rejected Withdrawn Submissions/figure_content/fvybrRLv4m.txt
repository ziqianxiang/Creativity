Figure 1: Error bars show one standard deviation in log-scale over 4 trials, with nB =5and B = 30.
Figure 2: In error plots (first row), error bars show one standard deviation in log-scale over 4 trials,each with 2 batches of test samples and B = 30. In reconstruction plots (bottom row), each row isa different sample and each column a different method (in order: noiseless, autodiff, altmin, MOD,kSVD, noisy). The left and right columns are the blurred and recolored datasets, respectively.
