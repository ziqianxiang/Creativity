Figure 1: The average loss on seven models against five attacks integrated with Ens and SVR-Ens,respectively.
Figure 2: The attack success rate (%) of the I-FGSM, MI-FGSM and SI-TI-DIM base attacks afterintegrated with SVR-Ens. It degenerates to the integration with Ens when M = 0.
Figure 3: The attack success rate (%) of I-FGSM, MI-FGSM and SI-TI-DIM after integrated withSVR-Ens on different internal step size Î² of SVR-Ens.
Figure 4: The attack success rate (%) of the MI-FGSM base attack after integrated with Ens orSVR-Ens.
