Figure 1: A sample tree structure, each edge isrepresenting a univariate functionwe connect hu and xv with probability 0 < p0 .
Figure 2: Box-plot of feature importance for three datasets. The red lines show the median ranksunder each algorithm. Lower median ranks imply better performance. DL refers to DeepLIFT.
