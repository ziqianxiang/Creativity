Figure 1: Overview of unseen client generalization and our proposed novel causal view. (a) Structuralcausal models for FL (variable notations defined in Sec. 3.1). (b) Example of training clients withvarious distributions and generalization on unseen clients with the illustration of change of non-iidfeature distributions upon TsmoBN.
Figure 2: Results on medical image datasetwith 3 training clients and 2 unseen clients.
Figure 3: (a) and (b) study on how the batch size and momentum values would affect TsmoBN. (c) isthe performance comparison of TsmoBN using different sampling sequences. (d) analyzes the effectof affine transformation parameters during testing.
