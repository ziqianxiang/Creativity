Figure 1: Convergence of Cronus and existing federated learning algorithms in benign setting. Cronus incursonly a slight degragation in accuracy compared to existing algorithms, while improves significantly overstand-alone training.
Figure 2: Convergence of Cronus and existing federated learning algorithms in adversarial setting. Accuracyof Cronus in adversarial setting is almost the same as in benign setting (shown in Figure 1) due to its highrobustness. Except for CIFAR10, for which only collaboration phase is shown, both the Cronus training phasesare shown in figure and the collaboration phase starts at epoch 50.
Figure 3: Difference in the gradient-norms, VL(D), of the last layer of aggregated model on the target andnon-target data (PUrChaSe100 data). In the context of active membership inference attacks, D, Dt, D, and Dtdenote non-target members, target members, non-target non-members, and target non-members, respectiVely.
