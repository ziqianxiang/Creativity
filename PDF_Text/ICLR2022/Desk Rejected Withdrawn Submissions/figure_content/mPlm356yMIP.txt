Figure 1: Depth error. We show mean deptherrors of three SOTA monocular detectors inthe given depth range and exhibit the theoret-ical lower bound.
Figure 2: We convert a discrete outputas a spatial probability distribution, andthen sample points as detection candidatesfrom the distribution.
Figure 3: The performance gap in monocular 3Ddetection. We show the performance of differentSOTA detectors on train and val set, respectively.
Figure 4: Two sampling strategies in thelocation distribution.
Figure 5: P-R curves of using previous represen-tation and ours on KITTI test set. Solid lines: pre-vious; dashed lines: ours.
