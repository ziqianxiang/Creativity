Figure 1: Model Architecture. We take the 2-hop path searching as an example. The black arrowmeans time-aware exponentially weighted sampling. The blue arrows denote calculating the rest ofquestions for each path. The red arrow represents pruning based on the scores of paths. We take(Sub, Rel, ?, Time) as the original question ,which can be denoted as (es, rq, ?, tq). The searchedtwo paths are [(Sub,R1,Obj1,Time1)] and [(Sub,R1,Obj1,Time1),(Obj1,R5,Obj5,Time5)], whichcan be denoted as [(es, rp1, e1, t1)] and [(es, rp1, e1, t1) , (e1, rp2, e2, t2)] respectively. (Sub’, Rel’,?, Time) and (Sub”, Rel”, ?, Time) denote the remaining question after 1-hop and 2-hop path,wihch can be taken as es-1, rq-1, ?, tq , es-2, rq-2, ?, tq respectively.
Figure 2: A brief illustration Of the Path SCOring module. For the query (Sub, Rel, Tq,?), We searchthe 2-hop path (Sub, Rl, Tl, Objl),(Objl, R2, T2, Obj2). The pink box indicates that the originalquestion and the tailof the path are formed a quadruple to measure the rationality Of the inference tailas the answer, that in, QUestion MatChing Degree rfqmd∙ The purple box represents the comparisonbetween the question's ed(jlemtion and the Path relations to measure the semantics equivalence betweenthe question and the Paths that is, AnSWer ComPleting Level fac.
