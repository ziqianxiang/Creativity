Figure 1: Smoothing trajectoriesWS has the following probabilistic interpretation. Denote the un-calibrated network output distribu-tion by p(y = i|x; θ) s.t. that θ is the network parameter set. Let z be a binary random variable s.t.
Figure 2: Comparison of the optimal weights achieved by CWS and the (reciprocal of the) optimaltemperatures achieved by CTS in each bin for (a) CIFAR-10 trained on ResNet110 and (b) CIFAR-100 trained on ResNet110. The corresponding difference between confidence and accuracy beforecalibration in each bin are shown in (c) and (d).
Figure 3: Reliability diagrams, (a) before calibration, (b) after CTS calibration and (c) after CWScalibration with 13 bins for CIFAR-100 trained on ResNet110.
