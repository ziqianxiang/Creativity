Figure 6: Visual examples of the physical impersonation attack under different conditions. The text at thebottom of images denotes the recognition result of the FaceNet model.
Figure 7: Several groups of faces and the corresponding effective pasting areas. For each group, the left is theface image, and the white part of the right image represents the effective area.
Figure 8: Examples in the simultaneous optimization process. The black text at the bottom of images denotesthe ground-truth identity, and the red text is the false identity after attacks.
Figure 9: Examples when allowing patches to cover facial features in a small range. The black text at thebottom of images denotes the ground-truth identity, and the red text is the false identity after attacks.
