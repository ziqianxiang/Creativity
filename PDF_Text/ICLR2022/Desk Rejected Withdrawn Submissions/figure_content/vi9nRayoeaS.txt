Figure 2: Bayesian search on 入-#Proxyternating proxies in place of samples hold. We obtain98.06% MAP@R performance with sample-based train-ing against 97.21% MAP@R performance of proxy-based training. This empirical result supportsour motivation on using the proxies in place of samples.

Figure 6: Illustration of our method and the geometry of the embedding space before, (a), and after,(b), our method (through iterations 1-4), where boxes are the converged proxies and the circles are thenext proxies as the result of k-Center. In proxy-based DML, proxies are coalesced into one whereaswith ASAP, we have diverse proxies, resulting reduced covering radius.

We use 2-D TSNE embeddings of the validation datain the visualization. We report MAP@R, average covering radius and average inter-class pairwisedistances in the visualization.
