Figure 1: An overview of a standard SEIR model (left) the mobility network (right: from time t totime t + 1, person p3 moved from location lι to l3, and pi moved from lι to l2).
Figure 2: Daily reported cases, predictions made by the vanilla SEIR model, and the predictionsmade by LSTM for three cities in China - Shijiazhuang, Harbin and Suihua. Curves are smoothed by5-day average.
