Figure 1: The process to generate adversarial examples via SEM. The input image first be trans-formed into different image sizes. Then, through the target model, we calculate the related gradientsof those inputs. Finally, we integrate the related gradients to generate the adversarial perturbation.
Figure 2: Results of ablation studies on scale range l and r (first row), and on scale number N(sencond row).
Figure 3: Attention maps change with scale increasing inner a single iteration. Each row indicatesa different method. The attention maps of the top two methods which we called scale-invariant arenot related with the scale changing, while the last two are scale related, whose attention maps arerelated with pixel scales and image scales separately.
Figure 4: More results of target modelâ€™s attention maps on the transformed images.
