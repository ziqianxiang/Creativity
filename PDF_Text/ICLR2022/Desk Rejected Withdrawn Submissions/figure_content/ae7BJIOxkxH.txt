Figure 1: Illustration of different types of logits. (a) the normal logits. (b) the stingy teacher, (c) We presentthe probabilities after the temperature-scaled softmax.
Figure 2: Comparison of KD from three types of modification on the logits: the “stingy -sparse” logits, the“stingy - smooth” logits, and the reversed logits. We conduct experiments with three teacher student pairs onboth CIFAR-100 and Tiny-ImageNet. We also present the accuracy of training from scratch and KD from anormal teacher for comparison.
Figure 3: Testing accuracy over epochs for student networks trained with KD on CIFAR-100.
Figure 4: The visualization of logit responses produced by a normal ResNet-18 (blue), a nasty ResNet-18(yellow), and a stingy ResNet-18 (orange) trained on CIFAR-10. We present the probabilities after temperature-scaled softmax, where τ is 4.
Figure 5: Comparison of sparse logits built with top N categories (top logits) and the combination of thetop-1 class and N-1 smallest probabilities (least logits). Experiments are conducted on CIFAR-100.
Figure 6: Ablation studies on temperature τ. Experiments are conducted on CIFAR-100 withResNet-18 as the teacher network.
