Figure 1: Program induction task examples. (a) The famous Karel task (Pattis et al., 1981), whichincludes four primitive functions with no parameter, i.e., the total action space is 4; (b) The “Se-quence Manipulation” task (Balog et al., 2017), which includes 15 primitive functions with limitedparameters, and the total action space is 34. (c) The Visual Program Induction task in this paper,where there are five primitive functions with rich parameters, and the total action space is 2,349.
Figure 2: Model illustration. (a) The process of computing function class Ft and parameters Θtfrom Ot-1 to Ot. (b) An illustration from Ot-1 to Ot in the embedding space, where si = E (Oi)is the state embedding vector and eF is the function class embedding. Ft determines main directionwhile Θt further revises the direction of the function towards Oout .
Figure 3: An illustrating example of the mod-ified MCTS algorithm to build a search treein this paper. We assume three parameters areselected for each function and show the firstthree traces (best view in colors).
