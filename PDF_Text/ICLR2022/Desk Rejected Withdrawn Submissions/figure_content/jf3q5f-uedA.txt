Figure 1: The learned latent space (top, left) stronglydiffers from reference (bottom, right) and from the re-duced simulation (top, right). The restoration of detailsfrom it leads to a relative improvement of 50% w.r.t tothe baseline.
Figure 2: Architecture of our interacting models for n solver steps. The initial state ft goes throughthe encoder model that gives a reduced state rt. This reduced state is given to the reduced solverP that outputs the next reduced state rt+1 that is then decoded into the approximate solution ft+1.
Figure 3: Evaluations of non-linear advection-diffusion (toP) and buoyancy-driven flows (bottom).
Figure 4: Visual comparisons of reduced states. The bottom two rows for the ATO models representphysical dynamics that noticeably deviate from the original time evolution.
Figure 5: l2 difference of the reduced states with respect to the states of the best performing ATOmodel. Larger distances consistently coincide with reduced model performance.
Figure 6: Comparison among the ATO models for a buoyancy-driven flow example. Increasingnumbers of steps of the recurrent training yields better and better reconstructions of the reference onthe left.
Figure 7: A detailed architecture of the encoder and decoder models interacting with the differen-tiable physics solver for the buoyancy-driven flow scenario.
Figure 9: Ablation study of the influence of skip connections in the ATO model.
Figure 12: Selected simulation steps of two additional test examples started from different initialstates.
Figure 13: Mean l2 errors for the buoyancy-driven flow case, starting from step 100 (left) and step200 (right).
Figure 14: Evaluations of non-linear advection-diffusion (top) and buoyancy-driven flow (bottom)in two additional metrics: SSIM and LSiM.
Figure 15: Mean l2 errors for the non-linear advection-diffusion scenario with different numbers ofintegrated steps.
