Figure 1: Partially observed navigation tasks. (a) Invisible traps. We randomly place traps (in green), whichare invisible to agents, in a maze. Agents receive negative rewards if falling into a trap. (b) Hidden treasures.
Figure 3: Sinusoid Regression. Column 1: y | X and column 2-4: y|x, X, y. Black star denotes observed datapoints, the solid blue line denotes the mean of predictions, and cyan star denotes ground truth.
Figure 4: Concept learning. A concept defined by twoconstraints c0 : "Triangle is on the bottom of Circle"and c1 : "Circle is large". Top row: positive samplesand bottom row: negative samples. Clearly, if a modelonly captures c0, it can correctly distinguish positiveand negative samples. Similarly, models that capturec1 or c0 &c1 can do so as well.
Figure 5: Results on Concept learning. Our method is sample efficient in terms of (a) the number of data pointsobserved in each task and (b) the number of meta-training tasks. (c) Model distribution converges to the truedistribution, i.e., p(c0) → 0.5 andp(c1) → 0.5.
Figure 6: Qualitative examples for random traps. Green cells are traps. ∆ entropy means the change in H(a | s).
Figure 7: I(s). The first column is the environment with two categories, each has 20 images. The positiveobjects are highlighted in yellow edges. Column 2〜4 show how map I(S) changes as agents gather moreinformation. From step 0 to step 2, agents collect two positive objects at (6, 6), (5, 3). Based on the gatheredinformation, I(s) is updated accordingly. With the updated I (s), agents collect two more positive objects at(2, 4), (2, 5) without hitting negative objects.
Figure 8: Qualitative examples for “Predator” vs. “Prey”. In this setting, both agents are learned end-to-end. Wesample 2 sequences of consecutive moves (11, 0) → (17, 1) and (65, 21) → (77, 24) where (x, y) indicatesthe number of moves of “Predator” (green) and “Prey” (red). To save space, we skip several moves, e.g.,(31, 7) → (36, 7), but plot the last three moves with a lighter color to display the trajectory. In addition, wezoom in on the grid map and only plot 5 × 5 cells. Note that, in this setting, we also restrict “Prey” to move onlywhen “Predator” is a single step away.
