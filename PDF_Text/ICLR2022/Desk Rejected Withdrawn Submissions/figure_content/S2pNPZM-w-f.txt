Figure 1: An overview of ICGNN architectures(c) ICGRNNneural network (PICNN) can be considered. For clear explanation, we overload x so that it iscorresponding to the convex features and y denotes the features that is not required to be convex.
Figure 2: Heat diffusion prediction results(b) Average rollout prediction errorsaction trajectories length of 100 whose actions are sampled fromU(0.0, 50.0). Figure 2(b) visualizesthe averages prediction errors of the ICGRNN and GRNN models on the test dataset. As shown inFigure 2(a), both of the ICGRNN and GRNN can well predict the 10 future states as they are trainedto predict until 10 future steps. However, after the 10 steps, the prediction errors of GRNN starts todiverge while ICGRNN shows relatively stable prediction errors.
