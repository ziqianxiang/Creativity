Figure 1: Accuracy of SAM-5, SAM andvanilla ViT on ImageNet-1k. SAM-5 in-dicates the method that calculating SAMgradients every 5 steps.
Figure 2: Difference of gradients betweenevery 5 steps for gs, gh, and gv . gv thatleads to a smoother region changes muchslower than gs and gh .
Figure 4: Accuracy-Training Time of different models for LookSAM-k on ImageNet-Ik. With thegrowth of k value, the throughput is increasing but the accuracy starts to drop. There is a trade-offbetween the accuracy and training speed.
