Figure 1: The performance of existing methods and our proposal (IntNaCl & IntCl) in terms of theirstandard accuracy (x-axis) and adversarial accuracy under FGSM attacks = 0.002 (y-axis). Thetransfer performance refers to fine-tuning a linear layer for CIFAR10 with representation networkstrained on CIFAR100.
