Figure 1: Influence functions vs. retraining. a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i represent that we randomly masksingle, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60% of parameters.
Figure 2: Feature importance distribution map. The importance of each feature in the binaryclassifier. The lighter the color, the more important the feature is. (a). The binary classifier ofMNIST dataset 0 and 8. (b). The binary classifier of MNIST dataset 1 and 4. (c). The binaryclassifier of MNIST dataset 1 and 7.
