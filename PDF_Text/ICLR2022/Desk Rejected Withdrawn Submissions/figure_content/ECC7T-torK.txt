Figure 1: Transferability evaluation of adversarial examples generated with ResNet18 as the surrogatesaved at different epochs in untargeted (left) and targeted(right) settings on CIFAR10 dataset.
Figure 2: Transferability evaluation of adversarial examples generated with ResNet18 as the surrogatemodel deleted at every convolution layer(left) and last layer(right), on CIFAR10 dataset with targetedI-FGSM attack.
Figure 3: Transferability evaluation for adversarial examples generated on early-stopped surrogatemodels Sn and evaluated on early-stopped target models Tn. Left: The same ResNet18 with thesame model parameters as surrogate and target model. Center: Two separately trained ResNet18architectures(ResNet18-A, ResNet18-B) for surrogate and target model. Right: ResNet18 as thesurrogate model and VGG16 as the target model. Each entry represents the target model accuracyevaluated on the obtained adversarial examples from Sn . The experiments were performed forCIFAR10 and the I-FGSM attack.
Figure 4: Transferability of adversarial examples generated for a robust ResNet18 as the surrogatemodel. Left: Transferability for an adversarially trained model with l∞-PGD with =8/255 forCIFAR10. Right: Transferability for an adversarially trained model with l∞-FGSM with =1/255 forImageNet. The transferability is evaluated for the adversarial examples obtained from the modelsduring different adversarial training stages of the surrogate model. The adversarial examples weregenerated with an untargeted I-FGSM. The results are reported in the untargeted ASR.
