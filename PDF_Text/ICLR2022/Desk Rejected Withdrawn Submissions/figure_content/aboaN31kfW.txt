Figure 2: Our causal triple attention time series forecasting model (CTTT) contains two parts, i.e.,the representation model and the prediction model. The representation model is used for learningthe representation vector for each time point, which utilizes gated residual network to select rele-vant features and gated linear units to suppress unnecessary information. The prediction model is aencoder-decoder recurrent network with LSTM cells to predict the target values based on the rep-resentation vectors learned from the representation model. Three attention modules are deployed tohelp model capture the local and global information and mitigate the confounding effect.
Figure 3: The transformed series item and covariates are input to learn the representation vectorsand then to estimate the temporal and pattern attention.
