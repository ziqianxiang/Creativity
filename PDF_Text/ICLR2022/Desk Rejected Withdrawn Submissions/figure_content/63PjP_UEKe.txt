Figure 1: Illustration of cross domain ensemble distillation (XDED). To alleviate overfitting onsource domains, XDED produces the soft target as a class-wise ensemble of predictive distributionsof samples from different domains, which contains meaningful errors from multiple domains.
Figure 2: Analysis of our framework. Left: Train/Test losses versus the weight perturbation withvarying Ïƒ . Note that the loss values are log-scaled, Right: The divergence (A-distance) betweenthe source domains and the target domain.
Figure 3: Test accuracy (%) on target domains with input deformations. All models are trainedunder the multi-source domain generalization setting.
Figure 4: The learning curve on the target domain. On PACS, models are trained on the sourcedomains (Cartoon, Sketch and Photo) and evaluated on the target domain (Art Painting).
