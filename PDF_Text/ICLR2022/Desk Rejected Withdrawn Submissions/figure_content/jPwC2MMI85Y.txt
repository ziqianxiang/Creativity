Figure 2: Overall architecture of MolHMPN3	MethodologyThis section highlights the methodology of the proposed MolHMPN. In MolHMPN, the hypergraphsare first constructed using the prior knowledge of functional groups. The graph and constructedhypergraphs are then embedded using the HyperMP layer(s) so as to modify the membership ofthe hyperedges using the computed embeddings. The graph and modified hypergraphs are thenembedded again using the HyperMP layer(s) to predict the target label with the updated embedding.

Comparing MolHMPN with the PAIR models, we can see thatthe inclusion of higher-order connectivities is indeed beneficial for the tasks as MolHMPN has out-performed the models for five out of eight datasets. From the SUB results, we can see that MolHMPNoutperforms the other baselines for three out of six datasets. Also, although ML-MPNN has inte-grated information from the nodes, edges, subgraphs and graphs, MolHMPN has outperformed it for
