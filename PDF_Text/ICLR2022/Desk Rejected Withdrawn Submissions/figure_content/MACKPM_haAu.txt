Figure 1: Demonstration of proposed Variable Step-Size Attack (VSA) method. At first, adversarialpoints take a step with reduced step-size in gradient direction. Then, points that fall out of theoriginal pointsâ€™ boundaries are projected back. This process is repeated at each step.
Figure 2: Adversarial Samples generated by each method with (, n) set to reach 25% attack successrate. For each method, first column represents low n and high and second column represents highn and low . Red points represent adversarial points and Blue points represent original points.
