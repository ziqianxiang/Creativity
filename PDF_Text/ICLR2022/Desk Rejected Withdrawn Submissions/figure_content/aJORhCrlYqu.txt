Figure 1: Data timeline and different phases ofARMCMC algorithm. For algorithm at timet: Phase (A) Data collection [we pack Ns datapoints for the next algorithm time step], Phase(B) Adjusting [the method is applying to the mostrecent data pack], (C) Execution [after the minevaluation of algorithm, the results will be up-dated on parameters posterior distribution andany byproduct value of interest].
Figure 2: Kmin with respect to λ for some valuesof , δ in ARMCMC. (for λ = 1 evaluation forARMCMC is equivalent to MCMC)P(Dt ∣θt, DtT) is the likelihood function which is obtained by sampling from the one-step-aheadprediction:Ytlt-1 = F (Dt-1,θt),	(4)where Yt|t-1 is a sample from the prediction of the output in (1). If the model in (4) is accurate, thenthe difference between the real output and predicted should be measurement noise, (i.e., Y t|t-1 -Yt|t-1 = ν). Therefore, the model parameter may be updated as follows:tm +Ns +1P(Dt∣θt,Dt-1) =	Y	PV(ΥtltT- Yt1t-1),	(5)t=tm+1where Pν is the probability distribution of noise. Note that there is no restriction on the type of noiseprobability distribution.
