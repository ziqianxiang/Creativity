Table 2: Details for linear regression sinusoidal covariate shift problem.
Table 3: Details for linear regression sinusoidal covariate shift problem. Rather than choosing afrequency f and using it directly as in Table 2, we use f together with the stationary distributionvariance 0.1 to compute AR(2) coefficients φ1, φ2.
