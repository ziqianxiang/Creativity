Table 1: Results of evaluating RMC. We also evaluate the static base model for comparison. Bold numbers areworst results.
Table 2: Results of evaluating DENT on CIFAR-10. We also evaluate the static base model for comparison.
Table 3: Results of evaluating DANN. Bold numbers are worst results.
Table 4: Results of evaluating TADV. Bold numbers are worst results.
Table 5: Results of evaluating DENT on CIFAR-10 under the adversarially-ordered game. Bold numbers areworst results.
Table 6: Results of evaluating RMC. We also evaluate the static base model for comparison. We report the meanand standard deviation of the accuracy or robustness (meanÂ±std) over the five random runs of the experiment.
