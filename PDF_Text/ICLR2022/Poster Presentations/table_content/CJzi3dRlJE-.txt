Table 1: Definitions and constraints for the LVM variants. We evaluated a total of 9 model variants. Acrossthese variants, we explored two methods of modeling chemical synapses: current-based and conductance-based(Sec. 2.1). We also tested several different levels of connectome constraint. (Sec. 2.6). For both the chemicalsynapse Wjci and electrical synapses Wjei, the weight matrix Wji = αTjiMji, where Tji is the sparsity matrix,Mji is the matrix of connection magnitudes, and α is a global scalar. Trainable parameters are indicated by a X.
Table 2: Holdout evaluation results. We performed neuron holdout evaluations on each of the 107 measuredneuron pairs in the dataset, and report the average correlation coefficient between the predicted and measuredfluorescence traces (Sec. 3.2). We also performed worm holdout evaluations, witholding 6 of the 21 individualsfrom the training (Sec. 3.3). For the worm holdouts, we report several metrics: correlation coefficient, ELBO,reconstruction loss, and KL divergence. Overall, the conductance-based model under connectome countconstraint produced the best predictions among the 9 models.
Table 3: Inter-consistency and connectome-consistency. Correlation between multiple modelweights with different initializations, and correlation coefficient between model weights and connec-tome counts. Evaluations are performed for models fitted on a single worm and across current-basedand conductance-based models with different levels of connectome constraints. The CC-LVM ismore consistent among different random initializations and more highly correlated to the connectomecounts.
