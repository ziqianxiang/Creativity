Table 1: Overall performance. RvS conditioned on goal states (RvS-G) is state-of-the-art in the AntMaze, Kitchen, and GCSL suites. RvS conditioned on rewards(RvS-R) performs worse at these tasks, highlighting the importance of the conditioning variable. In Gym, RvS-R matches the performance of Decision Transformerwhile only using an MLP. *For the sake of completeness, we include CQL-p, TD3+BC, and Onestep numbers that use AntMaze version v0. See Appendix A formore discussion of this and other experiment details.
Table 2: Hyperparameters. Architecture and design parameters that we found to work best in eachdomain. We define an epoch length to include all start-goal pairs in GCSL, i.e., to be |D| H2 . InD4RL, We set all epoch lengths at 2000 (520) = 2450000.
