For most datasets, the detected interactions can help improvethe predictive performance and significantly reduce the model size, see Table 3 for detailed results.

We preprocessed the datasets as follows. For Parkinsonsdata, we remove the column motor UPDRS and predict the total UPDRS. For SkillCraft data, the18Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2022target is set to be LeagueIndex. For the Bike sharing data, the feature weather is converted into a one-hot representation. Before feeding the data into neural networks, we performed data normalizationfirst for all datasets.
