Table 1: Accuracy and speed comparison. MLP indicates the baseline coordMLP. S and P refer toSIREN and PE respectively. A refers to accelerated training with our sampling method (Sec. 3.2).
Table 2: Accuracy and speed comparison for MLP training. MLP indicates the baseline coordMLP.
Table 3: Accuracy and speed comparison for MLP inference. PSNR is used as the quantitativemetric. (Scores for EDSR-baseline-LIIF are from the original paper.) The speed here is the averagetime to finish processing all images in the DIV2K valid set with Ã—2 scale.
Table 4: Accuracy and speed comparison. When Df = 5, CoordX becomes the baseline coordMLP.
Table 5: Image fitting with larger CoordX models. The inference speed is the average time toinference a synthetic 1024x1024 image 100 times.
Table 6: Quality comparison between different fusion strategies. Prod, sum and concat denotemultiplicative modulation, additive modulation and concatenation. S and P refer to SIREN and PErespectively.
Table 7: Rendering time comparison for different volumetric rendering method.
Table 8: Quantitative comparison between baseline NeRF and our CoordX NeRF. The speeds in thetable are tested on the Lego scene.
