Table A.1: Model hyperparameters for the four basic models used. Con-Dil-ResNet and Con-TF-Nethave the same architectural parameters as Dil-ResNet and TF-Net, respectively, with the addedconstraint weighted by the constraint weight. Note that spatial filter kernel for TF-Net is differentfrom the kernel size in the first row: this spatial filter is applied during the decomposition in theTF-net model.
Table B.1: Dataset details. œÅ refers to density, P to pressure, and vx, vy, vz to velocity components.
Table B.2: Number of parameters per model.
