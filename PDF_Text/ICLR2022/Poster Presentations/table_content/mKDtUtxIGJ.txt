Table 1: Quantitative results of point cloud reconstruction. Note that PC, PU, PD representpoint completion (Xiang et al., 2021), point upsampling (Li et al., 2021), and point denoising (Luo& Hu, 2021), respectively. Please refer to the appendix for more results.
Table 2: Ablation study of our point cloud reconstruction network. In (a), PE* indicatespositional encoding from NeRF Mildenhall et al. (2020). In (b), S-hourglass represents the voxelgeneration network. Self-attn and Cross-attn mean self-attention layers and cross-attention layers,respectively. The evaluation is conduced in ShapeNet-Part dataset under lvox=0.02, Pin=2048.
Table 3: Additional quantitative results. We measure the quality of point reconstruction fromours, point completion (PC) (Xiang et al., 2021), point denoising (PD) (Luo & Hu, 2021) and pointupsampling (PU) (Li et al., 2021) using typical criteria: chamfer distance (Fan et al., 2017) andpercentage metric that consists of accuracy (Acc.) and completeness (Comp.) and f -score (Jensenet al., 2014). For fair comparison, we test various conditions by changing the number of input pointcloud Pin, the upsample ratio r, and voxel size lvox. Note that identical colors mean the results fromthe same pre-trained weights for each method.
