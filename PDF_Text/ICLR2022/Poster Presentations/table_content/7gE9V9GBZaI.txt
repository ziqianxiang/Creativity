Table 1: Test accuracy (%) of several methods on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN under the '∞ norm With= 8/255 based on the ResNet-18 architecture. We choose the best checkpoint according to the highest robustaccuracy on the test set under PGD-10.
Table 2: Test accuracy (%) of the proposed method and other methods on CIFAR-10 under the '∞ norm with= 8/255 based on the ResNet-18 architecture.
Table A.1: The training accuracy, test accuracy, and generalization gap (%) of TRADES when trained on true orrandom labels, with and without explicit regularizations, including data augmentation (random crop and flip),weight decay (0.0002), and dropout (0.2).
Table C.1: Test accuracy (%) of several methods using different model architectures and threat models. Wechoose the best checkpoint according to the highest robust accuracy on the test set under PGD-10.
Table C.2: Test accuracy (%) of several methods on CIFAR-10 under the '∞ norm With ethe ResNet-18 architecture. We show the mean/std of the results over 3 runs.
