Table 1: Averaged normalized scores on MuJoCo locomotion and Ant Maze tasks. Our method outper-forms prior methods on the challenging Ant Maze tasks, which require dynamic programming, and iscompetitive with the best prior methods on the locomotion tasks.
Table 2: Online finetuning results showing the initial perfor-mance after offline RL, and performance after 1M steps of on-line RL. In all tasks, IQL is able to finetune to a significantlyhigher performance than the offline initialization, with final per-formance that is comparable to or better than the best of eitherAWAC or CQL on all tasks except pen-binary-v0.
