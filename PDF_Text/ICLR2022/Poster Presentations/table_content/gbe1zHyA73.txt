Table 1: Experimental Results for PDL and LV data. The presented metric for parameter evaluation is therMAE reported in %. Pred. columns report the prediction log MSE on trajectories on test set.
Table 2: Results for Adv+S and Natl data. We report the MSE (× 100) on the predicted observations T , thevelocity fields U and the source term S over 6 time steps on test set.
Table 3: Ablation Study on Adv+S. We report the MSE (× 100) on the predicted observations T , the velocityfields U and the source term S over 6 time steps. “Joint” rows refer to the simultaneous optim. of hk and hu.
Table 4: Ablation Study on Adv+S. We report the MSE (× 100) on the predicted observations T , the estimatedvelocity fields U and the residual source term S over 6 and 20 time steps from an initial datum t0. Unlikealternate training, i.e. Algorithm 1, “Joint” rows refer to the simultaneous optimization of hk and hu .
