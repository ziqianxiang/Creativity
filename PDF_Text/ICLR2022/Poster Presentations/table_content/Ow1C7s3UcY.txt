Table 1: We convert the native Onshape numerical parame-ters to the above forms for modeling. Subscripts of 1, mid,and 2 indicate start, mid, and endpoints, respectively.
Table 2: Primitive model evaluation. Nega-tive test log-likelihood in bits/primitive andbits/sketch. Next-step prediction accuracy(per-token avg.) is also provided. Standarddeviation across 5 replicates in parentheses.
Table 3: Image-conditional primitive models evalu-ated on real hand-drawn sketches. NLL and predic-tive accuracy (per-token avg.) metrics are shown forthree models trained with different data augmentationschemes.
Table 4: Constraint model evaluation with per-tokenperplexity and accuracy. A model trained on noiselessdata degrades substantially in the presence of noise.
Table 5: Additional evaluations of the primitive model. Unconditional (perm. test) denotes theprimitive model trained on standard data but evaluated on a randomly permuted dataset.
Table 6: Mapping for both primitive types (left) and constraint types (right) to the reserved set of value tokensfor each model. The tokens 0, 1, and 2 are used in both models for padding, start, and stop, respectively.
