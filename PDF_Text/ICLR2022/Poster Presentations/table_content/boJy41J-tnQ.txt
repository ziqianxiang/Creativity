Table 1: Multi-Session FSCIL weighted average of accuracy(%) results on miniImageNet using an identical setup to Fig. 2with memory distinction. We report the average results over 10random splits of the data for incremental sessions 1, 2 and 8.
Table 2: miniImageNet 64+5-way and tieredImageNet 200+5-way single-session results. We follow previouswork in reporting the average of accuracies of base and novel samples over all classes rather than weightedaverage. In addition to accuracy, we report a quantity labeled ∆ by Ren et al. (2019), which is the gap betweenindividual accuracies and joint accuracies of both base and novel samples averaged. Lower values of ∆ arebetter. Bold numbers are not significantly different from the best result in each column under a paired t-test(p < 0.05 after Bonferroni correction). All results are averaged across 2000 runs.
Table 3: miniImageNet weighted average results across multiple sessions showcasing theusefulness of Rold in reducing catastrophic forgetting across multiple sessions for -M setting.
Table 4: miniImageNet +M results across multiple sessions in tabular form. Initial number of baseclasses is 60 and 5 new classes are introduced at every session. Results are on the test set thatgrows with the increasing number of classes. In the last session we evaluate over all 100 classes.
Table 5: miniImageNet -M results across multiple sessions in tabular form. Initial number of baseclasses is 60 and 5 new classes are introduced at every session. Results are on the test set thatgrows with the increasing number of classes. The last session is evaluated over all 100 classes.
Table 6: miniImageNet validation set accuracy with two ResNet-18 architectures with slightdifferences as listed in Appendix D. Overall performances are comparable.
