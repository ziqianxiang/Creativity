Table 1: Result of reaction product prediction on USPTO-479k dataset. The best results are high-lighted in bold and the best results of baselines are highlighted with underline.
Table 2: Result of RMSE in GED pre-diction. The best results are highlightedin bold.
Table 3: Result of AUC in molecule property prediction. The result in the first four blocks is takenfrom (Honda et al., 2019), (Chithrananda et al., 2020), (Fabian et al., 2020), and (Xu et al., 2021),respectively, while the result in the last two blocks is reported by us. The best results are highlightedin bold, and the best results of baselines are highlighted with underline if MolR is the best.
