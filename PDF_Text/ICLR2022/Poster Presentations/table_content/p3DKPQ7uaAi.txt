Comparison on MSE between ground-truths andpredicted alignments by the supervised learned TAP (TAP-s) and SoftDTW (SoftDTW-s) is shownin the left part of Tab. 4. f in TAP can also be directly learned by minimizing MSE on the trainingset via augmentations. We directly apply TAP learned in this way and SoftDTW to align the originaltest sequences and their augmentations. Results are shown in the right part of Tab. 4. Details of theevaluation methods are presented in Appendix A.8. In both cases, TAP achieves lower MSEs.

We compare the self-supervised learned TAP with8 alignment-based sequence distances in the retrieval and classification tasks, including DTW,length-normalized DTW (lDTW), matching step-normalized DTW (nDTW), optimal transport(OT) (Kolouri et al., 2017), Sinkhorn (Cuturi, 2013), TCOT (Su & Hua, 2019), OPW (Su & Hua,2019), and SoftDTW (Cuturi & Blondel, 2017). We follow the setting in (Su & Hua, 2019) anddirectly compare with the results reported in Su & Hua (2019). The comparisons on the MSR Ac-tion3D and MSR Activity3D datasets are shown in Table 6 and Table 7, respectively. We observethat TAP generally outperforms other distances on the MSR Activity3D dataset, but performs worse
