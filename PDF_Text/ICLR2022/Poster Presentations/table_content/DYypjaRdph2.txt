Table 1: Problems considered in related work, noting the relationship between both input and output.
Table 2: Action prediction performance. Com-parison of methods on transplant offer acceptances.
Table 4: Medical examples performance. Comparison of methods on three different medicaldatasets. Performance of the policy is evaluated on the quality of action matching against a held outtest set of demonstrations. We report the area under the receiving operator characteristic curve (AUC)and average precision score (APS).
