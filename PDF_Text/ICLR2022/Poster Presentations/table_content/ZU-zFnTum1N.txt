Table 1: Sample complexities of the representative PG algorithms based on mirror descent algo-rithm for finding an -stationary policy of the nonconcave performance function. Although Liuet al. (2019); Shani et al. (2020) have provided the global convergence of TRPO and PPO undersome specific policies based on convex mirror descent, they still obtain a stationary point of noncon-cave performance function. Note that our convergence analysis does not rely any specific policies.
