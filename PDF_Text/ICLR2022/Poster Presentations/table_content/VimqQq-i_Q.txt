Table 2: Percentiles of metrics across clients on six federated tasks. We observe that the unpartici-pating clients tend to exhibit longer tails on the lower side of accuracy. For example, the participatingclients of EMNIST-10 have perfect (100%) accuracy even for clients at the 5th percentile, whereasthe unparticipating clients only achieve 91.7%.
