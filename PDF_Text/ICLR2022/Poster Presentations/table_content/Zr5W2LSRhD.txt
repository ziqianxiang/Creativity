Table 1: The configurations of the provably 1-Lipschitz architecture with L convolution layers. Itconsists of 5 blocks. Each block contains two groups of convolution layers. The first group contains(L/5 - 1) convolution layers of stride 1, and the second group contains a single convolution layerof stride 2. The output size decreases to 1/2 after each block. conv [k, c, s] denotes the convolutionwith the kernel of spatial size k Ã— k, output channels c, stride s. The dilation of a convolution layeris n/k where n is the spatial size of the input, and k is the spatial size of the convolution kernel.

Table 3: Ablation on implementing the first l blocks by SOC and the last 5 - l blocks by our ECOconvolution. We use LipConvnet-5 model.
Table 4: Comparisons between SOC (Singla & Feizi, 2021b) and our ECO convolution on theevaluation time on the third convolution block. LC denotes LipConvnet. In evaluation, we set thebatch size as 128 and the evaluation is conducted on a single V100 GPU.
