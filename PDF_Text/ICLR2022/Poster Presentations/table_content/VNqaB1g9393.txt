Table 6: Ablations on PASCAL VOC to Clipart. Note that no bounding box adaptation is adoptedin (a) and (c) for a fair comparison. (a) Category adaptation. w/o condition: use a class-independentdiscriminator. w/o bg proposals: no background proposals added to source domain or target domainor neither. w/o weight: remove the weight mechanism in Equation 3. w/o adaptor: remove thecategory adaptation step and directly use the labels generated from detector on the target domain aspseudo labels. (b) Spatial Adaptation. w/o DD: remove the disparity discrepancy in Equation 6. w/oadaptor: remove the bounding box adaptation step and only trains the classification branch of thedetector. (c) Training strategy. In the standard training, if the confidence threshold increases, thenumber of false negatives will increase, otherwise the number of false positives will increase.
