Table 1: MPC with the true reward function, MuJoCo simulator/pre-trained dynamics model and fixedGaussian/pre-trained proposals. We present best results from large sweeps over planner hyper parameters,compute budget, planner horizon and Gaussian proposal variance. Results use a horizon of 30 time-steps, 2000samples and are averaged over 100 episodes. For further details, see Sec. F.1. * indicates settings where we sawnumerical issues with ground truth model and the CEM planner.
