Table 1: Convex landscape and interpretation of WGAN with two-layer discriminator under different dis-criminator activation functions and generator architectures. Note that adding a linear skip connection to thediscriminator imposes an additional mean matching constraint when using quadratic activation.
Table 2: Notation used throughout the paper.
Table 3: FID results of progressive training of linear generators and two-layer quadratic-activationdiscriminators using both the convex approach and the non-convex baseline. Results are reportedover three runs.
