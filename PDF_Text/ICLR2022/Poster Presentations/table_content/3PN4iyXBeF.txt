Table 1: Cost of finding an e-accurate solution as measured by E[L(χk)-L*]∧2-1μE [∣∣xk-x?『]when L is μ-strongly-convex (SC) and k Pk=I E ]▽£(Xi)『]When L is non-convex (NC). Thesettings (D) and (S) stand for the deterministic and stochastic settings. The cost corresponds to thetotal number of gradients, Jacobian and Hessian-vector products used by the algorithm. κL and κgare the conditioning numbers of L and g whenever applicable. The dependence on κL and κg forTTSA and AccBio are derived in Proposition 11 of Appendix A.4. The rate of MRBO/VRBO isobtained under the additional mean-squared smoothness assumption (Arjevani et al., 2019).
