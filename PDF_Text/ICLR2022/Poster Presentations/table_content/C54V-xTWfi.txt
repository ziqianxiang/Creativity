Table 1: Ablation studies on the KITTI validation set. SF, OF, and OR denote the scene-leveldistillation in feature space, the object-level distillation in feature space, and the object-level distil-lation in result space, respectively. Besides, FF means the attention based feature fusion strategy.
Table 2: Evaluation on the KITTI validation set for detailed design choice. OF and OR representthe object-level distillation in feature space and the object-level distillation in result space.
Table 3: Comparison of state-of-the-art methods on the KITTI test set. Methods are ranked bymoderate setting. We highlight the best results in bold and the second place in underlined. OnlyRGB images are required as input in the inference phase for all listed methods. *: need dense depthmaps or LiDAR signals for training. 1: our baseline model without confidence normalization.
Table 4: Performance of the Car category on the KITTI validation set. We highlight the bestresults in bold and the second place in Underlined. 1: our baseline model without confidence nor-malization.
Table 5: Cross-model evaluation on the KITTI validation set. We extract each required item(location, dimension, orientation, and confidence) from the baseline model (B) and the full model(O), and evaluate them in a cross-model manner.
