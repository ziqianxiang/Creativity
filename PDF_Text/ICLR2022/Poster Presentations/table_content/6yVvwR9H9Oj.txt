Table 1: A Comparison of mean accuracies (%). We alter the imbalance ratio γ of labeled data andleave the unlabeled data balanced (γu = 1). We keep Nmax = γ so that the least number of labeleddata among all the classes is always 1.
Table 2: The individual performance of our proposed Class-Aware Propensity (CAP) and Class-Aware Imputation (CAI) alone and together in trivial combination (w/o CADR) and CADR combi-nation (w/ CADR). We marked the best and Second-best accuracies.
Table 3: Comparison with multiple base-line methods. Experiments are conductedon CIFAR-10 (γ = Nmax = 50).
Table 4: Comparisons of average accuracies with labels missing completely at random (MCAR).
Table 6: Evaluation with different threshold co-efficient β for CAI. “label” means following thedistribution of the labeled data. Experiments areconducted on CIFAR-10 (γ = Nmax = 50).
Table 5: Evaluation with varying moving av-eraging coefficient μ for CAP. Experimentsare conducted on CIFAR-10 (γ = Nmax =50).
