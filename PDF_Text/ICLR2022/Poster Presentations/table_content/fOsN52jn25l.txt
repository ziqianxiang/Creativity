Table 1: Comparisons between DLTH and other settings. Base model, One/Multiple,Controllability, Transformation, and Pretrain represent where to pick subnetwork,if the setting finds one specific subnetwork or studies randomly selected subnetworks, if sparsestructure is controllable, if the selected subnetwork needs transformation before finetuning, and ifpretraining dense network is needed, respectively.
Table 2: Performance comparison of ResNet56 on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets using 50%,70%, 90%, 95%, and 98% sparsity ratios. Except for the L1 row, the highest/second highest perfor-mancs are emphasized with red/blud fonts.
