Table 1: Experiment results on CIFAR-10. Different metrics are used to evaluate the machineunlearning performance, including the classification errors on the remaining set Sr, removed setSf, and test set Stest, the knowledge removal estimators εM, and the membership inference attack(MIA) accuracy on Sf . Every experiment is repeated 5 times. The results show that the proposedMCMC unlearning algorithm beats baseline methods in almost every experiments settings.
Table 2: Experiment results on Fashion-MNIST. Different metrics are used to evaluate the machineunlearning performance, including the classification errors on the remaining set Sr, removed setSf, and test set Stest, the knowledge removal estimators εM, and the membership inference attack(MIA) accuracy on Sf . Every experiment is repeated 5 times.
Table 3: The results of prediction differences on CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST. The predictiondifferences between the retrained model and the processed model are calculated on the remainingset Sr, removed set Sf, and test set Stest, respectively.
