Table 1: The consistency of counterfactuals measured by invalidation rates. The average `2 cost of differentmethods are also included. Results are aggregated over 100 networks for each experiment (RS and LOO).
Table 2: Hyper-parameters and Success Rate for each baseline methods. adp. denotes that the stepsize for each iteration is 2*ã€ƒmax_steps.
Table 3: Invalidation Rates with standard deviations for each datasets and each re-training situations.
Table 4: `1 and `2 costs of counterfactuals with standard deviations.
