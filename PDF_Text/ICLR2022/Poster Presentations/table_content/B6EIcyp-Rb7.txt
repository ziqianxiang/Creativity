Table 1: Object dynamics for planning, where the transi-tion models and observation encoders are independentlyparameterized for a total of K objects.
Table 2: Normalized testing scores and averaged improvement (â†‘) over DQN in six difficulty levels (0to 5). For each method, we implement three independent runs (check random seeds in Appendix A.1).
