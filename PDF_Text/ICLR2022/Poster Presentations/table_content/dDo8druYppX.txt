Table 1: Symbols for few-shot classification and 3D reconstruction. Rows shown in blue are items3D shape reconstruction has but few-shot classification does not.
Table 2: Reconstruction results on ShapeNet. We compare our results withPixel2Mesh(P2M) (Wang et al., 2018), AtlasNet(AN) (Groueix et al., 2018), Occ-Net(ON) (Mescheder et al., 2019), SIF (Genova et al., 2019), CvxNet(CN) (Deng et al.,2019) and Hypernetwork(HN) (Littwin & Wolf, 2019). Best results are shown in bold.
Table 3: Ablation study. We show (a) IoU ↑, (b) ChamferJ and (c) F-SCore ↑ for different N and w.
Table 4: Results of different base learners: SVM vs Ridge Regression (RR).
Table 5: Different backbones. ENB1: EfficientNet-B1. RN34: ResNet-34. RN50: Resnet-50.
Table 6: Different embeddings. Spa: (3D) spatial embeddings. Other columns: trained withlinear ridge regression of different embedding dimensions (32, 64 and 128).
