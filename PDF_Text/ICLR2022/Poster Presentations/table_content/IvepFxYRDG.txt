Table 1: Summary of sample complexity of algorithms for solving discounted infinite-horizon zero-sum Markov games. (|S | is the number of states. Amax is the maximum number of actions betweenthe players. μmin is the lower bound of state stationary distribution. Y is the discount factor.)Work	Model -free	Private update	Symmetric update	Data type	Sample complexity (duality gap ≤ )Zou et al. (2019)	X	×	X	Markovian	-Zhao et al. (2021)	X	X	X	i.i.d.	-Guo et al.
