Table 5: Report of data compressing: QoI data represent original data of the variables of interest;Embedding represents the saved embedding vectors from the GMR (encoder); Decoder is the savedGMUS model which is used to decode the embeddings; Compression Ratio is the ratio of QoI datasize to the sum of the embedding and decoder sizes. The RMSE is the relative mean square error ofthe reconstructed data from embedding.
