Table 1: Summary of the experimental datasets that entail diverse distribution shifts ("ArtificialTransformation" means that we add synthetic spurious features, "Cross-Domain Transfers" meansthat each graph in the dataset corresponds to distinct domains, "Temporal Evolution" means thatthe dataset is a dynamic one with evolving nature), different train/val/test splits ("Domain-Level"means splitting by graphs and "Time-Aware" means splitting by time) and the evaluation metrics. inAppendix E we provide more detailed information and discussions on the evaluation protocols.
Table 2: Test accuracy on FB-100 where we compare different configurations of training graphs.
Table 3: Test accuracy on OGB-Arxiv with pa-pers in different time intervals for evaluation.
Table 4: Statistic information for Twitch-Explicit datasets.
