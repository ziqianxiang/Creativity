Table 3: Zero-shot probing performance after T5 models are continually pretrained on different subsets ofCC -RecentNews. NLE and IL stand for NewLAMA-Easy and InvariantLAMA, respectively. There arethree scenarios according to the corpus used for continual pretraining, explained in the text of Section 5.2. TheFUAR of the three scenarios is calculated differently, and the corresponding tasks are shown in the table as theparameters of FUAR: TF, TnU, and TnA . In this setting, TF consists of only a single task T0F (IL) measuring thetime-invariant information lost from D0 only. For SMALL, we calculate the gap on NLE using the weightedsum of the gaps on NLEP1 and NLEP2 with uniform weights.

Howard University sixC Experimental ConfigurationPretraining Congifuration We utilize the T5 initially pretrained on C4 (April 2019) and contin-ually pretrained with salient span masking (Guu et al., 2020) on Wikipedia (May 2020) as initial-ization. We use the checkpoints from Wolf et al. (2020). We also perform the SSM objective duringCKL because it was shown to help LMs “focus on problems that require world knowledge” (Guuet al., 2020; Roberts et al., 2020).
Table 7: Result of T5-Vanilla and T5-Kadapters continually pretrained with various learning rates. The exper-iments are done under the setting of SMALL scenario in Table 3, thus D0 are C4 (April 2019) and Wikipedia(May 2020), and D1 is CC-RECENTNEWS-SMALL. Each ofIL and NLE stands for INVARIANTLAMA andNEWLAMA-EASY. The parameters of FUAR are TF, T1U, and T1A, the tasks measuring the amount of time-invariant knowledge from corpus D0, updated knowledge from D1, and newly acquired knowledge from D1,respectively.
