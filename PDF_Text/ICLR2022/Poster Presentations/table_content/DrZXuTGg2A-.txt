Table 1: The guarantees proved in this paper. d is the dimension of the parameter space Θ, ε isthe privacy parameter, and n is the number of data points. For neatness, this table omits the non-private 1∕√n term, logarithmic terms, and other parameters like Lipschitz constants, parameter spacediameter, and smoothness. Full statements appear in the referenced theorems.
