Table 1: Graph Value Iteration results. We report the average MAPE and policy predictionaccuracies (in %) of different ns and na combinations with 500 repeats per combination. All metricsare measured per graph.
Table 2: Graph classification results (accuracy in %). All benchmark results are reproduced fromthe original papers except IGNN.
Table 3: Graph classification results (accuracy in %).
Table 4: Graph Value Iteration results over the different fθ(∙) architecture. We report the averageMAPE and policy prediction accuracies (in %) of different ns and na combinations. All metrics aremeasured per graph. ± shows the standard deviation of the metrics.
Table 5: Transition map ablation. We report the average MAPE and policy prediction accuracies (in%) of different ns and na combinations with 500 repeats per combination. All metrics are measuredper graph. ± shows the standard deviation of the metrics.
Table 6: γ ablations. We report the average MAPE and policy prediction accuracies (in %) ofdifferent ns and na combinations with 500 rePeats Per combination. All metrics are measured PergraPh. ± shows the standard deviation of the metrics. All metrics are measured Per graPh.
Table 7: Graph Value Iteration results over the non-linear and linear transition maps. We reportthe average MAPE and policy prediction accuracies (in %) of different ns and na combinations. Allmetrics are measured per graph. ± shows the standard deviation of the metrics.
