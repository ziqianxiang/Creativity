Table 6: Pitch and periodicity error for a varying number of stepsWe compute the pitch and periodicity error of HiFi-GAN and CARGAN at 0.5 million and 2.5million steps. For HiFi-GAN, training to 2.5 million steps takes about one month on an RTX A6000GPU. We use the same 256 examples from VCTK and DAPS as used for objective evaluation inSection 5.2. Results are presented in Table 6. We see that CARGAN outperforms HiFi-GAN atboth 0.5 million and 2.5 million steps. Given the shorter training time and proportional pitch andperiodicity errors, we use 0.5 million steps for all other experiments.

These are objective metrics inspired by the FrechetIncePtion Distance (Heusel et al., 2017) and are meant to aPProximate subjective Preference bycomParing distances between embeddings of real and generated audio Produced by the DeePSPeech2 sPeech recognition system (Amodei et al., 2016). We use the Public imPlementation of thesedistances Published by the original authors. This imPlementation requires at least 10,000 samPlesPer condition. To obtain these samPles, we samPle 40 random one-second chunks from each ofthe 256 examPles from the VCTK and DAPS datasets used for objective evaluation. Results onVCTK are Presented in Table 8 and results on DAPS are Presented in Table 9. Note that the PublicimPlementation rePorts a limited Precision for KDSD and cKDSD. ComParing these results to oursubjective evaluation in Table 4, we find that the only statistically significant comParison that is alsoreflected in the DeePSPeech distances is between CARGAN and the - Prepend ablation. Therefore,the DeePSPeech distances do not seem to be an adequate indicator of subjective quality when theconditions are as close in subjective quality and naturalness as the ones considered in this PaPer.
