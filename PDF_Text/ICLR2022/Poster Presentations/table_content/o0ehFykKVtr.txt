Table 1: World prediction evaluations, reported as average world region PSNR and SSIM over 5timesteps. We compare against conventional models that use image and/or state (VF and VF+State).
Table 2: Zero-shot control results. All models are trained on a single robot (WidOWX200) unlessdenoted otherwise. Note the CycleGAN baseline is trained on 12k images of the test-time robot.

Table 4: Adding an additional view improves pick-and-place performance.
Table 5: Zero-shot video prediction results to a modified WidowX200 in simulation. The modifiedWidowX200 has different color and/or link lengths.
