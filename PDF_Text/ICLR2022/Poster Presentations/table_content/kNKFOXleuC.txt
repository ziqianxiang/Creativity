Table 1: Accuracy (mIoU) and inference computation (GFLOPs) for Cityscapes semantic segmenta-tion with four exits. Our approach achieves higher accuracy in less computation than the HRNet andMDEQ baselines across exits. Early exiting (EE) makes progressive predictions. Redesigned heads(RH) improve early predictions (exits 1 and 2). Confidence Adaptivity (CA) reduces computation.
Table 2: Accuracy (PCKh@0.5) and computation (GFLOPs) on MPII pose estimation at the lastexit and averaged for all exits. Early exits (EE) make progress predictions, redesigned heads (RH)improve accuracy, and confidence adaptivity (CA) reduces computation.
