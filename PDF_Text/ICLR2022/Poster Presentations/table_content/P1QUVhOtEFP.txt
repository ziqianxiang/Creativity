Table 1: Summarization of the data, hyperparameters and optimization times for our experiments.
Table 2: Summary of the topological losses computed from persistence diagrams D with points(bk, dk) ordered by persistence dk -bk. Note that for 0-th dimensional homology diagrams d1 = âˆž.
Table 3: Embedding/reconstruction and topological losses of the final embeddings. Lowest in bold.
Table 4: Embedding performance evaluations for label prediction. Highest in bold.
Table 5: Summary of the additional topological losses computed from persistence diagrams D withpoints (bk, dk) ordered by persistence dk - bk, used to study the topologically regularized PCAembedding of the Synthetic Cycle from the main paper for weaker or wrong topological information.
