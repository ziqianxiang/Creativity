Table 1: We report quantitative evaluations of the learned actionable visual priors. For each metric,we report numbers over test shapes from the training categories (before slash) and shapes from thetest categories (after slash). Higher numbers indicate better results.
Table 2: We report task success rates (within 15% tolerance to tasks) of manipulating articulatedobjects comparing our method against three baseline methods.
Table D.3: We summarize the shape counts in our dataset. Here, Micro and Washing are short formicrowave and washing machine.
Table I.4: We compare our final approach to an ablated version that removes the curiosity-feedbackchannel and report quantitative evaluations of the visual actionable priors. For each metric, we reportnumbers over the test shapes from the training categories (before slash) and the shapes from the testcategories (after slash). Higher numbers indicate better results.
