Table 1: Average prediction set error and sizes over 100 random trials under rate shifts on Do-mainNet (first six shifts) and support shifts on ImageNet (last two shifts). We denote an approachsatisfying the ε error constraint by ✓, and X otherwise. The “normalized size" is the size dividedby the total number of classes (i.e., 345 for DomainNet and 1000 for ImageNet). Parameters arem = 50, 000 for DomainNet, m = 20, 000 for ImageNet, ε = 0.1, and δ = 10-5. Our approachPS-W satisfies theε constraint, while producing prediction sets with the smallest average normalizedsize among approaches that always satisfy the error constraint. See Appendix G.2 for box plots.
