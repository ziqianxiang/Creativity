Table 1:  Prediction Error in RMSE for (a) pneumatic muscular arm (4.1) and (b) Franka Arm manipulatingvarying loads (4.2) for both fully observable and partially observable scenarios.
Table 2: Comparison between the permutation invariant set en-coder and recurrent encoder.  The performance is measured interms of prediction RMSE (10-5) and mean of the training timeper epoch (in seconds) over 5 runs.
