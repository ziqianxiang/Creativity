Table 1: Quantitative Evaluations. We compare to several baselines or ablated versions, and reportthe precision (P), recall (R), F1-score (F1), and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) given thetest-time interaction budget as 10% or 20% of the per-room object counts.
Table 2: We present quantitative evaluations when transferring our network trained on one type ofrooms to other types at the test time that may also contain unseen object types. We additionally showresults transferring to RoboTHOR, whose scenes are visually different from AI2THOR.

In Fig. B.9 we show an example inference in thebathroom. There are many holders used for different purposes. For example, the bath towel holder(ID: 20) is used for bath towel (ID: 19); the hand towel holder is (ID: 29/30/31/32) used for a handtowel (ID: 18); the toilet paper holder is (ID: 41) used for toilet paper (ID: 23/33). Those holderslook similar and the agent fails to give accurate predictions based on prior knowledge. However, theagent knows those holders are hard to distinguish and uses the fast-interactive-adaptation policy toreduce the uncertainty. In Fig. B.10, we show an example inference in the bedroom. We can see thatthe prior knowledge is already good without any interaction. And with interaction, the performancecan be further improved. For example, the agent learns to turn on the ceiling lamp (ID: 3) by togglinga novel button (ID: 9) that doesnâ€™t appear in the training scenes.
Table C.4: We present performance over different types of relationships. One-to-One and Many-to-Many are classified by number of links of objects of GT graph. Self means to trigger one object leadsto state change of itself. Binary means to interact one object leads to state change of another object.
