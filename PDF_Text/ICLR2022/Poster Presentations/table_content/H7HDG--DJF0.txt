Table 1: Best learning rates for distribUted settings14Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2022Figure 7: General overview of Multi-Agent MDP Homomorphic Networks. G-CNN refers to agroup-equivariant CNN encoder. Equivariant message passing refers to the proposed equivariantmessage passing networks. Encoding local states with group-CNNs ensure the state encodings zi aregroup-equivariant. The locations xi are input to the equivariant message passing network.
