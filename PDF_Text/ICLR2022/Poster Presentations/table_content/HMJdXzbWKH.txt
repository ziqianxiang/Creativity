Table 1: Comparison of tabular Q-learning based algorithms. d ≤ |S| is maximum size of supportof P(∙∣s,α). In the case of asynchronous setting, μ1- is roughly equivalent to |S||A| in the syn-chronous setting. We use the color green to represent results with optimal dependence on (1 - γ)-1.
Table 2: Parameter constraints (first 3 rows) and choice for < error (last 3 rows) for our algorithms.
