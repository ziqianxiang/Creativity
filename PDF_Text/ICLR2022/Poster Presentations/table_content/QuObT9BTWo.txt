Table 2: Experimental results on two-objective MOTSP, MOCVRP and MOKP with different inputsizes (20,50 and 100). HV is the hypervolume metric, Gap is the ratio of hypervolume differencewith respect to our method, and Time is the running run for solving 200 random test instances. Thebest result and its statistically indifferent results are highlighted in bold.
