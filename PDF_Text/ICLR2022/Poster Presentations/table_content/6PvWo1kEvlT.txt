At each epoch, we subtract either0.02, 0.04, or 0.06 from the temperature of the target energy function. We see that 0.02 annealingschedule yields the best BLEU scores. Interestingly, more aggressive schedules result in better (lower)energy values, but with lower acceptance rates, and lower BLEU scores.
