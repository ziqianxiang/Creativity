Table 3: Validation error of different ZCA whitening methods. The covariance matrix is of size1×64×64. The time consumption is measured for computing the matrix square root (BP+FP) on aworkstation equipped with a Tesla K40 GPU and a 6-core Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU @ 2.20GHz. Foreach method, We report the results based on five runs.
Table 4: Validation top-1/top-5 accuracy of the second-order vision transformer on ImageNet (Denget al., 2009). The covariance matrices are of size 64×48×48, Where 64 is the mini-batch size. Thetime cost is measured for computing the matrix square root (BP+FP) on a Workstation equipped Witha Tesla 4C GPU and a 6-core Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU @ 2.20GHz. For the So-ViT-14 model, all themethods achieve similar performances but spend different epochs.
