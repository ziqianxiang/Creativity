Table 1: Summary of the ablation study of the Masker. Each numbered column corresponds to atrained model and black dots indicate which techniques (rows) were included in the model. Thelast two columns correspond to the baseline models: ground (G) segmentation from HRNet as floodmask and InstaGAN (I).
Table 2: Details of the results of the ablation study. The values in each cell are the 20 % trimmedmean error difference between models with and without a given technique, in brackets the 99 %confidence intervals, and the p value.
Table 3: The analogue to Table 2 for the F05 scorewhich the predictions are very accurate and hence all the metrics are near perfect, the plot shows thatvarious metrics are useful for identifying a few images for which not all metrics are low. We furtherillustrate the meaning of our proposed metrics in Fig. 19, where we show images that obtained thelowest—2nd quantile—and highest—98th quantile—values of each metric.

Equivalent distributions wereobtained for all other techniques and metrics in the ablation study.
