Table 1: Search spaces for the Branin and Profet benchmarks. We report the original ranges andwhether or not a log scale was used. Mean of the strong and weak priors before offset are reported.
Table 2: Search spaces for the two case studies. We report the original ranges and whether or nota log scale was used. Mean and standard deviation of the priors are reported, where the standarddeviation is reported as a percentage of the search space. For the categorical variable pooling, theprobabilities for activation functions in U-Net were set to uniform and the probabilities for pooling,[Avg, Max], were set to [0.2, 0.8], respectively.

Table 4: Approximate GPU hours required to perform an evaluation for one approach for the deeplearning case studies. Additionally we report approximate carbon footprints using the MachineLearn-ing Impact calculator presented in Lacoste et al. (2019) based on OECDâ€™s 2014 yearly average carbonefficiency.
