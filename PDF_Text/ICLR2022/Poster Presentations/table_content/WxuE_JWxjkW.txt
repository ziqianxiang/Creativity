Table 1: Mean, 25th-percentile, and 75th-percentile of the distributions of message types numbersfrom different source game.
Table 2: Converged MI from different source games. Both mean and standard deviation are given.
Table 3: Mean and standard deviation σ of generalisation performance of languages from fiXed-conteXton various target games.
Table 4: Mean and standard deviation σ of generalisation performance of language games on eachother.
Table 5: p-values of testing the statistical significance between two different types of source languagesacross various target games. We take 0.05 as the threshold for our p-values, and bold all the significantresults. For the comparison between t‘refer1000’, ‘refer2500’, ‘refer5000’u and t‘refer7500’,‘refer10000’u, we also make the significant results be in red colour.
