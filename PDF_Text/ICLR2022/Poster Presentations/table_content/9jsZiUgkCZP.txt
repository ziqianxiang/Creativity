Table 1: Comparison of the vision transformers compressed by UVC with different benchmarks onImageNet. FLOPs remained denotes the remained ratio of FLOPs to the full-model FLOPs.
Table 2: Ablation study on the modules implemented in UVC. The first part present single techniqueablation. The second part presents the result to sequentially apply Skip configuration and Pruning.
Table 3: Result with distillation token of DeiTModel	Method	Top-1 Acc. (%)	FLOPs(G)	FLOPs remained(%)DeiT-Tiny	Baseline	74.4	1.3	100(dist token)	UVC	74.1(-0.3)	0.66	50.58â€¢ Skip connection patterns: We next draw the result of skip connection patterns Fig. 3(b), showing what layers are learned to be directly skipped under unified optimization.
