Table 1: Comparison of Group-DRO, CGD across the three simple settings. Worst loss is the worstgroup binary cross entropy loss on the test set, and averaged over six seeds, shown in parenthesis isthe standard deviation. Variance column shows the variance of Lâˆž normalized solution across thesix runs. CGD has lower variance and test loss when compared with Group-DRO.
Table 2: Average, worst group accuracy on the test split. Shown in parenthesis is the standarddeviation. All numbers are aggregated over three runs. More details of the setup in Appendix D6Published as a conference paper at ICLR 20225	ExperimentsWe compare CGD with state of the art methods from group-distribution shift and domain general-ization literature. We enumerate datasets in Section 5.1, discuss the baselines and present imple-mentation details in Section 5.2, and finally present our results in Section 5.3.
Table 3: Summary of the datasets we used for evaluation. The Size column shows the number oftraining instances. The Worst ratio column shows the ratio of the size of the largest train group tothe smallest; worst ratio reflects loosely the strength of the spurious correlations.
Table 4: Average and worst-group accuracy in that order. All numbers are averaged over 3 seedsand standard deviation is shown in parenthesis. G-DRO is abbreviation for Group-DRO.
Table 5: Evaluation on WILDS datasets: All numbers averaged over multiple runs, standard de-viation is shown in parenthesis. Second row shows the evaluation metric, and the third shows theevaluation type: in-domain (ID) or out-of-domain (OOD). Two highest absolute performance num-bers are marked in bold in each column.
Table 6: Plot of data from first two features for the three synthetic settings. The three columns showthe distribution of examples from the three groups in the order. The rows from top to bottom showthe plots for Noisy (Section 4.1), Spurious (Section 4.3) and Rotation (Section 4.2) simple settings.
