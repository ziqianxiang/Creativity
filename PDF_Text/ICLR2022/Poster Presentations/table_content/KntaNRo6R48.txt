Table 1: Evaluating the estimation quality of the canonical vectors φ and η . Each pair indicates(eφ , eη), which are the estimation errors of φ and η respectively. We compare the proposed '0-CCA to other sparse CCA schemes considering three types of covariance matrices for generating Xand Y, and different dimensions (N, Dx , Dy). The description of all three covariances appears inSection 5.1. We highlight the smallest error obtained across all methods using boldface.
Table 2: Evaluation of correlated embedding extracted from the Noisy MNIST, Seismic, andMETABRIC (cancer type) datasets. The representation extracted by `0 -DCCA leads to higher clus-tering accuracy (KM), and classification accuracy (SVM) compared with several baselines. MIindicates the Mutual Information between cluster assignments and sample labels. We use NA todenote simulations which did not converge.
Table 3: Evaluating the estimation quality of the canonical vectors φ and η. Each pair indicates(eφ , eη), which are theestimation errors of φ and η respectively. We compare the proposed `0-CCA to standard CCA and to SCCA-II (Gao et al., 2017). Different columns indicate differentadditive noise levels.
