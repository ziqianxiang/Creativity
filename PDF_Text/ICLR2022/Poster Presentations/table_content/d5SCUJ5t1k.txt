Table 1: Comparisons of different methods on Open World Object Detection. Wilderness Impact (WI)and Absolute Open Set Error (A-OSE) are both the less the better, which measure the ability on unknownidentification. Our proposed method achieves consistent performance improvement during the whole life ofthe detector, surprisingly achieves much lower A-OSE compared with baselines and previous state-of-the-artmethods.
Table 2: Comparison of different methods on class incremental object detection. In the three task settings,10, 5, and the last class from the Pascal VOC 2007 (Everingham et al., 2010) dataset are introduced to a detectortrained on 10, 15, and 19 classes respectively.
Table 3: Ablation on semantic anchor generation. Semantic anchors derived from CLIP-text and BERT obtainthe similar performance, both outperforming ORE. Surprisingly, semantic anchors from random vectors alsoachieve better result than ORE.
Table 4: Ablation on unknown anchor and loss components.
