The term unlabeled implies that the assignment is notpre-determined and it is executed online. At the start of the experiment, the agents are spread withminimum inter-agent distance d and so do the goal targets. A centralized solution to this problem wasintroduced in (Turpin et al., 2014), which we refer to as the CAPT solution. This solution gives theagent trajectories, {Qi ∈ R2×T}iN=1, while the agent velocities and accelerations can be calculatedas
