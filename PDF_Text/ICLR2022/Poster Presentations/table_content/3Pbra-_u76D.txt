Table 1: Systematic comparison among some representa-tive methods. “Deep” indicates that a model is expand-able along depth. “Opt.” stands for the principal operator.
Table 2: Classification results on ModelNet40 dataset. With only 1k points, our method achievesstate-of-the-art results on both class mean accuracy (mAcc) and overall accuracy (OA) metrics. Wealso report the speed of some open-sourced methods by samples/second tested on one Tesla V100-pcie GPU and four cores AMD EPYC 7351@2.60GHz CPU. * For KPConv, we take the resultsfrom the original paper. The best is marked in bold and second best is in blue.
