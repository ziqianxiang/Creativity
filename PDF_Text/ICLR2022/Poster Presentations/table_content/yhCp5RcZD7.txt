Table 1: Quantitative comparison. Among the benchmarking methods, only NGLOD at LOD-6, using 256×number of parameters compared to our model, can yield results close to ours. siren models with larger ω haveconvergence issues: despite our best efforts, the models still diverged in most cases. Please refer to Table 4 fora more comprehensive evaluation.
Table 2: Ablation study. Our model benefitsfrom the proposed architectural and trainingdesigns, yet it is also robust against variations.
Table 3: Study of the hyperparameters α (left) and ν (left). The reconstruction accuracy remains stable andhighly competetive throughout hyperparameters variation.
