Table 1: Comparison to different methods. ‘Local Redundancy’ means the redundant computationfor capturing local features. ‘Global Dependency’ means the long-range dependency among frames.
Table 2: Comparison with the state-of-the-art on Kinetics-400&600. Our UniFormer outper-forms most of the current methods with much fewer computation cost.
Table 3: Comparison with the state-of-the-art on Something-Something V1&V2. Our Uni-Former achieves new state-of-the-art performances on both datasets.
Table 4: Ablation studies. ‘Unified’ means whether to use our local MHRA (%means to use Mo-bileNet block). ‘Joint’ means whether to use joint attention. ‘L’/‘G’ refers to local/global MHRA.
Table 5: More results on Kinetics-400&600.
Table 6: More results on Something-Something V1&V2.
Table 7: Comparison with the state-of-the-art on ImageNet. ‘Train Size’ and ‘Test Size’ refer toresolutions used in training and fine-tuning respectively. ‘TL’ means token labeling proposed inLV-ViT (Jiang et al., 2021). We group the models based on their parameters.
