Table 1: The relationship between different numer-ical methods.
Table 2: Image generationmeasured in FID on Cifar10and CelebA. PFs use blackbox ODE solvers and we usethe number of score func-tion evaluations as the stepof PFs. DDIM* is a retestof DDIM. The bold resultsmean the best ones using thesame pretrained model. Weuse the 50-step, 512 batchsize experiment on an RTX-3090 to test the computa-tional cost and the columntime is the average compu-tational cost per step in sec-onds. And we put the resultsof standard deviation in Ap-pendix A.12method and linear multi-step method). On Cifar10 and CelebA, we first provide the results of previ-
