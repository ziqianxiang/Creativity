Table 6: Performance comparison between the Fisher-Rao distance and the KL Divergence for OODdetection in a Black-B ox setting. The numerical values in the Table are TNR at TPR-95% inpercentage for a DenseNet and ResNet models pre-trained on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and SVHNdatasets. Fisher-Rao (sum) corresponds to the Igeood score.

Table 8: B lack-B ox and Grey-Box settings average performance across different OOD datasetsfor validation. The hyperparameters are tuned using one validation dataset (column 1), and evalua-tion is done on the remaining eight OOD test datasets. The DNN is DenseNet-BC-100 pre-trainedon CIFAR-10, and the values are TNR at TPR-95% in percentage.
