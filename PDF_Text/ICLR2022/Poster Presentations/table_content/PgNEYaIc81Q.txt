Table 1: Comparison between ComPhy and other visual reasoning benchmarks. ComPhy is the datasetwith reasoning tasks for both physical property learning and corresponding dynamic prediction.
Table 2: Evaluation of physical reasoning on ComPhy. Human performance is based on sampledquestions. See Section 4.2 for more details.
Table 3: Evaluation of CPL on ComPhy.
Table 4: Question templates and examples in ComPhy. _SA_ denotes static attributes like “red”and “sphere”; _DA_ denotes dynamic attributes, “moving” and “stationary”; _MP_ de-notes mass attributes, “lighter” and “heavier”; _Q_ denotes question phrases like “whichof the following would happen”; _CP_ denotes charge attributes, “uncharged” and“oppositely charged”; _H_ denotes visible concepts, “color”, “shape” and material;_PA_ denotes physical attributes, heavy, light, charged and “uncharged”; _TI_ denotestime indicators like “when the video ends”.
Table 5: Symbolic operations of CPL on ComPhy. In this table, “order” denotes the chronologicalorder of an event, e.g. “First” and “Last”; “static attribute” denotes object static concepts like “Red”and “Rubber” and “dynamic attribute” represents object dynamic concepts like “Moving”.
