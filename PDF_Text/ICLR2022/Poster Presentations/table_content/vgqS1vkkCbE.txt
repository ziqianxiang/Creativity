Table 1: Success rates of different representations for model-free RL across varying levels of difficulty andtime horizons (second row denotes complexity in terms of number of rooms). VFS explicitly captures thecapabilities of the low-level skills, and outperforms all baselines. Online methods (denoted by Dlearnedjointlywith the RL objective outperform their offline counterparts (AE and CPC), but their performance degrades forlonger-horizon tasks. Refer to Appendix B for additional performance metrics and ablations.
Table 2: Success rates for zero-shotgeneralization. VFS can generalizezero-shot to novel environments.
Table 3: Success rates for roboticmanipulation. VFS outperforms allbaselines and closely matches orac-ular performance.
