Table 1: Importance of the data generating factors to the model’s prediction. Prediction Flip quantifieshow often the model’s prediction changes the sign when changing the attribute. The Mean LogitChange reports the median of the absolute change in logit values. The R2 score is calculated on anordinary least squares from the changes of each factor to the changes in the model’s logit. For moreattributes, see Appendix Table 3.
Table 2: The mean accuracy for each attribute by condition. Ncollected provide the number ofparticipants collected and Nfiltered the number of remaining participants after the filtering. Stars markstatistical significance.
Table 3: Importance of the data generating factors to the model’s prediction. For the R2 score,we fitted an ordinary least squares from the factors’ deltas to the deltas of the model’s logits andthen report the coefficient of determination (R2). The Mean Logit Change reports the median ofthe absolute change in logit values. The Prediction Flip column quantifies how often the model’sprediction changed the sign when changing the attribute.
Table 4: Norm quantifies the length of feature map changes (∆h = f (x) - f (X)) after resamplingthe different data generative factors. Angle w. Clas. quantifies the mean angle (in degrees) between∆h and the classifier weight w .
Table 5: Distribution of each attribute in the study’s dataset. Biased denotes whether an attribute isunequally distributed for the two classes. Additional Class Information show if an attribute containsany additional information about the target class not already given by the legs’ position.
