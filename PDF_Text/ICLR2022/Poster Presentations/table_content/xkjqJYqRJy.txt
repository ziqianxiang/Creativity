Table A.1: Diagnostics and median performance at temperature T = 1 for every prior and UCIdataset. The split-R is generally high, which shows the chain has not fully explored the posterior.
Table A.3: Estimated R values for the different models and priors with respect to the loss.
Table A.4: Estimated Rb values for the different models and priors with respect to the potential.
