Table 1: Image classification results. We report the mean percentage accuracy (acc.) with standarddeviation (std.) obtained by running the same experiment with three different random seeds. Thelast column (acc. â†‘) calculates the difference of accuracy by using our method compared to baseline,where positive numbers indicate improvement.
Table 2: Comparing gradient lexicase selection to other selection methods on CIFAR-10. We reportthe mean percentage accuracy (acc.) with standard deviation (std.) obtained by running the sameexperiment with three different random seeds.
Table 3: Comparing different population sizes on CIFAR-10. Lexicase is relatively robust to dif-ferent population size p, and it manages to outperform baseline with all the configurations in thisexperiment. The generalization performance does not seem to increase with larger population size.
Table 4: Comparing different momentum configurations on CIFAR-10. Resetting momentum aftereach selection event avoids too much aggregation of gradients, which results in a higher diversity ofoffspring and thus better generalization performance.
