Table 1: Results with ZeroFL on CIFAR10 and SpeechCommands for both IID (α=1.0) and non-IID(α=1000) settings. We report the test accuracy at 700, 200 and 1K communication rounds respectively forCIFAR10, Speech Commands and FEMNIST. We report the size (in MB) of the artifact to be transmitted to theserver for aggregation, which has been compressed following the CSR sparse format representation. ZeroFLimproves the performance while reducing the uplink communication cost up to a factor of 7.4× compared tovanilla SWAT. For each sparsity level and dataset, we highlight in bold the best masking strategy. For claritywe do this on the non-IID results only. More results can be found in Appendix.
Table 2: CIFAR-10 with FedAdam for the non-IID setting, 100 clients and using 10 clients per round.
Table 3: Experimental results with ZeroFL on SpeechCommands using 100 clients. We evaluate both IID(α=1.0) and non-IID (α=1000) settings. The table reports the highest test accuracy within 300 rounds.
