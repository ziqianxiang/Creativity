Table 1: Comparison of different active training strategies on object-goal navigation.
Table 2: Comparison of active train-ing methods in semantic map pre-diction.
Table 3: Comparison against baselines and variations of our method. Baselines are adapted from[1] Yamauchi (1997), [2] Chaplot et al. (2020b), and [3] Chaplot et al. (2020a). Comparisons abovethe double horizontal line were carried out on our set of 11 objects while the comparison below thedouble line against SemExp was carried out on the 6 objects reported in [3]. Note that the discrepancybetween the results of SemExp reported here and those in [3] are due to different sets of test episodes.
