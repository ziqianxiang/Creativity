Table 1: Examples of compressors {Ci}in=1 ∈ U(A, B). See the appendix for many more.
Table 2: Value of L2± in cases when fi(x) = φ(x) + φi(x), where φ : Rd → R is an arbitrary dif-ferentiable function and φi : Rd → R is twice continuously differentiable. The matrices Ai ∈ Rd×dare assumed (without loss of generality) to be symmetric. The matrix-valued function L± (x, y) isdefined in Theorem 3.
Table 3: The number of communication rounds for solving (1)-(2) by MARINA and EF21.
Table 4: Optimized communication complexity of MARINA and EF21 with particular compres-sors.
Table 5: The “adaptive” ratio (L1)2 / (L±)2 calculated at points Xt from experiments with MARINAand PermK on MNIST (see Figure 2).
Table 6: Optimized communication complexity of MARINA and EF21 with particular compressors underPE condition (up to a logarithmic factor).
