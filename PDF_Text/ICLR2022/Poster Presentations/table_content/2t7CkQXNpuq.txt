There are two training strategies adopted to accelerate training and stabilize theresult. As mentioned in Sec.3.5, one is to increase episode length L and γ factor gradually duringtraining, the other one is to split the optimization of the ToM and RL model.

As we mentioned in the experiment section, it isthe volume of messages that has a decisive effect on the cost of communication. Since the messagesare all float-type vectors, we use the length of a message instead of the number of bits to represent thevolume of a single message.

For I2C, the message from agent i is the local observation oi , containingthe information of all the targets. For HiT-MAC, communication happens between the executors andthe coordinator. The executors send their local observation to the coordinator, and the coordinatorreturns the goal assignment. For ToM2C w/o CR and ToM2C, the message is simply the inferredgoals of the receiver. ToM2C w/o CR means that the trained ToM2C model is not further optimizedto reduce communication.
