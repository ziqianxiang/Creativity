Table 1: Statistics for the estimated R-D upper bound on GAN-generated images with d = 2,computed with m = 100 samples of (R, D). “CI” denotes 95% large-sample confidence interval.
Table 2: Statistics for the estimated R-D upper bound on GAN-generated images with d = 4,computed with m = 100 samples of (R, D). “CI” denotes 95% large-sample confidence interval.
Table 3: Statistics for the estimated R-D lowerbound on d = 2 GAN-generated images, com-puted with m = 30 samples of ξ. “LCB” denotes90% large-sample lower confidence bound.
Table 4: Statistics for the estimated R-D lowerbound on d = 4 GAN-generated images, com-puted with m = 30 samples of ξ. “LCB” denotes90% large-sample lower confidence bound.
