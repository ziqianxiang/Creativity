Table 1: Examples of constraints implemented in our CEs for SQL, Vega-Lite and SMCalFlow.
Table 2: Results of each language model on all domains with and without CSD and TST. For SQL,we run the resulting query and report Execution Match accuracy (Exec.). For Vega-Lite and SM-CalFlow, we instead report Exact Match accuracy (Acc.). Edit Distance (Dist.) measures averagerelative edit distance between the prediction and the ground truth. We also report the fraction ofValid model outputs (those that parse, type-check and execute). For context only, we show recentresults from supervised models (trained on the datasets we use) marked with (S) .
Table 3: Computing Brzozowski derivatives for each constructor of regular expressions under theassumption that Klenee stars are greedy. The resulting algorithm runs in linear-time on the size ofthe regular expression.
