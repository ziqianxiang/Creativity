Table 1: Overall performance of our approach on three tasks.
Table 2: Detailed information about dataset for each task.
Table 3: Accuracy and ASR for the evaluated models for each task19Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2022G The amounts of evaluated models for various task and attackAPPROACHESFor each attack and task, we build 60 infected models and 60 uninfected models, respectively. No-tably, the uninfected models for different attack approaches are randomly selected and different.
