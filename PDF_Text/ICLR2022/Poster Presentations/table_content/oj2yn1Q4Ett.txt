Table 1: Comparison of the total communication required per node by different algorithms for non-overparameterized (NOP) and overparameterized (OP) regimes. Please see Appendix B for a detailed dis-cussion of the algorithms. Here N is entire sample size, UB on M denotes the upper bound on the number ofnodes, M, d is the data dimension, β ≥ 2 is a constant, and T denotes the total communication (iterations)rounds utilized by the distributed algorithms.
Table 2: Total communication (in bits) per node required to achieve a fixed MSE (×10-3) performance.
Table 3: Comparison of MSE for a fixed communication budget.
