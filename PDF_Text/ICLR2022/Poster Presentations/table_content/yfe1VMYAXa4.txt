Table 1: Results on TAPE Benchmark. SS is a secondary structure task that evaluates in CB513.
Table 2: Protein-Protein Interaction Prediction Results. Breath-First Search (BFS) and Depth-FirstSearch (DFS) are strategies that split the training and testing PPI datasets.
Table 3: Protein Function Prediction Results on three sub-sets with two settings. BPO refers toBiological Process, MFO refers to Molecular Function, and CCO refers to Cellular Component.
Table 5: Entity categories of GO terms and specific relation types of these entity categories.
Table 6: Hyper-parameters for the downstream task.
Table 7: Terms descriptions in Gene Ontology. GO annotations are created by associating a gene orgene product with a GO term. Four pieces of information uniquely identify a GO annotation: GeneProduct, Go term, Reference, Evidence. And each Go term contains a description text, and this isGo statement.
