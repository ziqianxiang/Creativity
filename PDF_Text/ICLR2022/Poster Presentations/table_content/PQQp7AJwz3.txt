Table 1: Required computational complexity to achieve ep-accuracy (P(P) — P(p*) ≤ ep). n is the re-sampling interval. Mi (i = 1, 2, 3) is the number of particles required to approximate the true distributionfor each method: They are given as Mi = Θ(e-2), Mi = Θ(e-2 log(n)), Mi = Θ(e-1 log(n)). Gi isthe number of gradient evaluation to obtain the sampling distribution which has TV-distance p from the truedistribution; when MALA is used, this is given as Gi = O(n log(1/p)3/2 ).
