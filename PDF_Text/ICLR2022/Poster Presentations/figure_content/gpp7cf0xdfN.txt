Figure 1: Overview of RED versus AD.
Figure 4: The influence of different data augmentations.
Figure 6: IoU distributions of the attribution alignment by three RED methods. Higher IoU is better. Foreach subfigure, the four IoU scores standing for IoU(xRED , x, y), IoU(xRED , x, y0), IoU(x0RED , x0, y), andIoU(x0RED , x0, y0).
Figure 7: Reverse engineer partially-perturbed data under different interpolation portion p.
Figure 8: Correlation matrices between different adversaries. For each cor-relation matrix, rows and columns represent adversarial example estimatex0RED and true adversarial example x0 (For the ground-truth correlation ma-trix, x0RED = x0). Each entry represents the average Spearman rank correlationbetween the logits of two adversary settings âˆˆ {(victim model, attack type)}.
