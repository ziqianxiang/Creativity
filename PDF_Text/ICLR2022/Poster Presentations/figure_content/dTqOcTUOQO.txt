Figure 1: Experiment results for GMMs.
Figure 2: Time costs for process-ing single data deletion requests onBNNs. A smaller time cost impliesa higher efficiency of the unlearn-ing method.
Figure 3: The changes of the prediction confidences for the test set examples of CIFAR-10 alongwith data removing. The BNN is trained with SGLD and the knowledge removal is conducted withthe proposed MCMC unlearning algorithm. The predictions for the true labels are colored in red.
