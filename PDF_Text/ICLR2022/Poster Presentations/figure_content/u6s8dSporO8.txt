Figure 1: By standardizing the source Sky position, aGW signal can be made to arrive at the same time in allthree LIGO/Virgo detectors. However, since this alsochanges the projection of the signal onto the detectors, itdefines only an approximate equivariance. Nevertheless,our proposed GNPE algorithm simplifies inference bysimultaneously inferring and standardizing the incidentdirection.
Figure 2: We infer p(gθ, ^∣x) with Gibbs samplingby alternately sampling (1) gθ 〜p(gθ |x, ^) (blue)and (2) g 〜p(g|x, gθ) (orange). For (1) We use adensity estimator q(gθ∣Tg-ι (x), g), for (2) the def-inition g = gθ + e, e 〜κ(e). Pose standardizationwith Tg-ι is only allowed due to conditioning ong. Increasing the width of K accelerates conver-gence (due to larger steps in parameter space), atthe cost of g being a worse approximation for gθ,and therefore pose alignment being less effective.

Figure 4: Comparison of estimatedposteriors against LALInferenceMCMC for eight GW events, asquantified by c2st (best: 0.50, worst:1.00). GNPE with a wide kernel out-performs both NPE baselines, whilebeing only marginally slower (1 it-eration 〜2 s). With a narrow ker-nel and 30 iterations (〜60 s), Weachieve c2st < 0.55 across all events.
Figure 5: Corner plots for the GW events GW170809 (left) and GW170814 (right), plotting 1Dmarginals on the diagonal and 90% credible regions for the 2D correlations. We display the twoblack hole masses m1 and m2 and two spin parameters θ1 and θ2 (note that the full posterior is15-dimensional). NPE does not accurately reproduce the MCMC posterior, while accurate-modeGNPE matches the MCMC results well. For a plot with all baselines see Fig. D.4.
