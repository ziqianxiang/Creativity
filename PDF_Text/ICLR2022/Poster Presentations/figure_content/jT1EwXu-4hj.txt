Figure 2: (a). Weight analysis on MovieLens and GoodReads. Upper: distribution of wui on the positiveand negative feedback data. Lower: relation between wui and fui under Pf (the recommended (u, i) under f)and others; (b). Weight analysis on MovieLens simulation: the relations between wui and P(Oui = 1) on thepositive and negative synthetic feedback data for MCF (upper) and NCF (lower); (c). Ablation study for thetransportation regularization and sensitivity analysis on Î» for MovieLens and its synthetic data.
