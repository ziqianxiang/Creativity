Figure 1: (Left) The mean of the velocity estimates by the agents compared to the reference velocityin a test example. (Middle) The relative RMSE in the ST-GNN outputs under perturbations to theunderlying space-time topology. (Right) The mean difference between agent and reference velocities.
Figure 2: (Left) Three-second agent trajectories of a test example. (Middle) Relative error caused byusing different network densities. (Right) Relative error caused by using different sampling time Ts .
Figure 3: Flocking experiment. (a) (b) and (c) the estimated velocities of some agents in threedifferent examples from the test dataset, and (d) the positions of the agents in (c) at the start of thesimulations and after 9s (the red arrows represent the agent velocity).
Figure 4: The estimated velocities of some agents in two different examples from the test datasetusing ST-GNNs (left) and a decentralized controller (right).
Figure 5: Relative cost after 10s calculated over test datsets that have encountered either graphperturbations resulted from changing the agent density œÅ0 (Left), or time perturbations resulted fromchanging the sampling time Ts (Right).
