Figure 3: Comparison with sample-based methods (EconNAS) on NAS-Bench-201 across CIFAR-10.
Figure 4: Comparison with ZenNAS in their search space on ImageNet-1k. Due to the limitationof computational resources, we only run 10000 evolution iterations and 20 epochs to train theselected architecture. We plot the top-1 prediction accuracy along training for two methods (ZenNAS,GradSign).
