Figure 1: PseUdo-Labeled Auto-Curriculum Learning (PLACL). (0) In the initial round, the modelΘω is pre-trained on the labeled data. And for the r-th round, (1) the trained network Θ∖ is usedto predict pseudo-labels for unlabeled data. (2) A learning curriculum consisting of a series ofthresholds (Yr) is generated. (3) Reliable pseudo-labeled data is selected by the searched curriculum.
Figure 2: (a) Accuracy on different datasets (5% labeled data) with various rounds (R). (b) Com-parisons with different fixed thresholds (blue dots) and different group sizes G. Experiments areconducted on LSPET dataset (5% labeled data).
Figure 3: Visualization of how pseudo-labels evolve in self-training rounds.
