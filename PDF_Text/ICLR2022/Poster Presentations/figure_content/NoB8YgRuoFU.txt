Figure 1: Top panels illustrate the four steps of our PI3NN algorithm. Bottom panels illustrate the effectivenessof the OOD identification feature. As shown in bottom left, when turning on the OOD identification feature byinitializing the bias of the output layer of uθ and lξ to a large value, PI3NN can accurately identify the OODregions [-7, -4] ∪ [4, 7] by giving them increasingly large PIs as their distance from the training data gets large.
Figure 2: Probability density functions of the PI width for the training (InD) and testing (OOD) data for allthe five methods. When we use a probability density function (PDF) to fit PIWs of the InD and OOD samples,respectively, we should be able to see two separated PDFs with the PDF of OOD samples shifting to the righthaving larger PIWs. If the two PDFs are overlapped to each other, then it indicates the method can not identifythe OOD samples by reasonably quantifying their uncertainty.
Figure 3: Streamflow prediction using LSTM network and the calculated 95% PIs from our PI3NN method andthe baselines. The testing period (2017) is a wet year (extreme event) having dramatically different streamflowpatterns than the training period. PI3NN identifies this OOD patterns by giving the prediction a large PI whileother methods fail to identify the OOD patterns by giving the testing data similarly narrow PIs as the training.
