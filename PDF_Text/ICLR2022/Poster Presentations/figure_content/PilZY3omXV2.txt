Figure 3: (a) Overall Framework. Given intermediate representations from the backbone encoder,V = fb(X), the TFD and SFD produce the trend features, V(T) = fτ(V), and seasonal features,V(S) = fs(V), respectively. (b) Trend Feature Disentangler. Composition of a mixture of auto-regressive experts, instantiated as 1d-causal convolutions with kernel size of 2i , ∀i = 0, . . . , L,where L is a hyper-parameter. Followed by average-pool over the L+1 representations. (c) SeasonalFeature Disentangler. After transforming the intermediate representations into frequency domain viathe FFT, the SFD applies a (complex-valued) linear layer with unique weights for each frequency.
Figure 4: T-SNE visualization of learned repre-sentations from CoST and TS2Vec. (Top) Gener-ated by visualizing representations after selectinga single seasonality. Colors represent the two dis-tinct trends. (Bottom) Generated by visualizingrepresentations after selecting a single trend. Col-ors represent the three distinct seasonal patterns.
Figure 5: T-SNE visualization of seasonal-trend disentanglement in CoST embeddings. TFD Rep-resentations refer to the representations generated by the Trend Feature Disentangler while SFDRepresentations refer to the representations generated by the Seasonal Feature Disentangler. (a) Weselect a single seasonality and visualize the representations. The two colors represent the two dis-tinct trends. (b) We select a single trend and visualize the representations. The three colors representthe three distinct seasonal patterns.
