Figure 1:from the same class (column name). More example images can be found in Appendix A.1.
Figure 2: Overview. With pre-trained feature extractor (a), N-Way K-Shot classifiers are learnt (b)based on LA (d) to classify WSI patches (c). Given a novel representation z, LA generates its newfeatures from the most likely variation in the base dictionary, so few-shot novel samples can beproliferated in a reasonable way, and the decision boundary could therefore be improved.
Figure 3: Ablations on latent augmentation. (a) The effect of different number of prototypes. Dashlines are the baselines for the solid lines of same colors. (b) The effect of number of augmentationtimes. The harmonic mean are plotted. “LA ×DA' denotes T latent augmentations are applied afterT traditional data augmentations (leads to T2 times in total). (c) The effect of using labels andcalibration. “DC': Distribution Calibration. “calib.': calibration; We introduce it in Appendix D.3.
Figure 4: Visualization of samples learned by CLP and FSR “Abs./Rel. Sim.” columns show theabsolute/relative cosine similarity between the global feature and the local ones. Relative similarityis the min-max normalized absolute similarity. k indicate the cluster numbers used by K-Means.
