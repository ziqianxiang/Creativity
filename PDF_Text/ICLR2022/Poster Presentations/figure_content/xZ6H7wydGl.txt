Figure 1: Independently sampled paths. a shows paths sampled from the SDE using an integrator,while b shows samples from a Brownian bridge which pass exactly through the observations. In bothcases the drift function is given by a neural network which is randomly initialized with the same seed.
Figure 2: Learning curves of a neural SDE on the Lorenz system. b shows the normalized mean-squared deviation of the learned drift from the ground truth. a shows the mean-squared error ofsample paths from the observations.
Figure 3: Gradient variances as a function of the time between observations. a shows gradientvariances of the observation mean-squared-error computed with an SDE integrator. b shows thegradient variance of the log-probability of observations computed with Algorithm 1.
Figure 4: GP posterior compared to ground truth vector field. a shows the GP vector field colouredby uncertainty. The arrows show the integral curves of the posterior mean and the coloured are scaledlinearly with the log predictive variance. b shows the integral curves of the ground truth van derPol oscillator. c shows the deviation of GP posterior from the ground truth vector field in standarddeviations. The red lines show the 10%, 25%, 75%, and 90% quantiles.
Figure 5: Log-probability estimates for an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. The solid lines indicate themean value of the estimator, and the shaded regions indicate three standard deviations from the mean.
