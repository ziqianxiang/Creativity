Figure 1: Model Ideas and Schematic Diagram. (a) Results from Semi-supervised clustering forAD disease: model clusters PT into discrete subtypes based on both spatial and temporal variations:P1 and P4 show mild and severe stages and are mixture of two patterns; (b) Improvements fromSurreal-GAN: two patterns are captured by two indices with values indicating severity; (c) Generalarchitecture of networks; (d) Schematic diagram of Surreal-GAN.
Figure 2: Results on Semi-synthetic data (results presented as mean value ± standard error). (a)Representation accuracies on different tasks (measured by Pattern-c-index); (b) Agreements amongrepetitively trained models on different tasks (measured by Pattern-agr-index).
Figure 3: Voxel-wise statistical comparison results between selected subgroups and CN. (FDRmethod with p-value threshold of 0.05 was used for multiple comparison). In each direction guidedby arrows, we increased values of one R-index and keep the other relatively fixed. Therefore, wechose out groups of subjects who have much stronger expression of one pattern for visualization.
Figure 4: Regularization and hyper-parameters. (a) Representation accuracy on different tasks withvariations in hyper-parameters (measured by Pattern-c-index); (b) Agreements among repetitivelytrained models on different tasks with variations in hyper-parameters (measured by Pattern-agr-index) (results presented as mean value ± standard error for (a,b)); (c) Representation accuracywith regularization terms removed. (*Smile-GAN here refers to a ”pseudo Smile-GAN” with thesame regularization terms included in Smile-GAN model. Latent variable z is sampled from samecontinuous distribution as in Surreal-GAN.)Table 5: ”Practical upper bounds” of compared modelsMild Changesall regularizationsno ortho■ no decom	Surreal-GAN	NMF	LDA	FA	OpNMF	DNMFBasic Case	0.838 ± 0.011	0.834 ± 0.000	0.769 ± 0.005	0.750 ± 0.000	0.751 ± 0.000	0.631 ± 0.017Large	0.837	0.844	0.777	0.721	0.715	0.641Overlapping	± 0.008	± 0.000	± 0.001	± 0.005	± 0.000	± 0.017Scarce Regions	0.783	0.760	0.640	0.618	0.666	0.548	± 0.007	± 0.000	± 0.015	± 0.001	± 0.000	± 0.006Within-pattern	0.818	0.831	0.775	0.764	0.730	0.644Noise	± 0.013	± 0.000	± 0.003	± 0.000	± 0.015	± 0.031
