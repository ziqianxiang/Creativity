Figure 1: Causal graph of the per-turbed data generation process. Eachnode represents a random variable, andgray ones indicate observable variables,where C,S, X, Y, E, X, Î¸ are content vari-able, style variable, natural data, label, per-turbation, perturbed data and parameters of aneural network, respectively.
