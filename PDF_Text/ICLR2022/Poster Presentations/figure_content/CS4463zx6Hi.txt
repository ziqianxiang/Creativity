Figure 1: A Mol* (Sehnal et al. (2021)) visualization of interacting protein chains (PDB ID: 3H11).
Figure 2: DeepInteract overview. Our proposed pipeline separates interface contact prediction intotwo tasks: (1) learning new node representations hA and hB for pairs of residue protein graphs and(2) convolving over hA and hB interleaved together to predict pairwise contact probabilities.
Figure 3: Geometric Transformer overview. Notably, our final layer of the Geometric Transformerremoves the edge update path since, in our formulation of interface prediction, only graph pairs’node representations hA and hB are directly used for the final interface contact prediction.
Figure 4: Conformation module overview. The Geometric Transformer uses a conformation modulein each layer to evolve proteins graphs’ geometric representations via repeated gating and a finalseries of residual connection blocks.
