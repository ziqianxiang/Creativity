Figure 1: We study the graph condensation problem, which seeks to learn a small, synthetic graph,features and labels {A0, X0, Y0} from a large, original dataset {A, X, Y}, which can be used to trainGNN models that generalize comparably to the original. Shown: An illustration of our proposedGCOND graph condensation approach’s empirical performance, which exhibits 95.3% of originalgraph test performance with 99.9% data reduction.
Figure 2: Condensed graphs sometimes exhibit structure mimicking the original (a, b, d). Othertimes (c, e), learned features absorb graph properties and create less explicit graph reliance.
Figure 3: Test accuracy and sparsity under different values of δ.
