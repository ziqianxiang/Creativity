Figure 1: Capturing online learning behaviour. We assume the agent models the response surfacesin their mind, and that their belief changes each time step in response to the actions they take and theconsequent observations they make. The response surface they model need not converge on the truesurface since the update method of the agent may be biased and not appropriately use the informationavailable to them.
Figure 2: Simplified inverse process. Our taskis to infer the evolving perceived effect over time(the blue line) given only realisations of the agentâ€™sbehaviour.
Figure 3: Model. Solid black lines indicate single time step dependencies. Given covariates Xi andan observed history then treatment effects are estimated in the mind of the agent. An action Ai isselected based on these effect and an outcome Yi is observed. The dashed grey lines then indicateinformation flow over time.
