Figure 2: Overview of DisCo. DisCo consists of: (i) a Navigator exploring traversal directionsin the latent space of a given pretrained generative model, (ii) a ∆-Contrastor encoding traversedimages into the Variation Space, where We utilize Contrastive Learning. Samples in the VariationSpace correspond to the image variations along the directions provided by the NaVigator labeled withdifferent colors, respectively. ∆-Contrastor includes two shared-weight Disentangling Encoders toextract disentangled representations respectively, and outputs the difference between the disentangledrepresentations as variation representation. The Generative Model is fixed, and the Navigator andDisentangling Encoders marked with grey color are learnable.
Figure 3: Violin plots on three datasets (1: β-TCVAE, 2: FactorVAE, 3: InfoGAN-CR, 4: CF, 5:LD, 6: GS, 7: DS, 8: DisCo (ours)). DisCo on pretrained GAN consistently achieves the bestperformance. Each method has 25 runs, and the variance is due to randomness.
Figure 4: Comparison of discovered directions. DisCo can better manipulate desirable attributeswhile keeping others intact. Please refer to Appendix C for more qualitative results.
