Figure 1: Man-in-the-Middle Attack.
Figure 2: VIRTUAL+ observes vi (or estimates)and maintains R during the sampling phase.
Figure 3: Estimation of the competitive ratio ofonline algorithms in the stochastic k-secretaryproblem with Ïƒ2 = 10.
Figure 4:	Plot of online fool rates for k = 1000 against PGD-robust models using different online algorithmsA, attacks, datasets, and 20 different permutations. For a given x-coordinate, a higher y-coordinate is better.
Figure 5:	For every example in MNIST we compute an attack using fs and submit it to ft . Left: Thedistribution of the normalized loss values of ft for all attacks where a higher loss is a stronger attack. Middle:The percentage of unsuccessful attacks as a function of fs normalized loss values. Right: smoothed ratio ofunsuccessful attacks to total attacks as a function of the fs normalized loss values.
