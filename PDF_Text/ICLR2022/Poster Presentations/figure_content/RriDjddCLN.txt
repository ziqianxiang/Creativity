Figure 1: Example results. LSeg is able to handle unseen labels as well as label sets of arbitrarylength and order. This enables flexible synthesis of zero-shot semantic segmentation models on thefly. From left to right, labels that are removed between runs are underlined, whereas labels that areadded are marked in bold red.
Figure 2: Overview. A text encoder embeds labels into a vector space. An image encoder extractsper-pixel embeddings from the image and correlates the feature of each pixel to all label embeddings.

Figure 5: LSeg examples with related but previously unseen labels, and hierarchical labels. Goingfrom left to right, labels that are removed between runs are underlined, whereas labels that are addedare marked in bold red.
