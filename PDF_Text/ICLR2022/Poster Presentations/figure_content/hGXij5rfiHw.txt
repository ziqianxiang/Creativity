Figure 2: (a) Causal view of data-generating process; (b) Illustration of interventional distributions.
Figure 3: DIR Implementation on GNNs, which includes a rationale generator, a distribution inter-vener, an encoder and two classifiers. For the inference, We only use yc as the prediction.
Figure 4: Visualization of DIR Rationales. Each graph shows a comment, e.g., “a majestic achieve-ment, an epic of astonishing grandeur” in (a), where rationales are highlighted by deep colors.
Figure 5: Two-stage Training Dynamics of DIR.
Figure 6:	Visualization of Training Rationales. Each graph represents a comment, e.g., , ”determinedto uncover the truth and hopefully inspire action” in (a).
Figure 7:	Visualization of Testing Rationales. Each graph represents a comment, e.g., , ”whimsicaland relevant today” in (a).
Figure 8:	Visualization of Training Rationales in Spurious-Motif Dataset. Structures with deepercolors mean higher importance. Nodes of ground truth rationales are colored by green.
Figure 9:	Visualization of Testing Rationales in Spurious-Motif Dataset. Structures with deepercolors mean higher importance. Nodes of ground truth rationales are colored by green.
Figure 10: Sensitivity of Hyper-Parameter λ. In each chart, dash line represents the performanceof the best baseline in the corresponding dataset, and the area between ACC±std are colored.
