Figure 1: The typical ASR pipeline used in the adversarial research community. We can seethe potential factors (a-f) and their locations at different stages (i-v) of the pipeline. Wewill study each of the impact of each potential factor on transferability.
Figure 2: The target transferability rate of optimization attacks for every potential factor.
Figure 3: The details of the pipeline we used in the control experiment. The pipelines forthe potential factors we study in the paper are all based on the one shown above.
Figure 4: We can observe the change in the transferability rate with respect to the numberof iterations. Generally, we see that the number of iterations does not have a significantimpact on the transferability rate, except when the MFCC is removed.
Figure 5: The plot shows the relationship between transferability and iterations for two se-tups: the control experiment and when the MFCC is removed. For the control experimentthe transferability rate is consistent across all iterations (a). However, when the MFCC isremoved, the rate falls as the iterations increase (b). This suggests that the MFCC is regu-larizing the feature vector helping the model learn smooth and robust decision boundaries.
