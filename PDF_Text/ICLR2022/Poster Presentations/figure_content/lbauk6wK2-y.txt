Figure 1: Object space as discriminative weights. Objects live in a low-dimensional manifold ofa high-dimensional latent space. A latent code representing a specific object is translated into seg-mentation weights that can distinguish the object from anything else at different viewing conditions.
Figure 2: Data collected in iThor. Target objects are highlighted by their instance masks.
Figure 3: Unseen objects re-identified as learned. 1st row:unseen objects, 2nd to 4th row: similar objects from thelearned object list. Bounding boxes highlight the objectswith embedded text indicating the instance identity.
Figure 4: Unseen objects expressed by base objects. Unseen objects in the 1st column (Cup_3,BoWL10, Cup_2) are represented by base objects in the 2nd to 6th columns with combination Co-efficients shown below the object. Higher coefficient means greater weight or importance in thecombination.
Figure 5: More segmentation results. The objects showed above are unseen objects that are ex-pressed by base objects.
Figure 6: Demonstration of obtaining instance masks of manipulated objects through interaction.
Figure 7: Visualization results of one-shot learning on DAVIS dataset. 1st column: training datathat contains only one data sample. 2nd to 6th column: results on testing set (the rest frames in thevideo clip).
