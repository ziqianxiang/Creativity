Figure 1: Comparison of vanilla conformal prediction and our CP-Gen for learning a prediction interval with90% nominal coverage on a real-world regression task. Left: The function class {Ct} is the prediction intervalsused by Conformalized Quantile Regression. Right: {Cθ,t} is a larger class of intervals used by our conformalquantile finetuning procedure with the same base predictor; here the additional trainable parameter θ is the lastlinear layer within the quantile neural network (cf. Section 5.1 and Appendix E.3 for more details).
