Figure 1:	Table of results and figure showing an example of the nuisance for Waterbirds. On theleft are the accuracies of NURD and ERM on Waterbirds. Gold standard accuracy is 90% (seethe results paragraph below). The figure shows an image and the corresponding border nuisance.
Figure 2:	Table of results and figure showing an example of the nuisance for chest X-rays. Thefigure shows an example of a chest X-ray and the corresponding non-lung patches (right). NuRDhas both images during training and only the left image at test time.
Figure 3: Landscape of the objective in eq. (5) for the example in eq. (2) for linear representationsru,v (x) = ux1 + vx2. Local maxima correspond to representations r-u,u and global maxima torepresentations ru,u .
Figure 4: Plots of average accuracy vs. test ρ for classifying Waterbirds and Pneumonia. A larger ρimplies a larger difference between the nuisance-label relationship in the test data used for evaluationand the training data, which has a ρ = 0.1. Nuisance-randomized data corresponds to ρ = 0.5.
