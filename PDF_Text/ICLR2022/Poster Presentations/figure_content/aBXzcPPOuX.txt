Figure 1: Examples of fiber bundles. (Left) A Mobius band as a bundle over the circle S1. A typicalfiber over a base point (dark orange) and a locally trivial neighborhood and local trivialization areincluded for illustration. (Right) Two other examples of fiber bundles. Above is the Torus (withcircular fiber) lying over the circle. Below is the analytic continuation of the complex functionZ → ʌ/z over the punctured disc D = {z ∈ C|0 < |z| < 1}, which has a two-point fiber.
Figure 2: A diagram of the BundleNet architecture. The upper arrows indicate the forward operationof the model while the lower arrows indicate the reverse operation of the model.
Figure 3: Visualization of the convergence of three different priors to a distribution on an oval: a1-dimensional Gaussian (Above), a 2-dimensional Gaussian (Middle), and a uniform distributionon a circle (Below)).
Figure 4: Model performance on a “bundle” where the fibers have different geometry and topology.
Figure 5: Effect on generation error (Wasserstein-1 distance) on the Airfoil Noise dataset by numberof circular priors. Error bars represent 95% CIs.
Figure 6: Visualizations of synthetic dataset reconstruction for each model type. To produce eachimage, 100 evenly distributed base points were chosen and we generated 200 points in the fiber overeach (where such capability is available). The colors correspond to the angle parameterizing thecircle in the base space. Note that we do not expect the colors in WGAN’s reconstruction to bewell-organized since this model has no way of consistently modeling specific fibers like the othermodels do.
