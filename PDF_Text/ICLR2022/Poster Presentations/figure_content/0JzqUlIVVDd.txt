Figure 1: Graphical model. Note that the distribution p(z|x) (green edge), corresponding to our representa-tion network, is shared between the source and target domains.
Figure 2: Reverse KL allows a flexible alignment of the representation while still effectively preventing theout-of-distribution problem. (a) Source representation distribution (black). Consider the case where the datadistribution pS (x) of the source domain has two modes, then the representation distribution pS (z) will likelyalso have two modes; and consider the case where the target distribution has only one mode. (b) An acceptabletarget representation distribution (green) that helps the classifier avoid the out-of-distribution problem. ReverseKL allows for this type of flexible alignment (match to one/some of the modes) due to its mode-seeking nature.
Figure 3: Visualization using t-SNE of the representation space of our method KL and the baselinesMMD, DANN, ERM. For each method, the left subfigure corresponds to the source domain M0and the right one corresponds to the target domain M45 . Each color represents a digit class.
