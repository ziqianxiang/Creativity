Figure 1: Implicit versus automatic differentiation for different dataset difficulties, reconstructionlosses, lower is better. iDSPN+mom stands for iDSPN with Nesterov momentum. (left) and (right)compare models at equal iterations, (middle) compares models at roughly the same amount ofcomputation. We select (right) as an atypical example where DSPN outperforms iDSPN.
Figure 2: Relative reconstruction loss for autoencoding sets when fixing n and varying d, loss relativeto it=10 DSPN, lower is better.
Figure 3: Relative reconstruction loss for autoencoding sets when fixing d and varying n, loss relativeto it=10 DSPN, lower is better.
Figure 4: Random set examples for each combination of n and d. For d > 2, only the first twodimensions are shown. All models use 20 iterations.
