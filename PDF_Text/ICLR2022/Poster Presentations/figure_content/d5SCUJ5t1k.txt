Figure 2: t-SNE visualization of object features with our proposed semantic topology. Both previously-known categories and novel categories are binded to their corresponding nodes on the semantic topology. Itmaintains the previously-known category feature topology when learning novel categories.
Figure 1: t-SNE visualization of object features in ORE. The location of previously-known (the first fiveclasses) object features are severely distorted when learning new categories.
Figure 3: Illustration of two novel classes, e.g., chair, and refrigerator, are introduced to the open-worldobject detector at a specific time point during the training procedure. Each node in the semantic topology,termed as a semantic anchor, is pre-defined by a randomly-generated vector or derived from a well-trained lan-guage model before starting the training procedure. When the detector learns novel categories, the correspondingsemantic anchors are registered to the semantic topology firstly, then object features of the same category areconstrained to close to its semantic anchor. At the inference stage, the RoI feature classifier and the semanticfeature classifier are ensembled to make predictions.
