Figure 1: Red and blue circles represent the sourceand target texts respectively. (a) Existing methodscrucially ignore the inherit parallelism within thedata. (b) Our method first mines (roughly) parallelexpressions, then learns how to transfer style withthe self-supervision from the parallel expressions.
Figure 2: An example of aligned parallels byour scene graph based method. We underlinethe scene entities and annotate how We computedorder and â€œExist With ^tgt+ and ^tgt-.

Figure 4: (a) extraction of scene entities (Underlined) from source sentence and parallel targetsentences. Sentences with a + correspond to stgt+, and those with a - correspond to stgt- (i.e., expertand amateur demonstrations for imitation learning); (b) entity appearing order (dOrder, computed byedit distance); and (c) entity existence (dExist, computed by hamming distance).
