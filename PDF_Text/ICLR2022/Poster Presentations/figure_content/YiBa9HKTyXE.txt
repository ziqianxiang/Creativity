Figure 1: (A graphical depiction of Theorem 1â€™sproof sketch.) Assume that the minimizer is atthe origin. The proof of Theorem 1 first showsthat there exists an initialization and a sequenceof permutations, such that using those, we get tothe exact minimizer. Let the sequence of iteratesfor this run be xokpt. Consider a parallel run, whichuses the same sequence of permutations, but anarbitrary initialization point. Let this sequence bexk . The figure shows how xokpt converges to theexact optima, and the distance between xokpt and xkdecreases exponentially, leading to an exponentialconvergence for xk .
