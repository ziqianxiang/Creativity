Figure 1: Phase diagrams of six variable selection methods for a block-wise diagonal design. Theparameters (H, r, P) characterize the sparsity, signal strength, and design correlations, respectively.
Figure 2: The phase diagrams of Elastic net and its comparison with Lasso (notation: η = ρ∕(1+ μ)).
Figure 3: Left: Phase curves of SCAD. Middle and Right: Comparison of SCAD and Lasso.
Figure 4: Comparison of the phase diagrams of thresholded Lasso and Lasso.
Figure 5: The phase diagrams of forward selection and forward backward selection.
Figure 6: Experiment 3 (effects of tuning parameters). In all plots, cyan points are computed from theformulas in our theory, and red points are the empirically best tuning parameters (they minimize theaverage Hamming error over 500 repetitions). In (a)-(b), the cyan/red points with t = 0 correspondto Lasso, and the other two are for thresholded Lasso. In (c)-(d), the cyan/red points with t = 0correspond to forward selection, and the other two are for forward backward selection.
