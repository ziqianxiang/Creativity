Figure 3: Visualization of convergence, stability,and generalization bound in Theorem 4.1. The twosets of visualizations are obtained by choosing differ-ent speeds CÎ˜ in the convergence rate and stability.
Figure 4: Convergence of recovery error. SinceAPF takes a long time to converge, its curve areoutside the range of these plots. We use a dash-line to represent the final `2 error it achieves.
