Figure 1: Visual comparison of the true and learned adjacency matrices G of a 10-variable Lorenz system (seesection 4.1). GNGM (the proposed continuous-time approach) and GNGC (Neural Granger Causality (Tank et al.,2018)) are estimates of continuous and discrete-time algorithms respectively. Panel (a) shows a data sample andthe true adjacency matrix, panel (b) shows estimates with higher frequency of observation (∆t = ti - ti-1 =0.05) and panel (c) with lower frequency of observation (∆t = 0.25). The heat scale gives the strength ofestimated functional interactions. An explicitly continuous-time model is more accurate and more robust to thesampling frequency than discrete-time alternatives for graphical modelling in dynamical systems.
Figure 2: True positive (higher better) and false discovery (lower better) performance comparisons on Lorenz’smodel. Thresholds are chosen for maximum F1 score. We omitted plotting NGC-MLP which gave very similarresults to NGC-LSTM. NGM is the proposed approach.
