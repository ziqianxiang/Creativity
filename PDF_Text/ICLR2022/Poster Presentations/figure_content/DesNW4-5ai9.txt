Figure 2: The relative frequencydistributions of normalized∣Sign(IG(f, X)) — Sign(Vf)∣and ∣Sign(RIG(f, X)) — Sign(Vf)∣.
Figure 3: The first row is the original image and the IG before and after attack. The second row isthe original image and the RIG before and after attack. The images from left to right are the originalimages, the original IG (RIG) of the image, the IG (RIG) after TAIG-S attack, and the IG (RIG)after TAIG-R attack. The results are obtained from ResNet50.
