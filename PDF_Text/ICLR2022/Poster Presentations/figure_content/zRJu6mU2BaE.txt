Figure 1: Our framework consists of three steps: (a) Pre-training the backbone using a self-supervised contrastiveloss; (b) Learning the masking module on the target data to select relevant features, and (c) Fine-tuning thebackbone using a regularized loss with positively relevant features.

T-SNE plot of positiveand negative features of CropDisease dataset for (b) 5-way 5-shot, (c) 5-way 20-shot settingComparison between positive and negative features: We also investigate the difference betweenthe positive and negative features. In practice, the positive features are more relevant to the classifica-tion task, and therefore expected to be more discriminative than the negative features. We quantify thediscrimination ability of features using the metric DS = T r(Sb)/T r(Sw), where Sb is the between-class scatter matrix, Sw is the Within-Class scatter matrix and Tr(∙) is the trace operation. The scattermatrices are defined as Sb = PN=I ni(μi - μ)(μi - μ)τ and Sw = PM=I(Xj - μyj)(xj - μy∕τ,where μ% is the sample mean of the ith class, μ is the mean of all the samples, and n is the numberof samples in the ith class With a total of N classes. (xj, yj) is the jth sample-label pair out of Mtotal samples. Higher values of DS indicate better discrimination. We compared DS across differentshots and datasets in Table 3 for the 5-way setting. As expected, DS scores for the positive featuresare higher than that of the negative features for both the 5-shot and 20-shot settings. The DS scoresget higher for the positive features of the 20-shot setting since more training samples produce better8Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2022Table 3: Discrimination scores (DS) of positive (+) and negative features (-) for different shots (S) and datasets	ChestX				ISIC				EuroSAT				CroPDisease			Setting	5S+	5S-	20S+	20S-	5S+	5S-	20S+	20S-	5S+	5S-	20S+	20S-	5S+	5S-	20S+	20S-DS	0.018	0.016	0.03	0.02	0.13	0.10	0.17	0.09	0.67	0.42	0.62	0.28	0.63	0.41	0.77	0.31
