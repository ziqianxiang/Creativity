Figure 1: (Left) Partitions of the set of all tournaments on n nodes using flip classes. Every shadedregion is a flip class partition and every circle indicates a tournament. The flip class that containsthe transitive tournament (Flip class 1) is precisely the set of all locally transitive tournaments. Thisis also the set of all tournaments that can be represented in 2 dimensions (Section 5). Every flipclass contains a canonical representative termed the R-cone (Section 4), indicated using the largercircle inside each flip class. The tournaments that cannot be represented using d dimensions appearas union of Forbidden Flip classes (Flip class k in Figure) (Section 4). (Right) Explicit flip classpartition of the 4 possible non-isomorphic tournaments on 4 nodes. Tournaments in flip class 1 canbe represented using 2 dimensions whereas tournaments in flip class 2 cannot (see Section 5).
Figure 2: A simple tournament to illustrate that the quantity Î¼(T) need not be same as the size of theminimum feedback arc set. All edges go from left to right except the ones in red. See Remark 2 inSection 7 for details.
