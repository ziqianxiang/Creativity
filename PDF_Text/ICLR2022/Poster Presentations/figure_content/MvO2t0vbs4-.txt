Figure 1: Committee-based models achieve ahigher accuracy than single models on Ima-geNet while using fewer FLOPs. For example,although Inception-v4 (‘Incep-v4’) outperformsall single ResNet models, a ResNet cascade canstill outperform Incep-v4 with fewer FLOPs.
Figure 2: Ensembles work well in the large computation regime and cascades show benefits in allcomputation regimes. These cascades are directly converted from ensembles without optimizingthe choice of models (see Sec. 4). Black dots represent single models. Ensembles: Ensemblesare more cost-effective than large single models, e.g., EfficientNet-B5/B6/B7 and ResNet-152/200.
Figure 3: Different metrics for the confidencefunction. For a EfficientNet-B0 model, we se-lect the top-k% validation images with highestconfidence scores and compute the classificationaccuracy within the selected images. The higherthe accuracy is at a certain k, the better the confi-dence metric is. All the metrics perform similarlyin estimating how likely a prediction is correct.
Figure 4: Cascades with different confidencethresholds. Each black dot is a single modeland each square is an ensemble of models. Eachcolored dot represents a cascade with a specifict1 (0 ≤ t1 ≤ 1). As t1 increases from 0 to 1,the cascade uses more and more computation andchanges from a single model (first model in thecascade; t1 = 0) to the ensemble (t1 = 1).
Figure 5: Cascades of EfficientNet, ResNet, MobileNetV2 or ViT models on ImageNet. Comparedwith single models, cascades can obtain a higher accuracy with similar cost (red squares) or achievea significant speedup while being equally accurate (green squares; e.g., 5.4x speedup for B7). Thebenefit of cascades generalizes to all four architecture families and all computation regimes.
Figure 6: Confidence vs. accuracy for EfficientNet-B3, ResNet-50, MobileNet-1.0@192, and X3D-M on their respective dataset. ‘Original’ refers to the original prediction and ‘Calibration’ refersto the prediction after calibration. We divide the confidence into several intervals. Then for eachinterval, we visualize the accuracy of images whose confidence is within this interval. The originalprediction is slightly underconfident, i.e., the confidence p is slightly lower than the actual accuracyof images whose prediction confidence is p. After calibration, the confidence almost equals to theactual accuracy.
