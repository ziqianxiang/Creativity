Figure 1: Orbits in R2 . Eachcolor represents points in thesame orbit under G’s action.
Figure 2: Two (unvectorized) basis kernels (j = 1, i= 1, r ∈ {1, 2}) from Thm. 2.1 for G = SO(2), l = 1, J =2.
Figure 3: Basis for G = SO(2)-steerable kernels fromEq. 4. ρin = ρl=0 is 1-dimensional. ρout = ρJ for J ∈{0, 1, 2}, Which are 1, 2 and 2 dimensional. Each column isan element Kjisr of the basis, While each roW is an outputThis can be verified visually: in Fig. 3band 3c, the second column is obtained bysWapping the roWs of the first and by chang-ing the sign of the second roW.
Figure 4: Basis for G = C4-steerable kernels as in Eq. 4 using a steerable basis B built from circular harmonicsusing Eq. 5. Pin = Pl=0, while Pout = PJ for J ∈ {0, 1, 2}, which are 1, 2, and 2 dimensional. Each column isan element Kj(j0i0t0)sr of the basis, while each row is a different output channel. Since po Z PJ = PJ, j = J;for circular harmonics, i0 = 1. We require G = C4 equivariance, so a frequency j0 = 4 filter is invariant to G;analogously, the output of frequency j 0 = |j + 4k| filters (k ∈ Z) transforms like the output of a frequency j one.
Figure 5: Histograms of relative equivariance errorsof three different Icosahedral I-steerable bases. Thefirst two parameterize two different orbits of I whilethe third uses our basis based on spherical harmonics.
