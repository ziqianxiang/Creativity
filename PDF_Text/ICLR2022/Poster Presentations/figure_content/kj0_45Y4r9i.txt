Figure 1: Illustration of binary hypothetical labelingsThe discriminative clustering literature (Xu et al., 2004; Gomes et al., 2010) has demonstrated thepotential of multi-class classification for clustering problem. Inspired by the natural connectionbetween clustering and classification, we proposes the framework of Clustering by UnsupervisedClassification which models clustering problem as a multi-class classification problem. A classifieris learnt from unlabeled data with a hypothetical labeling, which is associated with a candidatepartition of the unlabeled data. The optimal hypothetical labeling is supposed to be the one such thatits associated classifier has the minimum generalization error bound. To study the generalizationbound for the classifier learnt from hypothetical labeling, the concept of classification model isneeded. Given unlabeled data {xl}ln=1, a classification model MY is constructed for any hypotheticallabeling Y = {yl }ln=1 as follows.
