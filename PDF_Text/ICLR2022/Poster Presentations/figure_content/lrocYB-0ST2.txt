Figure 2: Display of the 2D response EpqX ∈ L2(Ω2) of the operator in (6) for various 1D inputs X ∈L2(Ω). (left/Center) Dirac inputs X = δu centered at two different locations u; (right) Constantinput X = 1. The responses are localized on the p - q diagonal, corresponding to interactions betweentwo patches at distance around P - q. Here, we took (p,q) = (4,0), with a signal size ∣Ω∣ = 20.
Figure 3: (left) Mean squared error of kernel ridge regression on Cifar10 for different kernels with3x3 patches as a function of sample size (averaged over the 10 classes). (center) Eigenvalue decays ofkernel matrices (with Exp kernels) on 1000 Cifar images, for different depths, patch sizes (3 or 5) andpooling sizes. (right) decays for 2-layer architecture, Gaussian pooling filter vs strided convolutions(i.e., no pooling). The plots illustrate that pooling is essential for reducing effective dimensionality.
