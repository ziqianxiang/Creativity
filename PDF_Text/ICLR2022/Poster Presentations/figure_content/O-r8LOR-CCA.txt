Figure 1: In the open-world SSL, the unlabeled dataset may contain classes that have never beenencountered in the labeled set. Given unlabeled test set, the model needs to either assign instances toone of the classes previously seen in the labeled set, or form a novel class and assign instances to it.
Figure 2: Overview of ORCA framework. ORCA utilizes additional classification heads for novelclasses. Objective function in ORCA consists of (i) supervised objective with uncertainty adaptivemargin, (ii) pairwise objective that generates pseudo-labels, and (iii) regularization term.
