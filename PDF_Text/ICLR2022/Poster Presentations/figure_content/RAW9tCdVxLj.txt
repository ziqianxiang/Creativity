Figure 1: Framework of the proposed Zero-CL. The illustrated embedding Z ∈ R8 ×6 means thereare eight samples with six features. Zero-CL includes two branches, i.e., feature-wise branch(Zero-FCL, bottom) and instance-wise branch (Zero-ICL, top). In instance-wise branch, whiten-ing transformation is conducted on instance dimension. Then, the trace of cross affinity matrixtr((HA)>HB) is maximized. Note feature-wise branch is similar to instance-wise branch.
Figure 2: Frameworks of SimCLR (a), BarloW Twins (b), Zero-ICL (C) and Zero-FCL (d), whererow vector means one embedding of instance, and column vector means vector composed by i-th dimension feature values among all instance. The solid red line means negative pairs and thecorresponding objective function includes such negative term. The dash red lines mean the twovectors are orthogonal and thus, there is no need for negative term in objectives.
Figure 3: Classification accuracy on CIFAR-100 under different hidden dimensions in (a), (b) andbatch size in (c), (d). For (a) and (b), the batch size of Zero-ICL and Zero-FCL are set 256 and 1024.
