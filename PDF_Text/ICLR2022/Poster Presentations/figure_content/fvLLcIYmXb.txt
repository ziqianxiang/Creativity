Figure 1: A tiny version of the overall Axial Shifted MLP (AS-MLP) architecture.
Figure 2: (a) shows the structure of the AS-MLP block; (b) shows the horizontal shift, where thearrows indicate the steps, and the number in each box is the index of the feature.
Figure 3: The different sampling locations ofconvolution, SWin Transformer, MLP-Mixer,and AS-MLP. e.g., AS-MLP (s = 3, d = 1)shoWs the sampling locations When the shiftsize is 3 and dilation is 1.
Figure 4: The visualization of features from SwinTransformer and our AS-MLP.
Figure 5:	The throughput curve when the batch size is 1, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, respectively.
Figure 6:	The evaluation accuracy of AS-MLP and Swin transformer on the ImageNet, COCO andADE20K datasets during training.
Figure 7: The object detection and instance segmentation results on the COCO dataset.
Figure 8: The semantic segmentation results on the ADE20K dataset.
