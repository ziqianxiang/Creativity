Figure 1: Example comparing Fisher-Rao with Mahalanobis distances to distinguish between 1DGaussian distributions, showcasing the motivation to use of Fisher-Rao metric for OOD detection.
Figure 2: Probability distributions of the Igeood score under three different settings for a pre-trained DenseNet on CIFAR-10 for in-distribution and OOD data (TinyImageNet downsampled).
Figure 3: Histograms of the standardized first coordinate output of each hidden feature of aDenseNet model for in-distribution and out-of-distribution (TinyImageNet) compared to a 1-D Nor-mal distribution. The Average Shapiro-Wilk test’s W statistics is close to one for Conv 0, Block1 and Block 2, which indicates that the coordinates, and potentially the feature vector, are prov-ably Gaussian. The penultimate layer (outputs of Block 3) has a lower test statistic for the givenexperiments.
Figure 4: Histograms of the Mahalanobis and Igeood scores for the output of each hidden block ofa DenseNet model for CIFAR-10 (in-dstribution) and SVHN (out-of-distribution). The title showsthe TNR at TPR-95% considering only the scores of the outputs of the given layer. The logisticregression found as coefficients: α = (1.0, -3.6, -0.13) for Mahalanobis and α = (1.0, 1.3, 1.2)for Igeood.
