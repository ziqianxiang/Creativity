Figure 1: Left: A label taxonomy represented as a DAG. Center: A 2-dimensional box embeddingof this taxonomy. Right: Scores assigned by the box embedding model to each label for two inputs.
Figure 2: Critical diagrams of the post-hoc Nemenyi test across all 12 datasets.
Figure 3: The figure on the left shows the envelope of the ROC curves for the ancestor-descendantrelationship classification in the label space for different embedding based models across the datasetsand the table on the right is the area under the ROC curves. As seen, MBM implicitly captures thelabel taxonomy well compared to all other models.
Figure 4: Above figure shows the variation of performance w.r.t the embedding dimensions formodel MBM and MVM on FUNCAT datasets. Note that the training and evaluation performed forthis analysis includes the root node.
Figure 5: As discussed in Section 7, the scatter plots further show that the magnitude of box em-beddings(box volume) relate to the level of generality in taxonomy.In the figure, the marginal scorerefers to box volume of a label and the number of children in the label space taxonomy refers to thelevel of generality.Note that the training and evaluation performed for this analysis includes the rootnode.
