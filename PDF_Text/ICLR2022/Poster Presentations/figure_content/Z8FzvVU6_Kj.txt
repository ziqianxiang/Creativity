Figure 1: Two stages of SUMNAS: supernet training and search with evaluation of sub-models.
Figure 2: An example of topological equilibrium. Multiple sub-models with different edges couldbe reduced down to a single architecture. Different combination of skip-connect and 3x3 convencapsulated in the box produce exactly the same output and thus are all equal to the graph on thefar right.
Figure 3: Validation losses of 20 sampled sub-models during SUMNAS supernet training (left), andmeans and standard deviations of sub-model accuracies with the supernet parameters (right) withvarious number of adaptation steps on CIFAR-10 and the NAS-Bench-201 search space.
Figure 4: The architecture SUMNAS found on the NAS-Bench-201 search space and CIFAR-10(Krizhevsky et al., 2009).
Figure 5: The architecture SUMNAS found on the MobileNet-based search space and ImageNet(Russakovsky et al., 2015). MBe k Ã— k represents a MobileNet block whose expansion ratio is e andkernel size is k. s specifies the stride of the block. The grey line indicates where the channel size ischanged and the number over the line is the channel size.
