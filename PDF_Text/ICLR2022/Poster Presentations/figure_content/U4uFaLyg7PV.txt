Figure 1: Given an input signal, We first perform (a) Frequency Spectrum Energy Analysis todecompose signal (fs) into multiple frequency subbands with comparable energy, where eachsubband contains at most one formant. Then, according to the above decomposition, we con-struct (b) T-WaveNet, a tree-structured network, where each node is a (c) Frequency BisectionOperator built with an INN-based wavelet transform. The operator outputs the high- (d) and low-frequency (c) components of the input if its binary gate value is “1”, and otherwise bypass the input(φ, ψ, ρ, and η have the same structure: Conv1D(3, 1)→LeakyRelu(α = 0.01)→Dropout(rate =50%)→Conv1D(3, 1)→Tanh.). Considering the personalized heterogeneity of the input, we utilize a(d) Feature Fusion Module to fuse the subband features {hi } according to the feature dependen-cies across various frequency components. Finally, the enhanced feature vectors are supervised byCross-Entropy loss for classification. See Section 3 for more details.
Figure 2: Effectiveness of FSEA for tree structure configuration. The histograms below denotethe energy preserved in the frequency subband of each leaf. (a) is the configuration obtained withFSEA (Section 3.1), wherein the energy contained in each subband is similar. (b) and (c) are othertwo exemplar configurations with uneven energy distribution due to the coarser split of the dominantfrequency range, all of which suffer from performance degradation (decreased Fm). See Section 4.2.
