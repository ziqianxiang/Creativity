Figure 1: A student applies in Year 2021 and receivesan unfavorable admission outcome. The student im-plements one of the recommended recourse x0 cho-sen from the counterfactual plan ｛xj ｝ and re-appliesin Year 2022. However, the outcome is again unfavor-able because of the change in the model parameters θ .
Figure 2: Illustration with d = 2 andJ = 3. Shaded area is Θ({xj}), dashedellipsoid represents (θ - μ)>Σ-1 (θ -b) = 1, black dots are the locations ofZj/λ?.
Figure 3: The impact of the Gelbrich radius on the validity of a counterfactual plan. The verticalaxis of each green point represents the empirical validity of the plan With respect to which θ 〜N(μg, Σg) and the horizontal axis is the GelbnCh distance G((μ, ∑), (μg, Σg)).
Figure 4: The impact of shift magnitudes on the validity of the plans obtained by three algorithms.
Figure 5: The impact of shift magnitudes on the validity of the plans obtained by three algorithms.
Figure 6: Evaluation of Mahalanobis correction on the real-world datasets. We fix ∆ = 0.1, evaluatethe effect of the number of correction on the lower validity bound, diversity, and proximity (leftcolumn). We fix K = 3, evaluate the effect of the perturbation limit on the lower validity bound,diversity, and proximity (right column).
