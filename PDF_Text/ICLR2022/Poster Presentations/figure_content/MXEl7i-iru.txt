Figure 1: The results for overfitting to minor classes, node memorization, and neighbor memorization. DaShlines are learning curves including all classes and solid lines are learning curves for the minor class in (a)and (b). In (c), the blue/red bars indicate the accuracy of seen/unseen nodes with seen neighbors in the node-replacing experiments. In (d), the blue/red bars denote the accuracy of seen nodes with seen/unseen neighborsin the neighbor-replacing experiments. Note that RW and OS represent re-weighting and oversampling.
Figure 2: Overall pipeline of GraPhENS. Vminor is a node sampled from the minor class to be augmented(oversampled). vtarget is a node sampled from the entire class and exploited to synthesize the ego network.
Figure 4: The learning curves over the training phase.
Figure 5: The train accuracy curves for all methods and test accuracy curves for each class on PubMed-LTdataset. Solid lines represents Minor_ 1 class, dashed lines are MinOr_2, and finely-dotted lines are Major class,respectively.
Figure 6: The decision boundaries of Re-weighting and our method are visualized by using 2D hidden repre-sentations of GNN.
Figure 7: Performance analysis according to the oversampling ratio with AmazonPhoto dataset with Graph-SAGE.
Figure 8: Overall pipeline of node-replacing and neighbor-replacing experiments.
