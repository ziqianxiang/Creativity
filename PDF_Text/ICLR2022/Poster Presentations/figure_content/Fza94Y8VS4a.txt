Figure 1: “Possible” vs. “Probable”: In the heat-map, red (warm) and blue (cool) colors representhigh and low densities respectively.
Figure 2: We plot the evolution of uncertainty for MWU in an one-population game specified by0.1	1.0	-1.0the matrix A = -1.0	0.1	1.0 , with step-size = 0.01. As we did in Figure 2, in the top1.0	-1.0	0.1left plot is the initial distribution, which is uniform in the small square. The top right plot shows the“possibility” plot after 6000 steps, and the bottom left plot shows the corresponding heat-map plotof probability densities.
