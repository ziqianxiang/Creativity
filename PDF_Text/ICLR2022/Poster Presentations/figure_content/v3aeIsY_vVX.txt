Figure 1: Left An example of pitch inaccuracy where HiFi-GAN has an average error of 65.8 centsand CARGAN obtains an error of 15.1 cents. Right An example of periodicity inaccuracy whereHiFi-GAN has an RMSE of 0.19 and CARGAN obtains an RMSE of 0.04.
Figure 2: Overview of our proposed Chunked Autoregressive GAN (CARGAN). Blue trapezoidsare the learned encoder (E), generator (G), and discriminators (D). Dashed lines represent operationsonly performed during training. The red line and red highlighted region are the autoregressive loop,where previously generated samples are passed as autoregressive conditioning when generating thenext chunk. The previous samples are always prepended when performing concatenation along thetime axis.

Figure 5: Spectrogram visualizations for our low frequency modeling experiment on a repeatedkick drum sample with a gradually increasing center frequency on a high-pass filter. Comparingthe lowest frequencies of each transient shows that CARGAN-16k is most capable of modeling theeffect of this high-pass filter.
Figure 6: Spectrogram visualizations for our reverb modeling experiment on a repeated snare samplewith a gradually increasing reverb decay time. All models are capable of reproducing reverb in thissimple case. Comparing the high-frequencies of each transient shows that CARGAN-16k is mostcapable of accurately modeling the high-frequencies.
Figure 7: Spectrogram visualizations for our polyphonic modeling experiment on a MIDI pianoinstrument with a gradually increasing number of notes. HiFi-GAN exhibits a strong vibrato that iseasier to hear than to see on a spectrogram. CARGAN and CARGAN-16k exhibit periodic boundaryartifacts which are clearly visible in the spectrogram.
