Figure 1:	The overall analyse of AT and SEAT.
Figure 2:	The loss surfaces of ResNet18 on CIFAR-10 test data. The loss surface of the standardadversarially trained models transitions up and down, which means the loss of such a model changesdramatically as moving along some directions. In contrast, SEAT has a fairly smooth landscape.
Figure 3: The overall ablation study of SEAT. The dashed line represents the natural accuracy whilethe solid line represents the robust accuracy.
