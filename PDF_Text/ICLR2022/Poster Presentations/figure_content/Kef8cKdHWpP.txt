Figure 1: Humans use various tools to manipulate deformable objects much more effectively than state-of-the-artrobotic systems. This work aims to narrow the gap and develop a method named DiffSkill that learns to use toolslike a rolling pin, spatula, knife, etc., to accomplish complicated dough manipulation tasks. Our method learnsskill abstraction using a differentiable physics simulator, composes the skills for long-horizon manipulation ofthe dough, and evalulated in three challenging sequential deformable object manipulations tasks: LiftSpread,GatherTransport, and CutRearrange.

(b) Neural abstraction by imitating the expert demonstration, which consist of agoal-conditioned policy, a feasibility predictor and a reward predictor. (c) Planning for both skill combinationand the intermediate goals to solve long-horizon tasks.
Figure 3: Visualization of the generated plan and the corresponding execution. The plan generated by DiffSkin isshown in the left, where the first and the last image are the given initial and goal observation and in between arethe generated intermediate goals. The color blocks indicate which tool is needed to reach the sub-goal. Theright shows sampled frames during the execution of the generated plan using the corresponding goal conditionedpolicy. The numbers on the bottom right shows the achieved normalized improvement metric at that time.
