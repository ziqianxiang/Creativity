Figure 1: Illustration of modular robot locomotion task. Each node is corresponded to a limb, andeach non-torso limb has an actuator to execute an action, which controls the torque of the jointconnecting two limbs.
Figure 2: Training curveon Animal-WalkersAMORPHEUS (Kurin et al., 2021) proposes a plain transformermodel without morphological information due to the aforementionedover-smoothing problem. However, we can still incorporate the mor-phological information into the transformer, i.e., the structural embed-ding widely utilized in NLP to add the structural bias.

Figure 8: t-SNE visualization of positional embeddings learned from multiple robots with variousmorphology. The points are corresponded to the reduced positional embedding of each node indifferent morphologies. The shape denotes the morphology it belongs to and the color denotes itslimb type. Walker(Cheetah)\{foot} are the variants lacking of feet.

For example, SWAT trained on the trainset of Walker++ is tested on Walker_3加ain and Walker_64ain. Note that We omit thelacking part in the name of morphologies in the Table 3 and 4.
