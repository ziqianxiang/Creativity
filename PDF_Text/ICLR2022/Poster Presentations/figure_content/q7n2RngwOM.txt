Figure 9: Plots of recovered-true latent. Rows: first 10 nonlinear random models, columns: outcome noiselevel.
Figure 10: Plots of recovered-true latent. Conditional prior depends on t. Rows: first 10 nonlinear randommodels, columns: outcome noise level. Compare to the previous figure, we can see the transformations fort = 0, 1 are not the same, confirming the importance of balanced prior.
