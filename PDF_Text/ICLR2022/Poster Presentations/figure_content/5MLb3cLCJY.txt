Figure 1: The detail component of table, car, chair, and cupfrom the test set of ModelNet40 (WU et al., 2015). Colorsrepresent the absolute values of the detail coefficients perpoint. The larger values (redder colors), the higher prob-ability that the points locate on high-frequency parts, e.g.,edges or non-flat areas. Such geometric representations arelearned implicitly in 3D shape classification task.

Figure 5: On the right, the curves show the classification results of AWT-Net tested on the 3D shapeswith different numbers of randomly sampled points (shown on left).
Figure 6: The detail component of chair, table, guitar, sofa, stool, wardrobe, and shelf. Colorsrepresent the absolute values of the detail coefficients per point. The larger values (redder colors),the higher probability that these points locate on high-frequency parts, e.g., edges or non-flat areas.
