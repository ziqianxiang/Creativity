Figure 1: Markov chainof adversarial attackWe can derive the lower bound of the miss-classification probability with the perturbed categoricalinput X0 following Fano inequality:RdV = P(y0≠y∣∣dif(b,ι^)∣≤ɛ) ≥ 1 -"Y0;YoS)+ M	(14)where ) denotes the number of the classes in the learning task. Based on Data Processing Inequalityillustrated in Chapter 2 (Mack, 2006), we can further obtain:R眇 ≥ 1 - (	；0SK	(i(Y0；Y，s)≤/(X0;Y,S))1 21 (X ;Y,S)-2η X - / (X 0;Y,S)+const=1----------------------------------IogKwhere η X = I (X ;Y,S) -1 (X 0;Y,S) denotes the mutual information difference between the unperturbedX and the adversarially perturbed instance X0.
