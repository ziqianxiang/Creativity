Figure 2:	Different architectures of Siamese model. When it is trained experimentally, the inversepredictor in (c) has the same architecture as predictor h.

(b) Normally train the model as SimSiam for 5 epochs, then using collapsing loss for 1epoch to reduce mr , followed by a correlation regularization loss. (c) Cosine similarity between re(oe) and gradient on Za induced by a correlation regularization loss.

Figure 9: BN with MSE helps prevent collapse without predictor or stop gradient. Its performance,however, is inferior to the cosine loss-based SimSiam (with predictor and stop gradient).
