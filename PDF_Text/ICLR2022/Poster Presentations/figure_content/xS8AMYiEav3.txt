Figure 1: Comparison of different approaches to the neural network repair problem. The black linesrepresent the original neural network function. The red dot represents the buggy input. The coloredlines represent the functions after the repairs are done.
Figure 2: Left: the target DNN with buggy inputs. Right: the REASSURE-repaired DNN with thepatch network shown in red. Support network gA is for approximating the characteristic functionon A; Affine patch function pA ensures the satisfaction of Φ on A; The design of the patch networkhA ensures locality for the final patch.
Figure 3: An illustration of multi-region repair with three different repair regions. Left: the originalDNN; Middle Left: repair A1 ∪ A2 ∪ A3 with pA1 ; Middle Right: repair A2 ∪ A3 with pA2 - pA1 ;Right: repair A3 with pA3 - pA2Once we have gAl (x, γ) and pAl (x), we can “stitch” multiple local patches into a final patch asfollows.
