Figure 1: (a) The architecture of CrossFormer for classification. The input size is H0 × W0 , and thesize of feature maps in each stage is shown on the top. Stage-i consists ofa CEL and ni CrossFormerblocks. Numbers in CELs represent kernels’ sizes used for sampling patches. (b) The inner structureof two consecutive CrossFormer blocks. SDA and LDA appear alternately in different blocks.
Figure 2: Illustration of the CEL layer. The in-put image is sampled by four different kernels(i.e., 4 × 4,8 × 8,16 × 16, 32 × 32) with samestride 4 × 4. Each embedding is constructed byprojecting and concatenating the four patches.
Figure 3: (a) Short distance attention (SDA). Embeddings (blue cubes) are grouped by red boxes. (b)Long distance attention (LDA). Embeddings with the same color borders belong to the same group.
Figure 4: An example of com-puting (∆xij , ∆yij ).
