Figure 1: Two 1-WL equivalent graphs with different color-ings after one step of individualization and refinement.
Figure 2: An example search tree of color-ings generated by exact graph isomorphismsolvers. Initial coloring is produced by 1-WLrefinement. PF-GNN approximates the treeby sampling multiples paths from root to leaf.
Figure 3: Runtime ratio of PF-GNN on SR25 dataset.
Figure 4: Example equitable partitions. The middle coloring in the second row is both equitable anddiscrete coloring.
Figure 5: IR process: First a vertex is distinguished from rest of the vertices and this information ispropagated to other nodes via message passing to generate a refined equitable coloring of the graph.
