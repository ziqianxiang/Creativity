Figure 1: Conceptual illustration of the MFcond loss and network inference. (a) The bold green linesindicate a single trajectory of the proposed CSDE, while other trajectories are shown in shaded regions. TheMFcond loss estimates the conditioned losses l ◦ Tsα,τs (e.g., red vertical lines) at τs. The empty parts of theαblack lines indicate the irregularly-sampled (unobserved) data representation. (b) The average decision Xtαk (e.g.,green cross) is estimated to approximate the true test data ytk (e.g., red cross) using multiple past observations.

The distinct point is that control agents are obtained by the gradientdescent of the MBcond loss with BSDE (i.e., Zt). Note that, as shown in (31), θ(K) is actually anoptimal control. This means that, without heavy calculations to solve the PDEs, the gradient descentalgorithm also assures optimality of control agents in the proposed control set A.
