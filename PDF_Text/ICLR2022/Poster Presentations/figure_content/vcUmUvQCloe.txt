Figure 1: Sampled φJ converges to exact φJwith L2 norm ≈ 1.45 ; k = 2 BostonFigure 2: Difference between consecutive φJsamples averages converges to zero; k = 2movie review #24.2.3	Movie reviewsWe train a fully connected neural network (two hidden layers, 16 units per layer, ReLU activations)on the binary movie review classifications in Pang & Lee (2005). From the full set of reviews, weremove a test block of 100 (picked to include those in Table 1 of Dhamdhere et al. (2020)) for analysis.
