Figure 1: URejectron in three settings. z contains “normal” examples on which the classifier can have highaccuracy. X includes Z and consists of a mix of 50% “normal” examples and 50% adversarial examples. In (a),the normal examples are clean test inputs and the adversarial examples are generated by PGD attack. In (b), the“normal” examples are still clean test inputs but adversarial examples are generated by CW attack. In (c), the“normal” examples are generated by image corruptions (adversarial examples are generated by PGD attacks).
