Figure 1: Illustration of our approach on a 2-class UDA problem [better viewed in color]. (a) Apretrained encoder g defines a latent space Z with labelled source samples X ◦ and unlabelled targetsamples ×q under conditional and label shift (GeTarS).(b) We train a target classifier /n on a newdomain N, where labelled samples ×o are obtained by (i) mapping source samples with φ actingon conditional distributions and (ii) reweighting these samples by estimated class-ratios pYN /pYS . φshould match source and target conditionals and pYN should estimate target proportions pYT .
