Figure 1: Overall workflow of time-series active learning centered on TCLP. A data point that isqueried for a label is determined by a query selection strategy. The label obtained is then propagatedto adjacent data points guided by the TCLP framework.

Figure 4: Classification accuracy measured at each (1st-15th) round of active learning. The accuracyvalue is an average over all query selection methods. Detailed results are in Appendix B.
Figure 5: Classification accuracy with standard error measured at each (1st-15th) round of activelearning. The accuracy value is an average over all query selection methods. The black line labeledMAX at the top indicates the maximum classification accuracy.
