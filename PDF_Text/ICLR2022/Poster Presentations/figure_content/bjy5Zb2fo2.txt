Figure 1: Spherical scattering network of the signal f ∈ L2 (S2). The signal is propagated throughcascades of spherical scale-discretized wavelet transforms, combined with absolute value activationfunctions, i.e. U [p]f = |||f ? ψj1 | ? ψj2 | . . . ? ψjd |, denoted by red nodes. The outputs of thescattering network are given by projecting these signals onto the spherical wavelet scaling function,resulting in scattering coefficients S[p]f = |||f ? ψj1 | ? ψj2 | . . . ? ψjd | ? φ, denoted by blue nodes.

Figure 5: CMB simulations to be classified. Forthe weakly non-Gaussian simulations consideredthe classification problem is difficult; e.g. it is notpossible to distinguish the simulations by eye.
