Figure 1: Input and output cosine similarities of a single randomly initialized convolutional layerwith 100 filters. Each red circle in the figures represents a random pair of images chosen from thecorresponding dataset. 200 pairs were sampled in each figure.
Figure 2: Illustration of the shared r-boundary from definition 2 in case of two axis-aligned rectan-gles. The boundary is marked in green.
Figure 3: An illustration of the examples from remark 3. Note that similar examples can be con-structed in higher dimensions, e.g., by equally distributing the coefficients over a larger set of coor-dinates.
