Figure 1: The log-log plot and estimated conver-gence slope for Modified DRM and DRM usingFourier basis, showing the median error over 5replicates.
Figure 2: We verify the dimension dependent scaling law empirically. The multiplicative inverseof the scaling law coefficient is highly linear with the dimension d, showing the mean error over 2replicates.
Figure 3: Neural networks have the ability to adaptto simple functions and achieve convergence with-out curse of dimensionality, showing the medianerror over 5 replicates.
