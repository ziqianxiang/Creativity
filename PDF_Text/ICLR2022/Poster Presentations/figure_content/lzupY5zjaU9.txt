Figure 1:	For Gaussian targets P in Rd, KT-COMPRESS++ and Herd-COMPRESS++ improve upon the MMDof i.i.d. sampling (ST), closely track the error of their respective quadratic-time input algorithms KTand kernel herding (Herd), and substantially reduce the runtime.
Figure 2:	Given MCMC sequences summarizing challenging differential equation posteriors P, KT-Compress++ consistently improves upon the MMD of standard thinning (ST) and matches ornearly matches the error of of its quadratic-time input algorithm KT.
Figure 3: Coresets of size 32 (top) or 64 (bottom) with equidensity contours of the target underlaid.
Figure 4: For M -component mixture of Gaussian targets, KT-COMPRESS++ and Herd-COMPRESS++ im-prove upon the MMD of i.i.d. sampling (ST) and closely track or improve upon the error of theirquadratic-time input algorithms, KT and kernel herding (Herd). See App. G.1 for more details.
