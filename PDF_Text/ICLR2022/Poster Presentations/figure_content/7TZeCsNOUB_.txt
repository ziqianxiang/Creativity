Figure 1: FID curves (first row) and sample images for training StyleGAN2+ADA unconditionally(second row), conditionally (third row), and using our method (fourth row) on four datasets un-der the limited-data setup (from left to right: ImageNet Carnivores, Food101, CUB-200-2011, andAnimalFace). The vertical axis of FID plots is in log scale for better visualization.
Figure 2: The FID scores for different experiments on ImageNet Carnivores using unconditional,conditional, and our proposed training of StyleGAN2+ADA by varying (a) the number of classes(number of samples per class is fixed at 100) and (b) the number of images per class (the number ofclasses is fixed at 50). The total number of images for the experiments is shown on the data points.
Figure 3: The proposed modified training objective and architecture of StyleGAN2 allows for tran-sitioning from the unconditional to the conditional model during the training.
Figure 4: Visualization of the formation of the class “Panda” in AnimalFace during the transitionfrom unconditional to conditional training. The transition starts at t = 2k.
Figure 5: Visualization of the transition function λh T§, Te, and Tm denote the start of the transition,the end time of the transition, and the end of the training, respectively.
Figure 6: FID curves for training unconditional and conditional StyIeGAN2, as well as our method,on CIFAR100 with 100 classes and 300 images per class. The vertical axis is in the log scale.
Figure 7: FID curves for training unconditional and conditional StyIeGAN2, as well as our method,on ImageNet Carnivores with 50 classes and 500 images per class.
Figure 8: Visual results for the compared methods on four datasets.
