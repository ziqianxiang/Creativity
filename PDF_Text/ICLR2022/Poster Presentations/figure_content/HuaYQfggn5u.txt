Figure 12: Layer-wise cosine similarity of FedAvg and Fed-BABU trained under the realistic FL setting (f =0.1 andτ =10) during fine-tuning. The blue-, green-, and red-likelines represent low-, middle-, and high-level convolution lay-ers, respectively. The black line represents the last linearlayer (i.e., head).
