Figure 4: P-H change of AutoS SL-es4.5 Evolution of SSL Task Weights, Pseudo-Homophily and PerformanceTo answer Q4, we visualize the final task weights searched by AUTOSSL-ES on all datasets throughthe heatmap in Figure 3a. From the figure, we make three observations. Obs. 1: The searchedtask weights vary significantly from dataset to dataset. For example, the weights for Par and Dgiare [0.198, 0.980] on Physics while they are [0.955, 0.066] on WikiCS. Obs. 2: In general,Par benefits co-purchase networks, i.e. Photo and Computers; Dgi is crucial for citation/co-authorship networks, i.e. Physics, CS, Citeseer, and CoraFull. We conjecture that localstructure information (the information that Par captures) is essential for co-purchase networks whileboth local and global information (the information that Dgi captures) are necessary in citation/co-authorship networks. Obs. 3: AUTOSSL-ES always gives very low weights to CLU, which indicatesthe pseudo-labels clustered from raw features are not good supervision on the selected datasets.
