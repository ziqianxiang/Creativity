Figure 1: Block diagram illustration of the proposed MPGNNs-LSPE architecture along with theinputs, general framework of a layer, and the output and loss components.
Figure 2: Sample graph plots from the ZINC validation set with each node color in a graph represent-ing a unique RWPE vector, when k = 24. The corresponding graph ids, the number of nodes in thegraphs and the number of unique RWPEs are labelled against the figures.
Figure 3: Left: Example 3-regular graph with 8 nodes from Li et al. (2020b) where the nodes arestructurally different and colored accordingly. The 4-dim initial RWPE vector is shown against thecorresponding nodes with their respective colors. Right: Example pair of non-isomorphic graphswith 11 nodes and skip-links 2 and 3 from Murphy et al. (2019). Each node in a graph gets thesame 4-dim RWPE vector, and shown above in colors are the respective graphsâ€™ RWPE vectors afteraveraging across all the nodes.
Figure 4: A pair of non-isomorphic and non-regular graphs (Left: Decalin, Right: Bicyclopentyl)from Sato (2020). The 5-dim initial PE vector is shown against the corresponding nodes with theirrespective colors.
Figure 5: Plot of the number of nodes in a graph vs. the number of unique PE for LapPE and RWPE.
Figure 6: Sample graph plots from the ZINC validation set with each node color in a graph represent-ing a unique RWPE vector, when k = 24. The corresponding graph ids, the number of nodes in thegraphs and the number of unique RWPEs are labelled against the figures.
Figure 7: Test scores on selecting different Values of k which is used to determine the number ofiteratiVe stePs of RW in RWPE as well as the dimension of the learned PE at the final layer, Eqn. 12.
