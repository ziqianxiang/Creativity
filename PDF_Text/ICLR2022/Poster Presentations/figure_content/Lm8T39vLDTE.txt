Figure 1: Generation of Autoregressive Diffusion Models for the generation order σ = (3, 1, 2, 4).
Figure 2: ARDM training step. Thisstep optimizes for step t = 2 for allpossible permutations σ simultaneouslywhich satisfy σ(1) = 3.
Figure 3: Loss components for Parallelized ARDMs using a budget of 5 steps for a problem of 20steps. Left: individual loss component for every step. Right: parallelized policy extracted from thedynamic programming algorithm. Components of the same height are modelled simultaneously, sothey are inferred and generated in parallel.
Figure 4: Bit upscaling matrices for data with eight categories and hence three stages, meaningS = 3. Entries that are white represent zeros, coloured entries represent ones.
Figure 5: Visualization of x through the generative process for an ARDM Upscale 4 model.
Figure 6: Loss components over model step on CIFAR-10. The height is normalized so that theaverage represents the total bits per dimension. Left: loss terms for the OA-ARDM. Right: lossterms for the ARDM-Upscale 4, which comprises four stages.
