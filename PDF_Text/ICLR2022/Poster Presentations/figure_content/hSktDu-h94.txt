Figure 1: Mechanism of our APOC algorithm.
Figure 2: Comparing the SPO loss with different surrogate losses. The true item values to be rankedare (4.9, 5.1) (dark star). Two predictions are (3, 7) (magenta triangle) and (6, 5) (orange triangle).
Figure 3: Three DoG filters with the reception field of 40 items.
Figure 4: Left and mid panel show the performance of Algorithm 1 on Energy Cost-Aware Schedul-ing problem with different γ (fixing σ = 0.2) and different σ (fixing γ = 1.0), respectively. Theright panel shows the ablation study on the DoG wavelet filter parameterization (γ = 1.0, σ = 0.2),with black segments showing the (5%, 95%) percentile interval.
