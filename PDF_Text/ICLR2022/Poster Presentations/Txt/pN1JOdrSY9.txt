Modern unsupervised machine translation systems mostly train their models
by generating synthetic parallel training data from large unlabeled monolingual
corpora of different languages through various means, such as iterative back-
translation. However, there may exist small amount of actual parallel data hid-
den in the sea of unlabeled data, which has not been exploited. We develop a
new fine-tuning objective, called Language-Agnostic Constraint for SwAV loss, or
LAgSwAV, which enables a pre-trained model to extract such pseudo-parallel data
from the monolingual corpora in a fully unsupervised manner. We then propose an
effective strategy to utilize the obtained synthetic data to augment unsupervised
machine translation. Our method achieves the state of the art in the WMT’14
English-French, WMT’16 German-English and English-Romanian bilingual un-
supervised translation tasks, with 40.2, 36.8, and 37.0 BLEU, respectively. We
also achieve substantial improvements in the FLoRes low-resource English-Nepali
and English-Sinhala unsupervised tasks with 5.3 and 5.4 BLEU, respectively.
1	Introduction
The quest to build a fully unsupervised machine translation (UMT) system, where only unlabeled
monolingual corpora are available, has received increasing attention in recent years. Profoundly,
Lample et al. (2018a;c) introduced the general principles for UMT that include cross-lingual initial-
ization, language modeling and iterative back-translation. Although various UMT variants (Lample
et al., 2018a;c; Conneau & Lample, 2019; Song et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2020; Nguyen et al., 2021)
applied these principles differently, they ultimately train their models on noisy synthetic parallel
data generated by the models themselves or some randomization processes, which may cause harm
as the generated synthetic data is often noisy and low-quality, especially at the beginning of training.
However, these methods may have missed out a potential that some parallel (or comparable) data
may exist in the monolingual corpora, which can be effectively mined to augment the UMT training.
This paper is motivated to explore mining of pseudo-parallel data for UMT tasks. While there have
been limited research in unsupervised mining of such data (Wu et al., 2019a;b), there have been
several studies on bitext mining from sentence embeddings in semi-supervised translation or zero-
shot transfer setups (Zweigenbaum et al., 2018; Schwenk, 2018; Artetxe & Schwenk, 2019a;b).
However, these methods require the models to be pre-trained on massive multilingual parallel data,
which renders them inapplicable and incomparable to the fully unsupervised setup. Furthermore,
such models may not behave well off-the-shell on low-resource languages that were not in the pre-
training data, such as Nepali and Sinhala (GUzman et al., 2019). Meanwhile, applying these mining
algorithms directly to sentence embeddings produced by fully self-supervised models (Conneau &
Lample, 2019) leads to a significant amount of misalignments, which hurts the UMT models as
shown later in our experiments (§4).

(a) Contrastive but not language-agnostic
Figure 1: Illustrations of semantically contrastive and non-language-agnostic (1a) vs. language-
agnostic (1b) representations of English (red) and Romanian (cyan) sentences. For semantically
contrastive models, sentences of the same topic will be clustered in the same region. If the models
are also language-agnostic, the semantic regions will not differentiate sentences by language.
(b) Contrastive and language-agnostic
In this paper, we propose a novel modification to SwAV loss (Caron et al., 2020), called Language-
Agnostic Constraint for SwAV (LAgSwAV)1, which is used to fine-tune existing pre-trained self-
supervised models (Conneau & Lample, 2019; Liu et al., 2020), so that they become semantically
contrastive and language-agnostic. Specifically, semantic contrastiveness is defined, in this paper, as
the model’s ability to cluster sentences of similar semantic contents into similar groups. Meanwhile,
language-agnostic property means that the embedding space of sentences from different languages
are indistinguishably mixed together. Figure 1 further illustrates the two properties. We argue
that these two properties combined can help the model mine more accurate pseudo-parallel data,
since language-agnosticism reduces the distances between cross-lingual embeddings while semantic
contrastiveness helps bring sentences of similar contents closer together even if they are in different
languages. To achieve the semantically contrastive property, we adopt the SwAV loss (Caron et al.,
2020), which is designed to classify input data into different clusters that reflect certain semantic
characteristics. However, since SwAV is not designed to be language-agnostic, we introduce a new
language-agnostic constraint for it to enable the latter property. Analysis experiments in §4 show
that our constraint significantly outperforms vanilla SwAV loss as well as other baselines in mining
pseudo-parallel data from monolingual corpora.
After fine-tuning pre-trained self-supervised models with LAgSwAV loss, we sample sentences from
both languages and pass them to the model to obtain the SwAV cluster assignment probabilities,
which are treated as sentence embeddings. The soft cluster assignments are then matched by a
margin-based algorithm (Artetxe & Schwenk, 2019b) with additional filtering criteria (§3.2). To
augment UMT training with the obtained pseudo-parallel data, we propose a simple ranking-based
weighted cross-entropy loss to train on this data along with the standard iterative back-translation
(§3.3). We also adopt a dynamic weight to the augmentation loss to alleviate the overfitting effect
due to the limited augmentation data.
We tested our method on the standard bilingual WMT’14 English-French, WMT’16 German-
English and English-Romanian unsupervised translation tasks and achieved the state of the art with
40.2, 36.8, and 37.0 BLEU, respectively; which is up to 2 BLEU gain from the baselines. In the FLo-
Res low-resource unsupervised setups (Guzman et al., 2019), our method also outperforms mBART
baseline (Liu et al., 2020) by up to 2.8 BLEU in the English-Nepali and English-Sinhala tasks.
We conducted a series of analyses to demonstrate the outperforming ability of LAgSwAV in min-
ing pseudo-parallel data. The method is also found to outperform supervised LASER (Artetxe &
Schwenk, 2019a), which can be attributed to LASER’s lack of language specifiers.
2	Background
2.1	Unsupervised Machine Translation
Lample et al. (2018a) and Artetxe et al. (2018) were among the first to employ iterative back-
translation in fully unsupervised machine translation (UMT). Lample et al. (2018c) later formu-
lated the three-principles to UMT: initialization, language modeling and iterative back-translation
(Sennrich et al., 2016a). Initialization can takes form of MUSE bilingual dictionary (Lample et al.,
1 Code: https://github.com/nxphi47/fairseq/tree/swav_umt

2018b;a), cross-lingual masked language model (XLM) (Conneau & Lample, 2019) or Seq2Seq
model (Song et al., 2019). Language modeling often takes form of denoising autoencoding (Lam-
ple et al., 2018a) or is omitted entirely (Song et al., 2019). Apart from these principles, Nguyen
et al. (2021) use two distinct UMT teachers to distill the student in a two-stage back-translation
process. Despite being different, most existing methods commonly employ the same iterative back-
translation process. Multilinguality is also proved to be useful as Liu et al. (2020) and Garcia et al.
(2021) utilize extra training data of more than two languages. These methods, however, do not
leverage the potential pseudo-parallel data that may exist in the monolingual data to improve UMT.
2.2	Pseudo-Parallel Data Mining
Parallel data mining for machine translation has been an active field of research (Zweigenbaum et al.,
2018; Schwenk, 2018; Chinea-RIos et al., 2017). Artetxe & SchWenk (2019b) suggested an effective
margin-based algorithm to mine parallel data using sentence embeddings, which we also use in our
method. More recently, LASER (Artetxe & Schwenk, 2019a) was trained on massive multilingual
parallel data from 93 languages. Nonetheless, most of the effort has been invested largely in a
supervised setup where the training data is parallel. In terms of UMT, Wu et al. (2019a) proposed
an extract-edit approach to mine relevant data and edit it for use, while Wu et al. (2019b) mine
weakly-paired documents. Tran et al. (2020) suggested to train on massive multilingual data from
25 languages and mine data from 180 translation directions, which may not be applicable in bilingual
setup, where monolingual data only for the two languages under consideration are available.
2.3	Swapping Assignments between Views (SwAV Loss)
Caron et al. (2020) introduced Swapping Assignments between Views (SwAV) loss as a means
to conduct self-supervised training in computer vision because masking-based training methods
applied in language modeling are intractable in images. Although SwAV is a type of contrastive
learning, it differs from its sisters (Chen et al., 2020; He et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2018) in that it is an
online clustering-based method. This means the model is trained to assign cluster labels, or “code”
vector q, to an input image with encoded latent features z . In particular, SwAV loss seeks to enforce
consistency between codes of different augmentations (or views) of the same image. In other words,
different augmentations of the same image should have almost the same semantic content as the
original, and thus the cluster assignments of them should also be consistently the same.
Formally, let z1, z2 ∈ Rd be latent features of two distinct views X1, X2 of the same image X
after passing them through an encoder fθ, we compute the corresponding codes q1, q2 ∈ [0, 1]K by
passing z1, z2 into the prototype layer, which consists of prototype weights C = [c1, ..., cK] with
ci ∈ Rd. We then proceed to swap the codes q1, q2 and use them as labels for z2, z1, respectively:
LSwAV(z1,z2) = l(z1, q2) + l(z2, q1)
(1)
The loss function l(z, q) in Equation (1) measures the similarity distance between features z and
code q, and is defined as:
l(z, q) = -	qk logpk, with pk
k
exp(1 ZT Ck)
Pk0 eχp(IZTCkO)
(2)
where τ is a temperature hyper-parameter and k is the index for Ck row in C. Figure 2a illustrates
how SwAV loss works. While the above formulations involve two different augmentations X1, X2
of the same image for brevity purpose, multiple augmentations are used in practice. We refer the
reader to (Caron et al., 2020) for further details on SwAV loss.
3	Method
In this section, we present our three main contributions: the language-agnostic constraint for SwAV
loss or LAgSwAV (§3.1), the pseudo-parallel data mining with filter suite (§3.2), and finally the
rank-based cross-entropy loss for UMT training with augmented data (§3.3).

(a) Vanilla SwAV loss
Figure 2: Comparison between vanilla SwAV (2a) and LAgSwAV (2b) losses. The “Proto” block
represents the prototype layer C . Unlike SwAV, our LAgSwAV loss differentiates which language
a sentence belongs to. As in Figure 2b, the cluster assignments of English sentences (i.e., q1s , q2s)
are skewed towards left clusters (blue histogram), and those of Romanian (i.e., q1t , q2t) are skewed
towards right clusters (red dotted histogram), causing an imbalance. The Ω block rebalances them
into more evenly distributed assignments v1s, v2s, v1t and v2t .
(b) LAgSwAV loss
3.1	Language-Agnostic Constraint for SwAV Loss in Language Model
The SwAV loss was developed to conduct self-supervised training in vision due to infeasibility of
applying masked language modeling (MLM) to images (Caron et al., 2020). Thus, for language
model pre-training, we stick to MLM and use our proposed LAgSwAV to fine-tune a pre-trained
LM to achieve semantic contrastiveness and language agnosticism.
Specifically, in the presence of sentences from two languages, let Bs = [X1 , ..., XB] and Bt =
[Y1 , ..., YB ] be the batches of B sentences from language s and t, respectively. We proceed to
augment them into Bs,1 = [X11, ..., XB1 ] and Bs,2 = [X12, ..., XB2 ], and Bt,1 = [Y11, ..., YB1] and
Bt,2 = [Y12, ..., YB2] by various noising techniques, such as token swapping, masking and delet-
ing. Next, we denote Fθ as the Transformer encoder (Conneau & Lample, 2019), which outputs
the sentence embedding z given an input sentence. We compute the respective latent features
Zs,1,Zs,2,Zt,1,Zt,2 ∈ RB×d for Bs,1,Bs,2,Bt,1,Bt,2 using Fθ, as described in §2.3. Subse-
quently, we compute the code cluster assignments Qs,1, Qs,2, Qt,1, Qt,2 ∈ [0, 1]B×K as:
s,1	s,2	t,1 t,2 T
[Qs,1; Qs,2; Qt,1; Qt,2] = sinkhorn(exp(---------------------------))
(3)
where [•; •] is the row-wise concatenation function and Sinkhorn(∙) is the iterative Sinkhorn-KnoPP
algorithm (Cuturi, 2013), a batch-wise renormalization process to compute the cluster assignment
Probabilities, and is a hyPer-Parameter to control the smoothness of the distribution.
The above formulation is in fact indifferent from the vanilla SwAV loss (§2.3). However, intuitively,
if the model Fθ is not language-agnostic (i.e., s and t are distributionally seParate), the resulting
cluster assignments Qs,j and Qt,j are likely to be distributed unevenly for s and t. In other words,
some clusters ci ⊂ C will be frequently assigned to the sentences of language s but rarely to the
sentences of t, and vice versa. Figure 2b illustrates the imbalance Phenomenon. We argue that it is
Possible to enforce the language-agnostic ProPerty indirectly by fixing this imbalance Phenomenon.
Therefore, the objective of our ProPosed LAgSwAV is to measure the stochastic imbalance in clus-
ter assignments Qs,j, Qt,j, and rebalance them into V s,j, V t,j ∈ [0, 1]B×K such that clusters in
V s,j, V t,j are stochastically assigned evenly regardless of the language of the sentences. Then, we
comPute the total LAgSwAV loss as usual for both s and t as:
LsAgSwAV,i = l(zis,1, vis,2) + l(zis,2, vis,1) ; LtAgSwAV,i = l(zit,1, vit,2) + l(zit,2, vit,1)	(4)
LLAgSwAV =	LsAgSwAV,i +	LtAgSwAV,i
(5)
We formalize the transformation from Q to V using the language-agnostic rebalancing function
Ω, which operates at the batch level to capture the statistics on cluster assignments. Specifi-
cally, given the Q matrices sPecified above, we comPute the Per-language rebalance weight vectors
ws , wt ∈ RK , such that when multiplying them with prototype outputs, they try to suppress the
4

magnitudes of frequently-assigned clusters and promote those of rarely-assigned clusters, resulting
in more balanced cluster assignments. More formally, the weight vectors are computed as:
2B
2B
fs =	onehot([Qs,1; Qs,2])i ; ft =	onehot([Qt,1; Qt,2])i
i=1
ws
i=1
KK
1.0-(fs/Xfjs);wt=1.0-(ft/Xfjt)
j=1	j=1
(6)
(7)
where onehot(∙) is a row-wise one-hot function which returns a one-hot vector by turning the max-
imum entry in the row to 1.0 and the rest to 0.0. We then use the weight vectors ws, wt to compute
the rebalanced cluster assignments V s,j , V t,j ∈ RB ×K by modifying Equation (3) as:
[Vs,1; Vs，2; Vt,1; Vt,2] = sinkhorn(exp(1[ws Θ [Zs，1; Zs，2]; Wt © [Zt，1; Zt,2]]CT))	(8)
where a B is an element-wise multiplication operation of vector a applied to each row of B, and
the rows of Vs,j, Vt,j represent the vis,j, vis,j vectors in Equation (4). Note that there is no gradient
flow for the computation ofws and wt, as well as the cluster assignments Q and V.
3.2	Pseudo-Parallel Data Mining with Filter Suite
To mine pseudo-parallel data, we sample sentences from two monolingual corpora s and t, and
compute their cluster assignments using our LAgSwAV model. The cluster assignment probabil-
ities are treated as sentence embeddings in the next step to mine the data using the margin-based
algorithm proposed by Artetxe & Schwenk (2019b). The resulting dataset is decreasingly sorted
by the alignment scores. However, we empirically found that the obtained data are considerably
noisy. Therefore, we propose a filter suite, which is a set of filtering criteria to filter out low-quality
samples from the initial mined dataset, Xsr-t = [(x1, y1), ..., (xm, ym)], resulting in the final mined
data Xs-t = [(x1, y1), ..., (xn, yn)]. While details and motivations for these criteria are given in the
Appendix, we briefly introduce them as:
1.	Minimum and maximum sentence lengths of Lmin and Lmax for both source and target.
2.	Source-target length ratio μ with μ ≥ 1.0; i.e., ɪ ≤ Iln(Xi) ≤ μ.
3.	Subword overlap ratio γi between source and target is larger than the corpus mean value, where
Yi isdefinedaslenleg+⅛) ； i.e., Yi > PnYj.
4.	Accept only top ρ% of pairs based on the alignment scores. This is equivalent to threshold
filtering (Artetxe & Schwenk, 2019b), but it does not depend on an absolute threshold value.
5.	UMT filtering with agreement BLEU > β. Specifically, after training a UMT model with the
mined data from steps 1-4, we use the model itself to translate each source sentence of the
mined data and measure the BLEU score between its translation and the target. We then filter
out any pair with BLEU < β. This step drastically reduces the size of the mined dataset.
3.3	Rank-based Cross-Entropy for UMT Integration
It is trivial to compute a supervised loss on the mined pseudo-parallel data and add it to the standard
UMT back-translation loss. However, we found that (i) the mined data still contains, especially
at the bottom of the ranked list, certain amount of misalignments, and (ii) the data is too small
(<100K sentence pairs) to not cause overfitting. These issues motivate us to develop a Rank-based
Cross-Entropy loss, or Rank-XE, to be applied to the mined data. Specifically, given a mined dataset
Xs-t = [(x1, y1), ..., (xn, yn)], which is decreasingly sorted by their alignment scores, we assign a
weight σi = 1.0 - (i - 1)/n for each pair (xi, yi). σi is designed to assign higher weights to the
pairs at the top and lower to the bottom ones, which effectively reduces the influence of low-ranked
pairs to the loss function. The loss for the mined (or augmented) data is then defined as:
LAUG = £_°i log Pθ (yi∣Xi)	(9)
i
which is then added to the standard iterative back-translation loss LBT to compute the total loss:
L = LBT + λaugLAUG	(10)
where the weight λaug is set to 1 at the beginning and gradually decreases to 0 to avoid overfitting.

4 Experiments
In this section, we first report the performance of our method in comparison with the established
baselines on the standard WMT and FLoRes low-resource UMT tasks. Then, we experimentally
show how LAgSwAV is able to mine better pseudo-parallel data. We also compare our method with
related approaches and conduct other analyses. To optimize for the most informative content within
the limited page real estate, we leave some of experimental details to the Appendix.
4.1	WMT B ilingual Unsupervised Machine Translation Tasks
Setup. For the WMT’14 English-French (En-Fr), WMT’16 English-German (En-De) and WMT’16
English-Romanian (En-Ro) bilingual UMT tasks, we follow the established predecessors (Lample
et al., 2018c; Conneau & Lample, 2019; Song et al., 2019; Nguyen et al., 2021) to use only the
monolingual data from 2007-2017 WMT News Crawl datasets of the two languages for each task.
Note that no data from a third language is used. We fine-tune the pre-trained XLM (Conneau &
Lample, 2019) with our proposed LAgSwAV loss and follow the process in §3.2 to mine pseudo-
parallel data, which are then used to augment MASS UMT models (Song et al., 2019). Following
all established previous work, we evaluate the models with tokenized BLEU multi-bleu.perl script
(Koehn et al., 2007). In addition, we also report the corresponding sacrebleu scores (Post, 2018) in
the subscript for our method as well as the baselines that we reproduced in our experiments.
Results. From the results reported in Table 1, we notice that our method outperforms MASS
baseline (Song et al., 2019) by 2.7, 2.1, 1.2, 1.6, 1.8 and 1.8 BLEU for the WMT En-Fr, Fr-En,
En-De, De-En, En-Ro and Ro-En, respectively. It also surpasses CBD (Nguyen et al., 2021) by up
to 2 BLEU in 5 out of 6 language pairs. The results demonstrate that the pseudo-parallel data mined
by our method is valuable for the UMT models.
4.2	Low-Resource Unsupervised Translation
For the FLoRes low-resource UMT tasks (Guzman
et al., 2019), we follow the same setup as mBART (Liu
et al., 2020). Specifically, we reuse their published
pre-trained model to fine-tune with our LAgSwAV loss
and mine pseudo-parallel data. Table 2 reports the re-
sults on Ne-En and Si-En for our method, as compared
with XLM (Conneau & Lample, 2019), MASS (Song
et al., 2019) and mBART (Liu et al., 2020). It can be
shown that our method outperforms mBART by up to
2.8 BLEU in these UMT tasks.

4.3	Understanding Language Agnostic Constraint for SwAV loss
To understand how LAgSwAV behaves in terms of the aforementioned language agnostic and se-
mantically contrastive properties, we conduct a series of evaluations with manual visualization as
well as automatic metrics to measure the focused properties.

XLM+LAgSwAV for En-Fr and En-De. Visualizations for En-Ro is given in the Appendix.
4.3.1	T-SNE Visualizations
We sample 50K sentences of both languages from a held-out monolingual data for each language
pair and use T-SNE (Van der Maaten & Hinton, 2008) to visualize the sentence embeddings pro-
duced by XLM, XLM fine-tuned with SwAV (XLM+SwAV) and XLM fine-tuned with LAgSwAV
(XLM+LAgSwAV). From the visualizations shown in Figure 3, it can be seen that the English em-
beddings (red) are scattered separately and distinguishable from those of French and German (cyan)
in XLM and SwAV XLM. Among them, the visualizations for German fare better than those of
French. However, after fine-tuning with LAgSwAV loss, the sentence embeddings are mixed indis-
tinguishably, indicating a high degree of language-agnosticism.
4.3.2	Quantitative Measures
Although §4.3.1 provides a qualitative sense of how the models exhibit in terms of the two examined
properties, it is necessary to measure the properties in a quantifiable manner. We propose three
metrics to evaluate the models: Tatoeba Accuracy, Global Accuracy and Cluster Word Distribution.
We compare different models on these metrics in Table 3. In the Appendix, we also provide sentence
samples of different clusters to show that they are semantically related.
Tatoeba Accuracy. Artetxe & Schwenk (2019a) proposed to use parts of the Tatoeba corpus as
test sets for the Tatoeba similarity search task, which can be used to measure how good a model is
at mining parallel data. Specifically, for each source sentence, we use cosine similarity to search for
the closest target sentence based on the sentence embeddings to check if the obtained target sentence
is indeed the correct target of the given source, from which we compute the Tatoeba accuracy score.
Global Accuracy. This metric uses a validation set of parallel sentences to measure how language-
agnostic the models are, based on the perception that non-agnostic models exhibit a separation of
latent spaces for different languages. Specifically, if there is a separation by language, each sentence
of language s would be closer to all other sentence of the same language s than any sentence of
language t. Therefore, we measure Global Accuracy in the same way as Tatoeba except that we
search for the target sentence in a search space that includes not just the target sentences, but both
source and target sentences combined. If the model is non-agnostic, the search will always pick
incorrect intra-lingual sentences, driving down the accuracy significantly.
Word Distribution Score. This metric uses a held-out monolingual data to measure how semanti-
cally contrastive the models are in terms of content and topics. One of the ways to measure this is to
detect certain words that appear frequently in only one cluster and rarely in others. Intuitively, if a
cluster contains certain key-words dominantly, it is likely the sentences in that cluster are of similar
semantic topic or content. From this notion, the word distribution score is computed based on the
unique word appearance frequency for each cluster. Further details are given in the Appendix.
Results. Table 3 shows the results in terms of the three metrics for the XLM (baseline),
XLM+SwAV, and XLM+LAgSwAV models along with their respective BLEU scores achieved us-
ing the mined data obtained by the models after going through the Filter Suite (§3.2). We observe
consistent improvements across all three measures for our LAgSwAV model. In particular, the
global accuracy scores reflect closely the degree of language-agnosticism as observed in Figure 3.
For example, the global accuracy values for French and Romanian are particularly low for the base-

lines, while that of German is already much higher. These improvements also translate well to the
performance of our LAgSwAV models on the downstream UMT tasks.
4.4	Comparison and Ablation Study
As an unsupervised bitext mining method, it is noteworthy to compare our method with existing
methods (Wu et al., 2019a;b). We also report the results for LASER (Artetxe & Schwenk, 2019a).
Note that LASER is not directly comparable to our setup as it was trained on parallel data from 93
languages. Specifically, we use the pre-trained LASER model to mine pseudo-parallel data from
the same monolingual sources used in LAgSwAV. We then use the mined data to augment UMT
models with and without the Filter Suite (§3.2) and rank-based loss (§3.3). Plus, we also conducted
an ablation study to examine the contributions of different components of our method. We train the
UMT models with the mined data from our LAgSwAV models without any filtering and rank-based
loss, and then subsequently add these components to see how they contribute to the performance.
Ablation Study. From the results in Table 4, it is noticeable that without a sufficient filtering
process, the mined data by LASER as well as LAgSwAV cause significant performance drops across
all language pairs. This is because the majority of sentence pairs ranked at the bottom of the mined
data are noisy, causing incorrect loss terms. The performances gradually improve as we add rank-
based cross entropy and dynamic λaug weight to the framework, which essentially reduce the impact
of low-ranked pairs. However, the most performance jumps are observed when we add the Filter
Suite, where we considerably filter the mined data and retain the top ≈ 5% of the mined data. These
observations are true for both LASER and our LAgSwAV fine-tuned XLM models.
Comparison with LASER. A more surprising observation we have from the results in Table 4
is that LASER underperforms our method, even with the Filter Suite. This is despite the fact that
LASER was trained on a much larger parallel data from 93 languages. After investigation, we
discover that LASER does not differentiate languages and the monolingual data contains sentences
from the other language. For instance, the English corpus contains some French sentences as arti-
facts; LASER simply picks these artifacts up and pair them with their identical matches found in
the French corpus. Since these Fr-Fr pairs are almost identical, they are (wrongly) ranked on top of

the targets are close to the sources according to the baseline model.

the mined dataset. Our LAgSwAV, meanwhile, differentiates languages thanks to XLM’s language
embedding layer. Therefore, when it encounters a French sentence that is ‘marked’ as English, the
model will infer it as erratic and avoid selecting it during mining. Table 5 verifies this observation.
4.5	Further Analysis
Quality of Mined Data. To gain further insights into the quality of the augmentation dataset mined
by our method, we use a supervised NMT model (Ott et al., 2018) to translate the source side of the
mined data and compute the agreement BLEU scores between its translations and the dataset’s target
side. The higher the agreement BLEU, the more likely the source and target of the mined dataset are
semantically and meaningfully aligned, according to the NMT model. We use this metric to compare
the quality of mined datasets produced by XLM, supervised LASER (Artetxe & Schwenk, 2019a),
XLM+SwAV and XLM+LAgSwAV. As shown in Table 5, XLM and XLM+SwAV fail completely
at mining pseudo-parallel data as their agreement BLEU scores are significantly low. Meanwhile,
our method outperforms even supervised LASER, which aligns well with the results in Table 4.
Percentage ρ%. Among the hyper-parameters specified in the Filter Suite (§3.2), we found that the
ρ% plays the paramount role. As shown in Figure 4, for the WMT En-Ro task, we found only the
top 10% of the mined data is valuable to improve UMT performance. As we gradually include more
data from the bottom of the mined data by increasing ρ, the performance degrades substantially.

Translationese Effect. Edunov et al. (2020) found that back-translation only benefits translationese-
source sentences but does not improve for natural-source texts. To investigate whether our method is
affected by the translationese effect, we use the test sets provided by Edunov et al. (2020) and repli-
cate the translationese analysis in three setups: (i) Natural-source → Translationese-target (X→Y*),
(ii) Translationese-source → Natural-target (X*→Y) and (iii) Translationese of translationese of
source → Translationese-target (X**→Y*). The results in Table 6 show that our method improves
the performance in De-En and En-De UMT tasks for both natural-source and translationese-source
setups. This demonstrates that our method is not affected by the translationese effect.
5 Conclusion
We have proposed a new language-agnostic SwAV loss, which is used to fine-tune pre-trained lan-
guage models to improve their ability to mine pseudo-parallel data in an unsupervised manner. We
have also introduced additional modules, such as Filter Suite and dynamic loss weight, to improve
the performance of UMT systems. The method achieves significant improvements over the baselines
in the WMT English-French, German-English and English-Romanian bilingual UMT tasks. It also
outperforms mBART in the FLoRes Nepali-English and Sinhala-English UMT tasks. Our analysis
also shows that the method outperforms the baselines in mining pseudo-parallel data.

Ethics and Reproducibility Statements
Ethics. The paper presents research on unsupervised machine translation where experiments were
conducted on publicly available datasets, such as the NewsCrawl and CommonCrawl datasets, which
have been used in various established publications. Thus, we believe the research and experi-
ments do not contain any questionable concern regarding bias, discrimination, fairness, privacy,
etc. Nonetheless, in case of application to production systems, we advise practitioners to use our
solutions with caution, as our mining method may still align source-target pairs that are close but
not exact, such as “I am from the US” versus “I am from California”. These inexact pairs may then
influence the downstream translation model to make incorrect predictions.
Reproducibility. Apart from the experimental explanations in the main paper, Appendix ap-
pendix A.3 provides further experimental details on the WMT and FLoRes unsupervised translation
tasks, as well as other analysis experiments. In addition, the source codes provided above contain
further technical instructions and code explanations to reproduce the results.

A	Appendix
In the Appendix, we provide further details and explanations about the inner-workings of our
method. Plus, we also show extra experimental configurations as well as other supplementary ex-
periments.
A. 1 Further Explanation for Our Method
In this section, we first explain the Sinkhorn algorithm and more details about the Filter Suite that we
use to filter pseudo-parallel data mined from our LAgSwAV model. Then, we lay out the complete
procedure used to integrate the mined data with standard back-translation for unsupervised machine
translation models.
A.1.1 Language-Agnostic Constraint for SwAV Loss in Language Model
In addition to the details explained in the main paper, we illustrate the batch-wise sinkhorn algorithm
(Cuturi, 2013) in Algorithm 1. Further details about this procedure and the SwAV loss are also
provided in Caron et al. (2020).

representations of batches of samples, and n number of iterations; return the sinkhorn prototype
output Q ∈ RB×K.

6:	Q 一 Q * (R/U)
7:	Q J Q * (C/(Pi Qi,:))
8:	end for
9:	Q J (Q/(Pi Qi,:))T
10:	return Q
A.1.2 Pseudo-Parallel Data Mining with Filter Suite
In addition to explanation given in the main paper, we further clarify certain note-worthy details of
the Filter Suite. Firstly, we sample sentences from two monolingual corpora s and t, and compute
their cluster assignments using our LAgSwAV model with softmax operation instead of sinkhorn
because it is unreliable to conduct batch-wise operation during inference. Specifically, we compute
the mining sentence embeddings eX of a given sentence X of any language as:
eX = softmax(CTFθ(X))	(11)
eX is then used by the margin-based algorithm proposed by Artetxe & Schwenk (2019b) to mine
pseudo-parallel data. Secondly, as the proposed Filter Suite consists of a set of different filtering
criteria,, we specify the motivations for each of them as follow:
1.	Minimum and maximum sentence lengths of Lmin and Lmax: short sentences may not be useful,
while long sentences may be more likely to mis-aligned.
2.	Source-target length ratio μ: source and target sentences should be of comparable length, the
variation may depend on the specific language pair.
3.	Subword overlap ratio γi between source and target: for relatively close language pairs (En,
Fr, De, Ro), parallel sentence pairs of the same meanings are likely to share a certain amount
of subword; so we accept aligned pairs whose γi is higher than the corpus average. In addition,
we also cap this value up to a maximum, such as 0.35, to avoid the exact match scenario, where
source and target are exactly the same. Note that we do not use this criterion for low-resource
languages, such as Nepali and Sinhala.

Figure 5: Complete diagram for our LAgSwAV. The diagram shows the paths each English (X) and
Romanian (Y ) sentences take to compute the final LAgSwAV loss.
4.	Accept only top ρ% of pairs: sentence pairs are ranked based on alignment scores, as a result,
pairs with low scores are ranked at the bottom and are often low-quality. Thus, we filter them
out.
5.	UMT filtering: once the UMT model has been trained to be competent enough, it can act as a
filterer too. Therefore, we use it to translate the mined data to verify whether the source and
target are sufficiently aligned.
A.1.3 Rank-based Cross-Entropy for UMT Integration
In addition to the total loss L formulation for the rank-based cross-entropy loss and the UMT in-
tegration strategy in the main paper, we further provide the overall UMT integration of the mined
dataset procedures in Algorithm 2.

A.2 Complete LAgSwAV Model
Figure 5 illustrates the complete structure of our LAgSwAV model. Specifically, on the left side, we
have our input data, which are English (X) and Romanian (Y ) sentences. These inputs are perturbed
into four different augmentations (X1 , X2 , Y1 and Y2). These augmentations are then passed to the
Transformer encoder and then the prototype layer, as well as the rebalancing block Ω to compute
the final LAgSwAV loss.
A.3 Experimental Details
WMT bilingual unsupervised tasks. For the WMT’14 English-French (En-Fr), WMT’16 English-
German (En-De) and WMT’16 English-Romanian (En-Ro) bilingual unsupervised translation tasks,
we follow established predecessors (Lample et al., 2018c; Conneau & Lample, 2019; Song et al.,
2019; Nguyen et al., 2021) to use the all the monolingual data from 2007-2017 WMT News Crawl
datasets of the two languages for each task, which include 190M, 78M, 309M and 3M sentences
14
Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2022
for English (En), French (Fr), German (De) and Romanian (Ro) respectively. We fine-tune the pre-
trained XLM (Conneau & Lample, 2019) provided by the authors with our proposed LAgSwAV
loss. For each language pair, we also use the respective provided bilingual dictionary of 60K sub-
word units (Sennrich et al., 2016b). Regarding the mining process, we sample up to 20M sentences
from the monolingual data explained above for each language and use our LAgSwAV model to
mine pseudo-parallel data with Filter Suite explained in §3.2. We set mininum, maximum lengths
of Lmin = 5 and Lmax = 300； SoUrce/target length ratio μ 1.5; maximum overlap ratio Yi = 0.35
and accept only the top ρ = 5% of mined pairs. The agreement BLEU threshold is β = 30 We use
the mined data to augment the MASS (Song et al., 2019) UMT models. Following all established
previous work, we evaluate the models using tokenized BLEU with Moses multi-bleu.perl script
(Koehn et al., 2007). In addition, we also report corresponding sacrebleu scores (Post, 2018) in the
subscript of Table 1 for our method as well as baselines that we can reproduce.
In addition, we also use bootstrap sampling (Koehn, 2004) to test for statistical significance for
the WMT bilingual unsupervised tasks. As a result, we round that our method’s improvements are
significant with p-value < 0.05 for En-Fr, En-De, and En-Ro (both directions). Plus, we also ran our
experiments 3 times and found the standard deviations are approximately 0.1, 0.2, 0.1, 0.3, 0.2, and
0.3 BLEU for En-Fr, Fr-En, En-De, De-En, En-Ro and Ro-En, respectively.
FLoRes low-resource tasks. For the FLoRes low-resource unsupervised translation tasks (Guzman
et al., 2019), we follow the same setup as mBART (Liu et al., 2020). Specifically, we reuse their
published pre-trained mBART model to fine-tune LAgSwAV loss as well as initial model for UMT
back-translation training. We also use the same sentencepiece tokenizer model (Kudo & Richardson,
2018) as mBART. We sample up to 20M sentences of the English, Nepali and Sinhala corpora of the
CC25 pre-training data to mine pseudo-parallel data and train the UMT model. To avoid high-rank
mis-alignments in the mined data, we filter the mining monolingual data to include only sentences
with unicode \p{InDevanagari} and \p{InSinhala} word counts more than 80% the sentence length
for Nepali and Sinhala respectively.2
T-SNE Visualization. We sample 50K sentences of both languages from a held-out monolin-
gual data for each language pair and use T-SNE (Van der Maaten & Hinton, 2008) to visualize the
sentence embeddings of those sentences produced by the baseline XLM (encoder output of ‘[eos]’
token) and the SwAV as well as LAgSwAV fine-tuned XLM models (softmax representations of pro-
totype outputs softmax(CT Z)). These visualizations are shown in Figure 6. As it can be seen, the
sentence embeddings of English sentences (red) are scattered separately and distinguishable from
those of French, German and Romanian (cyan) in XLM and SwAV XLM. Among these, the visu-
alizations for German fare better than French’s and Romanian’s. However, after fine-tuning with
LAgSwAV loss, the sentence embeddings are mixed indistinguishably, indicating a high degree of
language-agnostic property.
Tatoeba Accuracy. Artetxe & Schwenk (2019a) proposed to use parts of the Tatoeba corpus as
test sets for the Tatoeba similarity search task, which can be used to measure how good a model is
at mining parallel data. Specifically, for each source sentence, we use cosine similarity to search
for the closest target sentence based on the sentence embeddings to check if the obtained target sen-
tence is indeed the correct target of the given source, from which we compute the Tatoeba accuracy
score. In other words, given a parallel test set [(X1, Y1), ..., (Xn, ..., Yn)] and a nearest neighbor
search function N operating on the sentence embeddings of the sentences, we compute the Tatoeba
accuracy as:
AccTatOeba = & (X 1[N (Xi, [Y1,…])=Yi] + X 1[N(Yi,[Xι,…])=Xi])	(12)

Global Accuracy. This metric also uses a valid parallel set to measure how lang-agnostic the
models are, based on the perception that non-agnostic models exhibit a separation of latent spaces for
different languages, like in Figure 3. Specifically, if there is a separation by language, each sentence
of language s would be closer to all other sentence of the same language s than any sentence of the
other language t. Therefore, we measure Global Accuracy in the same way as Alignment Accuracy,
except that we conduct search for the target sentence among a search space of not just the target
side, but both source and target side combined. If the model is non-agnostic, the search will always
2\p{InDevanagari} and \p{InSinhala} are unicode blocks dedicated for characters in Nepali and Sinhala.

pick incorrect intra-lingual sentences, driving down the accuracy significantly. Formally, with the
same notations as above, Global Accuracy is computed as:
Accglob = 2n(X 1[N(Xi, [Xi,…,Yι,...]) = Yi] + X 1[N(K, [Xi,…,Yι,...]) = Xi])	(13)

Word Distribution Score. This metric uses a held-out monolingual data to measure how semanti-
cally classifiable the models are in terms of content and topics. One of the ways to measure this is
to detect certain words that appear frequently in only one cluster and rarely in others. The intuition
is that if a cluster contains certain key-words dominantly, it is likely the sentences in such cluster
are of similar semantic topic or content. Specifically, given same data sampled in §4.3.1, we use
the K-means clustering (Vassilvitskii & Arthur, 2006) to cluster uhthe sentences into N = 20 clus-
ters. Then, for each unique word wi ∈ V in the data, we count its appearance frequency Fwj for
each cluster j . After divide it by the total occurance of the word wi in all clusters and compute the
normalized mean scores for each word. Formally, the Word Distribution Score is computed as:
WoDis = N X ɪ X (Fwi/X Fwi)	(14)

Percentage ρ% and Translationese effect.
In addition to analyses of percentage ρ% for En-Ro and translationese effect for En-De, we also
report the similar analyses for Ro-En and De-En, respectively. The results are shown in Figure 7, we
observe that the performance of our method for unsupervised Ro-En task reduces gradually with the
percentage ρ%. As shown similarly in Table 7, our method is also not affected by the translationese
effect for De-En direction.

A.3.1 Cluster Samples
Semantic contrastiveness reflects the model’s ability to classify sentences of similar topics and con-
tents into the same cluster group. To demonstrate this capability of our LAgSwAV model, we ran-
domly sample monolingual sentences from the NewsCrawl English-Romanian corpora and compute
their cluster assignments using our LAgSwAV model. Then, we use a simple K-means clustering
method (Vassilvitskii & Arthur, 2006) to cluster the sentences into 20 clusters. After that, we extract
randomly some sentences from these clusters and report them in Table 8. As it can be seen in the
next page, the sentences in each cluster are closely related semantically. Specifically, sentences of
cluster 1 talk about football, while those of cluster 5 talk about airlines and aviation.
