A more realistic object detection paradigm, Open-World Object Detection, has
arised increasing research interests in the community recently. A qualified open-
world object detector can not only identify objects of known categories, but also
discover unknown objects, and incrementally learn to categorize them when their
annotations progressively arrive. Previous works rely on independent modules
to recognize unknown categories and perform incremental learning, respectively.
In this paper, we provide a unified perspective: Semantic Topology. During the
life-long learning of an open-world object detector, all object instances from the
same category are assigned to their corresponding pre-defined node in the semantic
topology, including the ‘unknown’ category. This constraint builds up discrim-
inative feature representations and consistent relationships among objects, thus
enabling the detector to distinguish unknown objects out of the known categories,
as well as making learned features of known objects undistorted when learning
new categories incrementally. Extensive experiments demonstrate that semantic
topology, either randomly-generated or derived from a well-trained language model,
could outperform the current state-of-the-art open-world object detectors by a large
margin, e.g., the absolute open-set error (the number of unknown instances that are
wrongly labeled as known) is reduced from 7832 to 2546, exhibiting the inherent
superiority of semantic topology on open-world object detection.
1 Introduction
Object detection, which aims at localizing and classifying objects in a given scene (Felzenszwalb
et al., 2010; Everingham et al., 2010; Lin et al., 2014), is one of the most iconic abilities of biological
intelligence. It was introduced to the artificial intelligence field to endow an intelligence agent with
the ability of scene understanding. Although significant advances have been made to improve the
object detection system in recent years (Girshick et al., 2014; Ren et al., 2015; Cai & Vasconcelos,
2018; Sun et al., 2020b; Redmon et al., 2016; Lin et al., 2017; Tian et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2019a;
Carion et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2020a), a strong assumption that all the objects of interest have
been annotated in the training set, i.e., close-set learning, is always made but not holds well. All
unknown objects are treated as background and ignored by current detectors, making such detectors
cannot handle corner cases in many real-world applications such as autonomous driving, where some
obstacles are not available during training, but must be detected when intelligent cars are running on
the road. However, creating a large-scale dataset that contains annotations for all objects of interest at
once is extremely expensive, even impossible.
Superior to current detectors, humans naturally have the ability to discover both known and unknown
objects and gradually learn novel concepts motivated by their curiosity. Learning by discovering the
unknown is crucial for human intelligence (Livio, 2017; Meacham, 1983), and has been considered
as a key step to achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI) (Goertzel, 2014). Recently, a new object
detection paradigm, named Open-World Object Detection, has been established (Joseph et al., 2021;
Miller et al., 2021; 2018c; Liu et al., 2020) to mimic this learning procedure.
A qualified open-world object detector can not only identify known objects, but also discover object
instances of unknown categories and gradually learn to recognize them when their annotations

progressively arrive. The learning of novel categories is always in an incremental fashion, where the
detector cannot access all old data when training on new categories. This open-world learning setting
is much more realistic but challenging than previous close-set object detection.
The open-world object detection poses two challenges on current detectors, i.e., recognition of
unknown categories and incremental learning. On the one hand, previous close-set detectors do
not explicitly encourage intra-class compactness (Liu et al., 2016b; Yang et al., 2021b). However,
compact feature representation is highly required for unknown object recognition (discovery). If the
known categories occupy most of the feature space, the detector will probably classify the unknown
object as one of the known categories. On the other hand, the vanilla training strategy of the object
detector lacks the mechanism to prevent ‘catastrophic forgetting’ in incremental learning (Joseph
et al., 2021; Shmelkov et al., 2017a; Peng et al., 2020), i.e., previously-known objects features are
severely distorted when learning new categories. Consequently, training on novel categories weakens
the detector’s ability to detect previously-known objects.
Previous works have made efforts to endow the object detector with the capacity of unknown
recognition and incremental learning. One of the representative works, ORE (Joseph et al., 2021),
designs a clustering loss function to compact the object features, and involves an energy-based out-
of-distribution identification approach (Liu et al., 2020) to detect unknown objects. Combining these
two independent technologies in a step-wise manner makes ORE a non-end-to-end framework. Such
solutions for open-world object detection are far from the optimal status. Additionally, ORE (Joseph
et al., 2021) doesn’t guarantee a feature space topology consistency, which is crucial for effective
new class learning and avoidance of catastrophic forgetting, as shown in Figure 1.
This paper formalizes unknown recognition and incremental learning in a unified perspective and
proposes a much simpler but more effective framework for open-world object detection than prior
arts. We propose that an open-world object detector is desired to learn a feature space with such
characteristics, including (a) discriminativeness: the unknown objects and the objects of new cat-
egories couldn’t be overlapped with any previously-known categories in the feature space, and (b)
consistency: the feature topology of previously-known categories couldn’t be distorted severely when

Figure 3: Illustration of two novel classes, e.g., chair, and refrigerator, are introduced to the open-world
object detector at a specific time point during the training procedure. Each node in the semantic topology,
termed as a semantic anchor, is pre-defined by a randomly-generated vector or derived from a well-trained lan-
guage model before starting the training procedure. When the detector learns novel categories, the corresponding
semantic anchors are registered to the semantic topology firstly, then object features of the same category are
constrained to close to its semantic anchor. At the inference stage, the RoI feature classifier and the semantic
feature classifier are ensembled to make predictions.
learning new categories. Our key idea is to pre-define a unique and fixed centroid in feature space for
each category, including the ‘unknown’ category, and to push object instances close to their belonging
centroids during the life-long learning of an open-world object detector. The pre-defined centroids
are named as ‘Semantic Anchors’, and all semantic anchors constitute the structure of ‘Semantic
Topology’. As shown in Figure 2, all features are binded to their corresponding semantic anchors
to satisfy the discriminativeness, previously-known objects feature topology is maintained when
incrementally learning new categories to satisfy the consistency.
We introduce an off-the-shelf pre-trained language model to set up the semantic topology. The se-
mantic anchor for each category is derived from the language model by embedding the corresponding
category name. By incrementally registering new semantic anchors when new classes are involved,
the semantic topology gradually grows. In the experiments, we show that by combining a current
detector with our proposed semantic anchor head, a huge improvement in open-world object detection
performance across the board is achieved. In addition to the consistent mAP improvement over the
whole life of the detector, the ability of unknown recognition of our proposed method outperforms
the current state-of-the-art methods by a large margin, e.g., the absolute open-set error is reduced by
2/3, from 7832 to 2546.
More importantly, we conduct a comparison experiment by randomly generating semantic anchors
instead of leveraging language models. Although randomly-generated anchors do not provide
semantic priors, their performance still surpasses state-of-the-art methods. This strongly proves that
the topology consistency is the most key characteristic for open-world learning while introducing
semantic relationships can further boost the performance.

Modern object detection frameworks (Ren et al., 2015; Redmon et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2016a; Lin
et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2019a; Redmon et al., 2016; Redmon & Farhadi, 2018; Girshick, 2015;

in deep neural networks to localize and classify the target class object in given images and videos.
These well-established detectors can achieve excellent performance in the close-set dataset such as
PascalVOC (Everingham et al., 2010), MSCOCO (Lin et al., 2014). However, the detectors can

not handle open-world object detection, which is more common in the real world. To this end,
ORE (Joseph et al., 2021) raises and formalizes the open-world object detection problem.
Class incremental learning Class incremental learning aims to learn a classifier incrementally to
recognize all encountered classes met so far, including previously-known classes and novel classes.
Knowledge distillation is commonly adopted to mitigate forgetting old classes, which stores some
old class exemplars to fine-tune the model or compute the distillation loss. iCaRL (Rebuffi et al.,
2017) maintains an ‘episodic memory’ of the exemplars and incrementally adds novel class examples
into the memory. Then the nearest neighbor classifier can be obtained incrementally. LwF (Li &
Hoiem, 2017) proposes a modified cross-entropy loss to preserve the knowledge in the previous task.
BiC (Wu et al., 2019) points out the data imbalance between old classes and new classes causes the
network’s prediction biased towards new classes. However, the existing class incremental methods
cannot handle the open-world problem, where the classifier should identify those ‘unknown’ classes
and incrementally learns to recognize them, but existing methods would recognize unknown objects
as background.
Open-set Learning In open-set learning, the knowledge contained in the training set is incomplete,
i.e., the examples encountered during inference may belong to a category that does not appear in
the training set. OpenMax (Bendale & Boult, 2016) uses a Weibull distribution to identify unknown
instances in the feature space of deep networks. OLTR (Liu et al., 2019) proposes to tackle the
open-set recognition problem in a data imbalance setting by deep metric learning. Besides the
open-set classification, Dhamija et al. (Dhamija et al., 2020b) found that the object detectors exhibit
a high error rate that misclassifies unknown classes to known classes with high confidence. To solve
this problem, many works (Miller et al., 2021; 2018a; Dhamija et al., 2020b) aims to measure the
uncertainty of the detectors’ outputs to reject open-set error. Miller et al. (Miller et al., 2018a) uses
Monte Carlo Dropout sampling to estimate the uncertainty in an SSD detector. After that, Miller
et al. proposes to model a Gaussian Mixture distribution for each class in the detector’s feature
space to reject unknown classes. ORE (Joseph et al., 2021) uses an energy-based out-of-distribution
recognition method (Liu et al., 2020) to distinguish the known and unknown. However, such method
needs to compute the energy score distribution among all instances, including known and unknown,
during evaluation, making ORE a non-end-to-end method. We formulate the open-set recognition
problem and the class incremental learning into a unified framework. Different from (Joseph et al.,
2021), our method doesn’t access any unknown instances but achieves much superior performance.
Zero-shot Learning Aligning image and text into a common feature space has always been an
active research topic (Frome et al., 2013; Joulin et al., 2016; Li et al., 2017; Desai & Johnson, 2021;
Yang et al., 2019; 2021a), especially in zero-shot learning (Xian et al., 2017; Bansal et al., 2018;
Zareian et al., 2021; Gu et al., 2021). Many researches in zero-shot learning leverage the information
in language models to assist zero-shot image classification (Xian et al., 2017) or zero-shot object
detection (Bansal et al., 2018; Zareian et al., 2021; Gu et al., 2021). However, this paper tackles a
different problem and has a different usage of language models. We identify that a consistent feature
manifold topology plays an essential role in open-world object detection, and the language model
is used for generating growth-able and consistent semantic topology to constrain the feature space
learning of an open-world detection. Also, this paper is the first one to incorporate a language model,
e.g., CLIP, to assist open-world object detection, which results in a simple training framework and
strong empirical performance.
3	Methodology
In this section, we introduce the Open World Object Detection problem definition in Section 3.1,
the method overview in Section 3.2, and the details of the proposed method in Section 3.3 and
Section 3.4.
3.1	Problem definition
An open world object detector should detect all the previously seen object classes, and can also identify
if a testing instance known or unknown (belongs to previously seen classes or not). If unknown,
the detector should gradually learn the unknown classes when their annotations progressively arrive
without retraining from scratch. Formally, at each time point t, we assume there exists a set of known
object classes Cktn = {l1, l2, . . . , lC} and a set of unknown object classes Cut nk = {lC+1, lC+2, . . . }.
The detector Dt at the time point t has only trained on classes in Cktn while may encounter all classes
4

including Cktn and Cut kn during evaluation. Besides correctly classifying an object instance from the
known classes Cktn, the detector Dt should also label all instances from the unknown class set Cut kn
as unknown. At the time point t + 1, the unknown instances will be forwarded to a human user who
can select n novel classes of interest to annotate and return them back to the model. The detector
Dt should incrementally learn these n novel classes and updates itself to Dt+1 without retraining
from scratch on the whole dataset. The known class set Ckt+n1 in the time point t + 1 is also updated
to Ckt+n1 = Cktn + {lC+1, . . . , lC+n}. The data instances in the known classes Ckn are assumed to be
labeled in the form of {x, y}, where x indicates the image and y indicates the annotations including
class label l and object coordinates, i.e., y = [l, x, y, w, h] where x, y, w, h denote the bounding box
center coordinates, width and height respectively.
3.2	Method overview
A Region Proposal Network (RPN) that can identify unknown and a discriminative and consistent
feature space are two critical components for an open world detector. Here, we adopt the Unknown-
Aware RPN proposed in (Joseph et al., 2021) and propose to constrain the detector’s feature space
topology with a pre-defined Semantic Topology. Specifically, we create a unique and fixed centroid
for each category in the feature space, named semantic anchor. The semantic anchors for all classes
are derived by feeding forward their class names into a pre-trained language model. Our key idea is
to manipulate the detector’s feature space to be consistent with the semantic topology constituted by
semantic anchors during the whole life of the detector. Due to the feature dimension discrepancy, a
fully connected layer (semantic projector) is used to align the dimension between RoI features and
semantic anchors. At the training stage, the semantic features outputted by the semantic projector are
forced to cluster around their corresponding semantic anchors by a designed ‘SA (semantic anchor)
Head’. When incremental learning, the SA Head gradually registers new semantic anchors for novel
classes and continually pulls close the novel class features and their semantic anchors. To mitigate
‘catastrophic forgetting’ caused by old class feature distortion, the SA Head also minimizes the
distance between some stored old class exemplars and their semantic anchors when learning novel
classes. To better leverage the well-constructed feature space, we attach an additional classification
layer to classify the semantic features. Figure 3 shows the training pipeline of the proposed open-
world object detector. At inference, we multiply the class posterior probabilities produced by the two
classification heads and get the final prediction.
3.3	Unknown-Aware RPN
Open-world object detectors are required to separate potential unknown objects from the background.
Therefore, we need some specific designs for the Region Proposal Network (RPN). In this paper, we
adopt the unknown-ware RPN proposed in (Joseph et al., 2021) which selects the top-k background
region proposals, sorted by its objectness scores, as unknown objects. The unknown-aware RPN relies
on the fact that Region Proposal Network is class agnostic. Given an input image, the RPN generates
bounding box predictions for foreground and background instances, along with the corresponding
objectness scores. The unknown-aware RPN labels those proposals with a high objectness score but
do not overlap with any ground-truth object as a potential unknown object.
3.4	Semantic Topology
We propose to pre-define a semantic topology for detectors’ feature space rather than learn from data.
The semantic topology is constituted by semantic anchors. Each semantic anchor is a pre-defined
feature centroid for an object class. The semantic anchors can be generated by embedding corre-
sponding class names using a pre-trained language model. The semantic topology can dynamically
grow as novel classes are introduced to the open-world detector.
3.4.1	Semantic Anchor Registration
We generate semantic anchors for all classes by feeding the class names into an off-the-shelf pre-
trained language model. Denote li ∈ Cktn as class name of the i-th known class at time t and M as an
off-the-shelf pre-trained language model. The semantic anchor for class li is defined as Ai = M(li),
where Ai ∈ Rn, the dimension n depends on the pre-trained language model. The semantic anchor
registration is performed repeatedly as long as known class set update Cktn → Ckt+n1 when novel
classes are introduced at time t + 1. Note we also register a semantic anchor for all instances labeled
5
Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2022
as unknown by the unknown-aware RPN to better distinguish the unknown instances from the known
instances. Follows the same strategy, the semantic anchor for class unknown is also generated by the
word embedding of unknown text.
3.4.2	Objective Function
The RoI features f ∈ Rd are feature vectors generated by an intermediate layer of the object detector,
which are used for category classification and bounding box regression. We manipulate the RoI
features f to construct the detector’s feature manifold topology. Denote fi as an RoI feature of the i-th
known class, we first align the dimension of fi as the dimension of its corresponding semantic anchor
Ai, using a fully connected layer with d × n dimensional weights. The corresponding semantic
feature is denoted as f ∈ Rn. We constrain the detector's feature manifold topology by clustering the
semantic features around their corresponding semantic anchors, the learning objective is formalized
as
Lsa = kfi-Aik.	(1)
Minimizing this loss would ensure the desired feature space topology. To better leverage the
constructed feature space, we use an additional classification head to classify the semantic features fi ,
with the same label space as RoI classification head. The total training objective is the combination
of semantic anchor loss Lsa, semantic feature classification loss Lclsse, RoI feature classification loss
and bounding box regression loss:
Ltotal = Lsa
+ Lclsse + Lclsroi + Lreg .
(2)
At the inference stage, the classification results are computed by multiplying the two class poste-
rior probability vectors predicted by the RoI feature classification head and the semantic feature
classification head.
3.4.3	Topology Stabilization
To store the detection ability on old classes, a balanced set of exemplars are stored and used to
fine-tune the model after each incremental learning session as in the previous open-world object
detection approach (Joseph et al., 2021). However, we argue that finetuning the detector ignoring
the old knowledge topology as in (Joseph et al., 2021) still suffers from the severe ‘catastrophic
forgetting’ problem. Benefitting from pre-defining the feature space topology, our method can
guarantee a consistent feature space during the finetuning stage. The stored old class and new class
instances are still forced to cluster around their pre-defined centroids to guarantee the feature space
topology unchanged.
4	Experiments
We introduce the evaluation protocol, including datasets and evaluation metrics, implementation
details, and experimental results in this section.
4.1	Datasets
Following (Joseph et al., 2021), the open-world detector is evaluated on all 80 object classes from
Pascal VOC (Everingham et al., 2010) (20 classes) and MS-COCO (Lin et al., 2014) (20+60 classes).
All categories are grouped into a set of tasks T = {T1, . . . , Tt, . . . }, where all categories of Tt will
be introduced to the detector at a time point t. At the time point t, all categories from {TT ∣τ <= t}
will be treated as known and {TT ∣τ > t} would be treated as unknown. As in (Joseph et al., 2021),
T1 consists of all VOC classes, and the remaining 60 classes from MS-COCO are grouped into three
successive tasks with semantic drifts. The open-world object detector is trained on the training set
of all classes from Pascal VOC and MS-COCO, and evaluated on the Pascal VOC test split and
MS-COCO val split. The validation set consists of 1k images from the training data of each task.
4.2	Evaluation metrics
We introduce three metrics to evaluate the detection performance of an open-world object detector on
known classes and unknown classes at each time point:

Table 1: Comparisons of different methods on Open World Object Detection. Wilderness Impact (WI)
and Absolute Open Set Error (A-OSE) are both the less the better, which measure the ability on unknown
identification. Our proposed method achieves consistent performance improvement during the whole life of
the detector, surprisingly achieves much lower A-OSE compared with baselines and previous state-of-the-art
methods.
•	Mean Average Precision (mAP) (Everingham et al., 2010; Lin et al., 2014). Following previous
works (Joseph et al., 2021), we use mAP at IoU threshold of 0.5 to measure the performance on
known classes. Since the object classes are continually involved, mAP is calculated on previously-
known classes and currently-known classes.
•	Absolute Open-Set Error (A-OSE) (Joseph et al., 2021; Miller et al., 2018b). A-OSE counts the
absolute number of unknown instances that are wrongly classified as any of the known classes.
A-OSE evaluates the detector’s ability to avoid misclassifying unknown instances as one of the
known classes.
•	Wilderness Impact (WI) (Joseph et al., 2021; Dhamija et al., 2020a). The definition is WI =
PPKR - 1, where PK is the precision of the detector when evaluated on known classes and Pk∪u
refers to the precision when evaluated on all classes including known and unknown. The recall
level R is set to be 0.8. WI evaluates the detector’s ability to successfully detect unknown objects
and classify them as ’unknown’ class.
4.3	Implementation details
We extend the traditional Faster R-CNN (Ren et al., 2015) object detector with a ResNet-50 (He
et al., 2016) to be an open-world object detector. The RoI feature is extracted from the last residual
block in the RoI head, which has a 2048 dimension. The 2048-dim RoI feature is used for computing
traditional bounding box regression loss and classification loss as the same as in many previous
works (Joseph et al., 2021; Ren et al., 2015). The semantic projector is a fully-connected layer to
align the dimension of RoI features with the semantic anchors. The dimension of semantic anchors
depends on the choice of pre-trained language model, e.g., the semantic anchor is 512-dim when
using CLIP text encoder (Radford et al., 2021b) to embed categories names. The semantic feature
outputted by the semantic projector is used for calculating semantic anchor loss Lsa and semantic
feature classification Lclsse loss. The Lsa and the Lclsse are added to the standard regression loss and
RoI classification loss to jointly optimize the detector. For the topology stabilization, we store 100
instances per class as the same as in (Joseph et al., 2021). To enable the classifier to handle a variable
number of classes at different time points, we assume there exists a maximum number of classes to
be added and set the classification logits of unseen classes to a large negative value to make their
contribution to softmax output negligible, following (Joseph & Balasubramanian, 2020; Rajasegaran
et al., 2020; Lopez-Paz & Ranzato, 2017; Chaudhry et al., 2018).
To make a fair comparison, we report experimental results obtained by re-running the ORE (Joseph
et al., 2021) official code1. All the hyper-parameters and optimizers are also controlled to be exactly
the same for all methods.
4.4	Open-world object detection
Table 1 shows the open-world object detection performance of our proposed method and other
baselines. At task 1, all methods are trained over all 20 Pascal-VOC classes. Twenty novel object
classes are introduced gradually at the following task. WI and A-OSE are used to quantify how
unknown instances are confused with known class objects after training on each task. WI and A-OSE
are both the less the better. ORE (Joseph et al., 2021) used an extra clustering loss to separate
class features, and an energy-based unknown identifier that learns shifted Weibull distributions from

Figure 4: Visualization of ORE and our proposed method after training on Task 1 (T1) and Task 4 (T4).
At task 1, ORE frequently misclassify unknown object as one of the known object classes. After training on
task 4, ORE successfully detects novel classes but forgets objects learned on task 1. By explicitly introducing
semantic prior into the detector to constrain the feature space topology, our proposed method performs favorably
in open-world object detection.
all class data (including known and unknown) in the validation set to reject open-set error. Our
method doesn,t access any unknown data instances from the validation set and achieves much superior
performance onWI and A-OSE than Faster R-CNN and ORE. In task 3, our proposed method achieves
1/3 A-OSE compared to ORE (2120 v.s. 6900) and 1/4 A-OSE compared to Faster R-CNN (2120 v.s.
9622). Our method also reduces the Wilderness Impact (WI) by a large margin than baselines. This
indicates our method has a much better ability on unknown detection. Furthermore, our method also
achieves consistent mAP improvement over the whole life of the detector. At incremental learning
session (task 2,3,4), the performance of Faster R-CNN on old classes deteriorate severely (55.35
→ 6.09). Faster R-CNN + Finetuning, ORE, and our method store some old class instances and
fine-tune on them after learning new classes to restore the old class performance. However, the
Faster R-CNN + Finetuning and ORE don’t guarantee the feature manifold topology consistent. The
superior performance on old classes also proves that guaranteeing the feature manifold topology is
critical.
4.5	Incremental object detection
To verify the effectiveness of our proposed method, we also conduct experiments on class incremental
object detection (iOD), where the detectors only need to continually recognize novel object classes
without unknown identification. We use the standard iOD evaluation protocol as (Joseph et al., 2021;
Shmelkov et al., 2017b) to evaluate all methods, where group of classes (10, 5, and the last class)
from PASCAL VOC 2007 (Everingham et al., 2010) are incrementally learned by a detector trained
on the remaining set of classes. Benefits from the well-constructed feature space using semantic
anchors, our proposed method performs favorably well on the incremental object detection (iOD) task
against several state-of-the-art 2. Notably, our method exhibits strong ability to incrementally learn
new classes while not forget old classes. This is because our detector’s feature space is constrained to
be incrementally growth-able by assigning each object class a unique feature space location.
4.6	Ablation study
The effect of language model. We derive semantic topology from pre-trained language models. To
explore the effect of the choice of semantic topology, we conduct ablation studies in this section.
To be specific, we generate semantic anchors using two pre-trained language models, i.e., CLIP-
text (Radford et al., 2021a) and BERT (Devlin et al., 2019). The dimensions of semantic anchor
generated by CLIP-text and BERT are 512 and 768, respectively. The comparison results are shown in

Table 4: Ablation on unknown anchor and loss components.
Table 3. These two language models obtain similar results, which both outperform ORE, the previous
state-of-the-art method in open-world object detection. To further explore the importance of semantic
priors, we also generate semantic anchors by randomly and uniformly sampling, which means we
assume the total number of classes is known which is not applicable in practice. Surprisingly, our
experiment shows that semantic anchors as random vectors still surpass state-of-the-art methods. This
demonstrates that a consistent topology, even without semantic priors, could also largely benefit the
task of open-world object detection, which strongly proves that the discriminative and the consistent
are two key characteristics for open-world learning. However, the randomly assigned class centers
would hinder the learning ability of networks. Instead, a pretrained language model can perfectly
overcome these problem.
The effect of semantic anchor loss. In this section, we explore the importance of unknown class
anchor, semantic anchor clustering loss Lsa , semantic anchor classification loss Lclsse and the RoI
feature classification loss Lclsroi. The experiments in Table 4 shows the semantic anchor clustering
loss and the semantic anchor classification loss are both indispensable in identifying unknown objects.
5	Conclusion
Open world object detection raises two challenging problems on current detectors, unknown recogni-
tion and incremental learning. Different from previous methods which combine domain-dependent
technologies to respectively solve these two problems, our work provides a unified perspective,
i.e.semantic topology. In the framework of semantic topology, all object instances from the same
category, including ‘unknown’ category, are assigned to their corresponding pre-defined centroids.
Therefore, a discriminative and consistent feature representations are ensured during the whole life of
an open-world object detector. Aided with our proposed semantic topology, a huge improvement in
open-world object detection performance across the board is achieved.
