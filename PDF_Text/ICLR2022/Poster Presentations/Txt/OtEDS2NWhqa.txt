Ab stract
Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used in regression and classification
problems applied to text, in areas such as sentiment analysis and medical decision-
making processes. We propose a novel form for node attributes within a GNN
based model that captures node-specific embeddings for every word in the vocab-
ulary. This provides a global representation at each node, coupled with node-level
updates according to associations among words in a transcript. We demonstrate
the efficacy of the approach by augmenting the accuracy of measuring major de-
pressive disorder (MDD). Prior research has sought to make a diagnostic pre-
diction of depression levels from patient data using several modalities, includ-
ing audio, video, and text. On the DAIC-WOZ benchmark, our method outper-
forms state-of-art methods by a substantial margin, including those using multiple
modalities. Moreover, we also evaluate the performance of our novel model on a
Twitter sentiment dataset. We show that our model outperforms a general GNN
model by leveraging our novel 2-D node attributes. These results demonstrate the
generality of the proposed method.
1 Introduction
Deep learning techniques have been frequently used in sentiment analysis (Tan et al., 2013; Mukhtar
& Khan, 2018; Liao et al., 2021), particularly in movie recommendations and product reviews and
ratings. In the healthcare domain, sentiment analysis with deep learning provides many benefits
such as utilizing medical information to increase healthcare quality (Abirami & Askarunisa, 2017;
Bi et al., 2020). We focus our work on applications related to mental health such as using deep
learning to make a diagnostic prediction.
There is a pressing need to find a convenient and automated method to assess depression sever-
ity. Worldwide, more than 300 million people are suffering depression (Organization et al., 2017).
Apart from the high prevalence of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), overall 85% of depressed in-
dividuals are underdiagnosed (Falagas et al., 2007). Research has shown that about 30% of patients
suffering from an episode of major depression do not seek treatment, with only 10% of them being
adequately treated (Falagas et al., 2007). We validate our approach based on its application to the
diagnosis of MDD. We demonstrate that our approach can result in more accurate predictions of the
severity of depression, which can enhance automated health care decision making.
Medical research (Tsakalidis et al., 2018) shows that text sentiment analysis methods can be effective
in making inferences about people’s mental states, such as MDD. For example, depressed people use
more first person pronouns than non-depressed people because they are more focused on themselves
and less connected with others. These may not be reflected in a person’s visual appearance, i.e.,
visual behaviors. Visual data alone will therefore be insufficient for capturing depressive symptoms
that are only manifested in a person’s verbal utterances.
Mental disorders are difficult to detect. In practice, clinicians first measure the severity of depressive
symptoms in patients and then identify depression in them. During in-person clinical interviews,
clinicians widely use a structured Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) — a clinically validated tool
1

determining the severity of depressive symptoms across several personal dimensions (Kroenke &
Spitzer, 2002; Arseniev-Koehler et al., 2018).
Inspired by the observation of a provided data set of such interviews, we formulated the hypothesis
that the context of words in a transcript can be used to generate PHQ scores (Kroenke et al., 2009).
This PHQ metric for depressive disorder forms a context constructed with eight items, such as “sleep
problem”, “anxiety problem”, “fatigue problem”, “depression problem”, and “no motivation or in-
terest in things” (Arseniev-Koehler et al., 2018). We observed that each text (see figure 1) covers
information relating to at least one of these eight topics. This motivates use of a deep learning model
that represents these eight PHQ topics, thereby introducing an inductive bias into the learning pro-
cess. Thus the contextual information about these eight PHQ topics should be encoded to determine
depression states.
i always feel irritated, i am lazy when i do not sleep well, my
mood was just not right, i was always feeling down and
depressed and lack of energy, i always want to sleep, i am
lack of interest, i have gone to therapy, it has been useful for
me in the past, i would love to talk to someone, i just feel like
i do not have anyone so i do not depend on anyone, i have
always felt depressed in my life, my symptoms were lack of
energy, wanting to sleep a lot, lack of interest, my appetite
was uncontrollable either lack of or i was just being
gluttonous and eating the wrong things, i have notices those
changes in my behavior......
Figure 1: An extract from a raw transcript.
We motivate generating graph-level representations for transcripts (as inputs) to encode contextual
information from these transcripts (we assume a transcript encodes facts representing depressive
symptoms). To achieve this, we propose a novel form for node attributes within a GNN based model
that captures node-specific embeddings for every word in the vocabulary. The representations of
each word are shared globally and can be updated according to associations among words in a
transcript. We summarize the representations of all the words in the transcript to predict depression
states.
Intuitively, the generated node-level embeddings maintain records linking certain existing facts that
indicate the known symptoms of a subject. When subsequent facts are discovered which indicate
additional depressive symptoms, records will be updated by aggregating both old and new facts. In
other words, those records will be updated via a message passing mechanism over the transcript
context until ideally all major depressive features have been discovered.
In this way, we can represent the most relevant contextual information which is universal across all
transcripts - possibly involving the context of eight PHQ topics We discussed above. Using graph
structures to capture context-level features is an innovative pathway which we hypothesise can be
used to measure different levels of depression. In our experiments, our approach realized a good
generalization on a limited, incomplete, and unevenly distributed dataset (see figure 3).
1.1 Related Work
Research in measuring the severity of depressive symptoms aims to train a regression model to
predict depression scores (Valstar et al., 2016; Alhanai et al., 2018; Tsakalidis et al., 2018). Some
prior Work (Ringeval et al., 2017; Alhanai et al., 2018; Haque et al., 2018) applies a sequence-
level deep learning model to capture implicit depressive signals. Such models, in general, use a
multi-modal sentence embedding, rather than a mapping of a Whole intervieW, to predict a PHQ
score. Other prior Work (Valstar et al., 2016; Cummins et al., 2017) implements statistical functions
(e.g., max, min) on short-term features over an entire intervieW, but this may fail to preserve useful
temporal information across an entire intervieW, such as some short-term signs of regret, anxiety,
etc.

Deep learning approaches (Valstar et al., 2016; Alhanai et al., 2018; Song et al., 2018; Du et al.,
2019) to fuse multi-modal features in depression detection appear to be particularly promising. Al-
hanai et al. (2018) proposed a deep model which was trained jointly with the acoustic and linguistic
features. Lam et al. (2019) used multi-head attention modules to extract contextual information
from clinical text to assess depression tendency. There are existing studies on utilizing deep learn-
ing models with pre-trained word embeddings to extract global features from text (Ray et al., 2019;
Mallol-Ragolta et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020; Solieman & Pustozerov, 2021). The work (Lin
et al., 2020; Solieman & Pustozerov, 2021) applied a multi-modal fusion network to summarize all
depressive features from both text and audio. They used text features and audio features that were
highly correlated with depression severity.
In principle, we should be able to improve performance further using all available modalities, how-
ever feature-fusion method may lead to learn a wrong representation encoding inter-subject vari-
ability unrelated to depression (Williamson et al., 2016). The feature-fusion approach to learning
from small data may cause poor generalization: with a small sample size, the number of features
should also be small to avoid the problems of dimensionality and overfitting. However, given that
the dimensions of audio and video features are very large, sparse parametrization needs to be taken
into account when training machine learning models for learning a joint multi-modal feature vector
(Williamson et al., 2016).
2 Method
We generate a node-level embedding matrix for each word of a transcript. These node attributes rep-
resent an underlying relationship between the current word and every other word in the transcript.
In this way, a graph neural network (GNN) schematizes underlying associations among words via
their internal representations. We propose to aggregate their internal representations to encode in-
formation from the context of a transcript generalizing all major depressive symptoms1.
Building a Text Graph: For a given transcript, we build a text graph. We regard all unique words
appearing in a transcript as the nodes of the graph. Each edge starts from a word in the transcript
and ends with a word within a fixed window on either side of the word.
Let G = (V, E) denote a text level graph. V is a set of nodes representing all the unique words in
a given text, and E is a set of undirected edges between pairs of these nodes, each represented by a
set of the two nodes at either end of the edge. We build edges by using a fixed size sliding window
in a transcript to collect co-occurrence statistics. Each node has an attribute which is a matrix.
To emphasise this representational structure of the attribute matrix, we refer to it as a ‘schema’
(Hammen & Zupan, 1984; Rudolph et al., 1997; Soygut & Savayir, 2001; Dozois & Beck, 2008)
Ui ∈ Rn×d. The jth row of Ui is a vector of length d containing the representation that node vi has
of vj; and n denotes the total number of unique words (the vocabulary size) in a corpus.
2.1	Schemas
We generate a schema for each word node which performs a role of recording a global context.
This global context retains information from interactions between the current word and every other
word. In this way, each word node maintains “a dynamic record” (in the form of a schema) of the
context from the given transcript. The schemas are progressively updated by a GNN model. This
resulting model produces final embeddings of the words in a transcript in relation to all words in the
vocabulary, including the other words that make up the current training transcript.
Schemas preserve structures that represent relationships between the identifier word and every other
word. Thus we can exploit these schemas to capture context-level features in an explicit way by
learning a GNN model. Our innovation is to represent word proximity through the graph structure
and co-occurrence within the same transcript within the schema at each node.

Figure 2: For one of layers of SGNN model k, the upper figure showing an output is a schema
generated for the word node “hopeless”. This schema can be treated as an “inner record” of the
node “hopeless”, which is formed as Uhkopeless ∈ n × dk, where the generated dk-dimensional
representation of a node presents as a row. The blank rows correspond to word nodes that have not
been encountered with this identifier node “hopeless” in the current text context. The figure on the
bottom shows an example of a modified schema of the same word node “hopeless” after learning.
Our model using schemas can encode information about associations between the node “hopeless”
and its new neighbors, such as a node “his” (colored in green). As a result, the internal representation
of this identifier node “hopeless” is updated by the model. Moreover, its original record containing
its other already existing neighbors has been explicitly preserved while learning. Note: For the
convenience of display, in this figure, we set the window size of 1 for displaying associated edges
among the nodes; in our actual experiments we use a larger window size.
2.2	Schema-based Graph Neural Network (SGNN)
We use multiple passes (layers) of the message passing mechanism (MPM) (Gilmer et al., 2017; Xu
et al., 2018) to update the schema at each node of the text graph.
Initialization: We first initialise an n × d1 matrix (in our experiments, we set d1 = 32) as the
schema Ui(1)
at each node vi ∈ V . The schema is all zeros apart from the row corresponding to the
word associated with this node, which is a random d-dimensional vector using a linear transforma-
tion.
Message passing layer: In this work, the operation of message passing is split into two steps to
update the schema at each node.
We first modify the schema at each node vi :
u^Jk) = Ui⑹Wy) + 1ιιT Ui⑹Wy) + 1iiiT Ui⑹Wy)	⑴
i1 n i2 n	i3
where 1 ∈ Rn is a vector of ones.
The first term updates each row independently. The second term operates on the sum of the columns,
replicated in each row. The third term operates on the row corresponding to the current word,
replicated in each row. These terms are a subset of equivariant linear functions which are computed
using the methods of (Maron et al., 2018).

Second we compute the message function, which is defined as:
M(k) (Uvk), Uj(k)) = Ujjkk + RELU([uVk)∣∣Uj(k)] w4k))wj)	⑵
where || denotes concatenation along the second axis. (Wmmk)) 1≤m≤5 are learnable parameters. This
is essentially a two-layer neural network.
In the next step, each node’s schema is updated as:
Ui(k+1)= X M(k)(Ui(k)
j∈N(i)
∈ Rn×dk+1
(3)
We apply equation (3) as the sum aggregator over the k-th layer of the SGNN.
After all K message-passing layers have been applied, the schemas are pooled to get representations
of all nodes in the graph. We apply an elementwise max-pooling operater to extract node features.
We use the READOUT (Ying et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2018) function which aggregates node features
by summing them together:
hG = X Ui(K)	(4)
vi∈V
We use hG to predict a PHQ score for each transcript. In our experiments, we apply a 2-layer
multi-layer perceptron (MLP).
2.3 Datasets
We performed experiments on two datasets, DAIC-WOZ and a twitter sentiment dataset. Whilst our
principal interest is in depression prediction, we included the second dataset to show the generality
of the method we present here.
•	The DAIC-WOZ dataset contains video-based facial actions, audio and the conversation
transcribed to text for each participant. Both the 6th and 7th International Audio/Video
Emotion Challenge (AVEC) (Valstar et al., 2016) used this dataset. We utilized only the
text transcripts of all 142 individuals within the dataset. 43 out of 142 subjects (30%) were
labeled as depressed. The provided dataset has been split into a training set having 107 pa-
tients and a development set containing 35 patients. In line with prior work (Valstar et al.,
2016; Alhanai et al., 2018; Cummins et al., 2017; Haque et al., 2018) and to ensure com-
parable results, we test on the “development set” from the original competitions (Valstar
et al., 2016), since the actual test set is not in the public domain.
Privacy: This data2 does not contain protected health information(PHI). Personal names,
specific dates and locations were removed from the audio recording and transcription by
the dataset curators.
•	Borderlands Sentiment Twitter3dataset includes 74682 tweets labeled as positive (28%),
negative (30%) and neutral (42%) respectively. Tweets range in length from 2 to 126 words
with an average length of 25.3 words per tweet. We extracted 10% of the full data for
training.
3	Experiments
In this section, we show the results generated by our method on two distinct tasks of depression
prediction and twitter sentiment classification respectively.

3.1	the Severity of Depressive Symptoms Prediction
In this experiment, we predict the PHQ score for each participant. The loss objective is mean
absolute error (MAE) for regression. We evaluate our SGNN model on DAIC-WOZ benchmark
and we then compare our method to the state-of-art works centering on the feature fusion learning
algorithms.
We compare our method to prior work on measuring depressive symptom severity. The performance
of our method and eleven other methods, including the state of the art method, is set out in Table 1.
The results of some models are directly taken from their original papers. Our method outperforms
all other methods, despite using only the textual modality.
We found that our model performs better than the standard GNN (Gilmer et al., 2017). The
GNN without our schemas utilizes node representations which are initialized by pre-trained 300-
dimensional GloVe word embeddings (Mikolov et al., 2013). However, our method constructs
schemas which are initialized with random vectors. Moreover the standard GNN propagates node
features in terms of vectors while our model uses 2-D node attributes. This change increases the
expressive power of the MPM, yielding in better results.
The machine learning algorithms of (Valstar et al., 2016; Williamson et al., 2016) perform modeling
statistics using handcrafted features derived from audio, text and (or) visual inputs. However, our
method uses just raw text.
We also note that our model performs better than other prior work (Alhanai et al., 2018; Song et al.,
2018; Haque et al., 2018; Du et al., 2019; Lin et al., 2020; Ray et al., 2019). That is likely due to the
difference of representation learning. Their work uses a multi-modal sentence-level embedding to
predict a PHQ score while our model is trained to learn a graph-level embedding of each transcript.
The method (Lin et al., 2020) based on the BiLSTM model reaches a similarly low MAE. They
apply pre-trained w2v embeddings. However, we train word embeddings with random vectors.

tribution of PHQ scores on the dataset

the performance of applying a generic GNN (Gilmer
et al., 2017) algorithm, whereas the blue color represents
the performance of implementing our SGNN. The green
vertical line, as a cut-off, emphasizes a better generaliza-
tion performance of a small group having scores higher
than 13 (on the right of the figure).
3.1.1	Ablation Study
To further analyze our model, we perform three ablation studies (see Table 2). To give more reliable
measures of performance, we perform 10-fold cross validation on the combined training and devel-
opment dataset. We concatenate the training and development set as one set and then divide it into
10 folds in a stratified manner. Each time one fold is used for testing and the other 9 folds are used
for training.
In (i), we give equations 1-4 (in section 2.2) for ‘point-wise’ multiplication. According to the results
in Table 2, we can see that using convolution layers can better model the relations between words
compared with point-wise multiplication layers.
In (ii), we remove the second and third (equivariant) terms in (1). There was a significant reduction
in performance (Table 2). As a result, the representation power of our model can increase when
parametrized with these layers, thereby improving the model’s performance on the data set.
In (iii), we replace the max-pooling operator by a mean-pooling operator. From Table 2, we can see
that the result was not good when applying mean operator of the node. Max operator highlighting
features can enhance discriminating depressive features, which helps to achieve a better result.
Qualitative Analysis: Our model has some incorrect predictions which may be caused by the
unequal distribution of dataset (see figure 3). In figure 4, our SGNN model made more biased
predictions on those subjects with higher PHQ depression scores (plotted in blue): For instance, the
model predicted a PHQ score of around 16 to the patient with an actual PHQ score of 13, and the
patient who has the PHQ score of 23 has been overpredicted with a score of around 26. To improve
the learning capacity of the model, more labeled training samples with PHQ scores higher than 8
would be needed.
3.1.2	Interpretability analysis of word embeddings
We give an illustrative visualization of the word embeddings learned by SGNN model. Figure 5
can tell us what the content the model mainly focuses on, therefore helping us to understand its
learning process to some extent. We show two examples with predictive depression scores higher
than 15. The depression symptoms (of a patient) with corresponding PHQ-scores higher than 14 are
classified as moderate-severe or severe by a domain expert (Kroenke et al., 2009).
Compared with the content of the transcripts illustrated by word clouds (figure 5a, figure 5c) of the
left-side column, we found that word clouds (figure 5b, figure 5d) on the right-side column represent
very different content of the same transcripts. We note that the model can learn to discriminate
semantic features relating to depressive symptoms or non-depressive symptoms from the text.

The output of the final message passing layer of word embeddings is used. The right and left-hand
columns use the same transcript.
Word Visualization: We also qualitatively visualize word embeddings, in the form of bi-grams,
learned by SGNN model. Table 3 shows the most important word pairs that have been learned to
capture context-level semantic features, such as “feel, tough”, “therapy, asleep”, “sleeping, depres-
sion” or “depression, psychiatrist” related to PHQ topics. This demonstrates that the high depression
scores are predicted on the basis of appropriate semantic features.
3.2	Twitter Sentiment Classification
We evaluate the performance of our SGNN model on classifying three different sentiments on Twit-
ter data (Naseem et al., 2019; 2020; Yenduri et al., 2021; Janjua et al., 2021). We train our model
with a total of 7800 tweets. 10-fold stratified cross-validation is also adopted for our experiments.
We compare our SGNN model with a general GNN model. Table 4 reports accuracies on both
training and testing set. The row one method is initialized with pretrained 300-dimensional GloVe
embeddings. The row two method initialize each node with a 2-dimensional (2-D) random node
attribute. We observed that our low dimensional 2-D node embeddings can propagate contextual

and report mean with standard deviation in the parentheses for both of these two models. The GNN
model is initialized by Glove word embeddings.

information to the whole text well, while high dimensional pretrained embeddings do not improve
classification performances.
Table 4 also shoWs the performance gains of the proposed model on the Borderlands Sentiment
TWitter data When 2-D node embeddings applied. This gain demonstrates that a GNN model With
2-D node attributes can capture more context-level features of sentiments from text, and thus can
greatly improve the accuracy of this domain task.
3.3 Analysis of 2-dimension node attributes
We compared results of performances betWeen a standard GNN model and our SGNN model on both
the depression prediction task and the tWitter sentiment classification task using 2-D node attributes.
On the first experiment, our graph representation learning frameWork using schemas achieves better
generalisation on long text. Figure 4 shoWs that our SGNN model (plotted in blue) generalized
the development set much better, particularly for the small group of samples in the class of having
scores higher than 13. On the second experiment, We find our SGNN model also performs better
on the short text TWitter dataset using schemas, shoWing that it can also model consecutive and
short-distance semantics Well.
We suggest that using 2-D node attributes (i.e. schemas) can improve the expressive poWer of the
MPM. By setting a global context (matrices) of each node (as the input), We can obtain some pa-
rameters, in an explicit Way, that capture the context of a Word using each node’s schema. On the
contrary, using simple 1D node embedding such as GloVe may result in losing contextual informa-
tion When they are processed by several layers of a learning model.
Settings: We set the learning rate as 10-3, L2 Weight decay as 10-4, the dropout rate as 0.5,
and the WindoW size as 4 to gather Word-Word occurrence statistics for both experiments. The loss
objective for the first experiment is mean absolute error (MAE); the loss objective for the second
experiment is cross-entropy loss. We trained the SGNN for a maximum of 500 epochs using the
SGD optimizer (Kingma & Ba, 2014) and stopped training if the validation loss does not decrease
for 10 consecutive epochs.
4	Conclusions
Our Work shoWs a novelty of improving the performance of predicting depression states by training a
deep graph learning model to learn contextual features from the text. Our results have demonstrated
that it is possible to apply deep learning methods to tackle more specific problems Within the field,
and not just a more general problem, even With limited data. Future Work might address finding
a Way of explaining a GNN model, such as, visualizing the relationship betWeen the underlying
depression features and depression scores, Which helps us better understand clinical context behind
the data.
