Figure 1: Each Wilds dataset (Koh et al., 2021) contains labeled data from the source domains(for training), validation domains (for hyperparameter selection), and target domains (for held-outevaluation). In the Wilds 2.0 update, we extend these datasets with unlabeled data from a com-bination of source, validation, or target domains, as well as extra domains from which there is nolabeled data. The labeled data is exactly the same as in Wilds 1.0. In this figure, we illustratethe setting with the GlobalWheat-wilds dataset, where domains correspond to images acquiredfrom different locations and at different times.
Figure 2: The Wilds 2.0 update adds unlabeled data to 8 Wilds datasets. For each dataset, wekept the labeled data from WILDS and expanded the datasets by 3-13 Ã— With unlabeled data fromthe same underlying dataset. The type of unlabeled data (i.e., whether it comes from source, extra,validation, or target domains) depends on What is realistic and available for the application. Beyondthese 8 datasets, Wilds also contains 2 datasets Without unlabeled data: the Py150-wilds codecompletion dataset and the RxRx 1 -wilds genetic perturbation dataset. For all datasets, the labeleddata and evaluation metrics are exactly the same as in Wilds 1.0. Figure adapted With permissionfrom Koh et al. (2021).
