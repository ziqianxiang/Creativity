Figure 1: Top: evolution of curvature on a surface mayreduce the bottleneck. Bottom: this paper shows howthe same may be done on graphs to improve GNN per-formance. Blue/red shows negative/positive curvature.
Figure 2: Different regimes of curvatures on graphs anal-ogous to spherical (a), planar (b), and hyperbolic (c) ge-ometries in the continuous setting.
Figure 3: 4-cyclecontribution.
Figure 4: Comparing the degree distribution of the original graphs to the preprocessed version. The x-axis is node degree in log2 scale, and the plots are a kernel density estimate of the degree distribution.
Figure 5: Comparing the degree distribution of the original graphs to the preprocessed version. The x-axis is node degree in log2 scale, and the plots are a kernel density estimate of the degree distribution.
Figure 6: Rewiring of the Cornell graph. Left-to-right: original graph, DIGL, and SDRF rewiring.
