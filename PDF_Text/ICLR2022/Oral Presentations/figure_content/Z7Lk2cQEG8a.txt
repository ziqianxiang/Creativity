Figure 1: Comparison of the non-convex landscape (left) and the convex landscape (right) ofprogram (4). Here, we consider the toy example with date X = 1, label y = 1 and the `2 loss.
Figure 2: Illustration of relations between Wm, ΘCVx, ΘCVx and Θ*.
Figure 3: Plots in the neuron space of nerual networks trained by GD over two trials. Points αiui ofthe neural network {(ui, α∕}m=ι trained by GD, and non-zero block w5 of the global solution of theconvex problem. The points a%u% lie in the convex hull of {0, w5}, and they satisfy equation (11) upto numerical tolerance. This implies in particular that the neural network found by GD is optimal.
