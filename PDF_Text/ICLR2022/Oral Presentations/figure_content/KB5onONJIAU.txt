Figure 1: Relationship between H-divergence (this paper) and existing divergences. The JensenShannon divergence is an f -divergence but not an IPM; the MMD is an IPM but not always anf -divergence; both are H-divergences. There are H-divergences that are not f -divergences or IPMs.
Figure 2: Average test power on HDGM dataset. Left: results with the same sample size (4000)and different data dimensions. Right: results with the same sample dimension (10) and differentsample sizes. Our method (H-Div, dashed line) achieve better test power for almost every setup.
Figure 3: Example plots of H-divergence across different geographical locations for losses ` relatedto agriculture (left) and energy production (right). Darker color indicates larger H-divergence. Com-pared to divergences such as KL, H-divergence measures changes relevant to different social andeconomic activities (by selecting appropriate loss functions `). For example, even though climatechange significantly impact the high latitude or high altitude areas, this change has less relevance toagriculture (because few agriculture activities are possible in these areas).
Figure 4: Left: Average test power on the Blob dataset for different sample sizes and significancelevel α = 0.05. Our method (H-Div, dashed line) has significantly better test power, especially forsetups with small sample sizes. Right: The same plot with significance level α = 0.01.
Figure 5: The divergence between corrupted image and original image measured by H-divergencevs. FID. For better comparison we normalize each distance to between [0, 1] by a linear transforma-tion. For “speckle” and “impulse” corruption, both divergences are monotonically increasing withmore corruption. For “snow” corruption H-divergence is monotonic while FID is not. Other typesof corruptions are provided in Appendix B.2.
