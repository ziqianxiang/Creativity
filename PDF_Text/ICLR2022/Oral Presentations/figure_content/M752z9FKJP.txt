Figure 1: DiffStride forward and backward pass, using a single-channel image. We only compute thepositive half of DFT coefficients along the horizontal axis due to conjugate symmetry. The zoomedframe shows the horizontal mask mask(wS ,W,R) (n). Here S = (Sh, Sw) = (2.6, 3.1).
Figure 2: Comparison side by side of the shortcut blocks in classic ResNet architectures with stridedconvolutions, and with DiffStride that learns the strides of the block.
Figure 3:	Learning dynamics of DiffStride on the CIFAR10 dataset.
Figure 4:	Top-1 accuracy (%) on the Imagenet validation set as a function of the regularization termJ((Sl)ll==1L) as defined in equation 6, after training with λ ∈ [0.1, 10].
