Figure 1: Left: An agent is walking next to a pond in a park and observes the world as an image. The worldconsists of a latent endogenous state, containing variable such as agentâ€™s position, and a much larger latentexogenous state containing variables such as motion of ducks, ripples in the water, etc. Center: Graphical modelof the EX-BMDP. Right: PPE learns a generalized form of inverse dynamics that recovers the endogenous state.
Figure 2: Results on combination lock. Left: We show the latent transition dynamics of combination lock.
Figure 3: Results on visual grid world. Left two: Shows sampled observations for the first two steps from thevisual gridworld domain. The agent is depicted as a red-triangle, lava in orange, walls in grey, and the goal ingreen. Center Right: Shows errors of type 1 and type 2 made by the PPE in recovering the latent endogenousdynamics. Right: State decoding accuracy of PPE, Homer and a random uniform decoder. (see Section 6)(a) Grid World h = 1. (b) Grid World h = 2.
