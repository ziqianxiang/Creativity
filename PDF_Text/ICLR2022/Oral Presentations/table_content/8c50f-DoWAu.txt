Table 1: Input types for speaker conditioning gt(Y ) compared in terms of speaker similarity.
Table 2: Subjective evaluation (MOS) of one-shot VC models trained on VCTK. Ground truthrecordings were evaluated only for VCTK speakers.
Table 3: Subjective evaluation (MOS) of one-shot VC models trained on large-scale datasets.
Table 4: Reverse SDE solvers compared in terms of FID. N is the number of SDE solver steps.
Table 5: Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Euler-Maruyama (EM) solvers comparison in terms ofMean Square Error (MSE). MSE < 0.001 is denoted by conv, MSE > 1.0 is denoted by div. N is thenumber of SDE solver steps, Îµ is variance of Gaussian noise added to perfect scores s6*.
