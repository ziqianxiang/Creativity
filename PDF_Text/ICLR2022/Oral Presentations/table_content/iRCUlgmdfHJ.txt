Table 1: (left) Classification accuracies of four types of DNNs, including the normally trainedDNNs, and the other three types of DNNs mainly encoding low-order, middle-order, and high-orderinteractions. (right) Comparison of adversarial accuracies between normally trained DNNs andDNNs mainly encoding high-order interactions on the census dataset and the commercial dataset.
Table 2: Comparison of the adversarial accuracy between normally trained DNNs, low-order DNNs,middle-order DNNs, and high-order DNNs on the census dataset and the commercial dataset.
Table 3: Comparison of the running time between normally training DNNs by 200 epochs andtraining DNNs by 200 epochs with the proposed losses.
Table 4: Mean values and standard deviations (μ ± σ) of the projections at the first five principaldirections of the gradient(at initialization), which were computed under different sizes of contexts.
Table 5: Mean values and standard deviations (μ ± σ) of the projections at the first five principaldirections of the gradient (at 40 epochs), which were computed under different sizes of contexts S.
