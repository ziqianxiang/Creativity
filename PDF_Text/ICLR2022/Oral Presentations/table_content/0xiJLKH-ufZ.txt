Table 2: FID ] under the DDPM and DDIM forward processes. All are evaluated under the eventrajectory (ET). The result with * is slightly better than 3.17 reported by Ho et al. (2020), becausewe use an improved model architecture following Nichol & Dhariwal (2021).
Table 3: Efficiency comparison, based on the least number of timesteps J required to achieve a FIDaround 6 (with the corresponding FID). To get the strongest baseline, the results with * are achievedby using the quadratic trajectory Song et al. (2020a) instead of the default even trajectory.
