Table 1: Each module in MIDI-DDSP produces a high-quality reconstruction and accurate predic-tion. We show reconstruction accuracy of each MIDI-DDSP module against a comparable method.
Table 2: The note expression outputs are strongly correlated with input adjustment. The Pearsoncorrelation r-values are shown in the table (all entries p < 0.0001). The bold numbers indicate aPearson r-value larger than 0.7, which we consider to indicate strong correlation between the inputcontrol and the respective output quantity. For simplicity, only four instruments are shown. Moreresults can be found in Table 7.
Table 3: The architecture of the Mel-CNN (bottom) used to extract features from log-scale Mel-spectrogram in the DDSP Inference module. The Mel-CNN uses convolutinal blocks defined in thefirst table below.
Table 4: The architecture of dilated convolution network (bottom) used in the Synthesis Generatorto generate amplitude, harmonic distribution and noise magnitude. The dilated convolution networkuses dialted stack layers defined in the first table below.
Table 5: Details of the discriminator blocks used in the Synthesis Generator.
Table 6: A post-hoc comparison of each pair on their pairwise comparisons with each other, usingthe Wilcoxon signed-rank test for matched samples (“win” means the first item in the pair is selected). p value less than 0.01/15 = 6.67 × 10-4 yields a statistically significant difference. Only two pairsare not significantly different (DDSP Inference vs. Ground-truth, MIDI2Params vs. FluidSynth),and are marked with an asterisk (*).
Table 7: The Pearson correlation result of all instruments described in Table 2. The Pearson cor-relation r-values are shown in the table, while p-values are omitted as in all entries p < 0.0001.
