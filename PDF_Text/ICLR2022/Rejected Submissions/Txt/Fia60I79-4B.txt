Paper under double-blind review
Abstract
There are many tasks to use news text information and stock data to predict
the crisis. In the existing research, the two usually play one master and one
follower in the prediction task. Use one of the news text and the stock data
as the primary information source for the prediction task and the other
as the auxiliary information source. This paper proposes a fusion model
for pre-training time series-Text representations, in which news text and
stock data have the same status and are treated as two different modes
to describe crises. Our model has achieved the best results in the task of
predicting financial crises.
1	Introduction
Forecasting the stock market trend from multiple angles is of great significance to economics
researchers and sociological researchers.
First of all, there are extensive studies in finance to solve the problem of forecasting the
stock market. There are two main motives for them. The first is that predicting the stock
market trend could reveal the specific factors that drive the stock market trend. Second, by
predicting the stock market trend, it is possible to evaluate the pricing of particular assets
Ponka (2017).
The influence from the stock market would spread to other areas due to the significant impact
on the society from financial. How to predict and prevent significant stock volatility crises is
a critical research topic. Economic researchers in academia and the financial industry have
never stopped their research in this area. Related research methods are constantly updated.
Financial time-series forecasting is one of the most important research tasks in these fields.
Economics researchers are increasingly accepting the use of deep learning for related re-
search. More and more tasks use AI technologies such as machine learning and deep learning
to predict financial time series. Researchers in related fields have created various models
and published a large number of papers accordingly. After introducing deep learning models
into this field, the results obtained are significantly better than traditional machine learning
models Sezer et al. (2020). For example, the time series forecasting model based on the
transformer Wu et al. (2020a), and a time series forecasting model based on graph neural
network Wu et al. (2020b). Researchers are becoming more and more interested in de-
veloping financial time series forecasting models Thakkar & Chaudhari (2021). While the
modelling methods are becoming more and more diversified, the complexity of the model
is also increasing. Fortunately, these behaviour results are gratifying, and the accuracy of
financial time series forecasting tasks is constantly improving.
Not only is the model itself becoming more powerful and more complex, but even the
information on which the prediction task itself is based is also becoming more and more
diverse. From time-series data itself to macro-financial factors to text data such as news,
the data of financial time series forecasting tasks have become more abundant. Especially
for text data, text mining has now become a significant research field. It has been applied
in many fields such as medical treatment, business, finance, education, and many others
Elagamy et al. (2018).

News content is one of the most critical factors affecting the stock market. Analysis of
the impact of news when predicting stock market volatility would lead to more reasonable
forecasts. Stocks are one of the most important components of financial markets, and they
could directly impact regional and global economies. Precise forecasts of stock trends could
help support critical business and financial decisions and even political decisions.
Therefore, we use stock time series data and news text data to enter the main methods of
this article on stock market trends. The primary method of our project is to improve the
accuracy of prediction based on the fusion representation of text and stock time-series data.
2	Related work
The use of data mining techniques to analyze and predict the stock market has been widely
recognized Nikfarjam et al. (2010). This method mainly uses structured data, such as past
prices, historical returns, or other stock characteristic indicators. The task of using data
mining to predict financial time series has achieved many results. Samitas et al. (2020)
has established an early warning system, which dramatically improves financial risk early-
warning accuracy and could give early warning signals in advance.
The method of text mining is different from that of data mining. It is not easy to extract
relevant information from unstructured data such as news. So this type of method has
relatively few applications in financial time series forecasting tasks.
The trend of stocks is entirely random. Using data mining methods to predict the trend of
stocks is very dependent on a large amount of data. However, historical data that stretches
the time axis too long does not have a high reference value for the current state Patel et al.
(2015). Furthermore, they believe that it is not easy to provide a reasonable explanation
effect simply by using numerical prediction Schumaker et al. (2012). News content is one of
the most critical factors affecting the stock. If the news is classified in advance, and then
these tags are passed in when forecasting, better results could be obtained Nikfarjam et al.
(2010).
News text data usually contains many events, and these events could be used for the sup-
plementary analysis of random behaviour. There is a lot of free news and financial data. If
both could be used at the same time, it may improve the interpretability of the predictive
model. Moreover, they proved that the correct available information could improve the
performance of sequence prediction models.
Text information has a very unfriendly feature: their language structure and writing style are
very different. It is not easy for machine deep learning technology to learn information and
patterns from such unstructured data. This difficulty is mainly reflected in the modelling
and training phases. In order to solve these problems, there are two leading solutions:
subject terms, modelling, and keyword modelling.
The solution we currently use is keyword modelling, which is used to characterize news text.
Many researchers use news in stock forecasting tasks. For example, the news labels are
input into the predictor as a feature of stocks Nikfarjam et al. (2010), and Fung et al. (2002)
also proposed a system that only uses the news to predict stock trends. A stock trading
early warning system is also established through the classification of news Mittermayer &
Knolmayer (2006). News is used in such tasks because news has an impact not only on the
stock market itself but also on the stock market participants. They discover that specific
news articles can influence investors’ decision-making Li et al. (2014). In addition, they
prove that the text information of the news could help investment institutions conduct
intraday risk management Groth & Muntermann (2011).
There are many examples of using news in tasks related to stock forecasting, and most of
them have achieved better results. However, their method is to classify the news text as a
stock feature or only use the news text without using stock data.
In addition to fusing multiple information together, some researchers use different models
and different types of information to make different predictions He et al. (2019). Then they
2

merge these single models and use a model fusion solution to improve the prediction effect.
Model fusion could perform various operations to fuse two or more models and multiple
specific features. It must be noted that these operations may be different from the possible
operations performed by feature fusion. Such operations and optimization could be applied
to a wide range of models. Extensive experiments have proved that the performance of the
fusion model is 3%-5% higher than the performance of a single model.
Fusion models usually require the use of information features from multiple sources, and
then use the superior performance of different models for certain types of information to
improve the final performanceThakkar & Chaudhari (2021).
Since some studies already prove that news text alone could also effectively predict the
stock market, we suppose that news could be an independent observational state of the
stock market. Using news text and stock price data simultaneously and treating them as
two modalities, we could use a multi-modal learning method in the prediction task.

3.1	The BERT model
BERT Devlin et al. (2019) proposes to learn language representations by using a “masked
language model” training objective. In more detail, let x = x1 , ..., xL be a set of discrete
tokens, xl ∈ X . We can define a joint probability distribution over this set as follows:
p(x | θ)
1L
Z(θ) 口 φl (x 1 θ) 8 exp
(XX log Φι (XI θ )
Use BERT to establish a self-supervised key semantic feature extraction method, and
achieved the best results. This process avoids the time for manual tagging of keywords
and does not require any prior knowledge. This allows us to easily apply this method to
huge financial news data sets.
3.2	TS-BERT
Our world experience is multi-modality we see objects, hear sounds, feel textures, smell
smells, taste tastes. Modality refers to the way something happens or experiences. When a
research question contains multiple modalities, it has the characteristics of multi-modality.
In order for artificial intelligence to make progress in understanding the world around us, it
needs to interpret these multi-modal signals simultaneously.
For example, images are usually associated with tags and text explanations. The text
contains images to more clearly express the article’s central idea. Different modes have very
different statistical properties.
In our task, the volatility of stocks is our goal. The statistical characteristics of stock
volatility exist in the time series data of stocks and the news text related to stocks.

3.2.1	Fusion Embedding
The fusion embedding method could be divided into two parts. The first part is to embed
the news text, the second part is to embed the stock data, and then the third step is to fuse
the two. In terms of design, this is a multi-modal neural network learning method.
3.2.2	News Embedding
In text embedding, we use keyword extraction technology, which uses BERT to embed to
create keywords and key phrases that are most similar to news text.
Although there are many methods available for keyword generation, such as Rake, Yake,
and TF-IDF, the performance of these once-popular methods is no longer so powerful in
the current deep learning field. Due to the advent of pre-trained models, it is easy to create
a more powerful method to extract keywords and key phrases. This is the design basis of
our method, using Bert embedding and superficial cosine similarity to find the most similar
sub-phrases in the news text to the news itself.
First, use BERT to extract news embedding to obtain news-level embedding. Then use
no-gram to extract the embedding of the word. Finally, we use cosine similarity to find
the most similar words or phrases to the news. Then we define the most similar words or
phrases as the words and phrases that best describe the exclusive news.
We feed the news to BERT, and obtain the contextual feature vector of each word. The
vectors of words in a news is averaged in order to get its news embedding vector. Then
we choose the words close to news embedding vector. The idea is that a keyword should
capture meaning of news, and thus should be closer to the news embedding. The similarity
of the embeddings to the news embedding is obtained using cosine similarity metric.

The advantage of this method is that we do not need to start training from scratch and
adjust the parameters multiple times. The performance of BERT itself has been widely
recognized.
3.2.3	Stock time series data Embedding
There are also many modelling methods for stock time-series data. However, because we do
not need to use a very complex model in this task, we choose to use a basic RNN to embed
the stock time series data.
Embedding connection Although combining different modalities or information types to
improve the effect is intuitively an attractive task, how to combine different noise levels and
conflicts between different modules in practice is a challenge. The most common method in
practice is to connect high-level embeddings of different inputs and then apply softmax.
The problem with this approach is that it would give equal importance to all sub-
networks/modes, which is very unlikely in reality. News and stock prices may not have
the same influence on the forecast, so we need to calculate the different weights they play.
3.2.4	Weighted combination of networks
Because the relationship between the two modalities of text features and time-series features
is relatively complicated, we could not only use simple fusion methods to describe this
relationship. And it would cause the fusion of feature vectors to have too high dimensionality.
We use MCB to solve this problem. MCB pools the fused features. First, the vector outer
product calculation is performed on the feature vector of each location of the feature map
obtained by the convolution. Then sum pooling is performed on the results of the outer
product calculation of all locations to obtain the feature vector x. x gets the final feature
after signed square root and L2 normalization.

The operation of bilinear pooling can be expressed as:
B(X) = XXsXsT
s∈S
MCB maps the result of the outer product to a low-dimensional space, and does not need
to explicitly calculate the outer product.
4	EXPERIMENT
4.1	Data
We used data from the kaggle competition. We carry out some necessary processing of these
data. In the end, the data set we used for the experiment contained data from a total of
300 companies from NYSE and NASDAQ. The period is from 2008 to 2021, with a total of
more than 2,800 trading days. Each day’s data for each company includes the corresponding
stock price and news related to the company.
We consider the data of 300 companies as a whole, so our data set length is around 840,000.
We split the data set into two parts: training and testing, 85% is the training set, and 15%
is the test set. In addition, we regard the top 5% and tail 5% of the stock’s daily rise and
fall in a cycle as crisis and the rest as crisis-free.
4.2	Baseline Methods
For contrastive experiments, we consider baselines with two different methods:GCN classifier
and CNN classifier with LSTM embeddings.Since these models do not have multi-modal
application cases similar to our text-time series data, this result could not be considered as
the best performance of the model on such tasks.
4.2.1	GCN classifier
We use words and stock features as news nodes to construct news with a graph structure.
Then use TF-IDF to characterize the relationship between words and news. In the training
phase, we use a fixed-length window to divide the crisis or not as a monitoring label for
news.
4.2.2	CNN classifier
We use LSTM to extract the key semantics of the text, and then use CNN to extract the key
features of the semantics.It should be noted that only news data is used in CNN classifier.
4.3	Results
As shown in table1, both our model and baseline model have high precision, but fewer false
warnings are crucial for crisis prediction tasks, so we also calculated the recall.

5	CONCLUSION
Using multi-modal learning methods to improve the accuracy of stock risk volatility predic-
tion is one of the main directions of our work. In future work, we have additional possible
improvements.
At present, we use the top3 self-relevance keywords in the news as news representations,
and there may be possible that the impact of these three keywords on the stock market is
not the same. We could score the relevance of the news stock classification before extracting
the keywords. Then we use the highest score as the stock classification tendency of the news
and then extract the top3 words of this classification tendency in the news.
Another possible improvement is that we may design a new crisis modelling method, which
aims to accurately describe the crisis fluctuations in the stock market and improve the inter-
pretability. And then, using a more complex and more powerful time-series data embedding
method may also improve the performance of our model.
In order to be more in line with the actual stock market, perhaps the weight ratio of precision
to recall is not the same as in the standard F1. Therefore, changing the recall weight is also
one of the important applications of the F1 score. After the change, the formula of the F1
score could turn to:
Fe = (1 + β2) *
Precision * Recall
(β2 * P recision) + Recall
If necessary, experimental data, model structure, etc., may be further improved.
