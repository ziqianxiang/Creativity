Table 1: Quantitative evaluation on (a) BAIR Robot Pushing (Ebert et al., 2017) and (b) KITTIdriving dataset (Geiger et al., 2013). We observe that HARP can achieve competitive performanceto state-of-the-art methods with large end-to-end networks on these benchmarks.
Table 2: FVD scores of HARP with varying (a) the number of codes to use for top-k sampling, (b)number of layers, and (c) magnitude m of data augmentation.
Table 3: Average success rate onMT-50 test environments. The re-sults report the mean and standarddeviation over five runs.
