Table 1: Accuracy of the testing methods with GCN networks as baseline. We report mean accuracyover 3 runs of 10-fold cross validation with standard deviations (denoted ±). The relative improvementof ifMixup over the baseline GCN is provided in the last row of the table. Best results are in Bold.
Table 2: Accuracy of the testing methods with GIN networks as baseline. We report mean scores over3 runs of 10-fold cross validation with standard deviations (denoted ±). The relative improvement ofifMixup over the baseline GIN is provided in the last row of the table. Best results are in Bold.
