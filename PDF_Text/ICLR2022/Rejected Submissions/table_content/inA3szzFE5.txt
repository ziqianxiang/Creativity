Table 1: Accuracy on Fourier-filtered CIFAR10/CIFAR100 test sets.
Table 2: Mean accuracy across all Fourier-noise corruptions averaged across 1,024 randomly se-lected test samples for each corruption. `2 norms of the additive Fourier-noise are âˆˆ {3, 4}.
Table 3: Accuracies on SVHN-C corruptions of highest severity level. We created SVHN-C byapplying corruptions in CIFAR10-C to SVHN test samples.
Table 4: Accuracies on CIFAR10-C corruptions of highest severity level.
Table 5: Accuracy on patch-shuffled CIFAR10/CIFAR100 test sets.
Table 6: Accuracies for CIFAR100-C corruptions of highest severity level. We note that the LSF-regularized model is significantly more robust than the baseline for blurring corruptions. Fornoise corruptions, the MSF-regularized model is more robust compared to the baseline as wellas the LSF-regularized model. Similar to CIFAR10-C, low-pass filtering and AT also lead tomodels robust to blurring and noise. MSF-regularized and ASF-regularized models areagain more robust to noise and JPEG noise, compared to the ASF-regularized model.
