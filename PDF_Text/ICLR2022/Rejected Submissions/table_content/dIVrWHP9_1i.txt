Table 2: Performance comparisons of G-Mixup with different graph neural networks on differentdataset. The metric is the classification accuracy and its standard deviation. The best performance isin boldface. Experimental settings are in Appendix B.1. Experiments with more backbones (Diff-Pool, MincutPool, GMT) and molecular property prediction are in Appendix C.1 and Appendix C.2.
