Table 1: Data selection time (in minutes) for the first cycle on Cifar10 with two selection sizes 2500and 250. All the results are measured on a Nvidia Tesla V100 GPU with an Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold5117 CPU.
Table 2: Evaluation of variance reduction for different active learning methods at cycle 2 on Ci-far10. The confidence of the true label (higher is better) and Entropy (lower is better) are used toapproximate the variance. We use the same random seed in the all experiments. The Confidence andEntropy at cycle 1 for training samples are 0.64 and 0.69, respectively.
