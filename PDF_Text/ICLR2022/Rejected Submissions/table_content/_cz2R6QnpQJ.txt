NRRN does a better job in removing noise across the resin while sharpening the biologicalstructures - visible on Fig. 1 and Fig. 6b. Additional information is given in the appendix.

We see thatthe signal (which on the resin area is mostly noise) gradually fattens. Looking at the intermediatedenoising results one can tune the modular architecture toward the needs in hand: the higher the levelof noise, the higher the number of BUs. We trained a whole family of NRRN networks ranging thenumber of BUs from 1 to 5 on the OHSU data set. Measuring the signal variation on the resin interms of IQR, PSNR, and SSIM, we observed that while the SSIM and PSNR have not improved, thevariation of the signal (in terms of IQR) on the resin flattened until the 4th BU and leveled there.
