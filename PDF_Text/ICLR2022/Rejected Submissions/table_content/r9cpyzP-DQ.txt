Table 1: The mean squared error for interpolation, MSE (I), and generalization, MSE (G), and meanexecution times (in ms, ± 1 standard deviation) on the 3D Lotka-Volterra system and the time criticalmotion generation for our method with a linear base ODE and competing augmented ODE models,with neural network dynamics, with various numerical integrators. Our method, with a linear baseODE, provides comparable or better accuracy, with significant integration speed-ups.
Table 2: The mean squared error, accuracy and mean integration times (in ms, ± 1 standard deviation)when using latent ODEs on the tasks of periodic curve reconstruction using 100 and 1000 time-steps,the classification problems of human activity and ECG, and the image sequence generation with ourmethod using a linear base ODE and competing numerical integrators.
Table 3: The MAE of interpolating trajectories from the Lorentz system, with ODEs using neuralnetworks of various sizes.
Table 4: The MAE of interpolating trajectories from the Lorentz system, with a small base ODE with2256 parameters and an increasing number of invertible layers.
Table 5: The training times in seconds with standard deviations, for 1000 iterations. By leveragingthe closed-form solution of linear ODEs, training time with our method is consistently orders ofmagnitude faster than by using a differentiable numerical integrator.
