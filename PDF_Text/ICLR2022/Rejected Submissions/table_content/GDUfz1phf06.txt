Table 1: Performance and cost trade-off between searched architectures and human designed archi-tectures on UCI density estimation datasets. When the emphasizing on forward cost, the cost columnreports forward cost, when emphasizing on inverse cost, the cost column reports inverse cost. Thetest NLL (lower the better), density, coverage (higher the better) cost and FOM are reported.
