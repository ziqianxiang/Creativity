Table 1: FID score for different methods on multiple datasets. FID results are calculated every 10epochs and we choose the minimum. Lower score means generated images are better. * means wedon’t go for the best performance across different structure, but for comparison purpose only.
Table 2: FLD score for different methods on multiple datasets. We choose FLD when FID reachesthe best. Lower score means the encoded latent distribution is closer to the Guassian prior.
Table 3: The network architecture we use for MNIST. FC represents fully connected layer.
Table 4: The network architecture we use for CelebA and CIFAR10. CONV(C, K, S) representsconvolutional layer with C channels, K×K-size kernels, and S strides. DCONV represents decon-volutional layer, parameter meaning similar with CONV. BN represents batch normalization layer.
