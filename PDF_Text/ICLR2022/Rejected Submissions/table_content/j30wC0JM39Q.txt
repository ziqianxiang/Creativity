Table 1: The frequency concentration slope of graph embeddings are consistently negative acrossfour algorithms/datasets.
Table 2: Word embedding datasets.
Table 3: Graph datasets13Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2022For each graph, we applied graph embedding algorithms (dim = 64) as following:•	Random walk based DeepWalk Perozzi et al. (2014),•	Random projection based FastRP Chen et al. (2019),•	First-order and second-order proximity based LINE Tang et al. (2015)•	Locally linear embedding LLE Roweis & Saul (2000).

Table 6: Our proposed Frequency Concentration (FC) index is well correlated with classic Moran’sI and Geary’s C.
