We observethat the best performance is achieved when all the information sources are utilized. Not using anymedication or patient similarity information leads to the highest RMSE, MAE, and MAPE on bothdatasets. This indicates that having a patient representation that incorporates the patient’s prescribedmedications and information from similar patients can boost the accuracy of lab test result predic-tions. We observe that the performance of KALP without the knowledge augmentation componentstill outperforms the state-of-the-art technique, BEHRT suggesting that the patient representationlearnt by KALP is indeed effective.
