Table 1: Comparison between MIP attack (Tjeng et al., 2019) (Using GurObi) and our BaB Attack. Bothattacks focus on hard instances Where a combination of MT-PGD, ODS-PGD and AutoAttack cannot attackand their robustness also cannot be verified using a verifier. We are faster than MIP Attack and can also findmore adversarial examples in all models. Average time excludes examples where all methods time out.
Table 2: Number of successfully (# succ.) attacked hard instances (from Table 1) under five more attacks.
Table 3: Ablation study on how each proposed component contributes to the overall performance.
