Table 1: Performance of Tessenated 2D convolutional neural networks against '∞, ε = 8/255FGSM and PGD adversarial attacks. Hyperparameter values of the number of sub-rectangles in thetessellation for the FMNIST dataset are: regular (k = 16), aperiodic (k = 22), Mondrian (k = 24).
Table 2: Accuracy (acc), and drop in accuracy (∆acc) of compared models for FGSM and PGDadversarial attacks for CIFAR10 dataset. Bold typeset values indicate best ∆acc for an attack.
