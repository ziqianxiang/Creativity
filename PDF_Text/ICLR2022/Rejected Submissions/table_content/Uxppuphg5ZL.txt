Table B.1: Median performance of the models on different datasets. *ConstraintMLP: results notshown for the ‘BoxBath’ dataset as it is infeasible to run MLP constraint on 1000s of nodes. Thestandard deviation from the median is shown over 5 random seeds. We do not show the results forthe models where the median value, or standard deviation is more than 1000 times larger than thebest model in each column. Results for all seeds are shown in figure B.6 Note that the tables usedifferent scales to demonstrate the errors on 1-step error, 10-step rollouts and full rollouts.
