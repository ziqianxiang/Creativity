Table 1: Datasets for experiments with a single-speaker target.
Table 2: S2ST performance for outputting in a single speaker’s voice. BLEU scores were computedwith 1 reference for the Conversational test set, and with 4 references for the Fisher test set.
Table 3: S2ST performance with voice retention using the approach in Section 4. Speaker similarityMOS is evaluated between the synthesized English speech and the human Spanish recording. Note: 1)the BLEU evaluation set is a subset of the same in Table 2; 2) Training targets are human recordingsin Jia et al. (2019b) and synthesized speech in this work.
Table 4: Voice retention performance on speaker turns. The speaker similarity MOS between theleading/trailing 1.6-second segment from the predicted speech (English) and the entire 1st/2nd sourcespeaker,s speech (Spanish) is measured. (↑ / J indicates that higher/lower values are better.)	1st source speaker		2nd source speaker		Leading seg. ↑	Trailing seg. J	Leading seg.

Table 5: Multilingual X→En S2ST performance on 4 high-resource languages from CoVoST 2,measured by BLEU on ASR transcribed text. The same checkpoints from each model were used forevaluating all language pairs. Note: BLEU scores are not directly comparable between S2ST and ST.
