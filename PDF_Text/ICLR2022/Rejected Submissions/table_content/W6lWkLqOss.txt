In this paper,we do not propose a new imbalanced learning techniqUe, bUt a general-pUrpose performance evalUa-tion framework that coUld be Used in the training and/or testing of models for any techniqUe. Section4 demonstrates the practical Utility of oUr framework for a variety of real ML Use cases.
