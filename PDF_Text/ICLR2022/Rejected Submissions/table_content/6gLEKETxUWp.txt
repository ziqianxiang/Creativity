Table 1: Quantitative Evaluation of Molecule Manipulation over a variety of molecular properties(numbers reported are strict success rate / success rate in %, -R denotes model with random manip-ulation, -L denotes model with largest range manipulation, -M denotes model with MolSpacE. Thebest performances compared to baseline models are bold and the best performances across modelsin the same dataset are marked as red).
