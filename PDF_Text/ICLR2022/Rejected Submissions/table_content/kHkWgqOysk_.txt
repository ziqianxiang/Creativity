Table 1: Validation of RPL and SEC. The experiments are conducted on CIFAR10 with Wide-ResNet-28-2 backbone. Class-mismatch ratio varies from 0 to 100%. Check RPL or not meansusing RPL or vanilla PL. K = 0 means we do not use SEC. K = 1 means we label all the lowconfidence data as a unified class KID + 1.
