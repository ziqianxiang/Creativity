Table 1: Common kernel functions. Kernel functions are symmetric, positive semi-definite func-tions(corresponding to symmetric, positive semi-definite Gram matrices). The linear kernel does notmodify or warp the feature space.
Table 2: Empirical results reported for LFW : PCA, TensorFaces and compositional hierarchicalBlock TensorFaces. Pixels denotes independent facial part analysis Gaussian/Laplacian use a multiresolution pyramid to analyze facial features at different scales. Weighted denotes a weightedcomposite signature.
