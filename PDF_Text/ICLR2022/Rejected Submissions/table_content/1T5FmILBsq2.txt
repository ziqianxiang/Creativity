Table 1: Parameter counts and performance of the three RNN models tested on the addition problem.
Table 2: Parameter counts and accuracy of the three RNN models tested on the HAR-2 classificationproblem, including the standard deviation across 10 training runs.
Table 3: Parameter counts and test perplexity of the RNN models trained on the PTB data set forword-level language modelling. Parameter counts only include the size of the RNN cells.
