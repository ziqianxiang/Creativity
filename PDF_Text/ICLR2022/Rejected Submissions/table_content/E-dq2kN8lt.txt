Table 1: Number of communication rounds for finding an -solution of federated convex and non-convex problems (1), where Ef (x) - f * ≤ e for convex setting and Ek▽/(x)k2 ≤ e for nonconvexsetting. In the last column, (G,B)-BGD means that PN=I ∣∣Vfi(χ)k2 ≤ G2 + B2kVf (x)k2. (G, 0)-BGD means B = 0, and (0, B)-BGD means G = 0. BV denotes the “Bounded Variance” assumption,i.e., (2), and Smooth stands for standard smoothness assumption, e.g., Assumption 1. Other notations(i.e., N, S, M, K) are summarized in Table 2.
