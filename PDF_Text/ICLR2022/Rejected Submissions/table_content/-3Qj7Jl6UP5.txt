Table 1: S0rensen-Dice coefficient on held-out test of the magnitude-based method with respect tothe Canny method.
Table 2: The accuracies of the attacked networks. From left to right: quantized magnitude layer withdifferent quantization levels, the undefended model, the model with feature squeezing and variouslevels, and the magnitude layer as an input layer. The zero epsilon values are the base accuries. Forthe non-zero epsilon, the accuracy is the ratio of non-adversarial examples to base accuracies.
