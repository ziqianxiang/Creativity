In thetable, worker (random) denotes a worker with a random manager, and FRL (backwards) denotesour framework with a manager generating sub-goals in a backwards manner, i.e., with the multi-hopmanager model in 2.4. FRL (forwards) is an ablation of our solution, with the manager generatingsub-goals in a forward manner. We run 5 randomly initialized worker training on 6 × 6 and 10 ×10 grid-sized RTFM games respectively. Upperbound is the performance of our worker with thegroundtruth sub-goals provided.

While our manager agent well connects the linguistic information andthe visual information, our model achieves extraordinary performance in Stage 2. However, due tothe indistinguishable setting for the entities, the performance of our model also drops. With the ini-tial observation, which has no motion information, the manager cannot distinguish the same namedentities, but randomly guess the goal entity between them. We argue it is not a suitable setting forreading-to-act task, because with only the manual description, it cannot provide all the informationto finish a task.
