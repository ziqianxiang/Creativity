Table 1: Training results for all datasets. cpl-mixVAE uses 2 arms. |c| and |s| denote the cardinality of latentdiscrete and continuous spaces. Iter, ACC and DS denote number of iterations, the accuracy of the categorical as-signment, and the disentanglement score, respectively. Computation denotes the training speed (iteration/second)on a GeForce RTX 2080 Ti GPU. The computation of cpl-mixVAE includes the entire execution time for trainingone pair of coupled networks, plus data augmentation.
