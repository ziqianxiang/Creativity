Table 1: Average goal visits across environments and baselines at the end of training for the Gridworld(10 trials) and Point Mujoco Maze (5 trials) environments. Bold numbers indicate best performance.
Table 2: Hyperparameter values for our approach.
Table 3: Average reward per step (meanÂ±standard deviation) across environments and baselines atthe end of training for the Gridworld (10 trials) and Point Mujoco Maze (5 trials) environments. Thebold values indicate the best performance. The averaging window size used for U-Maze is 1000, andfor other mazes, it is 10000.
