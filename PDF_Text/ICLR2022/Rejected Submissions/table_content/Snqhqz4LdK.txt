This far exceeds the uncheckedvalidity rate of 67% achieved by GraphAF, suggesting that GEN3D has a better understanding of thebasic rules of chemistry. Interestingly, our geometry-free baseline achieves 99.8% validity, suggest-ing that our improvements in chemical validity come from architectural differences that are unrelatedto the generation of 3D geometries. GEN3D achieves a uniqueness rate of 94.3%, which is simi-6Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2022lar to the rates for GraphAF and CGVAE. We also assessed the geometric feasibility of generatedgraphs by converting them into 3D coordinates using CORINA (Sadowski & Gasteiger, 1993), andthen computing the volume of the tetrahedron enclosed by each sp3 tetrahedral center, with verticeslocated 1 A along each tetrahedral bond. Graphs that could not be converted with CORINA, orcontained tetrahedral centers with volumes less than 0.345 cubic A, were classified as being overly

This metric, however, is relatively insensitive to the correctness ofindividual molecular geometries because it only compares the aggregate distributions of distances.

Sucha model could learn to generate potential binding molecules directly inside a protein pocket. Thegenerated molecules and geometries could then move directly into downstream stability screeningsusing molecular dynamics simulations or docking programs. This approach could greatly decreasethe amount of computation needed to select and verify promising drug molecules. Quantum mechan-ical energy calculations, docking scores, and molecular dynamics simulation results from generatedposes could also be used to train the model via reinforcement learning.
