Table 1: Classification accuracy on the latent representation in MNIST-SVHN-Text. Bold representsthe highest accuracy in each modality.
Table 2: Classification accuracy of image generations on MNIST-SVHN-Text. The top line showsmodalities generated, and the second line shows modalities conditioned when generating it.
Table 3: Performance on the latent representation and modality generation in Bimodal CelebA. I andT respectively stand for Image and Text. We report the mean average precision across all modalities.
Table 4: Performance on the latent representation and modality generation in Bimodal CelebA.
Table 5: Classification accuracy on the latent representation and generated modalities in MNIST-SVHN-Text. M, S and T respectively stand for MNIST, SVHN, and Text, indicating that the rep-resentations are inferred from these modalities. M+S means both M and S. Aâ†’ B means that thecorresponding column is the performance of generating B conditioned on A.
