Table 1: MAE measured in the one-step forecasting of different time series, when a same predictorDNN is trained with a static MAE loss function and with a loss learned via MetaLoss. The rightmostcolumn reports the percent gain in MAE scored by the MetaLoss approach over the static MAE loss.
Table 2: Operator cost of an anticipatory allocation of network resources measured for the mobiledata traffic generated by four different services, when a same predictor DNN is trained with a staticα-OMC loss function (Bega et al., 2019) and with a loss learned via MetaLoss. The rightmostcolumn reports the cost reduction achieved by the MetaLoss approach over the static α-OMC loss.
