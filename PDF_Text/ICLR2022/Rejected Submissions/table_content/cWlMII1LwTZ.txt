Our code is based on Pytorch. We use the Adam optimizer and learningrate 10-3 for all the applications. The number of samples, train/test split, training epochs, and re-sulting runtime are summarized in Table 1. (Note that the evaluation for hourly household powerconsumption is based on the theoretical solutions, so “training epochs”, which is associated with thegradient-based method, doesn’t apply.) We also provide all our documented code as supplemen-tary material and will make it publicly-available after the review process. All three datasetscited in the evaluation are publicly-available from the standard UCI Machine Learning Repository(Dua & Graff, 2017) and anonymized using standard practices. The individual dataset licenses werenot available.
