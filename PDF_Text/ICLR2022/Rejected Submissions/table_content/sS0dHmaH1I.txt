Table 1: Numerical evaluation of anomaly localization onMVTec-AD. We report both mIoU (top rows) and AUC-ROC(bottom rows) values. Col 2-5 are fully supervised methodstrained with massive normal samples.
Table 2: Frame-level AUC-ROC for the video anomalydetection tasks.
Table 3: Comparison of different sparse coding receptive fields.
Table 4: Performance w/ and w/o sparsity constraint. From left toright: mIoU; AUC-ROC; the difference of averaged reconstruc-tion errors between abnormal/normal samples.
Table A: The architectures of feature extractor.
Table B: Robustness to pose variations. We report both mIoU (left) and AUC-ROC (right) values.
Table C: Comparing with image differencing. We report mIoU (left) and AUC-ROC (right) forindustrial inspection task and AUC-ROC for video anomaly detection task.
Table D:	Performance evaluation against data contamination. We contaminate the normal trainingdata by inserting increasing percentages of abnormal data.
Table E:	Performance comparisons with temporal information incorporated.
