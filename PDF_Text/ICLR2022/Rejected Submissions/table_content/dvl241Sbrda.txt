Table 6: Evaluation of graph reconstruction on the real-world taxonomies (the dimension is 32 forTreeRep and 16 for UnitBall). For memory cost, the unit is GiB.
Table 7: Evaluation of taxonomy link prediction in different embedding dimensions (the embeddingdimension for UnitBall is half of other models). The best results are shown in boldface. The secondbest results are underlined. TreeRep is not applicable to 128-d WordNet-noun due to the largememory cost so we do not include the results.

Table 12: Nodes embedded in the most simple totally real plane of the unit ball model. Theembeddings are trained by UnitBall model on link prediction task in Section 5.3.1. Considering thepossible numerical error, we allow the embeddings to deviate the plane for a small threshold insteadof strictly lying in the plane.
