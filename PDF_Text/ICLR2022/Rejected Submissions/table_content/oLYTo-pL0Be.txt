Table 1: Average classification accuracies and standard deviations for various baseline and state-of-the-art methods on the Ward Admission (tabular), MNIST (image) and CIFAR-10 (image) datasets.
Table 2: Average classification accuracies and standard deviations for various baseline and state-of-the-art methods on the hospital ward admission (tabular), eICU (tabular), CIFAR-10 (image) andMNIST (image) datasets. All models are averaged over the same five seeds. We also show how themodels perform when subjected to a data poisoning attack and a local model poisoning attack.
