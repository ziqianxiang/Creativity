Table 2: Multi-task Policy Performance Results: We report multi-task average andstandard error performance across all 18 training tasks and all 18 test tasks (unseenobject color in goal text or image) for seen and unseen initial state distributionswith no conditioning, primitive code conditioning, and language conditioning. Thevalues reported are the episode reward averaged across 50 seeds per task policyrollout. The tasks are robotic arm manipulation of objects to different target semanticrelationships of each other in the FetchSimRobot environment from only images.
