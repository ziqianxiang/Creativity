Table 1: Evaluating transductive universal transport from objects on UCF-101. Our proposedapproach also enhances universal object-based approaches for zero-shot action recognition, due toboth object filtering (left) and the proposed weighting of unseen actions and objects (right).
Table 2: State-of-the-art comparison on UCF-101 and HMDB51 for different numbers of testactions. Across both datasets and different numbers of test actions, our approach obtains the highestzero-shot action classification performance.
