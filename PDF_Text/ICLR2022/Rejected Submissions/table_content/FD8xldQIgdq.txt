Table 1: Results of several attribution methods over 1500 images of ImageNet using a standard androbust ResNet50 (training is reported in the first column). BIG: Boundary-based Integrated Gra-dient. BSM: Boundary-based Saliency Map. AGI: Adversarial Gradient Integration. SM: SaliencyMap. GTI: grad√óinput. SG: Smoothed Gradient. IG: Integrated Gradient. See Appendix E forthe corresponding boxplot.
Table 2: Hyper-parameters used for adversarial attacks. adaptive means the actual step size isdetermined by 2 * E / max steps.
Table 3: Comparisons among BIG, BIGp (BIG using PGD only to run the boundary search), AGIand IG.
