Table 6: A sample example of class overlapping of the data used to build up modelsresulting in strong class overlapping among some classes. It makes the models confusing duringtraining to learn distinctive features for proper classification. Therefore, for some classes in the testdataset, the models perform very poorly. Table 6 presents a sample of examples of class overlappingin the data prepared by Hulsebos et al. (2019). It is to be noted that the proportion of this class overlapis considerably large in numbers with respect to the total number of instances. Therefore, it affectsthe training as well as the model performance on the test dataset by a significant margin. Besides theclass overlap, faulty or wrong values are present in some classes.
