Table 2: Our main results: using permutations generated by tsample and adding cardinal-ity gives the best overall performance in terms of macro precision, recall, and F -score. BART-multi-labelis the standard multi-label classification approach. Statistically significant results areunderscored. CARD stands for cardinality.

Table 5: Set overlap for different sampling types with 200% augmentations. The gains are con-sistent across sampling types. Similar trends were observed for 100% augmentation and withoutpositional embeddings. Top-k sampling was introduced by (Fan et al., 2018), and Nucleus samplingby (Holtzman et al., 2020).
