Table A2: Testing accuracy and percentage of remaining weights on ResNet-50 with CIFAR-10.
Table A3: Testing accuracy and percentage of remaining weights on CIFAR-100 with VGG-16.
Table A4: Testing accuracy and percentage of remaining weights on CIFAR-100 with WideResNet-32-2. Different methods (IMP, IMP-Refill, and IMP-Regroup) are evaluated. The baseline(validation accuracy of the dense network) is 75.53%.
