Table 1: The patient claim dataset on hypertension contains 1, 618, 363 observations and 60 vari-ables. Above the family of such variables are listed and briefly described.
Table 2: Model evaluation on hybrid data. The results show that the first four models perform muchbetter than the IPTW model.
Table 3: Model evaluation on synthetic data. The results show a pattern similar to the table for thehybrid dataset: the first four models perform much better than the IPTW model. The performancevariance of the first four models is larger than that on the hybrid dataset.
