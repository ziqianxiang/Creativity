Table 1: Summary and comparison of existing molecular graph generation methods.
Table 2: Generation performance on QM9.
Table 3: Generation performance on ZINC250k.
Table 4: Property optimization resultsin terms of the best QED scores. OurGraphEBM finds more novel moleculeswith the best QED scores.
Table 5: Constrained property optimization results. Note that there are two different settings inbaselines. JT-VAE and GCPN choose 800 molecules with the lowest plogp scores in the test set anduse them as initialization, while GraphAF and MoFlow choose from the training set. We report ourresults on both of these two settings for extensive comparisons. Î´ is the similarity constraint. Thetop two highest property improvements on each constraint are highlighted as 1st and 2nd.
