Table 1: Natural modelling results for Atari 2600. Bit-level F1 reported for slots with high entropy,as in Anand et al. (2019). Results assumed significant at p < 0.05 (one-sided paired Wilcoxon test).
Table 2: Abstract modelling results for Atari 2600. Entire-slot accuracies and bit-level F1 scores arereported only for slots with high entropy, as per Anand et al. (2019).
