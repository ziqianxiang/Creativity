Table 1: Training and Test Errors on InvarianceUnitTests for all algorithms and examples with(dinv, dspu, denv) = (5, 5, 3). The errors for Examples 1 and 1s are in MSE and all others are clas-sification error. The empirical mean and the standard deviation are computed using 10 independentexperiments. An ‘s’ indicates the scrambled variation of its corresponding problem setting.
