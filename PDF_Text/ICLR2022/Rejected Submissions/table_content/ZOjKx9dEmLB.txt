Each wavesignal is then sampled using a wavelength and frequency prescribed in C6t6-A∏ard et al. (2019) toproduce 2D signals.
Table 2: Performance of NAS and the WRN baselines across the tasks of NAS-Perf-360. Methodsare divided into efficient methods (DenseNAS and fixed WRN) that take 1-10 GPU-hours, moreexpensive methods (DARTS and WRN tuned by ASHA) that take 10-100+ GPU-hours, andspecialized methods (Auto-DL and AMBER). All results are averages of three random seeds.
