Table 1: Analogous quantities in RG and IMP theory.
Table 2:	Computed eigenvalues of the eigenfunctions Mi for ResNet-50, pre-trained on ImageNetusing simCLR (Chen et al., 2020b). Red (green) corresponds to those eigenvalues that are relevant(irrelevant). Any eigenvalues within a standard deviation of λ = 1 are considered marginal andcolored cyan.
Table 3:	Computed eigenvalues of the eigenfunctions Mi for the first stage of various ResNet archi-tectures. Same coloring as in Table 2.
Table 4:	Computed eigenValues of the eigenfunctions, Mi, for ResNet-50, pre-trained on ImageNetusing superVised learning (Huh et al., 2016). Red (green) corresponds to those eigenValues that arereleVant (irreleVant). Any eigenValues within a standard deViation of λ = 1 are considered marginaland colored cyan.
Table 5:	Computed eigenvalues of the eigenfunctions, Mi, for VGG-16 trained on CIFAR-10. Notethat only the prunable layers had their IMP eigenvalues computed. Coloring is same as Table 4.
Table 6:	Computed eigenvalues of the eigenfunctions, Mi , for BERT trained on the MLM task.
Table 7: Computed eigenvalues of the eigenfunctions Mi for the second stage of various ResNetarchitectures. Coloring is same as Table 4.
Table 8:	Computed eigenvalues of the eigenfunctions Mi for the third stage of various ResNetarchitectures. Coloring is same as Table 4.
Table 9:	Critical exponent, γ, for ResNet-50 with either no pre-training and 5% rewinding, or pre-training using ImageNet, simCLR, or MoCo. Bottom half gives γ computed on the pre-trained taskafter pre-training the parameters. Data from Chen et al. (2021a).
