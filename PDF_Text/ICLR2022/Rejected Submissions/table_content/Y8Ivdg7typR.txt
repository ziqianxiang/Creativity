Table 1: Evaluation results (%) on 5-Phase CIFAR-100 using POD+AANets (Liu et al., 2021a),LUCIR+AANets (Liu et al., 2021a), LUCIR (Hou et al., 2019), iCaRL (Rebuffi et al., 2017), andLwF (Li & Hoiem, 2016) w/ and w/o our PlaceboCIL plugged in. “Average” and “Last” denote theaverage accuracy over five phases and the last-phase (5-th) accuracy, respectively.
Table 2: Average accuracy (%) across all phases using the state-of-the-art method (POD+AANets)w/ and w/o our PlaceboCIL plugged in. The upper block is for recent CIL methods.
Table 3: Ablation results (%) on CIFAR-100, N =5.“Average” and “Last” denote the average accu-racy over all phases and the last-phase accuracy, respectively. The four blocks show the results ofbaselines, using different free image streams, using RL (or not), and using placebos to compute CEloss, respectively. Please refer to more details in Section 5.2 Ablation study.
Table A1: Supplementary to Table 1. Evaluation results (%) on 25-Phase CIFAR-100 usingPOD+AANets (Liu et al., 2021a), LUCIR+AANets (Liu et al., 2021a), LUCIR (Hou et al., 2019),and iCaRL (Rebuffi et al., 2017) w/ and w/o our PlaceboCIL plugged in. “Average” and “Last”denote the average accuracy over five phases and the last-phase (25-th) accuracy, respectively.
Table A2: Supplementary to Table 3. Ablation results (%) using equal-size split on CIFAR-100,10-phase (10 classes/phase).
Table A3: Supplementary to Table 3. Learning Curve Area (LCA10) (Chaudhry et al., 2019) onCIFAR-100, 5-phase.
Table A4: Supplementary to Table 3. Ablation results (%) on CIFAR-100, N =5.“Average” and“Last” denote the average accuracy over all phases and the last-phase accuracy, respectively. “All”denotes using all data from ImageNet, and “overlapping” means including samples from the over-lapping classes between CIFAR-100 and ImageNet.
