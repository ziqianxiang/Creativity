Table 1: MNIST Addition Results. Test accuracy corresponds to the percentage of correctly classifiedtest images. (a) Test accuracies in percent for the MNIST Addition task with various DPPLs, includingSLASH with an NPP that models the joint probabilities (SLASH (PC)) and one that models onlyconditional probabilities (SLASH (DNN)). (b) Test accuracies in percent for the MNIST Additiontask with missing data, comparing DeepProbLog with SLASH (PC). The amount of missing data wasvaried between 50% and 97% of the pixels per image.

Table 6: Additional MNIST Addition Results. Test accuracy corresponds to the percentage ofcorrectly classified test images. Both models (DeepProbLog and SLASH (PC)) were trained on thefull MNIST data, but tested on images with missing pixels. Test accuracies are presented in percent.
