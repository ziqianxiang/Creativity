Table 1: The lowest KL divergence from theground truth distribution to the obtained distri-bution on two types of single processes ([1] and[2]) and joint process of them ([1,2]). APP-# represents the order of the Additive PoissonProcess. Missing values mean that the compu-tation did not finish within two days.
Table 2: Negative test log-likelihood for theNew York Taxi data. Single processes ([T] and[W]) and joint process of them ([T,W]). APP-# represents the order of the Additive PoissonProcess.
