Table 1: Results for polynomial evaluationtask. Scratchpad outperforms direct predic-tion whether using fine-tuning or few-shot.
Table 2: Synthetic tracing and execution re-sults. Scratchpad outperforms direct predic-tion both for few-shot and fine-tuned.
Table 3: Comparison of models fine-tuned on different data sets and evaluated on MBPP programs.
