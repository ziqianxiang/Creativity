Table 1: Evaluation of three proportions to assess the appropriateness of using the constituency treerepresentation. The computation was performed on the train dataset under the cross-domain setting.
Table 2: Feature importance of the BERT-GAT-CRF model in Cross Domain predictionOne difficulty encountered during the development of this model was the management of batches.
Table 3: F1- score of the different models at token level on the test dataset (the results with a star(*) have been directly taken from (Trautmann et al., 2020))identification. Thus, it improves the state of the art on the token level (but achieves similar resultson the sentence level and the span level).
