Table 2: Prediction error (RMSE) and fairness performances of the matrix factorization basedalgorithm on MovieLens 1M dataset. The boldface indicates the best result and the underline denotesthe second best. Our algorithm offers great fairness performances for all the measures, except forVAL, which our framework does not target.

Table 4: Prediction error (RMSE) and fairness performances on the synthetic dataset. The datasetpreserves observation bias (q0, q1) = (0.2, 0.02) while exhibiting no population imbalance (p0, p1) =(0.4, 0.4). The boldface indicates the best result and the underline denotes the second best. Eachbaseline, say VAL-based approach, enjoys the best fairness performance only for the measure focusedtherein, VAL, while it does not work well under the other fairness measures. On the other hand,our algorithm offers great fairness performances for all the measures, except for VAL, which ourframework does not target.
