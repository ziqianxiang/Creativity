Table 3: Attribute Attack Accuracy for the dataset Rotated-MNIST with color as an attribute. We consider theattribute as binary (0: no color; 1: color ), thus the best case AI Attack accuracy Would be 50% via randomguess.

We randomly introduce color as an attribute with 70% probability to Rotated-MNISTdataset. The attacker’s goal is to infer whether a given input is colored or not (binary task) withonly access to the output prediction. This setting can be observed for example, where the user sendsembedding of their input to the server instead of the original input (Song & Shmatikov, 2020).
