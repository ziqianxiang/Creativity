Table 1: Definite Conformation Prediction on QM9 with backbone PhysNet(RDKit initialized).
Table 2: Multiple Conformation Generation on GEOM-Drugs with backbone PhysNet(RDKit ini-tialized). Time refers to the seconds used to process 50k molecules in a training epoch. ↑ means“higher is better”. An NaN result occurs in Naive RMSD.
Table 3: Multiple Conformation Generation on GEOM-QM9 with backbone CVGAE. Time refersto the seconds used to process 50k molecules in a training epoch. ↑ means “higher is better”.
Table 4: The proportion of degrees of freedom over number of sampled factors on D, Φ, Ψ. To savetime, we only sampled 1/10 molecules in datasets GEOM-QM9 and GEOM-Drugs.
Table 5: The standard deviation of sampled D, Φ, Ψ in each dataset.
Table 6: The hyper-parameters weighting D, Φ, Ψ for each dataset.
Table 7: Multiple Conformation Generation on GEOM-QM9 with backbone PhysNet. Time refersto the seconds used to process 50k molecules in a training epoch. ↑ means “higher is better”.
Table 8: Multiple Conformation Generation on GEOM-Drugs with backbone CVGAE. Time refersto the seconds used to process 50k molecules in a training epoch. ↑ means “higher is better”.
