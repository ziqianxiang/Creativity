Table 1: Mean average training accuracy and worst-group test accuracy (%) of the last 10 trainingepochs of ERM, IW and Group DRO under different levels of weight decay (WD). Each entry isAverage training accuracy / Worst-group test accuracy. Blue entries are mean accuracies of epochs11-20 with no weight decay. Each experiment is repeated five times with different random seeds.
