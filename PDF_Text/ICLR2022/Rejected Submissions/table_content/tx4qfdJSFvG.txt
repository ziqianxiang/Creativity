Table 1: Performance of Feature Propagation (combined with a GCN model) for 50%, 90% and99% of missing features, and relative drop compared to the performance of the same model whenall features are present. On average, our method loses only 2.50% of relative accuracy with 90% ofmissing features, and 4.12% with 99% of missing features.
Table 2: Performance of GCNMF, PaGNN and FP(+GCN) with 99% of features missing, as well asLabel Propagation (which is feature-agnostic). GCNMF and PaGNN perform respectively 58.33%and 21.25% worse in terms of relative accuracy in this scenario compared to when all the featuresare present. In comparison, FP has only a 4.12% drop.
