Table 1: Mean Opinion Score (MOS) with 95% confidence intervals and Automated Speech Recog-nition (ASR) metrics of TTS models for LJSpeech. The ASR metric indicates character error rate(CER) and word error rate (WER) measured by the pre-trained ASR model. The unconditionalDDPM in Guided-TTS uses only untranscribed speech of LJSpeech for training. Guided-TTS-T is amodel whose phoneme classifier and duration predictor are trained using the transcript of LJSpeech.
Table 2: Mean Opinion Score (MOS) of Guided-TTS-U with various untranscribed datasets with95% confidence intervals. In Guided-TTS-U, the phoneme classifier and the duration predictor aretrained on LibriTTS dataset, and the speaker encoder is trained on VoxCeleb2 dataset.
