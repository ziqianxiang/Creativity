Table 1: Polytopes classification: training and test accuracy (mean ± standard deviation over 10runs) for different transformations in the test set.
Table 2: Benchmark datasets. Train and test accuracy are reported for MNIST and CIFAR10. ForTSP, due to the high class unbalance, the train and test F1 score for the positive class is reported.
Table 3: Time per training step in the various experiments, normalised with respect to the batch-size.
Table 4: Polytopes classification: training and test accuracy (mean ± standard deviation over 10runs) for n = 3, for different transformations in the test set.
Table 5: Polytopes classification: training and test accuracy (mean ± standard deviation over 10runs) for n = 4, for different transformations in the test set.
Table 6: Polytopes classification: training and test accuracy (mean ± standard deviation over 10runs) for n = 5, for different transformations in the test set.
