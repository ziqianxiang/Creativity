Table 1: IMDB sentiment classification dataset accuracy. Continuous softmax uses Gaussian at-tention, continuous sparsemax truncated parabola, and kernel softmax and sparsemax use kernelexponential and deformed exponential family with a Gaussian kernel. The latter has Î± = 2 inexponential and multiplication terms. N: basis functions, I = 10 inducing points, bandwidth 0.01.

Table 3: Accuracy results on MIT BIH Arrhythmia Classification dataset. For F1 score, kernel soft-max and continuous softmax have similar results, while kernel sparsemax drastically outperformscontinuous sparsemax. For accuracy, the Gaussian mixture slightly beats other methods.
