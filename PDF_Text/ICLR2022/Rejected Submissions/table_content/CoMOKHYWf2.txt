Table 1: Test set ECE(%) for different methods (pre and post temperature scaling). Underlinedvalues mark the lowest error among Pre-T results and bold marks the overall lowest in the row.
Table 2: Test set error (%). The model with the lowest error is marked in bold.
Table 3: AdaECE(%). Underline marks the lowest error among pre-temperature scaling values.
Table 4: ClasswiseECE(%). Underline marks the lowest error among pre-temperature scaling values.
Table 5: ECEdebias(%) 15 bins. Underline marks the lowest error among pre-temperature scalingvalues. Bold marks the overall lowest in the row. Optimal temperature is selected based on the lowestECE on the validation set.
Table 6: ECEdebias (%) 30bins. Underline marks the lowest error among pre-temperature scalingvalues. Bold marks the overall lowest in the row. Optimal temperature is selected based on the lowestECE on the validation set.
Table 7: ECEEW-sweep(%). Underline marks the lowest error among pre-temperature scaling values.
Table 8: ECEEM-sweep(%). Underline marks the lowest error among pre-temperature scaling values.
Table 9: Effect of number of bins used for AdaFocal.
Table 10: AUROC (%) of models trained on CIFAR-10 as the in-distribution data and tested onSVHN and CIFAR-10-C as out-of-distribution data.
