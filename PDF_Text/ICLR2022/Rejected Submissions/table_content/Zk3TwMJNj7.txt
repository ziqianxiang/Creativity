Table 1: Test AccuracyWe also use one-side Wilcoxon signed-rank test to check if the test accuracy of different algorithmare significantly different, the result is in Table 2. All the p-values are significant at 0.01 level, sowe reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the SGD with moderate step size has test accuracysignificantly higher than all other algorithms.
