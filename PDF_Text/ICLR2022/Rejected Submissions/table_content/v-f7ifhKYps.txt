Table 1: Best self-play reward and its corresponding population entropy with different α: Inthis table, α denotes the weight of the population entropy reward in Equation (8).
Table 2: Mean episode reward and population entropy with different α in all five layouts: Eachcolumn corresponds to a different value of α in the set of [0.000, 0.001, 0.005, 0.010]. There arefive row sections, which correspond to the five layouts. Each row section contains two rows, whichare the plots of the mean episode reward and the mean population entropy of the layout, respectively.
Table 3: Mean episode reward and population entropy with different α in all five layouts: Eachcolumn corresponds to a different value of α in the set of [0.020, 0.030, 0.040, 0.050]. There arefive row sections, which correspond to the five layouts. Each row section contains two rows, whichare the plots of the mean episode reward and the mean population entropy of the layout, respectively.
