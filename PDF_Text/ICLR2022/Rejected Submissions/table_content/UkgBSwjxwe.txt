Table 11: Valuation functions for each neural predicate in Kandinsky data set. Each neural predicateis associated with a valuation function. In the forward-chaining reasoning step, the probability foreach ground atom is computed using the valuation function. The parameterized neural predicatesare trained using the concept examples.
