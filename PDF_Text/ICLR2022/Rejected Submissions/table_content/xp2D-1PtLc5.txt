Table 1: Comparison of different models in traditional VC and one-shot vcMethods	Traditional VC			One-Shot VC			MCD	MOS	VSS	MCD	MOS	VSSVQVC+	7.08 ± 0.22	3.31 ± 0.90	3.42 ± 0.85	8.41 ± 0.08	2.75 ± 0.84	3.11 ± 0.88AutoVC	4.34 ± 0.12	3.81 ± 1.14	3.45 ± 0.76	7.66 ± 0.17	2.61 ± 0.73	2.91 ± 0.72VAE	5.63 ± 0.21	3.33 ± 0.87	3.07 ± 0.84	—	—	—StarGAN-VC2	6.28 ± 0.09	3.45 ± 1.01	3.59 ± 0.87	—	—	—ClsVC	4.06 ± 0.11	4.09 ± 0.86	4.03 ± 0.82	4.81 ± 0.13	4.18 ± 0.73	3.75 ± 0.74As quoted in Table 1, in the traditional VC task, compared with other baseline models, our ClsVChas achieved the best results in both subjective and objective tests, which indicates that the speechproduced by our method is much better than baselines’. The results of VSS test show that comparedwith VQVC+, AutoVC, VAE and StarGAN-VC2, our method makes the converted speech learnbetter timbre information, which improves the conversion effect.
