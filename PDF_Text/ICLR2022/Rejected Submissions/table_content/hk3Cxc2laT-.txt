Table 1: Few-shot classification performance on MiXtUre-Of-DataSetS for (a) baseline comparisonand (b) ablation study. We sampled 1000 tasks for meta-testing. The results are reported in the formof mean accuracy (%) ± std over 8 trials. We also report the inference time (in milliseconds) pertask during meta-testing for the 5-way 1-shot scenario for baseline comparison.
Table 2: Prediction performance in MAE(lower the better) for 3 datasets. We re-port the mean MAE over 5 trials, where thestandard deviations are all less than 0.001.

Since in this case, task-aware methods do not haveadvantages over the global initialization methods, we see that all the baselines have comparableperformance as the original MAML. Nevertheless, the results show that though the task-aware mod-
