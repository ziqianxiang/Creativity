We test Molformer on a series of small molecule datasets, containing QM7 (Blum &Reymond, 2009), QM8 (Ramakrishnan et al., 2015), QM9 (Ramakrishnan et al., 2014), BBBP (Mar-tins et al., 2012), ClinTox (Gayvert et al., 2016), and BACE (Subramanian et al., 2016) 2. QM7 is asubset of GDB-13 and composed of 7K molecules with up to 5 heavy atom types. QM8 and QM9are subsets of GDB-17 with 22k molecules and 133K molecule respectively.
Table 2: The performance comparison. For regression tasks including QM7 and QM8, lower isbetter. For classification tasks including BBBP, ClinTox, and Bace, higher is better. The methods inpurple are pretrained methods.
Table 3: Comparison of MAE on QM9. The methods in orange are Transformer-based methods.
Table 4: Comparison of RMSD, Rp, and Rs on PDBbind.
Table 5: Effects of each module on QM7, QM8 and PDBbind (RMSD). ME stands for the trainablemotif embedding method.
