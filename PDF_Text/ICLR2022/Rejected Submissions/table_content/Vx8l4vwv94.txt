According to Table 2, TDE obtains almostsimilar scores for MaxSimC (39.22) and the AvgSimC (39.04) whereas, in STE-diff, MaxSimC gets31.56 and AvgSimC gets 33.28. Highlighted cells indicate better scores in the table obtained byTDE.

For this experiment, we use the 20Newsgrup dataset. The parameter setting for bothmodels base (STE-diff) and proposed (TDE) are the same as mentioned in section 4.2. Table 3exhibits overall PMI scores for different numbers of top words (T) under 20 topics. The highlightedcells in the table indicate higher coherence, as we obtained negative coherence scores so, the smalleris better.
