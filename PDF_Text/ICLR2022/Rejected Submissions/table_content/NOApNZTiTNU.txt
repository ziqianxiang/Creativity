Table 1: Sample efficiency comparison of SAC, TQC, REDQ and AQE. The numbers show theamount of data collected when the specified performance level is reached (roughly correspondingto 90% of SACâ€™s final performance). The last three columns show how many times AQE is moresample efficient than SAC, TQC and REDQ in reaching that performance level.
Table 2: Early-stage performance comparison of SAC, TQC, REDQ and AQE. The numbers showthe performance achieved when the specific amount of data is collected. On average, AQE performs2.9 times better than SAC, 1.6 times better than TQC and 1.1 times better than REDQ.
Table 3: Late-stage performance comparison of SAC, TQC, REDQ and AQE. The numbers showthe performance achieved when the specific amount of data is collected. The last three columnsshow the ratio of AQE performance compared to SAC, TQC and REDQ performance. On average,during late-stage training, AQE performs 1.26 times better than SAC, 1.06 times better than TQCand 1.22 times better than REDQ.
Table 4: Early-stage performance comparison of SAC, TQC, REDQ and AQE when AQE and TQCwhen using the same hyperparameters across the environments. On average, AQE performs 2.71times better than SAC, 1.59 times better than TQC and 1.02 times better than REDQ.
Table 5: Late-stage performance comparison of SAC, TQC, REDQ and AQE when AQE and TQCwhen using the same hyperparameters across the environments. On average, AQE performs 16%better than SAC, 9% better than TQC and 11% times better than REDQ.
