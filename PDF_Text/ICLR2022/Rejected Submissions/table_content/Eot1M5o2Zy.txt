Our complete set of databases which is described in table 2, consists of multiracial andmultiethnic individuals. In total, this data set includes 12,034 portrait images from persons of differentethnicities with individual social backgrounds. These images are labelled and annotated in surveysover a period of 8 years with a total number of 5.4 million annotations. Additionally, recently we addthe FairFaCe (Karkkainen & Joo, 2019) database, which includes male and female portraits of sevendifferent ethnic groups.

This will helpreduce human bias during human-computer interaction, but the economic cost of the training is alsohuge. If there is an artificial intelligence similar to our research that can better circumvent humanunconscious biases it would be a viable alternative.
