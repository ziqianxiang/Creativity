Table 1: Test Accuracy (%) for all the baselines and our proposed method, PARS, on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100with symmetric noise (noise ratio ranging 20% to 90%) and asymmetric noise (noise ratio 40%) on CIFAR-10.
Table 2: Test Accuracy (%) for all the baselines and our proposed method, PARS, on Clothing1M. The resultsabove the “DivideMix” row are taken from Li et al. (2020).
Table 3: Test Accuracy (%) for all the baselines and our proposed method, PARS, on CIFAR-10/100 datasetswith 50% and 90% symmetric noise with a subset of training labels. + denotes that methods are adapted toinclude unlabeled data while training. f denotes re-training With the open-source code.
