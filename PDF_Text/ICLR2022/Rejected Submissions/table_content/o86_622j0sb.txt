We utilize asalient object segmentation model to produce such saliency maps with no need for any informationother than the input image. Experiments show that SOTA black-box attacks equipped with seg-mentation priors can indeed achieve better imperceptibility performance. Furthermore, we devise anew gradient-free black-box Saliency attack that further enhances the imperceptibility via refiningin salient regions. The perturbations generated are much smaller, imperceptible and interpretable tosome extent. Finally, we also attack against some detection-based defense and the results show thatthe adversarial examples generated by our attack are harder to be detected.
