Table 1: Median purity, NMI, and RI on CalMS21 and Basketball compared to human-annotated labels (3runs). Experiment hyperparameters are included in the appendix.
Table 2: Median purity, NMI, and RI on CalMS21 of our algorithms with DSLs selected by three domainexperts compared to human-annotated labels (3 runs). DSL1 corresponds to Table 1.
Table 3: Median purity, NMI, and RI on CalMS21 and Basketball compared to human-annotated labels (3runs) for baseline with trajectory inputs only, and baseline with trajectory features added.
