Although Lord Henry, who is visiting with Basil, asksabout the young man’s identity, Basil declines to answer, noting his preference for secrecy. Basil never intends to exhibit the painting, because if he did, it would barethe deepest feelings in his soul. However, Basil lets slip that the subject of the portrait is Dorian Gray, who shortly thereafter pays the two men a house call. LordHenry immediately begins to influence Dorian, suggesting that he should treasure and guard his youth and beauty while he has them, because they will soon fade.
Table 13: Summary Samples for BookSum Book-Level19Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2022B Additional Experiment DetailsDue to the space limit, additional experiment details are reported here. As we discussed in the maintext, all of our models are initialized from BART Large with 12 layers (Lewis et al., 2020). In thebottom-up inference module (the left panel in Figure 1), the local self-attention in our models has8 layers and all parameters are initialized from the first 8 layers of BART (including parametersfor layer normalization). We use 4 layers for top-down inference (the middle panel in Figure 1).
