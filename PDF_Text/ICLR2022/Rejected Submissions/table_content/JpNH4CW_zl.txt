Table 2: Dataset specifications.
Table 3: Benchmark on METR-LA and PEMS-BAY datasets. Mean Absolute Error (MAE), RootMean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) are reported for differenttime horizons {15, 30, 60} minutes. Results have been averaged over 5 runs.
Table 4: Forward time in secondsfor different methods.
Table 5: Benchmark on Solar-Energy, Traffic, Electricity and Exchange-Rate. Root Relative SquaredError (RSE) and Empirical Correlation Coefficient (CORR) are reported for different horizons {3, 6,12, 24}. All results have been averaged over 5 runs. #Top2 column counts how many metrics in eachrow are in the top 2 (i.e. bold).
