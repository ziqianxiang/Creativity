Table 1: Determining the value of λ and μ in Eq.4λ	0.1	0.3	0.5	0.7	0.9μ	0.9	0.7	0.5	0.3	0.1PairSSIM	0.660	0.676	0.671	0.689	0.681A.3 The details of SSIMSSIM is an evaluation index to measure the similarity of two images, the calculation formula is asfollows:SSIM =(2μx μy + c1 )(2σxy + c2 )(μX + μy + ci )(σX + σ2 + c2)(10)Where X and y are two images, μx is the mean of x, μy is the mean of y, σ2 is the variance of x, σjis the variance of y, σxy is the covariance ofx and y, c1 = (k1L)2, c2 = (k2L)2, is a constant usedto maintain stability. L is the dynamic range of pixel values. k1=0.01, k2=0.03.
