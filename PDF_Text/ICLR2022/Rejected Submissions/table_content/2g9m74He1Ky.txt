One of the reasons might relate to the size of the representation. Although there might besome information that can contribute to the prediction, using all three sequences tripling the dimensionof the input and let the noise offset the potential benefit. Besides, we can find out that the varianceresults are high for all three datasets, which agree with the assumption that the quality of the learntrepresentation regarding the mobility forecasting task is sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters.
