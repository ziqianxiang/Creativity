Table 1: AUC - AUClb (1). The observed AUC is lower bounded by the predicted AUC. Thedifference between the two is always â‰¥ 0. This represents the average tightness of the lower bound.
Table 2: Observed AUC and (Predicted AUC). The observed AUC is lower bounded by the pre-dicted AUC and so the observed AUC should always be higher than the predicted AUC. The AUCvalues are normalized between 0 and 1.
