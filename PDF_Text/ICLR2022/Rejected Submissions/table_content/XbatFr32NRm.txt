Table 3: The loss and accuracy of the trained models. The “modified” 8-class age classificationmodels are the ones that were initially trained for the 101-class age classification task, but thenrepurposed to 8-class classification. Random initialization is done with Kaiming He uniform randominitialization (He et al., 2015). We ran five-fold cross validation five times. The reported numbersare the averages of the 25 runs. Early stopping was done to save training time. That’s why sometrainings lasted longer epochs than the others.
