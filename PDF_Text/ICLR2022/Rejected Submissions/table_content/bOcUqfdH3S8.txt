Table 1: Performance comparison ours and several other alternatives on time series datasets andregression benchmarks. Our method (ours) achieves far better ECE than other methods. For pinballloss our method is on-par or better than baselines. The original prediction (orig.) is sharp, but theprediction is incorrect (the calibration and pinball loss are poor), hence sharpness is not meaningful.
