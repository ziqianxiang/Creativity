Table 1: The summary of our theoretical results on the desirability of equilibria of different PVGformulations. The “ordering" column illustrates in which order the prover and verifier pick theirstrategies (weights) and the problem instance (the input and labels) are revealed. The “necessity" and“sufficiency" columns show whether having converged to an equilibrium is necessary and/or sufficientfor having discovered and complete and sound proof-verification protocol. The “failure mode"column describe in what way some of the setups lead to undesirable equilibria. The “convergence"column specifies if gradient descent converges to the eqilibrium on the Binary Erasure Channel Task.
Table 2: (Precision and Recall on Binary Erasure Channel Task:) We froze the verifier networksobtained via. Prover-Verifier Training and collaborative training and evaluated their precision andrecall against both an optimized prover and directly optimized messages. The PVG-trained verifierachieved perfect specificity, whereas the collaborative-trained verifier achieved exactly 0 specificity.
Table 3: (Precision and Recall on Find-The-Plus Task:) We froze the verifier networks obtainedvia Prover-Verifier Training and collaborative training and evaluated their specificity and recall againstboth an optimized prover and directly optimized prover messages. The PVG-trained verifier achievednear-perfect specificity against the optimized prover and optimized messages. The specificity of thebaseline was zero in all cases.
