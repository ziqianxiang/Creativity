Table 1: Complexity of various frameworks based on high-level metrics.
Table 2: Compile times in CPU minutes across frameworks.
Table 3: Performance on common state-of-the-art models across frameworks. Values are the numberof seconds needed to perform 100 iterations of the forward and backwards passes, with data loading(unless indicated). Number of parameters in millions (#param) and batch size (bsz) are specified.
