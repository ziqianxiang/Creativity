Table 1: Description of models compared. For details, see Appendix AFigure 2: Performance of trained networks: supervised models in A, left (classification accuracyfor the task model; r2 values for the reward and orientation models) and unsupervised models in A,right (mean squared error for image reconstructions for the standard and variational autoencodersare shown; binary accuracy for the contrastive predictive coding model.) Each point represents oneof three random instantiations. Chance for task classification is .25 and for CPC is .5. For SupOri,r2 is averaged over all three dimensions. Performance for the SupAll networks is shown in black foreach task. Example reconstructions from the two types of autoencoders are shown in B.
