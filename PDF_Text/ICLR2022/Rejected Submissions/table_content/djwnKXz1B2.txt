DenoteK as number of clients in the UFL system, and the private dataset in the party k ∈ {1...K} asXk. We have K clients with their private datasets Xk = {x∣x 〜Pk (x)} drawn from non-identicaldistributions, i.e., pk (x) 6= pk0 (x) for all k 6= k0. The UFL target is to optimize the model withprivate data distributed on different clients:Kmin F (w) , XvkFk(w),	(41)wk=1
