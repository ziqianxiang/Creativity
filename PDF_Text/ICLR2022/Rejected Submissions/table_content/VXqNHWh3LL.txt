Table 1: Accuracy (2AFC) & shift-tolerance(rrf) of various metrics on the BAPPS valida-tion dataset. 2AFC is computed on the BAPPSdataset resized 64 × 64 while rrf scores are ob-tained from its shifted version of size 64 × 61.
Table 2: Accuracy (2AFC) & shift-tolerance(rrf ) across various metrics on the BAPPS vali-dation dataset. 2AFC is computed on the BAPPSdataset of original size 256 × 256 while rrf is ob-tained from its shifted version of size 256 × 253.

However, F-Conv, also designed to reduce the boundary is-sue, does not help. While the learned BlurPool (Zou et al., 2020) also helps, it is not as effective asthe original version for our task of making a robust similarity metric.
