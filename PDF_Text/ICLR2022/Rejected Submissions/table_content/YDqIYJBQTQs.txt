Table 1: Segmentation performance of the unsupervised motionsegmentation (Keuper et al., 2015) for different optical flow estimators.
Table 2: Comparison of the reconstructions from the object model With the ground truth unoccluded objects.
Table 3: Default hyperparameters used for the object model.
Table 4: Quantitative evaluation of the SPACE object model trained end-to-end within SPACE and pretrainedbased on motion segmentations using the same loss as our object model. The pretrained SPACE object modeland ours use the cutout augmentation. The metrics are the same as in Tab. 2.
Table 5: Comparison of the reconstructions from the object model based on the GENESIS-v2 componentdecoder with our original object model using the same metrics as in Tab. 2. Both models are trained usingcutout augmentation.
