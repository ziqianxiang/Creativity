Table 1: Statistics of sequences and GO terms in CAFA34.2	Performance on the CAFA3Experimental settings We constructed each GO domain's model since each domain (MFO, BPO,CCO) had a different number of GO terms. Sequence and GO term's hidden dimensions d wereeach GO graph's maximum depth, which was 41 dimensions of MFO, 80 dimensions of BPO, and54 dimensions of CCO. Although the maximum depth of BPO was 155 since there were only 42GO terms with a depth of 80 or more, we used a maximum depth of BPO to 80 for efficient trainingtime.
