Table 1: Plausibility metrics for PGD attack (a) Withoutderivative term, (b) With the derivative loss term, and (c)With a Gaussian kernel (Han et al., 2020). The smallerthe cross correlation η and the Euclidian distance `2-norm, and the higher the cosine similarity γ, the morenatural the generated attack.
