Table 3: Ablation study results (in %) for link prediction.
Table 4: Descriptive statistics of the real graph datasets. |V | and |E | are the numbers of nodes andedges, respectively, CC is the clustering coefficient (Fagiolo, 2007), domuatx and dimnax are the maximalin-degree and out-degree of all nodes, respectively, davg is the average degree of all nodes (averagein-degree equals to average out-degree), ED = in=1 jn=1 Aij /(n(n - 1)) is the edge density, andRR= Pin=1Pjn=1Aijaji/Pin=1Pjn=1Aij is the reciprocal rate.
Table 5: Descriptive statistics of the real-world undirected graph datasets. |V | and |E | are the numbersof nodes and edges, respectively, CC is the clustering coefficient, dmax is the maximal node degrees,davg is the average degree of all nodes, ED is the edge density, defined as ED = 2|E |/(|V |(|V | - 1)),and FD is the dimension of attribute features (0 denotes no features available).
