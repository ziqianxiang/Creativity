Table 1: Details of the architecture of the deep learning mod-els for different datasets. In the model we only used fullyconnected (FC) and dropout layers.
Table 2: Two confusion metrics computed from layer 1 for MNIST dataset. Each matrix representsthe number of unique neurons for pairwise classes. Darker red color represents a higher value.
Table 3: Number of nodes in different communities of the activation pattern graph (detected byGephi). For each dataset, the communities of G(1) and G(20) are shown along with the PCC betweenthe average node per community and training accuracy. Darker red color represents higher value.
Table 4: Spearman and Pearson correlation coefficient between modularity and training accuracy fordifferent layers. Darker blue represents higher values and darker red represents lower values.
