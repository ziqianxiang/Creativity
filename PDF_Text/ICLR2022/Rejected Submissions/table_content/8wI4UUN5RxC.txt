Table 1: Summary of models considered.
Table 2: The model of interest is the realizable tanh-network with H hidden units and true weightwo = 0. The prior on the model parameters is taken to be 夕(W) = N(μ(夕)，σ2(夕)Id). For variouscombinations of values of H and values for (μ(夕)，σ2(夕))，we display the average and standarddeviation of Ψ(q, g) achieved after training on a dataset of size n = 5000 over 10 Monte Carloiterations.
Table 3: The model of interest is the realizable tanh-network with H hidden units and true weightwo = 5. The prior on the model parameters is taken to be 夕(W) = N(μ(夕)，σ2(夕)Id). For variouscombinations of values of H and values for (μ(夕)，σ2(夕))，we display the average and standarddeviation of Ψ(q, g) achieved after training on a dataset of size n = 5000 over 10 Monte Carloiterations.
Table 4: The model of interest is the realizable reduced rank regression model with H hidden unitsand true weight w0 = (A0 , B0) where A0 and B0 are as described in Section 7. The prior on themodel parameters is taken to be 夕(W) = N(μ(夕)，σ2(夕)Id). For various combinations of values ofH and values for (μ(夕)，σ2(夕))，we display the average and standard deviation of Ψ(q, g) achievedafter training on a dataset of size n = 5000 over 10 Monte Carlo iterations.
