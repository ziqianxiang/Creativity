Table 1: A comparison of WFN against other quantisation and weight clustering ap-proaches. The WFN pipeline is able to achieve higher compression ratios than the workscompared whilst matching or improving upon baseline accuracies.
Table 2: A full metric comparison of WFN Vs. APoT. For readiblity Rep(N0) is given relative tobaseline. Note, APoT did not release the ResNet-50 model save which is why it is not comparedhere.
Table 3: Full set of hyper-parameters explored for each model-dataset combination.
Table 4: A full metric comparison of WFN Vs. APoT. We compare the unique parameter count andentropy of all parameters in the full network, as well as the same measures but not including thebatch-norm layers (No BN) and the parameters not including the batch-norm and first and last layers(No BN-FL).
