For example, ourmeta-dropout can be implemented by using normal dropout or dropblock. When using the Meta R-CNN framework, we apply meta-dropout on group 4 of the backbone, while meta-dropout is appliedon the last convolution layer of TFA. The experimental results are shown in Table. 9. In general,using dropblock to implement our meta-dropout can get higher accuracy in novel classes.
