Table 1: Test set CRPS comparison (lower is better) of models from V-RNN, GP Copula, TCNF,and our model variants LatTe with Real-NVP, LatTe with-MAF. The mean and standard errors areobtained by re-running each method three times with random initializations. Best performance ishighlighted in bold.
Table 2: We present the mean and standard errors obtained by Deep-VAR, GP Copula, TCNF, andour model variants LatTe with Real-NVP. The evaluation criterion is the Test set Normalized MeanSquare Error (NMSE) comparison (lower is better). Best performance for each column is highlightedin bold.
