Table 1: Model likelihoods L on TIMIT representedas a 16bit μ-law encoded PCM for different stochasticlatent variable models compared to deterministic au-toregressive baselines. For the CW-VAE, s refers to s1and the multi-layered models have c = 8. Likelihoodsare given in units of bits per frame (bpf).
Table 2: Model likelihoods L on LibriSPeech test sets represented as 16bit μ-law encoded PCM.
Table 3: Model likelihoods on TIMIT represented as a 16bit μ-law encoded PCM, obtained bydifferent latent variable models and compared to autoregressive baselines all using a discretizedmixture of logistics with 10 components as output distribution. Likelihoods are given in units of bitsper frame (bpf) and obtained by normalizing the total likelihood of each sequence with the individualsequence length and then averaging over the dataset.
Table 4: Model likelihoods on TIMIT represented as globally normalized 16bit linear PCM. Like-lihoods are given in units of nats and obtained by summing over the likelihood all examples in thedataset and dividing by the sum of all their sequence lengths. In the table, Normal refers to using aGaussian likelihood and GMM refers to using a Gaussian Mixture Model likelihood with 20 com-Ponents. Models with asterisks * are our implementations while remaining results are as reported inthe referenced work.
