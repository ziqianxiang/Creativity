The DCI-d metric corresponds tothe DCI-disentanglement score and DCI-c to the completeness score (Eastwood and Williams, 2018),IRS is a similar disentanglement metric (Suter et al., 2018b), the MIG is the Mutual InformationGap (Chen et al., 2018), the SAP score is the Separated Attribute Predictability score (Kumar et al.,2017), and ModExp refers to the Modularity Explicitness score (Ridgeway and Mozer, 2018).

Each row shows the generated imagewhen varying the corresponding latent dimension while fixing the rest of the latent vector. For theSAE and VLAE models, the groups of dimensions that are fed into the same Str-Tfm layer (or ladderrung) are grouped together. Note the disentangled segments achieved by the SAE models and theconsistent ordering of factors of variation.
