Table 1: Classification accuracy of general few-shot classification on mini-ImageNet.
Table 2: Classification accuracy of fine-grained few-shot classification on CUB.
Table 3: Cross-domain few-shot classification results. We train the model on the mini-ImageNetdomain and evaluate the trained model in other domains.
Table 4: The ablation study on mini-ImageNet, CUB, Cars, Places, and Plantae datasets. We trainthe model on the mini-ImageNet domain and evaluate the trained model on other domains.
