Table 1: Quantitative cross-dataset performance comparison between different architecture config-urations on the AFRL dataset. Models were trained using only the synthetic dataset. Values shownare (mean ± standard deviation).
Table 2: Quantitative performance comparison between different architecture configurations. Valuesshown are (mean ± standard deviation).
Table 3: Quantitative cross-dataset performance comparison between different architecture config-urations in two separate external datasets: UBFC (Bobbia et al., 2019) and PURE (Stricker et al.,2014). Models were trained only on the synthetic dataset. Descriptions of the FD-optimized andSD-optimized models can be found in Table 1. Values shown are (mean ± standard deviation).
