Table 1: Summary of the state-of-the-art complexity results for finding an ε-stationary point, i.e., such apoint X that E [kVf (X)∣∣2] ≤ ε2, for generally non-convex functions and an ε-solution, i.e., such a pointX that E [f (X) — f (x*)] ≤ ε, for functions satisfying P匕-COnditiOn using error-feedback type methods. By(computation) complexity we mean the average number of (stochastic) first-order oracle calls needed to find anε-stationary point ("Compl. (NC)”)or ε-solution ("Compl. (P匕)").Removing the terms colored in blue from thecomplexity bounds shown in the table, one can get communication complexity bounds, i.e., the total numberof communication rounds needed to find an ε-stationary point ("Compl. (NC)”) or ε-solution ("Compl.(P匕)”).
Table 2: Description of the methods developed and analyzed in the paper. For the ease of comparison, we alsoprovide a description of EF21. In all methods only compressed vectors cit are transmitted from workers to themaster and the master broadcasts non-compressed iterates xt+1 (except EF21-BC, where the master broadcastscompressed vector bt+1). Initialization of gi0, i = 1, . . . , n can be arbitrary (possibly randomized). One possiblechoice is g0 = C(Vfi(x0)). The pseudocodes for each method are given in the appendix.
