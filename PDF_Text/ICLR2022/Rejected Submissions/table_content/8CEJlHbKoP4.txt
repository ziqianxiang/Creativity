Given aset of observations by an object detection model with unknown performance, METAGEN performedjoint inference over a metacognitive representation of the system and over the objects causing thedetections. We tested METAGEN using a variety of modern object detection models, and foundthat METAGEN can quickly learn an accurate metacognition and use it to correct errors from theclassification system, improving the system’s overall accuracy.
