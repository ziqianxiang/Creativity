Table 1: Comparison of the studies on the escape problem. B is batch size, η is a learning rate,r is a radius of the region around a minimum, H is a Hesse matrix of loss functions at a minima,and λ = λmin(H). Further, H0 is a Hesse matrix on one of the neighboring points of the mini-mum and λ0 is one of its eigenvalues of H0 . ∆L is a difference of training loss values within aneighborhood of minimum, α ∈ (0, 2] is an index of heavy-tailedness of gradient noise in SGD, andδ ∈ (0, 1) and s ∈ (0, 1) are values that implicitly include various factors of the escaping problem.
