Table 1: Pearson correlation coefficient between the spurious feature Z and the label Y for eachtask. The validation environment Eval follows the same distribution as E1train. We study the transferproblem between different task pairs. For the source task S, the model can access E1train(S), E2train(S)and Eval(S). For the target task T, the model can access E1train (T) and Eval(T).
Table 2: Target task accuracy of different methods. All methods are tuned based on a held-outvalidation set that follows from the same distribution as the target training data. Bottom right:standard deviation across 5 runs. Upper right: source task testing performance (if applicable).
Table 3: Worst-group and average-group accuracy on CelebA. The source task is to predictEyeglasses and the target task is to predict BlondHair. We use the attribute Young to definetwo environments: E1 = {Young = 0}, E2 = {Young = 1}. Both environments are available inthe source task. In the target task, we only have access to E1 during training and validation.. Weshow the results for the first 3 attributes (alphabetical order). The right-most Average* column iscomputed based on the performance across all 38 attributes. See Appendix F for full results.
