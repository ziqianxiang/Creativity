Table 1: Top-N accuracy (shown in percent) for each Task-λ on synthetic datasets generated withvarying amounts of randomness γ in the structure sequences. As expected, the model is able toperfectly predict even the most forward-looking task when the structure sequences are deterministic(γ = 0). Similarly, when the structure sequences are entirely random (γ = 1) the model is unable tomake any meaningful predictions.
