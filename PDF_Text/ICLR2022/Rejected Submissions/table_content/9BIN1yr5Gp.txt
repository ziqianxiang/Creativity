Table 1: Duality gaps for L-layer standard and parallel architectures. we compare our duality gapcharacterization with previous literature. Each check mark indicates whether a characterization ofthe duality gap exists for the corresponding architecture and the number next to it indicates whetherthe gap is zero or not.
