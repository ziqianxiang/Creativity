Table 1: CIFAR-10 image synthesis FID results (loWer is better). The ML column corresponds toGAN variants modified to fit the ML-CSC approach, as explained in the proposed method section,using the L0,âˆž method.
Table 2: IS results for conditional image synthesis of CIFAR-10 using BigGAN (higher is better).
