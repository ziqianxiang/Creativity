Table G.1: Comparison of performance of large capacity models on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, with andwithout principal component regularization. We observe that our proposed principal component regularizerconsistently yields accuracy improvements for large capacity models that contain the block structure. Theperformance gains are particularly significant in the case of CIFAR-100 and subsampled CIFAR-10 datasets.
