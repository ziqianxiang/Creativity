Table 1: Performance in the central (i.e. non-federated) setting on the Adult dataset. The fairnessmetric optimized is FNR parity. The tolerance for BMDM and MMDM is α = 0.02.
Table 2: Performance of a neural network on the Adult dataset when trained with FL. The fairnessmetric considered for BMDM-FL and FPFL is FNR parity and the tolerance is a = 0.02.
Table 3: Performance of a convolutional net-The second experiment tests whether FPFL canremedy the unfairness without decreasing ac-curacy too much. We trained the same con-volutional network, again for T = 2, 000 it-erations, and selected the model with the besttraining cohort accuracy that respected the fair-ness condition on the training cohort. When DPnoise is not included, FPFL reduces the accu-racy gap with FederatedSGD by around 9%while keeping the accuracy within 1%. We notehow, as before, clipping largely does not affectthe ability of FPFL to enforce fairness. How-ever, note that since the data is more non-i.i.d.
Table 4: Performance of a deep and a shallow network on the Adult dataset when trained withSGD and the MMDM algorithm. The fairness metric considered for MMDM is FNR parity and thetolerance is α = 0.02. Tran et al. (2021) without privacy, and with λmax = 0.05.
Table 5: Performance of a deep and a shallow network on the Adult dataset when trained withdifferent algorithms: FederatedSGD without privacy, with norm clipping, and with DP, denotedas FL, FL + Clip, and PFL respectively; and FPFL without privacy nor norm clipping, with normclipping only, and with DP, denoted as FFL, FFL + Clip, and FPFL respectively. The fairness metricconsidered for FPFL is FNR parity and the tolerance is α = 0.02.
