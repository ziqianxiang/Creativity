Table 3: Clustering separability results by the different clustering methodologies given input data with allavailable features (static, vital-signs, serum and haematological variables). For each metric and model, theaverage score and standard deviation are returned. The best values for each metric are indicated in bold.
Table 4: Outcome prediction scores across all models, displayed with an average and standard deviation of aset of 10 seeds (except NEWS2, which is deterministic). The best values for each metric are indicated in bold.
