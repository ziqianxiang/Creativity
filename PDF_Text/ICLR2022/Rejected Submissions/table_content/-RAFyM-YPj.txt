Table 2: Numerical results for counting induced triangles and non-induced 3-stars, following the setup of Chen et al. (2020). We report the test MSE divided by variance of the true counts of each substructure (lower is better). The best three models for each task are bolded.

First, we follow the experimental setup of Chen et al. (2020) on tasks forcounting substructures. In Table 2, we report results for learning induced subgraph count of trianglesand non-induced subgraph count of 3-stars. We test on two datasets of 5000 graphs each: one ofErdos-Renyi graphs and one of random regular graphs. Our RNP-GNN model is consistently withinthe best performing models for these counting tasks, thus validating our theoretical results. Based onthe baseline results taken from (Chen et al., 2020), RNP-GNN tends to widely outperform MPNNs(GCN (Kipf & Welling, 2017), GIN (Xu et al., 2019), GraphSAGE (Hamilton et al., 2017)), andother models not tailored for counting: spectral GNN (Chen et al., 2018), and 2-IGN (Maron et al.,

(2020). There are two datasets:one consisting of 5000 Erdos-Renyi graphs (Erdos et al., 1960) and one consisting of 5000 noisyrandom regular graphs (Steger & Wormald, 1999). Each ErdoS-Renyi graph has 10 nodes, and eachrandom regular graph has either 10, 15, 20, or 30 nodes. Also, n random edges are deleted fromeach random regular graph, where n is the number of nodes.
