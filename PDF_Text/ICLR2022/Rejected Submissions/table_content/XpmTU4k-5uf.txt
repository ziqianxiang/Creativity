Table 1:OOD performance. Mean scores AUROC ↑ / AUPR ↑ / FPR80 J over 5 random runs are reported.
Table 2: Effect of semantic content on OOD performance. In spoken digit classification, spoken digits fromdifferent datasets (high semantic overlap) as InD should result in AUROC ↑. Naively considering them to beOOD (dataset driven) should result in AUROC J Mean and standard deviation over 5 random runs. Best in bold.

Semantic means that e-MNIST classes with ambiguous semantic overlapon InD classes, i.e., {l,i,o,..} are removed from OOD evaluationMNIST	MSP	Predictive Entropy	KL_U	ODIN	Vanilla Mahalanobis	Test-Time Dropout	TIME-LAPSE (ours)0to9	0.895 / 0.968	0.899 / 0.971	0.903/0.972	0.896 / 0.969	0.903 / 0.973	0.963 / 0.973	0.961 / 0.9900to9 Semantic	0.921 / 0.970	0.926 / 0.973	0.928 / 0.975	0.922 / 0.971	0.937 / 0.976	0.976 / 0.970	0.986 / 0.995M235	0.907 / 0.982	0.910 / 0.983	0.909/0.983	0.906 / 0.982	0.919 / 0.985	0.976 / 0.986	0.975 / 0.996M235 Semantic	0.926 / 0.983	0.929 / 0.984	0.925 / 0.983	0.925 / 0.983	0.941 / 0.986	0.984 / 0.986	0.990 / 0.9985.3	Drift Detection: Sequential Evaluation ResultsTo evaluate the performance under our sequential framework, we define the detector to have erred ifit wrongly concludes an incoming test sample xt to be OOD when it is actually InD or vice-versa.

Table 8: Ablations showing the importance of individual scores on TIME-LAPSE. Semantic, Dataset, Allrefer to modes of evaluation. Semantic (audio) involves considering spoken digits from different datasets to beInD. Dataset (audio) involves considering spoken digitis from different datasets to be OOD. Semantic (MNIST)involves removal of e-MNIST classes that share ambiguous semantic overlap {o,l,i,z,y,s,q} with digits 0-9. All(MNIST) involves considering them as OOD along with other classes.
