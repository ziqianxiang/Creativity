Table 1: Defense performance against non-target (metattack) attacks.
Table 2: Classification performance for different settings of baselines and our proposed TGNN undermetattack attack on Cora dataset. Note that there are two settings, “No A”= 62.12 ± 1.55 and“KNN”= 71.94 ± 1.08, of which the results do not change with the perturbation rates.
Table 3: Dataset Statistics. Following Entezari et al. (2020); Zugner et al. (2018); Zugner &Gunnemann (2019b), statistics for the largest connected component are demonstrated.
