Table 1: Performance comparison of the different variants of our pre-trained networks on the Foldand Enzyme classification task. 1-NN makes predictions by searching the latent space for thenearest neighbor on the training data set, SVM indicates results of a support vector machine modeltrained on the learned protein representations, MLP presents the results of an MLP trained usingour representations, Fine-tuning indicates the performance of a fine-tuned protein encoder, and Nopre-train indicates the results of a protein encoder trained from scratch.
