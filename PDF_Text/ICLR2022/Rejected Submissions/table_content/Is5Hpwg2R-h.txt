Table 1: Performance comparison of our work (OTED-SAC) to existing RL algorithms on D4RLbenchmark. We report offline RL algorithm results from (Kostrikov et al., 2021). OTED-SAC is ableto recover a near-expert policy across almost all settings. For geom-friction, we achieve on-par orbetter than previous models. actuator-gainprm and gravity gives slightly lower performance thanlearning geom-friction. We see almost no performance drop when all parameters are trained jointly inmedium-level data.
Table 2: We ablate over different mechanisms for hyperparameter selection for the learned simulator.
