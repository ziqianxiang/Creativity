Table 1: Summary of complexity bounds for BTARD-SGD in different scenarios. By complexity we meanthe number of iterations sufficient to find such point b that E[kVf (b) ∣∣2] ≤ ε2 for non-convex problems andE[f (b) — f (x*)] ≤ ε for convex and μ-strongly convex problems (see Def. E.2) with x* being the solution.
Table 2: Summary of the complexity results for Parameter-Server (PS) based and distributed Byzantine-tolerantoptimization. By default, columns “Non-convex”, “Convex”, and “Strongly convex” contain the complexitybounds for L-Smooth non-convex, convex, and μ-strongly convex problems respectively. By complexity Wemean the number of iterations sufficient to find such point b that E[kVf (b) k2] ≤ ε2 for non-convex problemsand E[f (x) — f (x*)] ≤ ε for convex and μ-strongly convex problems (see Def. E.2) with x* being the solution.
