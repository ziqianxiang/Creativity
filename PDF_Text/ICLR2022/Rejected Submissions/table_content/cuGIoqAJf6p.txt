Table 1: Correlation comparison of supervised TMs against FT target accuracy. Larger correla-tions indicate better identifiability as quantified by TM. We compared our proposed Hα (f) againstoriginal H(f) and state-of-the-art measures.
Table 2: Correlation performance of TMs against relative accuracy for Large Balanced CIFAR-100data with different number of classes across target sets.
Table 3: Correlation performance of unsupervised TMs(see Section 4) in FT with/without DR in target task se-lection for ImageNet Models.
Table 4: Correlation of proposed Hα (f) without/with Random Projection (RP) for FT in SMS ofImageNet Models in small data regime constructed from CIFAR-100.
Table 5: Model identification (as measured by Top-3) by supervised/unsupervised measures for FTin SMS of ImageNet Models in small data regime.

Table S1: List of acronyms used in the paper.
Table S2:	Feature extraction layer in ImageNet models for nonlinear FT. The names are from pre-trained ImageNet models in Tensorflow Keras https://keras.io/api/applications/.
Table S3:	Spearman correlation comparison of supervised TMs. Larger correlations indicate betteridentifiability as quantified by TM. We compared our proposed Hα (f) against original H(f) andstate-of-the-art measures. For L-B regimes in the table we correlate against relative accuracy. Forother rows, we use vanilla accuracy.
