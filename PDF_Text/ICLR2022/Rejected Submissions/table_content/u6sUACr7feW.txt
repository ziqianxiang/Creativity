We ob-serve that using a large number of candidates results in more diverse samples although only a singleprosody item is selected at MAP inference. We also find that using a large number of candidates hasa regularization effect for training. Using a small number of candidates generates unstable speechsamples in terms of naturalness, in contrast, using a large number of candidates results in more stablespeech samples. 66 ConclusionIn this paper, we have proposed a novel prosody diversifying method based on conditional determi-nantal point processes (DPPs). To learn the kernel matrix of conditional DPPs, conditional deter-minantal point process (DPPs) is parameterized additional prosody diversifying module (PDM). Tobuild the kernel, Soft dynamic time warping is adopted to measure the extent of similarity betweentwo prosodic features, and the kernel of conditional DPPs is learned with conditional maximuminduced cardinality (MIC) objective. In the experiment, we demonstrated that our new prosodydiversifying method generates more dynamic samples than the baseline while maintaining the natu-ralness. In addition, we demonstrate that our model can be used in real-time applications by showingthe inference speed of our model.
