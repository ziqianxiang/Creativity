Table 1: Explicit Jacobian Regularization (EJR) enhances the test accuracy in various settings.
Table 2: Effectiveness of EJR. We report improvement (∆Acc.) and Error Reduction Rate (ERR)on CIFAR-10 when trained with EJR (+EJR), compared to the standard training (Baseline).
Table 3: Effectiveness of EJR.v2. We report improvement (∆Acc.) and Error Reduction Rate (ERR)on CIFAR-10 when trained with the second variant of EJR (+EJR.v2), compared to the standardtraining (Baseline).
