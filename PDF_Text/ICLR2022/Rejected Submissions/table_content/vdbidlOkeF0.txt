Table 3: Experiment configurations for Figure 7C Appendix1D density ratio estimation taskIn Section 5.1 we used KL-divergence as the evaluation metric to assess the accuracy of the densityratio estimation of each of the models, BC-DRE, TRE, F-DRE and sDRE. Since KL-divergenceonly evaluate the density ratio over samples from p, here we provide the plots of the log densityratio for all the models over a larger interval to better capture their behavior.

Table 5: Robustness evaluation for SDRE. Here R(a,b) stands for randomized mean vector where each dimen-sion is sampled uniformly from the interval (a, b). LM stands for the linear mixing construction scheme.
