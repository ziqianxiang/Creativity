Table 1: Forward Prediction performance measured in position error for a single-step prediction.
Table 2: Generalization results measured by the average distance to the goal position for differentnumber of objects and unseen object geometries in Top and Angled View images. Using a proba-bilistic graph representation significantly improves the generalization.
