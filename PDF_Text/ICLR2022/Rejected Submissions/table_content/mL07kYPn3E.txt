Table 1: Performance of state-of-the-art methods on Few-NERD (intra) and Few-NERD(inter). In this table, P is precision, R is recall and F refers to F1-score.
Table 2: Accuracies of Prototypes and Big Prototypes on FewRel 1.0 and FewRel 2.0 under 4 differ-ent settings. Separate blocks show the direct comparisons between prototypes and big prototypes.
Table 3: Accuracies with 95% confidence interval of big prototypes and baselines on miniImageNet4.4	AnalysisRadius Dynamics In this subsection, the mechanism of big prototypes will be empirically analyzed.
