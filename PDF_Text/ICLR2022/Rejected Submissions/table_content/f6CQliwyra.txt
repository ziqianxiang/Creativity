Table 1: Performance of SPEDE on various MuJoCo control tasks. All the results are averaged across 4random seeds and a window size of 10K. Results marked With * is directly adopted from MBBL (Wang et al.,2019). Our method achieves strong performance compared to pure empirical baselines (e.g., PETS). We alsocompare SPEDE-REG which regularizes the critic using the model dynamics loss with several model-free RLmethod. SPEDE-REG significantly improves the performance of the SoTA method SAC.
Table 2: Performance of SPEDE on various MuJoCo control suite tasks. Our method achievestrong performance even comparing to pure empirical baselines. To be specific, in hard tasks likeHUmanoid-ET and Ant-ET, SPEDE outperforms the baselines significantly. Results with * are di-rectly adopted from MBBL (Wang et al., 2019). We also provide the SoTA model-free RL methodSAC as a reference.
Table 3: Ablation Suty of SPEDE on MuJoCo tasks. We see that a small momentum factor helpstabilize the performance, especially in environments like Huamoid and Hopper-ET.
Table 4: Comparison of SPEDE with LC3 on MuJoCo tasks. LC3 only achieves good performanceon relatively easy tasks like Reacher. However, their performance on Hopper and Mountain-Car ismuch Worse than SPEDE._____________________________________________________	Reacher	MountainCar	HopperSPEDE	-7.2±1.1	50.3±1.1	732.2±263.9LC3	-4.1±1.6	27.3±8.1	-1016.5±607.4E.5 Performance CurvesWe provide an additional performance curve including ME-TRPO in Figure 2 for a reference.
