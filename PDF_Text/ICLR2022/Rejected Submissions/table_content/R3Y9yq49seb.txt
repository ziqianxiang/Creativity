Table 1: Validation results for semantic segmentation task using DeepLabV3plus with MobileNetV2as the backbone. Segmentation performance is measured by mean intersection over union (mIoU).
Table 2: Validation results on BTS, using ResNeXt50 as backbone encoder, measured by absoluterelative difference (AbsRel) and root mean squared error (RMSE), in both lower is better.
Table 3: In depth breakdown of MobilenetV2 (as a backbone for deeplabv3+) for a single Cityscapesâ€™image input. K and S refer to the size of the symmetric kernels and strides respectively. The firstconvolution of the network is omitted, since it is a common practice to avoid quantizing it.
