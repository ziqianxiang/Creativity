Table 1: (a) The given true Q values Qij(Ui1， Uj2 ∈ {0， 1， 2}). (b,c,d) Calculation results of the joint Q valuesQij with LVD or MVD under different greedy actions {Ui1* ， Uj2* }, where {Ui1* ， Uj2* } is marked with a pinkbackground. We denote the maximal joint Q values with numbers in bold. Due to the representation limitation,Qij 6= Qij. Instead, Qij overgeneralizes to Qij.
