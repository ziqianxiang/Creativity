Table 2: Ablation results(Accuracy in %) on CIFAR-10-SSLT, Imbalance factor 100 is used. Sam-pling methods are denoted as R for random, and C for class-balanced. The last two method namesshows where the embedding is trained.
Table 3: Pseudo label accuracy on unlabeled training subset. CIFAR-10-SSLT with imbalance ratio100 is used. Compared to testing set, the unsupervised subset is not balanced. In result, the overallaccuracy is higher than that on testing set, because of the domination of many-shot classes. Theresults in many/medium/few-shot splits are more useful.

In Stage 1, we assign pseudo labels for all samples inU . Table 3 reveals how the accuracy changes along loops in all splits. Few-shot split performanceimproves much faster than others. This proves the effectiveness of our alternate learning scheme,and explains why our method outperforms the baselines by a large margin in few-shot classes.
