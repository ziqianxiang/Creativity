Table 1: Attribution results associated with Figure 2. IG and BShap have baseline at (0, 0). SHAPvalues have a different sum because SHAP effectively uses the expectation across the whole inputspace as the baseline. The input distribution is assumed uniform for SHAP. Calculations are given insection A.1.3 of the supporting material.
Table 2: Comparison of attribution methods on the Local Minimum scenario. Each row correspondsto a component of the input vector. The first column shows the input vector. The second columnshows the nominal “scores” of the components contributing to the true class, normalised to maximumvalue 1, for comparison with attribution results. The remaining columns show attribution results,normalised to maximum value 1, from BShap, zero baseline Integrated Gradients, mean baseline Inte-grated Gradients, Expected Gradients, Additive Gaussian Noise and Integrated Certainty Gradients.
