Table 1: Our main results of certification accuracy on several datasets and multiple types of semantictransformations. - or 0.0% means the method fails to certify this type of semantic transformation.
Table 2: Results of ablation study on the influence of standard deviation of smoothing distributions,i.e. transformation noise σ1 and augmented noise σ2 for certification accuracy on rotational blur.
Table 3: Accuracy of our GSmooth under adaptive attacks (PGD using expectation over transforma-tions) on CIFAR-10 dataset.
Table 4: Empirical accuracy on subsets of CIFAR-10-C.
