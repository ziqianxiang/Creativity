Table 1: Known challenging cases from literature. When polynomial interpolation is used to com-pute higher order derivatives from noisy data, it is known that the quality of the library is going to bepoor - making it challenging to discover the underlying PDE by sparse regression. For both libraries∆ > 1 revealing the Lasso would not be able to recover the true support. *KS: Kuramoto-Sivashinsky.
Table 2: Success in recovering the ground truth PDE terms for table 1 cases. Here we reproducedthe results from Rudy et al. (2017), Maddu et al. (2019) (h stands for heuristic) and report an addi-tional results using the Lasso, adaptive Lasso and randomised adaptive Lasso. In case 1, PDE-FINDdoes find the correct terms, while it does not in case 2. In the latter, PDE-STRIDE and a randomisedadaptive Lasso do, see figure 5.
Table 3: Noise-to-sample ratios (Ψ) of successful PDE discoveries from state-of-the-art frame-works. In parenthesis, the sparsity estimator and the library size (p) are specified when applicable.
