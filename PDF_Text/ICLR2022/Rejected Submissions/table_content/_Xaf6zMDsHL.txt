Table 1: Comparison of MoCA with existing baselines using FID (lower is better) on CelebA dataset.
Table 2: Comparison of MoCA with WAE-MMD on CIFAR-10 dataset using FID (lower is better).
Table 3:	The optimal value of λ scales lin-early with input size. We consider λ between100 and 50000 and report the value λ? thatachieves the best FID score for each inputsize.
Table 4:	Smaller base momentum m0 causesmodel performance to degrade significantly.
Table 5: The effect of dictionary size K on the quality of samples measured using the FID score(lower is better). The performance is largely stable across different values of K unless K is too small.
