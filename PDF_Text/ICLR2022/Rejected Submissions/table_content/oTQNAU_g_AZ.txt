Table 1: Conflict rate (%), domination rate (%)and average finishing steps of our method andthe baseline with pure attention on different tasks.
Table 2: Conflict rate (%) of our method and theattention baseline on different tasks with CollisionPenalty. Lower value is better. Box: Open Boxand Place. Door: Push with Door.
Table 3: Success rate (%) on Stack Tower of different methods for each curriculum learning and adaptationstage. a → b means adapting the policy trained on a objects to b objects. 2 towers means the agents need tostack two separate towers.
Table 4: Success rate (%) on Rearrange of different methods for each curriculum learning and adaptation stage.
Table 5: Adjust Bar task. DAIR improvesbaseline over domination rate and finish steps.
