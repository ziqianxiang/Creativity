Table 1: Operator learning on Darcy Flow.
Table 2: Operator-learning on Kolmogorov flow Re = 500. Each relative L2 test error is averagedover 300 instances, which is evaluated with resolution 128 × 128 × 65. Complete results of otherresolutions are reported in Table 4 in appendix.

Table 4: Each neural operator is trained with 4k data points additionally sampled free initial conditions.
Table 5: Reynolds number transfer learning. Each row is a test set of PDEs with correspondingReynolds number. Each column represents the operator ansatz we use as the starting point of test-timeoptimization. For example, column header ’100’ means the operator ansatz is trained over a setof PDEs with Reynolds number 100. The relative L2 errors is averaged over 40 instances of thecorresponding test set.
