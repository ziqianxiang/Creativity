Table 1: Comparison on line-of-code (LoC) between Kokoyi and PyTorch7	Related WorkCompilers for deep learning frameworks are generally divided into two categories: Tensorcompilers such as Halide (Ragan-Kelley et al., 2013), TVM (Chen et al., 2018) and Tensor Com-prehension (Vasilache et al., 2018) aims at generating efficient codes for tensor operation; Programtranslators like AutoGraph (Moldovan et al., 2018) and JAX (Bradbury et al., 2018) converts Pythoninto low-level IRs for more efficient execution. Kokoyi can leverage both of them: speeding upindividual tensor operator by plugging in functions produced by the tensor compilers; replacing thecode generation stage and the runtime with the program translatorâ€™s for faster overall execution.
