Table 1: Density evaluation in log scale averaged on the test set (the higher, the better). Best resultindicated using •, runner-ups ◦.
Table 2: Counterfactual perturbations for German credit dataset with attributes encoded in on a one-hot fashion. Attribute 10: Other debtors / guarantors — A10-1 : none, A10-2 : co-applicant, A103: guarantor, Attribute 14: Other installment plans — A14-1 : bank, A142 : stores, A14-3 : none,Attribute 15: Housing — A151 : rent, A15-2 : own, A15-3 : for free. A cell color “green” denotes anegative correlation that we expect from the counterfactual perturbation. A cell color “red” denotesa wrong correlation.
Table 3: Average computation time on the test set in seconds (the lower, the better). Best resultshown in bold.
Table 4: Success rate is measured by the ratio of counterfactual examples that yields the targetprediction class (the higher, the better). Note that success for CEM is measured by any predictionperturbation for its own fairness, i.e. the perturbed prediction does not need to be the specified targetclass.
