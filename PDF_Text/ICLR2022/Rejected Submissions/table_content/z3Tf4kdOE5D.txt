Due to the variants of studied tasks in prior works, we evaluate themost common task, i.e., CIFAR-10, for all backdoor attacks in the i.i.d setting. We use the defaultattack settings same as the original paper: one attacker for CAS and four attackers for DBA. Here,ASR is the backdoor attack success rate, and UL is the utility loss compared with none-attack FL.
