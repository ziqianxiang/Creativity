Table 1: Results of approximating the Pareto set by different methods on three MNIST benchmark datasets.
Table 2: Comparing different methods for domain generalization on PACS using ResNet-18. The values intable are the testing accuracy with its standard deviation. The bolded values are the best models with p-valueless than 0.1 based on match-pair t-test.
Table 3: Comparing the multitask performance of standard training using linear scalarization with equallyweighted losses and the targeted fine-tuning based on PNG.
Table 4: Ablation study based on Multi-Mnist dataset with different choice of α and γ.
Table 5: Comparing different algorithms for domain generalization using dataset PACS and two networkarchitectures.
