Table 1: Generalized infidelity (mean absolute error) of the outputs produced by the feature-basedexplanation methods to the black box models. We show mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM)for Iris and MEPS where 5-fold CV was performed. See Appendix I for more quantitative results.
Table 2: Infidelity and generalized infidelity (mean absolute error) of the outputs produced by thefeature-based explanation methods to the black box models. We show mean ± standard error of themean for Iris and MEPS where 5-fold CV was performed. Lower values are better.
Table 3: Fidelity and generalized fidelity (Pearson’s r) of the outputs produced by the feature-basedexplanation methods to the black box models. We show mean ± standard error of the mean for Irisand MEPS where 5-fold CV was performed. Higher values are better.
Table 4: Approximate runtimes (in seconds) for the Feature Based Explanation methods. If thereare multiple folds, the runtimes are summed over the folds. See text for descriptions of the computeconfigurations A, B, and C.
Table 5: Approximate runtimes (in seconds) for the Analogy Based Explanation methods to generate10 analogous pairs. If there are multiple folds, the runtimes are summed over the folds. See text fordescriptions of the compute configurations A, B, C.
