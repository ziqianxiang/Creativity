Table 1: Experimental results of our model compared with baseline models on ReClor and LogiQA dataset. Test-E and Test-H denote Test-Easy and Test-Hard respectively. The results in bold are the best performance except for the human performance. * indicates that the results are taken from Yu et al. (2020) and LiU et al. (2020). Results with f is taken from Wang et al. (2021).

Two for specialized logic reasoning ability testing:ReClor (Yu et al., 2020) and LogiQA (Liu et al., 2020) and one for logic reasoning in dialogues:MuTual (Cui et al., 2020).
Table 2: Experimental results of our model compared with baseline on MuTual dataset. * indicatesthat the results are taken from Cui et al. (2020). For fair comparison with our method, we alsoreport the multi-choice method (RoBERTa-MC) in addition to the default Individual scoring method(RoBERTa).
