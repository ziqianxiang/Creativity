Table 1: Computational considerations in choos-ing graph class. A check mark “，” means thatknown algorithms for the problem are guaranteedto find the optimal solution in polynomial time. Themark “-” denotes that these settings use the specificheuristic methods.
Table 2: Time complexity of SOP-CG and DCG. n is the number of agents and A = | Sin=1 Ai|. ForDCG, k is the number of iterations in max-sum.
Table 3: Training time (hoUrs) of SOP-CG and DCG. Environmental time cost denotes the total timetaken by the environment simUlator and the training of the adversaries.
