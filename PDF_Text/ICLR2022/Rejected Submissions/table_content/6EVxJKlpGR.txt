Table 1: Comparison of success rate percentages between EMIX and prior MARL methods onStarCraft II micromanagement scenarios. EMIX is comparable to or improves over QMIX agent. Incomparison to SMiRL-QMIX, EMIX demonstrates improved minimization of surprise. Results areaveraged over 5 random seeds.
Table 2: Hyperparameter values for EMIX agentsD.3 SELECTION & TUNING OF βOne can manually tune β using a fine-grained hyperparameter search. We tune β between 0.001 and1 in intervals of 0.01 with best performance observed at β = 0.01. However, we find two additionalmethods helpful for obtaining more accurate values. These are described as follows-Armijo’s Line Search: One can borrow from optimization theory and utilize Armijo’s line searchNocedal & Wright (2006) by setting a termination condition. The method starts with a constantvalue of β which is iteratively incremented/decremented until a termination criterion (example-∣∣VL(θ) k < e with e a constant) is reached. While line search is proven to converge towards globallyoptimal values, its O(n2) convergence may be computationally expensive that too in the MARLsetting. Thus, we turn to the more efficient automatic tuning.
