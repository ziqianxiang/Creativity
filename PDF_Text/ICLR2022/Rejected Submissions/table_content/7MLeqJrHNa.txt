Table 1: Testing error on all the 3 datasets using the initial model that was trained only on dataset1. This initial model did not perform well on datasets 2 and 3. Therefore, continual learning tech-niques need to be applied. Otherwise, the cable position inference wouldnâ€™t be accurate when theoperational conditions change.
Table 2: Mean-squared prediction error, in units ofsquared meter, on datasets 1 & 2 after the network wastrained for 2 iterations before dataset 3 was introduced.
Table 3: Mean-squared prediction error, in units of squared meter, ondatasets 1 , 2 & 3 after the network was trained for 3 iterations. Diskspace usage for each method is shown in the last column.
