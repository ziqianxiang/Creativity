Table 1: Growth of the number of edges due to boundaries in the graph. The table shows statisticsacross the training trajectories of non-cohesive particles in a standard setting in hopper and drumexperiments. For each trajectory the frame with maximum relative increase in the number of edgesdue to virtual particles ∣E∣∕∣E∣ has been selected as a representative frame. This is done since weare interested in the maximum effect additional virtual particles have on the memory requirements.
Table 2: Runtime comparison for one granular flow process consisting of 250.000 simulationtimesteps, which are 2500 BGNN predictions.
Table B.1: Usage of different normal vector information in hopper particle flow experiment. Thetable summarizes means (μ) and standard deviations (b) of the EMD for the different versions andshows the results of a paired Wilcoxon test.
Table C.1: Comparison of the proportion (mean μ and Std σ) of particles beyond the outlet of thehopperdomain	cohesive		non-cohesive		N	(T	N	Tin-distribution	0.34	0.09	0.89	0.03OOD	0.14	0.11	0.73	0.15The Mann-Whitney U test shows that the predicted proportion values are significantly lower for OODthan for in-distribution trajectories (P-ValUe < 1.4 * 1θ-4 for the cohesive material and P-ValUe ‹1.2 * 10-4 for the non-cohesive material). We remind the reader that this is expected due to the onaVerage reduced outlet size in OOD geometries. Furthermore, we compare the predicted proportionvalues of the cohesive and the non-cohesive model under the null hypothesis that the same or ahigher proportion of particles traverses the outlet for the case of cohesive trajectories compared tonon-cohesive trajectories. The applied Mann-Whitney U test yields a p-value < 1.70 * 10-06 for thealternate hypothesis that the proportion is lower for the cohesive model, which is also in agreementwith rational arguments (cohesive particles tend to clump together) and observations.
