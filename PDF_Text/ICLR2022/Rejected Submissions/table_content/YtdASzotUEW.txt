Table 1: ROC-AUC for different methods and dataset pairings. The datasets enclosed by doublelines represent the training and in-distribution test set, while the datasets listed beneath them areused as OOD. Each entry was run 5 times. The standard errors are quite small, with a median of0.0071. Entries within two standard errors of the max are bolded. We see that label smoothing almostalways improves the performance of our method and that the method is competitive across a varietyof datasets.
