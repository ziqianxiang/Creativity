NONE is the baseline BERTimplementation, whereas SORT corresponds to sorted batching, and GREEDY concatenates se-quences as they arrive until they exceed 512 tokens. Setting no limit resulted in a maximum packingdepth of 16. The number of packs describes the length of the new packed dataset. Efficiency isthe percentage of real tokens in the packed dataset. The packing factor describes the resulting po-tential speed-up compared to packing depth 1. With overhead, we denote the percentage decreasein throughput due to changes to the model to enable packing (such as the masking scheme intro-duced in Section 3.2.2). The realized speed-up is the combination of the speed-up due to packing(the packing factor) and the decrease in throughput due to the overhead. It is used to measure the
