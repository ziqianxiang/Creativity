Table 1: GMP configurations of Theorem 3.5 (left) and Remark 3.6 (right)Figure 4 illustrates that the average iterates of GDA, OGDA, and EG stabilize to points that are notNash equilibria. Note that since our method (see next subsection) converges locally, the averageiterate should converge locally to a Nash equilibrium.
