Table 1: rQdia is robust to batch size. At 1/4 the batch size, rQdia surpasses or matches baselinemodels in data-efficiency (100k) and asymptotic performance (500k) given by mean episode rewardaveraged over 20 seeds. It is reported that larger batch sizes of 512 were necessary to achieving theperformances of prior works (Yarats et al., 2021a), while DrQ+rQdia uses a batch size of only 128.
Table 2: DER + rQdia rQdia augmented to Data-Efficient Rainbow (DER) yields performance gainscompetitive with SOTA models in the 100k data-efficient Atari benchmark (mean per 10 randomseeds, scores pulled from rliable (Agarwal et al., 2021)). The most apples-to-apples comparisonis rQdia and DER, since we build on top of DER. rQdia is also orthogonal to the other reportedmethods, and could feasibly yield even more striking improvements augmented to those.
