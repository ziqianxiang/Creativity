Table 1: The generative FactorsWhile the training proceeds, weak labels are assigned to the batches as one-hot encoded vectorsfor each factor, which are computed by programming based on the knowledge of the factors. Weroughly define the labeling criteria to divide the factors (speed, direction, and curvature) into four(0.25 interval), four (45 degree interval), and three (straight, right, left) segments. For instance,given a trajectory with (speed = 0.1, direction = 40 degree, curvature angle = -10 degree), then thetrajectory is assigned with label values of one, two, and three for each factor.
