Table 1: Confusion matrix for the Haar wavelet regression experiment. Overall 98.5% of all sampleswhere classified correctly. Linear Haar-Wavelet regression works particularly well for the StyleGAN.
Table 2: CNN source identification results on the CelebA and LSUN bedroom datasets. We explorethe use of boundary-wavelet packets up to a wavelet degree of 5. We report the test set accuracy.
Table 3: Confusion matrix for our best performing CNN using db4-wavelet-packets on CelebA.
Table 4: CNN source identification results on the CelebA dataset with only 20 % of the original data.
Table 5: The CNN architectures we used in our experiments. We show the convolution and poolingkernel, as well as matrix sizes in brackets. As the packet representation generates additional channelswe are forced to adapt the CNN architecture. The parameter counts vary depending on the number ofclasses, but has have approximately 100k for all experiments.
