Table 1: Details of the datasets used in the experimental evaluations. #Sample is the number of datapoints, #Num is the number of numerical variables, and #Cat is the number of categorical variablesin a dataset.
Table 2: Experimental results based on (stratified) 5-fold cross-validation. We use the same foldsplitting strategy for every dataset. The cross-entropy measure (lower is better) is selected forclassification tasks and MSE measure (lower is better) is selected for regression problems respectively.
Table 3: A comparison of the training and inference runtime for selected models from differentcategories on the whole Zillow dataset (167,888 samples). The results related to the training, inferenceand preprocessing time are averages over five runs over the whole dataset for training and inferencetests. The data preprocessing step includes: data scalling, handling missing values.
