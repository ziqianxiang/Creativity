Table 1: Problem 6, α = 3. Median and IQR for the RMSE and loss over 10 independent runs withdifferent initial guesses for the weights of the networks.
Table 2: Problem 6, varying α, h = 50, H = 25, h = 54, Nh = 400, NH = 200, 5 layers. Medianand IQR for the RMSE error over 10 independent runs with different initial guesses for the weightsof the networks.
Table 3: Problem 7, α = 0.1. Median and IQR of the RMSE and loss over 10 independent runs withdifferent initial guesses for the weights of the networks. When numbers in parenthesis are reportedit means that not all the 10 runs were successful, i.e. that the achieved RMSE was larger than 1.
