Table 1: Ratio of the explanation top-20 valuesincluded in the segmentation mask of each object.
Table 2:	Average Gini Index for the explanations of a VGG-16 network (averaged over 1000 sam-ples). A larger Gini Index indicates more sparseness and hence a more concise explanation.
Table 3:	Average Infidelity for the explanations of a VGG-16 network (averaged over 100 samples).
Table 4: Gini Index for the explanations of a ResNet-18 network (averaged over 1000 images fromCIFAR-10). A larger Gini Index suggests a more concise explanation.
Table 5: Infidelity of the explanations of a ResNet-18 network (averaged over 1000 images fromCIFAR-10). A lower Infidelity value is better.
