Table 1: Results from Atari games: scores over total 32 seeds on 5 environments. Here MCTS(N = 50) is the oracle version and the best results among those versions except the oracle aremarked in bold. V-MCTS outperforms MCTS (N = 30) while requiring fewer search times.
Table 2: Ablation results of different expansion methods on Go 9 × 9 against GnuGo (level 10).
Table 3: Hyper-parameters of V-MCTS on Go 9 × 9 and Atari games12Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2022A.1.2 Training Details of GoThe detailed implementations of Atari games are discussed in EfficientZero (Ye et al., 2021). How-ever, it is nontrivial to adapt to board games. Here we give detailed instructions for training boardgames Go 9 × 9 in our implementations.
