Table 1: An overview of existing methods and their high-level properties. We develop the first provablycommunication-efficient (via communication compression) algorithms for solving distributed VIproblems.
Table 2: Summary of our iteration complexity results for finding an ε-solution for problem (3) inthe deterministic (i.e., (4)) and stochastic (i.e., (4)-(5)) setups. In the strongly convex - stronglyconvex case, convergence is measured by the distance to the solution. In the convex-concave case,convergence is measured in terms of the gap function. Notation: μ = sum of the coefficients μFand μh of strong monotonicity of the operator F and strong convexity of h, L = maximum of localLipschitz constants Lm , R = diameter (in Euclidean norm) of the optimization set, R0 = initialdistance to the solution, q = the variance parameter associated with an unbiased compressor (see (1));δ = the variance parameter associated with a contractive compressor (see (2)); M = the number ofparallel clients/nodes; r = the size of the local dataset (see (5)). To simplify the bounds, we assumethat compression occurs only on the nodes, and the server transmits full information, additionally, weassume that the expected density β of the compression operators satisfies q = 1∕β and δ = 1∕β (e.g.,this holds for Randk and Topk).
