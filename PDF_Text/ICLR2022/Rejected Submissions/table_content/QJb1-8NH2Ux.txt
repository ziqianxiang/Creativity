Table 1: For each detector defense, we compute a (best-effort) bound on the claimed robust riskwith detection Radv-det using Equation (4), and report the complement (the robust accuracy withdetection), 1 - Radv-det. For each detectorâ€™s robustness claim (at distance ), we report the state-of-the-art robust classification accuracy for attacks at distance /2, denoted 1 - Rad/v2 . Detectiondefense claims that imply a higher robust classification accuracy than the current state-of-the-art arehighlighted in red.
