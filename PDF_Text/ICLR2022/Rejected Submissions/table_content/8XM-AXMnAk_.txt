To betterunderstand the relation between MMD and B for multiple query setting, we measure the MMD/B23Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2022for R ≥ 2. As shown in Figure 7, B is much larger than MMD even multiple query rounds. Besides,we notice that, for the first round, the larger query batch always leads to larger MMD/B, because thesampling bias introduced by the query policy will be amplified by using large batch size.
