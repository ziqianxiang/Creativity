Table 1: Node classification accuracy. The first row is the mean of self-interaction probability.
Table 2: Datasets statistics.
Table 3: Spectral filters.
Table 4: Node classification accuracy of P-DEMUF and GPRGNN.
Table 5: Node classification accuracy of P-DEMUF and its ablation models. We fix the number ofband-pass filters as 2.
