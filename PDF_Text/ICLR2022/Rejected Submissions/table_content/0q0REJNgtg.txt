Table 1: BabyAI: Multi-task offline RL with a multi-task retrieval dataset. Mean success rate of retrieval-augmented recurrent DQN (RA-RDQN) as compared to a recurrent DQN (RDQN) baseline on the 40 BabyAI levels as function of the amount of training data. RA-RDQN isrun twice, once with only the current task being evaluated in the retrieval dataset and once with all tasks in the retrieval dataset. Results are theaverage of 3 random seeds with standard errors.
