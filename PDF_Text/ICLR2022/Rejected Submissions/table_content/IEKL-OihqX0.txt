Table 1: Results on 32-dimensional synthetic discrete data in terms of MMD. The lower the better.
Table 2: Comparison between ratio matching and our RMwGGIS on 2spirals datasets with differentdimensions in terms of running time and memory usage.
Table 3: Graph generation results interms of MMD. The lower the better.
Table 4: Comparison of training Ising models in terms ofRMSE and running time.
Table 5: Comparison of resulting objective values. The top two lowest values on each dataset arehighlighted as 1st and 2nd.
