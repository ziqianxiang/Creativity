Table 1: Comparisons on CIFAR-10 with parameter sizes, parameter reduction rates, and test error.
Table 2: Classification performances on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet datasets. Per-formance on state-of-the-art light CNN architectures are listed in the upper block. The middle blockshows the performance of plug-and-play methods with parameter sharing in CNNs. We present theresults of variants of ACDC in the bottom block. Performance obtained by our reproductions aremarked with *.
Table 3: Performance on ImageNet. Parameters,top-1 and top-5 errors are reported. Numbers ob-tained by our reproductions are marked with *.
Table 4: Comparisons of FLOPs and speed with different variants of ACDC with grouping.
Table A: Performance comparisons with different dropping regularizations.
Table B: Comparisons on speed against some recent efficient network structures.
Table C: Experiments with expanding network capacity.
