Explanations in that work are offered as simulated trajectories that are deemed important.
Table 2:	Faithfulness measures for size of local neighborhood. For Minipacman, measures aredistances of miniPacman Positions in strategic states when using different local aPProximations withvarying aPProximation size N , where N is the maximum number of stePs allowed for a state to beincluded. Distances are symmetric (hence use of -).
Table 3:	Consistency measures for perturbations of the initial state. For Minipacman, measures aredistances of minipacman positions in strategic states when using different initial states (comparing astrategic state from initial state to that of a perturbed initial state).
