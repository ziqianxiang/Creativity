Table 1: Metrics computed on predicted accuracies for the three benchmarks in NAS-Bench-201.
Table 2: Metrics computed on predicted accuracies obtained from the transfer learning. A randomforest model is trained on a source search space and evaluated on the target search space. The metricsare reported as mean Â± standard deviation aggregated over ten runs. The results from the first runcan be seen in Figure 6.
