Table 1: The symmetry and implementation for each domain. See Appendix E for the ρ definitions.
Table 2: Model Performance on 3D Blocks and Rush Hour.
Table 3: Model performance on Reacher (left) and 3D Teapot (right) environments. For the 3D Teapotmodels, None is the non-equivariant model, Matmul is the matrix multiplication model and Equiv isthe version using Tensor Field Networks. (S) denotes the small discrete action space with 6 rotationsof 230 in SO(3) and (L) denotes any rotation in SO(3).
Table 4: Generalization results for 2D Shapes trained using only the up action and evaluated on allactions. Due to the simplicity of the environment, a simple CNN turns out to be equivariant, so boththe baseline CNN and Ours/Full have an equivariant symmetric embedding network.
Table 5: Generalization results for 3D Blocks with limited actions. The training set only contains the					up, right and down actions; the evaluation set contains all four actions.
