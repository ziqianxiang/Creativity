Table 1: ML services used for each task. Price unit: USD/10,000 queries. A publicly available(and thus free) GitHub model is also used per task: a single shot detector (SSD) (SSD) pretrainedon Open Images V4 (Kuznetsova et al., 2020) for MIC, a convolutional recurrent neural network(PP-OCR) (Pad) pretrained on an industrial dataset (Du et al., 2020) for STR, and a convolutionalneural network (SPaCy (Spa)) pretrained on OntoNotes (WeisChedel et al., 2017) for NER.
Table 2: Cost savings achieved by FrugalMCT that reaches same accuracy as the best commercialAPI. On average the cost saving across the evaluated datasets is 73%.
