Table 2: Results on the Opportunity Drill dataset (HAR). Loc.: locomotion, Ges.(R): gesture of the rightarm, Obj.(R): object in the right arm, Ges.(B): gesture of both arms, Meanw : weighted mean value of thecorresponding metric.
Table 3: Results on the Sleep-EDF dataset for the task of sleep staging. W stands for the awake stage, REMstands for rapid eye movement stage, N1, N2 and N3 stand for the three stages of non-REM sleep, and Meanwstands for weighted mean value of the corresponding metric. The results of U-Time is directly taken from thebaseline reported in Perslev et al. (2019), which has two valid significant digits.
Table 4: Ablation study. Two major modules of Seg-Time (MSS-LSTM and 1D-encoder-decoder) are in-dependently tested. w/o: without.
