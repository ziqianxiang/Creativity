Table 1: The hyperparameters for the deep networks and the model predictive control. The deep networkparameters were identified using random search to obtain the parameters with the highest reward for eachsystem. Ablation studies comparing different network parameters did not show any coherent trend for allsystems. Therefore, these studies are omitted. The MPC parameters were optimized using random search usingthe ground-truth dynamics models.
Table 2: The obtained reward when transferring the model between tasks. The model is trained using the train-ing domain and then applied to the evaluation domain. The deterministic model exhibits a good performanceand obtains a comparable reward than the model trained on the test domain for most transfers. The stochasticmodel performs worse than the deterministic model when the model is transferred between tasks.
