Table 1: Semantic classes used for evaluations. The Ci class regroups all configurations where exactly i pairsof blocks are close. The Si class contains all configurations where exactly i blocks are piled up. The Pi classcontains all configurations where i blocks form a pyramid. The & is a logical AND. All unspecified predicatesare false, thus classes represent disjoint sets.

Table 3: The different semantic classes used in evaluation. The class Close i regroups all semantic configura-tions where i pairs of blocks are close.
