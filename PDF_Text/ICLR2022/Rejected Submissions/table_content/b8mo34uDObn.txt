Table 1: Examples of in-distribution and out-of-distribution inputs and outputs from the WebNLG,XSUM and OpenQA tasks, respectively. In WebNLG, the distribution shift is due to non-overlappingtopics; in XSUM, the distribution shift is due to non-overlapping news categories; in OpenQA thedistribution shift is due to different data collection processes.
Table 2: Performance of full finetuning, lightweight finetuning, our ensemble, and our cocktailfinetuning model, for prefix-tuning (first half) and for adapter-tuning (second half). Cells arehighlighted blue if they are statistically significantly better than lightweight finetuning (for IDcolumns) or full finetuning (for OOD columns) and red otherwise.
Table 3: Hyperparameters. d refers to the dimension of the adapter MLP’s middle layer, and l refersto the length of the prefix vector in prefix-tuning.
Table 4: The selected values of λ for the ensembles and cocktail experiments.
Table 5: Number of examples in each dataset.
