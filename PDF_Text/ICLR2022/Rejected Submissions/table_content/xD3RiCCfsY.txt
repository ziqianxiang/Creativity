Table 1: Objective score â†‘ and inference time (in seconds) [ comparison of the max covering Prob-lem, including mean and standard deviation. Under cardinality constraint k, the problem is to selectfrom m sets to cover a fraction ofn objects. Gurobi solver fails to return the optimal solution within24 hours, thus reported as out-of-time. Our GS-TopK outperforms all competing methods, withcomparable or smaller time costs. The performance is further improved by Homotopy GS-TopK.

The problem is to select k clusteringcenters from m data points. GS-TopK and Homotopy GS-TopK surpasses all competing methodswith less time compared to general-purpose solvers and other one-shot methods.
