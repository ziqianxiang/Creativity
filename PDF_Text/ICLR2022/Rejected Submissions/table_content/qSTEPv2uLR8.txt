Table 1: We present a comparison between our PICANN approach and OT-ICNN from Makkuvaet al. (2020) and W2Gen from Korotin et al. (2019). We present the L2-UVP for three experiments.
Table 2: Computational cost for 100 epochs in various dimensions.
Table 3: We present a comparison between our PICANN approach and Makkuva et al. (2020) andKorotin et al. (2019). In this table, we present the L2-UVP and the percentage error between thetheoretical W2 metric and the approximated W2 metric for three experiments. In all these experi-ments, the source density is the unit Gaussian. The target density in the case of the ”Random CvxFunction” experiment is the unit Gaussian deformed by the gradient of a random convex function.
