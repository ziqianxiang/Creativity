Table 1: Quantitative results on nocaps. The numbers before/after slashes denote scores derivedwithout/with Constrained Beam Search (CBS).
Table 2: Quantitative comparisons on caption fluency, fidelity and adequacy. Note that BLEU@4(B@4) and CIDEr (C) are utilize for describing fluency, object precision (P) for fidelity, object recall(R) for adequacy and object F1 scores (F1) for overall cross-modal association.
Table 3: Analyses on BERT, CLIP, and repetition penalty for NOC using nocaps validation set. Notethat BERT mainly benefits the linguistic fluency with improved CIDEr, and CLIP is desirable forpreserving visual semantics with increased SPICE.
Table 4: Analyses on BERT and CLIP for improving caption fluency, fidelity and adequacy. Notethat BERT benefits fluency metrics of BLEU@4 (B@4) and CIDEr (C), while CLIP focusing oncross-modal association boosts metrics of object precision (P), recall (R), and F1 scores (F1).
