Table 1: Top-1 test accuracies and total client→server communication of all baselines, DAdaQuant,DAdaQuanttime and DAdaQuantclients. Entry x ± y p× (q××) denotes an accuracy difference ofx%w.r.t. the uncompressed accuracy with a standard deviation of y%, a compression factor of p w.r.t.
Table 2: Statistics of the models and datasets used for evaluation. MLR stands for “MultinomialLogistic Regression”.
Table 3:	ExecUtion time measUrements for different stages of a FL training roUnd on FEMNISTwith DAdaQUant. Each entry contains the execUtion time in seconds and as a fraction of the normaltraining time.The total overhead of DAdaQUant, inclUding Federated QSGD, is ≈ 1%.
Table 4: Comparison of the compression factors of DAdaQuant, UVeQFed with R = 4 (defaultvalue used for our experiments in Table 1) and UVeQFed with R = 1 (maximizes UVeQFed’scompression factor). Entry p × (q ××) denotes a compression factor of p w.r.t. the uncompressedcommunication and a compression factor of q w.r.t. Federated QSGD.
