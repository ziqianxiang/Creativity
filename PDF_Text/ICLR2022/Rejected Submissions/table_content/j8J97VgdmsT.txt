Table 1: Quantitative results of Subject 1,2,3 and 4 on validation data. Our results are better thanNerfies (Park et al., 2021), NerFACE (Gafni et al., 2021) and FOMM (Siarohin et al., 2019) on mostmetrics across all subjects.
Table 2: Here we show a quantitative comparison between using the spatial ray prior and not. As canbe seen, using the spatial prior gives significantly better results, especially with respect to perceptualquality as measured by LPIPS.
