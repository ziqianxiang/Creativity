To improve the reliability of the attained nosological relation, we adopt the nearly identicalmodel configurations to implement our model in UTO and HuShoWa datasets, respectively. Re-garding the scarce sample sizes of two datasets, the complex cross validation procedure may notbe appropriate here. Therefore, in Figure 4 of the main text, the results were yielded from two fulldatasets.
