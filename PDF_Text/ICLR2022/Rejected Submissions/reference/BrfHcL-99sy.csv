 All the existing methods use the same choice ofdatasets or others with similar scales,1000, There are no existing defense methods evaluated on datasets ona scale of about or above 100000 nodes
 Poisoningattacks are train-time attacks that perturb the graph data before the training process of the victimmodels,2018, For reasons why the poisoning attack is more interesting and realistic in GNN
