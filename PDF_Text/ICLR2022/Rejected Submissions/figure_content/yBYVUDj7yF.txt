Figure 1: The vertical axes indicate the prediction risk. Left: Comparison of downstreak taskperformance between contrastive learning and autoencoders the dimension d. The sample size nis set as n = 20000. Center: Comparison of downstreak task performance between contrastivelearning and autoencoders the dimension n. The dimension d is set as d = 40. Right: Downstreamtask performance in transfer learning against penalty parameter Î± in log scale. T is the number ofsource tasks and r is the dimension of the representation function. We set the number of labeleddata and unlabeled data as m = 1000 and n = 1000 respectively.
