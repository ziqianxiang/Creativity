Figure 1: Cascade randomization of the VGG-16 (ImageNet) layers. The first column shows theoriginal explanation for the image ”Jay” bird. Each subsequent column shows the effect of random-ization of the parameters of the network up to that layer (inclusive) on the explanations.
Figure 2: Spearman rank correlation between the original and randomized explanation derived forrandomization up to the layer indicated by the x-axis. A higher rank correlation value indicates ahigher similarity, i.e, the higher the curve of an explanation method, the less sensitive it is to modelparameters. The results are averaged over 1000 Images from Imagenet and the shaded area aroundeach curve indicates the standard deviation.
Figure 3: An example of β-smoothing explana-tion generated for the target category ”dog” and”cat” (left), and the segmentation mask of eachobject from the COCO dataset (right).
Figure 4: Evaluation with cosd (left) and LPIPS metrics for attacks against post-hoc approaches.
Figure 5: An example of visual comparisons of explanation attacks against different methods. Undereach attack setting, the left column shows the perturbed image and the right column shows thecorresponding perturbed explanation.
Figure 6: Spearman rank correlation between the original and the randomized explanations (aver-aged over 1000 Images from CIFAR-10). A higher rank correlation value indicates a higher similar-ity, i.e, the higher the curve of an explanation method, the less sensitive it is to model parameters.
Figure 7: Evaluation with cosd (left) and LPIPS (right) metrics for the attacks against ad-hoc ap-proaches. For both cosd and LPIPS, smaller values indicate higher similarity. All results are aver-aged over 1024 images from CIFAR-10. The back bars indicate standard deviation.
