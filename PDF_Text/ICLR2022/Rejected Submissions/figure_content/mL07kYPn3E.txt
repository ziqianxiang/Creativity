Figure 1: The illustration of our proposed big prototypes, where the data is sampled in 5-shot. Thestar symbol denotes the center of the hypershpere, the solid triangle denotes the sampled examplesand the dotted triangle denotes other examples in the whole dataset. The green solid line denotesthe distance from a data embedding to the surface of the hypersphere. The left part illustrates theinitialization stage, where the center and radius are estimated by the sampled data, and the the rightpart illustrates the learning stage, where the center and radius are simultaneously optimized. Wecan see that the location of the center and the value of the radius may change during the learningprocess.
Figure 2:	The illustration depicts the radius change according to the degree of sparsity of the sampledepisode. Each subfigure represents a selected anchor class in the FewRel dataset.
Figure 3:	t-sne visualization of feature distributions. (a) illustrates the representations of seen data(in training data) before training; (b) illustrates the representations of seen data (in training data)produced by our network; (c) illustrates novel data (in test data) before training; (d) illustrates noveldata (in test data) produced by our network after training. Note that even after training, the neuralnetwork has never seen the novel data and their classes.
