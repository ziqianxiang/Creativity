Figure 1: The Multi-Distribution Learning framework evaluates how training with a data distribu-tion helps with test performance on that distribution. The framework tests the limits of how manydistributions we can learn with a single model.
Figure 2: This table shows the performance difference by taking the proposed gradient update onthe y-axis on the test distributions on the x-axis. In this index: Rotate = 0, Translate = 1, Crop = 2,Cutout = 3, Bright = 4, Dark = 5, Gamma Contrast = 6, LR Flip = 7, UD Flip = 8, and Jigsaw = 9.
Figure 3: A Side-by-Side view of the impact of repeating data for Lookahead update analysis. Pleasesee the caption of Figure 2 for more details on the x and y axes and the distribution indexing from 0to 9.
