Figure 1: (a): Trade-off between effective sample size and value estimates. (b): Action countsheatmap in high-SOFA initial contexts of the policy learned.
Figure 3: The process of hyper-parameters search and test in the experiment.
Figure 4: (a): Action counts heatmap in mid-SOFA contexts of the policy learned from differentalgorithms. (b): Action counts heatmap in low-SOFA contexts of the policy learned from differentalgorithms.
