Figure 1: Depiction of a proof-verification protocol learned via Prover-Verifier Training. Whentrained on the task of detecting whether there’s a blue plus pattern (1a) in the input image, Prover-Verifier Training discovers a coordinate-based verification protocol. If there’s a plus in the image(1b), the prover sends its coordinate, and the verifier accepts this certificate. If there’s not a plus inthe image (1c), then the prover sends the coordinates of a maximally convincing image patch, but theverifier rejects this certificate.
Figure 2: BEC training dynamics: The evolutionof the logits, per input-output pair, of the prover (top)and verifier (middle), accompanied by the accuracyof the verifier (bottom). The verifier quickly picks thecorrect verification protocol, which drives the wholesystem into the desired equilibrium.
Figure 3: FindThePlus Verifier Architecture: A schematic diagram of a single head of the SpatialTransformer Network-like verifier architecture we used in out FindThePlus experiments.
Figure 4: Visualizing Verifier’s Gaze: We visualized where each of the verifier’s 4 Spatial Trans-former heads learn to look at. The top row displays the inputs. The left three inputs contain a blue plusin them (what the prover is defending). Each subsequent row corresponds to a different verifier head.
