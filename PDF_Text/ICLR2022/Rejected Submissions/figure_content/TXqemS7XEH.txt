Figure 1: A demonstration of the Pseudo-to-Real training paradigm. It first shares parameters acrosslayers at the Pseudo stage, and then delinks the parameters at the Real stage.
Figure 2: Comparison of pretraining language mod-eling loss of M6-1B P2R and Real on time-basis.
Figure 3: A demonstration of Granular CPU Offloading mechanism.
Figure 4: The log perplexity of M6-10T Pesudo-to-Real (P2R) compared with baselines on time-basis and sample-basis, respectively. (a) Compared with M6-10T Real on time-basis, M6-10T P2Rconverges much faster due to the significant reduction of time-cost on offloading in the Pseudo stage.
