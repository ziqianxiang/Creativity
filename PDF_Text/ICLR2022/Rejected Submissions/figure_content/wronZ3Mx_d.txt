Figure 2: Aggregated comparisons of normalized regret and mean ranks across all search spaces forthe non-transfer learning HPO methods on HPO-B-v3Afterwards, we demonstrate the comparison of state-of-the-art transfer against our method in Fig-ure 3. DKLM outperforms the rest of the baselines with lower mean normalized regret and lowermean rank. The superiority of landmark meta-features also becomes evident after a larger numberof trials (more than 50) .

We notice primarily that meta-learning the initializationin DKLM improves the general performance in most cases. Nevertheless, we notice in 4796 thateffect of transfer learning is not evident, as DKLM (RI) and Deep Kernel GP are better than the7Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 20220	50	100Number of Trials59060	50	100Number of Trials67670	50	100Number of Trials76090	50	100
