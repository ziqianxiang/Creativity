Figure 1: Schematic of modulatedfully connected layer. The weights ofthe fully connected layers are modu-lated by the output of the modulationnetwork.
Figure 2: Performance on classification tasks with artificial introduction of random missingness toincreasing portions of the input data (Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals).
Figure 3: Performance on classification tasks with artificial introduction of non-random missing-ness (achieved by removing input values above the specified quantile for each feature) (Error barsrepresent 95% confidence intervals).
Figure 4: Performance on classification tasks with artificial introduction of non-random missingness(achieved by removing complete features from the test dataset) (Error bars represent 95% confidenceintervals).
