Figure 1: Example based object detectors can in theory detect any object based on an example im-age. However existing models trained on the datasets with few categories SUCh as COCO performsignificantly worse for novel than known objects. We here show that this generalization gap progres-sively shrinks when training the same models with more categories thus moving us closer to modelswhich can actually detect any object.

Figure 3: Example predictions on held-out categories (ResNet-50 backbone). The left three columnsshow success cases. The rightmost column shows failure cases in which objects are overlookedand/or wrongfully detected.

Figure 5: A. Experiment subsampling LVIS and Objects365 categories during training. When morecategories are used during training performance on held-out categories (blue) improves while per-formance on the training categories (light blue) stays flat or decreases. B. Comparison of the per-formance on held-out categories if a fixed number of instances is chosen either from all categories(green) or from a subset of categories (blue). Having more categories is more important than havingmore samples per category. (1-shot results, for 5-shot see figure A.1)6Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2022COCO								Model	Backb.

Figure 6: Predictions on COCO tend to be more accurate and cleaner when using a bigger backboneand training on LVIS. Especially on categories with more ambiguous references like sports ball ordining table the LVIS trained model is more precise. Additionally the ResNeXt backbone leads to”cleaner” results with less false positives.
