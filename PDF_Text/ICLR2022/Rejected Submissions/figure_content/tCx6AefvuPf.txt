Figure 1: Performance of the proposed DP-GNN method as well as the baselines on the ogbn-arxiv, ogbn-products and ogbn-mag datasets. Clearly, DP-GNN offers a performance better thanboth of the Non-Private MLP and DP-MLP methods, with a reasonable privacy budget of ε ≤ 30.
Figure 2: Ablation studies on DP-GNN on the ogbn-arxiv dataset. (a) shows privacy-utilitycurves for a range of batch siZes for the DP-GNN. (b) shows privacy-utility curves when varyingmaximum degree K for the DP-GNN. In both analyses, the other hyperparameters are kept fixed.
Figure 3: Comparison of class-wise test accuracies of the non-private GCN model and privateDP-GCN model on all datasets, ordered by the decreasing frequency of occurrence of classesin the training data from left to right. The dotted lines indicate the overall accuracy for thecorresponding models. We observe that the private model performs relatively better for classeswhich have a high frequency in the training data, and the performance degrades as the frequency ofthe classes decreases.
