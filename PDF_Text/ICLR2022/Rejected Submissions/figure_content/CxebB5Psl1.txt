Figure 2: An illustration of overall architecture of Contextual Sentence EncoderBiLSTM3 Approach3.1	Problem StatementLet S = {si}iN=1 is a story comprises N text descriptions, where each description composed ofa single or a few sentences. For the simplicity and avoid annotation confusion, consider a singledescription as a single sentence. The goal of the task is retrieving an image sequence I = {ij }jN=1that is semantically aligned to a story S and each image ij is descriptive photo of the descriptionsi=j . Hence, the retrieval system F : {si}iN=1 7-â†’ {ij }jj=1 should map given story to the mostprobable image sequence without losing visual coherency. In this paper, we set I and S to have asame cardinality to easily compare the matching results by one-to-one. We left one-to-many retrievalas our future work.
