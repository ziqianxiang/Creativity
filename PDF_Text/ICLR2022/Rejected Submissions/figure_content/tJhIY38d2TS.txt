Figure 1: The extreme reweighting in GAIRAT results in a significant decrease when facing an unseen attack.
Figure 2: The ranking of attack in-tensity on different datasets. AT(Madry et al., 2018) and TRADES(Zhang et al., 2019) are different ad-versarial trianing methods. AT-60and TRADES-60 denote the earlystop models at the epoch 60.
Figure 3: Visualization of inconsistent vulnerable instances in different views using t-SNE. The dots insubfigures are outputs of the last layers in SAT-trained classifier (subfigures (a)-(d)). Classifier inputs are naturaldata points in the CIFAR-10 training set. The dots represent the vulnerable instances (top-20%). The red dotsrepresent consistently vulnerable instances, while the blue dots represent the inconsistent vulnerable instances inthe view of VGD, VPGD and VCW. VGD is the vulnerability w.r.t. geometry distance (GD) defined by Zhang et al.
Figure 4: The illustration of LRAT. LRAT pairs each instance with its adversarial variants, and performslocal reweighting inside each pair instead of global reweighting. For the same instance, there is inconsistentvulnerability in different views (the difference between red and blue). Thus, LRAT gives larger/smaller weightson the losses of adversarial variants, respectively.
Figure 5: The inconsistent vulnerability between instances about different variants. Six subfigures illustratethe frequency distribution of adversarial variants in the GAIRAT trained model on the CIFAR-10 training set(50,000). The x-coordinate in subfigures (a)-(c) is V in the view of PGD. The x-coordinate in subfigures (d)-(f)is V in the view of CW. Light yellow and light blue are all instances (50,000) in the view of PGD and CW, whiledark yellow and dark blue are top-20% vulnerable instances (10,000) respectively in the view ofPGD and CW.
Figure 6: The limitation of Eq. (10). Thefigure illustrates the performance on theGAIRAT trained model when the CW is sim-ulated in training.
