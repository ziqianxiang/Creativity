Figure 1: Illustration of the fern sharp graph including the bit functions and the voting tables. a - thebit functions operates on a single input features. Bits are concatenated into single word, pointing toa row in the voting table. The output is a Dout dimensional vector. b - the voting tables’ outputs aresummed across ferns.
Figure 2: Deep S-HTE architecture - multiple layers scheme. Each voting table output is summedto get the layer’s output. This output in then concatenated with the input example (green lines), andthe outputs of each layer is summed across layers (red line).
