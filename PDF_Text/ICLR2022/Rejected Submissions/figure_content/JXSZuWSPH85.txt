Figure 8: Relationship between noise scale and score in the Walker2d task. The X-axis representsthe standard deviation of the normal distribution (logarithmic scale), and the Y-axis represents theRL score (sum of true rewards) based on IRL results. The bars in the graph indicate the standarddeviation of the scores.
