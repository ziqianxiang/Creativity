Figure 1:	Example of a simple weighted layer of SVMnet. Each node in the layer is an SVM, trainedwith a subset of the inputs (pixels). Weight outputs are optional for a given layer.
Figure 2:	Example SVMnet architecture containing two SVM layers and a class label vote.
Figure 3: Test-set accuracy (left) and training time (right) of SVMnet and ResNet on COIL-100images when fitted with different training set sizes.
Figure 4: Test-set accuracy (left) and training time (right) of SVMnet and ResNet on Imagenettewhen fitted with different training set sizes.
Figure 5: Test-set accuracy (left) and training time (left) of SVMnet and ResNet on COVID-19chest x-ray images when fitted with different training set sizes. The accuracy of the ResNet modelsdisplays considerable overlap.
