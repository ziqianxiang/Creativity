Figure 1: Abstract form of the S3R method: Warped representation Zkw+1 and predicted representationZkp+1 are obtained from query encoder representation Zkq at frame k by flow based warping andtransition model, respectively. Both global-level and pixel-level similarity are then imposed withtarget encoder representation Zkt+1 at future frame k + 1.
Figure 2: Overall framework of the S3R method: Multiple representations generated by the queryand target encoders are used to infer a set of flow maps from F. The warped representation Zkw+1 isproduced using an inverse warping with the set of flow maps. The transition model with an action akalso predicts the future representation Zkp+1, similar to Schwarzer et al. (2021). The target encoderand projection heads are updated using the stop-gradient operation as in Chen & He (2020).㊉indicates a channel-wise concatenation and 1 × 1 convolution. The encoder representations Zkq areused as inputs in the RL algorithm. In our work, Rainbow DQN (van Hasselt et al., 2019) (M = 3)and SAC (Haarnoja et al., 2018a) (M = 2) are used as RL algorithms.
