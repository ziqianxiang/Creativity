Figure 15: Comparing No Attack (Ground Truth), FGSM and PGD attack on time series from theKARI Subsystem 2 (SS2). There is no significant difference between the three time series thereforethey seem perfectly overlap.
Figure 16: A more detailed view of the same time series as in Figure 1. However, for comparisonpurposes, the time series generated by No Attack (a), FGSM (b), and PGD (c) are shown separately.
Figure 17: Comparison of original vs. perturbed samples from different datasets inside UCR repos-itory. Moreover, the classification results of ResNet under normal and five different attack scenariosis also provided.
