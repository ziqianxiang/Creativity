Figure 1: Estimating uncertainty in regression having multimodality. Prediction interval for y with95% coverage probability is drawn for SQR and DDD (our method). SQR estimates continuousprediction intervals, while DDD provides disjoint prediction intervals.
Figure 2: Qualitative comparison of DDD and DDDens . DDD is trained with the training dataset(red dots). Gray shade and blue shade represent the estimated prediction intervals of DDD andDDDens, respectively. The Blue dotted line represents the width of prediction intervals for eachinput. DDDens shows better calibration in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution.
Figure 3: Qualitative comparison between DDD, SQR, and MVE. Blue dotted line represents targetvalue. The solid red lines, blue lines, and black lines are the PIs of DDD, SQR, and MVE repectively.
Figure 4: PIs (DDD) with coverage probabil-ity. Left scale means probability.
Figure 5: Qualitative comparison between DDD, SQR, and MVE. Blue dotted line represents targetvalue. The solid red lines, blue lines, and black lines are the PIs of DDD, SQR, and MVE repectively.
