The task is to predict the edge types for all edges in the graph given the ground truth nodetypes and coordinates for all nodes. We train the link predictor on QM9 and ChEMBL250k untilconvergence, then report the accuracy and the F-1 score on the test set. The classification reportsare computed by using scikit-learn, where the "Zero" type corresponds to the non-existence of abond. In addition, we provide visualized comparisons between the ground truth molecules and the
