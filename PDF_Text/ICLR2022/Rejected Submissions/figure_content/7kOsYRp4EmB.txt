Figure 1: OML and two ways to integrate with experience replay into its meta-training.
Figure 2: Meta-testing testing accuracies of ANML, OML, OML(ER), OML(REP). Note that the curves forOML(ER) and OML(REP) completely overlap with each other.
Figure 3:	Meta-testing testing accuracies of ANML, OML, OML(REP), OMER, OMREP(no-REP), and OMREP.
Figure 4:	T-SNE visualizations for the RLN output representations learned from the meta-testing sets ofCIFAR-FS. Circles represent training samples, and crosses represent testing samples (best viewed in color).
Figure 5: Meta-testing testing accuracies for the different memory selection schemes in OMREP.
Figure 6: Meta-testing testing accuracies with different replay buffer sizes. Note that the curves for OML(ER)and OML(REP) completely overlap.
Figure 7: T-SNE visualizations for the RLN output representations learned from the meta-testing sets of Omniglot(top), mini-ImageNet (middle), and CIFAR-FS (bottom). Circles are training samples, and crosses representtesting samples.
Figure 8: T-SNE visualizations for the RLN output representations learned from the meta-training sets ofOmniglot (top), mini-ImageNet (middle), and CIFAR-FS (bottom). Circles are training samples, and crossesrepresent testing samples.
