Figure 1: Schematic of MOR and learning-based approaches for estimating θgroup,A. (a) For Gfine consistingof n = 36 nodes, we have K = 3 communities (V1, V2, V3) with m = 6 coarse (c)-nodes (K1,. . . ,K6), eachhaving a coverage size r = 3. The control node set is K3. (b) In MOR approach, we infer θgroup,A via reducedorder dynamical system Scoarse . (c) Learning based approach capitalizes on mixed membership (MM) Algorithm2 to estimate θgroup,A directly from A, thereby avoiding the need to do consider Scoarse.
Figure 2: Estimation error based on MOR and Learning approaches. MOR Error= im=1 ∆i (A, A)/m andmLearning ErrOr=Ei=1 ∆i(Α)∕m. The shaded region in the figures represent one standard deviation computedfor 20 independent realizations. We make the following observations. First, both the learning and MOR basederrors are consistently better than the random baseline. Second, the learning based approach has consistentlysmaller error than that of the MOR approach for large parametric regimes. Third, (a) shows that all errorsmonotonically decrease as m increases. This is consistent with our bounds in Theorems 1 and 2. Fourth, (b)shows that errors decrease as ρn increases. This is expected because larger values of ρn result in more distantin- and cross-community edge densities. This makes community representation extraction and controllabilityestimation easier. Fifth, (c) demonstrates the higher tolerance of the Learning approach to situations whenincoarse measurements are less synchronized, in comparison to the MOR method. Finally, (d) shows that errordecreases with r . This should be the case as larger r means more fine nodes are sampled during coarsening.
