Figure 1: Ablation study for Meta-GLAR (Meta+RNN+ITF). Ablated elements are the representationfunction, which can be Linear (Lin) a feed-forward (FF) or a recurrent (RNN) neural network, theclosed-form adaptation from meta-learning (Meta) and iterated forecasts during training (ITF). Eachbox plot shows statistics for the 10 over 100 random search runs with lowest sMAPE computed on8K random training TS.
Figure 2: mean and max - min (shaded regions) sMAPE over training computed on 8K randomtime series from the train (dashed lines) and test (solid lines) sets of the source dataset (M4 monthly).
Figure 3: Ablation study for Meta-GLAR (Meta+RNN+ITF) on M4-HOURLY. Ablated elementsare the closed-form adaptation from meta-learning (Meta), which is also used only during prediction(ADA) and iterated forecasts during training (ITF). Each box plot show statistics for the 10 over 100random search combinations with lowest sMAPE computed on 8K random training TS.
Figure 4: Ablation study for Meta-GLAR (Meta+RNN+ITF). The box plots show statistics for allthe runs of the random search (no model selection).
