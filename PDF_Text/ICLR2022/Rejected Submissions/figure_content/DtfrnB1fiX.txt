Figure 2: Loss landscape of (a) Mini-batch SGD, (b) Local SGD, and (c) DaSGD. 12 samples areupdated on two workers. The orange and green arrows represent the updated loss function of eachsample, and the blue arrows describe the location of the updated loss function on the global model.
Figure 3: Validation loss(dotted line), training loss, and validation accuracy(solid line) of differentmodels on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
Figure 4: Effect of different parameters of DaSGD based on ResNet-50. The value in legend is thevalidation accuracy after 50 epochs.
