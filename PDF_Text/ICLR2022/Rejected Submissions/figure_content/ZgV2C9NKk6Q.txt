Figure 1: An illustration of the challenges in sampling from heterogeneous geospatial data layers. (A andB) show example geospatial data layers that a user may want to sample pixel-aligned data from. As theselayers have differing coordinate reference systems, patches of imagery (C and D) sampled from theselayers that cover the same area will not be pixel-aligned. TorchGeo transparently performs the appropriatealignment steps (reprojecting and resampling) during data loading such that users can train deep learningmodels without having to manually align the data layers.
Figure 2: Different layers of geospatial data often have differing coordinate reference systems andspatial resolutions. (Top row) The same physical area cropped from four raster layers with differentcoordinate reference systems and spatial resolutions—this data is not pixel-aligned and cannot yet be usedin modelling pipelines. (Bottom row) The same data as after reprojecting into the same coordinate systemand resampling to the highest spatial resolution—this data is pixel aligned and can serve as inputs or masksto deep neural networks.
Figure 3: Sampling performance of various “GeoSampler” implementations. (a) Solid lines representaverage sampling rate, while shaded region represents minimum and maximum performance across randomseeds. (b) Average sampling rate under different data loading conditions.
