Figure 1: The learn-ing rate schedules ofLARS and Nesterov mo-mentum Configuration B.
Figure 2: The fraction of hyperparametersettings that achieve better than a targetsearch, and Nesterov appears to have an inverse relation-ship between η and λ while LARS has the benefit of anoptimal η independent of λ. This raises the question of ifwevalidation error rate.
