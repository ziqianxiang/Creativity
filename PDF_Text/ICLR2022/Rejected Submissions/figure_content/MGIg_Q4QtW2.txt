Figure 1: Comparison between the shape-conditioned transformation and region-conditioned trans-formation. The shape-conditioned transformation predicts one global transformation for point setsalignment whereas the region-conditioned transformation predicts a set of transformations (i.e. Tn)for different implicit regions, which are then weighted fused to form a global transformation. Tndenotes the n-th region-specific transformation.
Figure 2: Our pipeline. Our proposed RAR framework contains three main components. The firstcomponent is a region-aware decoder (RAD) module that is formed with an implicit neural regionrepresentation parameterized by neural networks conditioned on a shape embedding. The implicitneural region representation is learned with a self-supervised 3D shape reconstruction loss withoutthe need for region labels. The second component is a region-aware transformation (RAT) modulewhich decodes shape embedding features to regress a set of region-specific transformations. Thethird component is the region-aware weight (RAW) module which generates the weights for differentregions of the 3D shape to be aligned. The global geometric transformation from source point setto target one is then formed by weighted fusion of region-aware transforms. Lalignment denotes thealignment loss. Lreconstruction denotes the reconstruction loss which allows us to reconstruct theinput shape. P denotes the region probability score and T denotes the region-specific transformation.
