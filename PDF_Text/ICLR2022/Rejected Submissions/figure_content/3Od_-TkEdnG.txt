Figure 1: An illustrative example of thetwo kinds of distribution shifts. (a) Di-versity shift (b) Correlation shift. z standsfor spurious feature, and y stands for labelclass.
Figure 2: Images in different domains from NICO dataset and corresponding attention heatmaps ofa model trained by ERM. The model has a strong focus on background information.
Figure 3: Images from Mixed-Same and Mixed-Rand and corresponding attention heatmaps of ERMand DAT, DAT effectively fixed the problem of excessive attention on uncorrelated backgroundinformation.
Figure 4: Attention heatmaps of ERM,(sample-wise) AT, and our DAT on theNICO dataset. Compared to ERM and AT,DAT has a more precise focus on the objectitself.
