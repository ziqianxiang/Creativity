Figure 1: Performance by Method: The improvement of each acquisition method over the modelgiven no extra labelled data. Boxplot and whiskers denote the median, quartiles and min/max scoresaggregated across each target domain and sample sizes (n = {8000, 18000, 28000}). The red linerepresents the median performance of a baseline that randomly selects examples to annotate.
Figure 2: Similarities of Example Rankings Measured by Kendall’s Tau Coefficients, for QA(above diagonal) and SA (below diagonal). Kendall’s Tau coefficient is computed between theexample rankings of each pair of methods. The heatmap contains these coefficients averaged overeach target dataset (some cells are crossed out for SA since SA’s kNN methods don’t have C/Q/QCvariants). 1 indicates a perfect relationship between the rankings, 0 means no relationship, and -1means an inverse relationship.
Figure 3: Kendall Tau scores normalized by intra-family scores according to the family of the methodon the y-axis (with uncertainty-ascending and uncertainty-descending as distinct families). If thecell’s corresponding Kendall Tau score is within the intra-family range, it’s value will be in [0, 1].
