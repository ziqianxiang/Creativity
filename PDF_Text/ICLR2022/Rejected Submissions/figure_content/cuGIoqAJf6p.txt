Figure 1: Stability of original H(f) andthe shrinkage-based Hα (f) with respectto number of samples. The original H-Score is 〜 75 times larger than thepopulation version of the H-Score (es-timated with a sample size of 106). Incontrast, the shrinkage-based H-Scoreis significantly more reliable.
Figure 2: Relation of NCE, LEEP & N LEEP to[Left] number of classes (log-scale) and [Right]class imbalance, max(n1, n2)∕min(n1, n2), forVGG19 on CIFAR100. For [Left], we randomlyselect 2-100 classes. For [Right], we randomlyselect 2 classes and vary the class imbalances.
