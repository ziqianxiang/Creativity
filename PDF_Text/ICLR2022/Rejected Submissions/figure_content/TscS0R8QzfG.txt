Figure 1: The sketch map of the total discrepancy between pairwise domains and discrepancy be-tween each domain and the shift-free domain.
Figure 2: The working flow of PDAML. When a new domain comes, the feature extractor firstchanges the data to feature. Then the governor judges its discrepancy and computes loss LDS . Underthe governing of G, the feature extractor makes quick self-adaptation. After several adaptation steps,the data X will be passed to a new feature extractor and then forward propagate to the classifier.
Figure 3: Visualization of the data using t-SNE. Different colors stand for different subjects. Differ-ent shapes stand for different emotion labels.
Figure 4: The test accuracy of self-adaptation. (a) Results of standard PDAML; (b) Results whenGRLs are removed.
