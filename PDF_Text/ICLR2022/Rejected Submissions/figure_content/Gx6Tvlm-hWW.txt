Figure 1: A demonstration of our proposed approach to trading off standard coverage guarantees(“Goal A”) for rigorous limits on the total number of false positives included in the output Ck,δ (“GoalB”). For in-silico screening for drug discovery, limiting false positives is critical when balancing abudget for experimental validation—even if it means that some true positives may be missed.
Figure 2: (k, δ)-FP results as a function of k for δ = 0.1 (up to k = B = 100). The top rowplots SSFPk,δ violation (lower is better). The bottom row plots TPR (higher is better). We see thatcompared to the other baselines, our conformal deep sets approach (NN) has the best (or close to thebest) TPR AUC across tasks, while having the lowest (or close to the lowest) SSFPk,δ violation.
Figure 3: k-FP results as a function of k for (up to k = B = 100). The top row plots size-stratifiedk-FP violation (lower is better). The bottom row plots the TPR (higher is better). As the number ofallowed false positives grows, our methods quickly achieve high power. Consistent with Figure 2,our conformal DeepSets approach (NN) demonstrates high TPR and low SSFPk across tasks.
