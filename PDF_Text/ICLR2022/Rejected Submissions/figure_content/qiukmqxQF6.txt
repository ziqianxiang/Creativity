Figure 1: Information flow during the training process: The goal of LatTe-Flows is to learn adimensionality reducing mapping (and its approximate inverse) that will produce representationsmore suitable to dynamics estimation and planning.
Figure 2: Forecasting under LatTe-Flows : Given a starting state, the flow generates estimates fornext time step by sampling from (Xh)~ p(xtι ∣htι). This process is repeated till our inferencehorizon. A latent trajectory is mapped back into the input space through the decoder.
Figure 3: LatTe-Flows models the joint trajectory of vital signals collected from wearables: Themodel is trained to produce 20-day forecasts of vital signals, given 30-day multivariate observationsof daily heart, blood pressure, and physical activity measurements, collected by wearable devicesand manual logging from 1630 healthy individuals. Each participant’s set of sensor measurementsis segmented into 50 day windows, further subdivided into two parts: the context window (30 days)and the prediction window (20 days). Once the model is trained, given at least 30 past days of aspecified participant in the testing set, we produce multivariate forecasts that capture changes overthe vital signals through time.
Figure 4: Qualitative predictions for the 20 day forecast window produced by LatTe-Flows forAH&MS signal observations (HRV, RHR, SC, BBT, DBP, SBP) of an individual. We estimate10 trajectories for a latent dimension of D = 5 and plot the estimates. Note that the forecastis displayed in terms of a probability distribution: the shaded areas represent the 50% and 90%prediction intervals, respectively, centered around the median (dark green line). The ground truth isoverlaid in blue with stars denoting true observations and linear interpolation between the points.
