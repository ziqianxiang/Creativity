Figure 1: An example of NAIL requiring naive logical reasoning. Highlighted option A is the correct answer.
Figure 2: An original example from CNCSE and its three imitations, which share the same backbone template.
Figure 3: The percentage and representative examples of each naive logical reasoning type.
Figure 4: Transfer learning results when evaluatingon the test split of LogiQA, ReClor and RACE. 0is the zero-shot performance of RoBERTa. * is aplaceholder for these three datasets.
Figure 5: Accuracy against reasoning types evaluated on different testing sets.
Figure 6: (a). X-axis: the number of sentences in the backbone template. The height of bars: Number of samplesin the test set grouped by X-axis. The number in bars: The accuracy against X-axis. (b). Accuracy of humanbaseline and RoBERTa against the number of possible worlds in the context.(“[a, b)#k” in the x-axis denotesthere are k samples in the test set where a ≤ number_of _possiblejworlds<b. (c). Number of mistakes madeby human baseline and RoBERTa model against various context length.
