Figure 1: The DOME platform, shown schematically (a) and pictorially (b). A digital light process-ing projection module is used to a controllable pixel grid of light. Real-time image analysis providedby standard light microscopy allow the light patterns to be shaped around the evolving dynamics ofthe microagent system to achieve closed-loop control.
Figure 2: (a) Q-table sum converging after 10 minutes for one simulated Volvox. (b) Speed decreas-ing over time for one simulated Volvox.
Figure 3: (a) Speeds of multiple agents over time, as Q-learning attempts to stop them. Speedsare reduced over time because the learning algorithm discovers optimal parameters for each agent(b) Y positions over time of emulated agents during herding, showing that 3 agents stop moving inpositions where Y â‰¥ 328. For both plots, each colour represents a different agent. It can be seen thatone agent (orange) has not yet learned the illumination pattern required to stop moving.
Figure 4: Average speeds in each of the experimental conditions, showing that using Q-learning,there is a lower average speed and less variance in the Y position. For the blinking light condition,an outlier can be seen, represented by a circular point.
Figure 5: (a) Evolution of the sum of the Q-table for agent A, showing stagnation. (b) Partial Q-tablevalues for agent A, showing that after 3 frames off, then 5 on, the best action is to turn the light offagain. (C) Evolution of the sum of the Q-table for agent B, showing stagnation. (d) Partial Q-tablevalues for agent B, showing that after 4 frames with light off, then 4 frameswith light on, the bestaction is to keep the light on. (e) Two Volvox illuminated at different rates using Q-learning.
Figure 6: The average Y position of all Volvox agents over time the Q-learning algorithm alternatesbetween illuminating the top and bottom of the screen. Red dashed lines indicate the time point atwhich the illumination half was switched.
