Figure 1: (a) presents the concept of neighborhood. If agent i is the node in purple, then purple andorange is Ni, and combination of purple, orange and green is Ni. (b) explains that extended valuefunction takes sN κ as input, here κ = 3. (c) is the illustration of graph convolutional model.
Figure 2: Training curves on multi-agent environments. Solid curves depict the mean of five trails,and shaded region correspond to standard deviation.
Figure 3: Figures of state and reward error. Both state error and reward error < 10% in everyenvironment.
Figure 4: Visualization of CACC and Flow environments. (a) A line of vehicles that need to keepa stable velocity and desired headway. (b) Vehicles travel in a figure eight shaped road section tolearn the behavior at an intersection .(c) Vehicles travel in a ring to reduce stop-and-go waves.
