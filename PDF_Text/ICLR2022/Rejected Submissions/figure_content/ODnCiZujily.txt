Figure 1: Left: Illustration of the network structure (top) and DeepSplit computationmodule for a generic layer (bottom). Adding identity layers in between the neural networklayers decouples the variables xk and allows processing them independently. Right: Over-approximation of the graph of tanh (top) and ReLU (bottom) function by convex hull.
Figure 2: A total of 1000 ResNet18 output lower and upper bounds are computed fromADMM and LiRPA for comparison in CIFAR10. Histograms of the relative improvementpercentage of ADMM over LiRPA are shown for the lower (left) and upper (right) bounds,which have an average relative improvement of 31.61% and 2.32%, respectively.
Figure 3: Projection of a point (x0 , y0) onto the convex hull of the ReLU function y =max(0,x) over the interval [χ,x]. We first project (x0,y0) onto all facets of the convex hulland then select the point with minimal distance to (x0, y0).

Figure 6:	The numbers of certified examples (left column) of ADMM and the linear-basedbounds (Wong et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2020) for the MNIST-A (upper row) and MNIST-B(lower row) networks and their differences (right column) for each e ∈ {0.01, 0.02, •一，0.10}.
Figure 7: The number of certified examples (left) of ADMM and the linear-basedbounds (Wong et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2020) for the CIFAR10 network and their differ-ences (right) for each e ∈ {0.5/255,1.0/255,…，4.0/255}.
Figure 8: The numbers of certified examples (left column) of ADMM and the linear-basedbounds (Wong et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2020) and their differences (right column) in theverification of DQNs from the BankHeist (first row), Roadrunner (second row) and Pong(third row) benchmarks. The range of e is given by {0.1/255,0.2/255,…，1.0/255}.
