Figure 1: A value indicative of the distance between the distributions of samples from twoSGLD processes running on neighbouring databases for the linear Gaussian model. For detailson μs, μr, σSr see subsection 4.2. The parameters used for this experiment (n = 1149019, α =0.1, β = 1,xh = 1.8, xl = 0.9, γ1 = 0.1, γ2 = 1.001, c = 1165165) ensure (1.6, 0.01) differentialprivacy when sampling from the posterior.
