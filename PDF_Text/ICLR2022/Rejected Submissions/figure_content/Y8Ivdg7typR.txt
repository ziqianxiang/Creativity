Figure 1: Left: Average accuracy (%) of new and old classes in the last phase, respectively us-ing LwF (Li & Hoiem, 2016) and iCaRL (Rebuffi et al., 2017). The dark blue, light blue, andgreen bars indicate the results of using new data, placebos, and old data to compute KD losses,respectively. “KD on new” means computing the KD loss on both new data and old exemplars.
Figure 2: The computation flow of our method PlaceboCIL in the i-th phase. We have three kinds ofinput data: old class exemplars, new class data,and a free stream of unlabeled images. We computetwo losses: CE loss on e ∪ d and KD loss on e ∪ p. The way to construct placebos is as follows: 1)We use the evaluation functions {Sm(u)}cmi-=11 to output the score for each unlabeled sample. 2) Weload a batch of unlabeled data U from the free image stream, and add K placebos with the highestscores for each old class to P . 3) We compute KD loss using the placebos then delete them from P .
Figure 3: (a) The selected placebos for two classes (“road” and “table”) and their activation mapsusing GradCAM (Selvaraju et al., 2017) on CIFAR-100 (N =5). The free image stream is non-matching ImageNet-1k. (b) The t-SNE (Maaten & Hinton, 2008) results on CIFAR-100 (N =5). Forclear visualization. We randomly pick five new classes and five old classes. The purple, light blue,and dark blue points denote the new data, old data, and the selected placebos, respectively.
