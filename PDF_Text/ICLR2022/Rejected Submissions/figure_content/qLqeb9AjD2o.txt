Figure 3:	Comparison of approximate certified accuracy for various training methods on MNIST.
Figure 4:	Comparison of approximate certified accuracy for various training methods on CIFAR-10. The sharp drop of certified accuracy in each plot is due to a strict upper bound in radius thatCERTIFY can output for a given σ, N = 100, 000, and α = 0.001.
Figure 5: Comparison of cleanvs. certified accuracy at r = 2.0on MNIST (σ = 1.0) for meth-ods those offer trade-off control.
Figure 6: Comparison of certified accuracy of CAT-RS ablationson CIFAR-10. We use ResNet-20 for ablation study and plot theresults at σ = 0.5. More results can be found in Appendix D.
Figure 7: (a): Comparison of the trends between the clean accuracy vs. (a) ACR, (b) the certifiedaccuracy at r = 1.0, and (c): the certified accuracy at r = 2.0, that each method exhibits as varyingits hyperparameter. We assume MNIST dataset with σ = 1.0 for this experiment.
