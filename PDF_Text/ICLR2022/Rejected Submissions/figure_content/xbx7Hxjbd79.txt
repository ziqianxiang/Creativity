Figure 1: Subfigure (a), (b) and (c) depicts the log of the consistency loss over the training of theupdate functions for the Tandem, MP and Ultimatum games. Subfigure (d), (e) and (f) show theperformance of COLA in comparison to HOLA:0.1, LOLA:0.1 and CGD:0.1. COLA:0.1 denotesCOLA with a look-ahead rate of 0.1.
Figure 2: Training in MP at look-ahead rate of Î± = 10. (a) Axes are on a log-scale. Increasingthe consistency helps with decreasing the variance of the solution. (b) LOLA and HOLA find non-convergent or even diverging solutions, while COLA is convergent.
Figure 3: Results are on the IPD. Subfigure (a) / (d), show the consistency loss for look-ahead rateof 0.03 / 1.0 respectively, (b) / (e) the average loss and (c) / (f) the policy for the first player, both forthe same pair of look-ahead rates. At low look-ahead HOLA defects and at high ones it diverges,also leading to high loss.
