Figure 1: (a) Data generated from Gaussian mixture model with 3 components, each has differingvariance and weight. (b) Naive density function in 2D (top) and 3D (bottom): only one peak can beidentified. (C) Proposed kernel diffusion density function: 3 clusters Can be easily discovered.
Figure 2: Precision-Recall curves of different approaches applied to DPC on MS1M dateset, using(a) Pairwise metric, and (b) BCubed metric .
Figure 3: Sensitivity analysis on emore_200k and MS1M. We investigate the clustering performanceby varying the following parameters: (a) Radius of Îµ-ball; (b) Number k of nearest neighbors; (c)Bandwidth h of Gaussian kernel.
Figure 4: Running time and memory usage of the pro-posed methods at different sample sizes on MS1M.
Figure 5: Naive density function in 3D with different values of e.
