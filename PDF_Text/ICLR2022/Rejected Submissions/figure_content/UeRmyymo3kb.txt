Figure 1: An overview of the three major phases of GARNET.
Figure 2: Comparisons of different kernel combinations in GARNET on Cora, Pubmed, and Squirreldatasets under Nettack â€” We denote the reduced-rank approximation kernel, adaptive filter learningkernel, and adaptive label propagation kernel by Reduced-Rank, Ada-Filter, and Ada_Label_Prop,respectively. Besides, we choose ProGNN and GPRSVD-CS (GPRGNN + SVD + C&S) as strongbaselines, whose curves on Pubmed are missing due to out-of-memory.

Figure 5: Comparisons of the ranks on input adversarial graph, our reduced-rank graph, and TSVD-based low-rank graph on Cora and Chameleon datasets.
Figure 6: GARNET accuracy comparisons of using vanilla spectral embedding and singular com-ponents (SC) based spectral embedding in the reduced-rank approximation kernel.
