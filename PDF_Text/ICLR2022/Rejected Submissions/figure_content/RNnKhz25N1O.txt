Figure 1: Method diagram showing the intuitionbehind the Expected Minimum Cost Objective.
Figure 2: In this plot we show the fraction ofusers satisfied vs the distance between the trainand test distributions. The results demonstratethat as the distance increases the performancedrops a bit and then plateaus, which means thatthe method is robust to this kind of distributionshift. Please refer to Section B.2 for more de-tails.
Figure 3: This figure shows the performance ofthe method on FS@k when recourses are gen-erated with Monte Carlo cost samples from adistribution with α-weight varying between 0and 1, where the user costs follow different α-weight values varying between 0, 1. Perfor-mance is robust to misspecification of α. Referto Section B.2 for more details.
Figure 4: Figure showing the performance ofdifferent recourse methods as the Budget is in-creased. These are the average number across5 different runs along with the standard devia-tion error bars. For some methods the standarddeviation is very low hence not visible as barsin the plot. It can be seen that as the budget in-creases the performance of COLS and P-COLSincreases. Please refer to Section B.2 for moredetails.
Figure 5: Figure showing the performance ofdifferent recourse methods as the the numberof counterfacuals to be generated is increased.
Figure 6: Figure showing the performance of theCOLS method as the number of Monte Carlosamples increase. These are the average numberacross 5 different runs along with standard devia-tion error bars. There is a steep increase and thenthe performance saturates. This implies that inpractice we do not need a large number of samplesto converge to the higher user satisfaction. Referto Section B.2 for more details.
