Figure 1: Left: Linear dependence of ∆SGD /∆SRG, the ratio of asymptotic errors of SGD andSRG, on σ2/σ2, the ratio of the uniform and optimal variances at the minimum. Right: SRG+achieves smaller asymptotic error than both SGD with Li -sampling (SGD+) and SGD with partiallybiased sampling (SGD++), while using large O(1∕L) step sizes just like SGD+ and SGD++.
Figure 2: Comparison of the evolution of the average relative error ∣∣xk - x* ∣∣2 / ∣∣x0 - x* ∣∣2 fordifferent optimizers on '2-regularized logistic regression problems using the datasets ijcnn1, w8a,mushrooms, phishing. We compare SRG (orange) with SGD (blue), SGD with random shuffling(purple), and SGD with the optimal variance-minimizing distributions at each iteration (green).
