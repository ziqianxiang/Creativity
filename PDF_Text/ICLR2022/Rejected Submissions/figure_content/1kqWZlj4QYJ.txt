Figure 2: An example of using supporting edge set to score an action. Based on the knowledge graph,the action pruner first predict the action type (e.g., cook) that needs to be taken at current state, theninstantiate the abstract supporting edge set to a concrete supporting edge set. Comparing the inputknowledge graph with the supporting edge set, we can compute action score for each action andselect the action with highest score accordingly.
