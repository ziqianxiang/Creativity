Figure 2: Maximum reward for a given entropy. When a trivially optimal language exists (a), thereward plateaus at a global maximum where further increases in entropy do not increase reward.
Figure 3: Sea star plots for three different settings in the edgeward navigation environment. Each“sea star” corresponds to an independent language learned in the given setting.
