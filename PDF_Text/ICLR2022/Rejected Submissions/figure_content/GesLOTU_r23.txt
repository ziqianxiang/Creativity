Figure 1: Output correlation PL as a function of input correlation po, for the erf activation. Empirical(Nl = 1024) in red, infinite-width in black. Blue is an upper bound on PL ◦…O Pi - for detailssee remark 2 in appendix A.1.
Figure 2: 1 - ρL as function of depth L (fig 2a) and negative slope a (fig 2b). Empirical correlationsfor sample data pairs in red; infinite-width predictions in black; smallest correlation (largest 1 - Pl)found by gradient descent on data (with network parameters fixed) in green; bounds obtained byrearranging inequality 4.1 in blue. Lower means smaller 1 - ρ, i.e. stronger shrinkage.
Figure 3: Representation shrinkage, singular values of the Jacobian and gradient propagation in deeperf networks. Bounds in figures 3a and 3f are the predictions of inequalities 4.2 and 4.3 respectively.
