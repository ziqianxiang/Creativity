Figure 1: Data augmentations for contrastive Learning: IDAA, CLAE and random augmentation. (a) Identity-preserving and hardness of data augmentations: random augmentation generates identity-preserved but easysamples, CLAE adversarially generates hard but identity-distorted samples, while IDAA (ours) can generate hardand identity-preserved samples. (b) Identity-preserving and hardness of augmentations by different methods:Points below the boundary line have the identity changed, while points close to the boundary are hard samples.
