Figure 1: Comparison of reliability and computational cost among baselines and different versions of MMattack. MM3, MM5 and MM+ are three versions of our MM attack. The subfigure (a) shows the (sorted) attacksuccess rates of different attacks. The higher the success rate, the stronger the attack. The subfigure (b) shows thecomputational cost of these attacks. The less time, the better the attack. AA is an ensemble of APGD-CE (A-CEfor short), APGD-DLR (A-DLR for short), FAB and Square. T-AA considers each target for APGD-DLR andFAB in AA, and is thus more time-consuming. Compared with AA (or T-AA), our MM3 achieves comparableperformance but only costs 3% (or 2%) of the computational time. The model structure we used is ResNet-18,which follows the adversarial training of (Madry et al., 2018) on CIFAR-10.
Figure 2: Minimum margin of probability. P denotes the predicted probability, Py and Pt are the predictedprobability on the true label y and a targeted false label t. The gray shape is the image of the adversarial variantsX within the bounded perturbation ball Be [x] under the mapping of the network onto (Py ,pt) the orange area(Pt > Py) indicates the region where the adversarial variants are misclassified, or to say a successful attack,while the blue area (Pt < Py) indicates the region where the adversarial variants do not attack successfully.
Figure 3: Reliability and computational time of different selection number. Regarding the performance for alltargets as benchmarks, as shown in the subfigure (a), (b) and (c), pre-selecting 3 (or 5) targets can achieve 99.13%(or 99.78%) reliability on CIFAR-10, 99.49% (or 99.82%) reliability on CIFAR-100; 98.78% (or 99.67%)reliability on SVHN; as shown in the subfigure (d), (e) and (f), pre-selecting 3 (or 5) targets only costs 33.58%(or 55.72%) computational time on CIFAR-10, 3.11% (or 5.07%) computational time on CIFAR-100; 33.33%(or 55.49%) computational time on SVHN.
Figure 4: Comparison of reliability and computational cost. We compare three versions of our MM attack(MM3, MM5 and MM+ mentioned in Section 4.1) with 8 baselines. In subfigure (a), (c) and (e), the Y-axis isthe accuracy of the attacked model, which means that the lower the accuracy, the stronger the attack (or to saythe better evaluation). In subfigure (b), (d) and (f), the Y-axis is computational time, which means the less thetime, the higher the computational efficiency.
