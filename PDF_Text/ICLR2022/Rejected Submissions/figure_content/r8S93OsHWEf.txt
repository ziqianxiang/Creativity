Adversarial budget ε = 0.031Vertical Flip (VFlip) Prediction is a self-supervised task similar to rotation prediction and hasalso been used for self-supervised learning (Saito et al., 2020). In essence, we make two copies ofthe input image and flip one copy vertically. The head gvflip then contains a 2-way fully-connectedlayer followed by a softmax layer and predicts whether the image is vertically flipped or not. Thecorresponding loss for an image x isLvfliP(X) = ―5 X : I 2 * 4og(GvfliP(XV )v ) ,	(13)2 v∈Vwhere V = {fliPPed, not fliPPed} is the oPeration set and GvfliP = gvfliP ◦ E. Xv denotes andtransformed input and Gvflip (∙)v is the probability of operation v. Note that We do not flip theimage horizontally as it is a common data augmentation technique and classifiers tyPically seek tobe invariant to horizontal flip.
