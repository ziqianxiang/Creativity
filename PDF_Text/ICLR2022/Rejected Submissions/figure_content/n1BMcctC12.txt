Figure 1: Evolution of min0≤k≤t Φ(wk) versus epoch counts for several different choices of N (i.e.,the number of blocks in N-RPDC), where nADMM refers to the algorithm proposed in (Zhang &Luo, 2020b). Left: dataset heart_scale. Right: dataset ionosphere. The results are obtainedby averaging 50 independent trials.
Figure 2: Evolution of min0≤k≤t Φ(wk) versus epoch counts for several different choices of N (i.e.,the number of blocks in N-RPDC) on synthetic dataset. Left: n = 360, d = 1280, s = 8. Right:n = 720, d = 2560, s = 16. The results are obtained by averaging 50 independent trials.
