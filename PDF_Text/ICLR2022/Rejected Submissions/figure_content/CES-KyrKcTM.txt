Figure 1: Variance penalization for classification problems. Contour lines of the weights distributionfor positive λ are shown on the left and for negative on the center plot. The right plot shows the use ofvariance penalization for outlier suppression or amplification (robustification versus generalization).
Figure 2: Polynomial functions for moments penalization. Dotted lines show the complete polynomialwhereas solid lines the clipped version. Left plot shows two convex and non decreasing polynomials.
Figure 3: Bounding the cross-entropy loss function using negative variance penalization. Classicalcross-entropy function is shown a dotted line. The impact of the λ2 parameter on the loss shape whenthe average loss is constant is shown on the left plot and the impact of the average loss on the shapein the center plot. Right plot shows the convex version of the variance penalized cross-entropy loss.
Figure 4: Polynomial functions for moments penalization and the corresponding weighted cross-entropy loss. Left column shows the polynomial functions used for penalizing the third centralmoment, top, and forth central moment, bottom. Right column shows the weighted cross-entropyfunction for E['] = 2. Dotted line shows the classical cross entropy for reference.
