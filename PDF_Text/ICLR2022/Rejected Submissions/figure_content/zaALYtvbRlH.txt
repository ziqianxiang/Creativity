Figure 3:	Effect analysis of training data size, drop ratio and span size on performance of modelstrained with S panDrop and Beta-SpanDrop over SQuADEffect of low data. To understand SPANDROP’s regularizing effect when training data is scarce,we study the model’s generalization performance when training on only 0.1% of the training data(around 100 examples) to using the entire training set (around 88k examples). As can be seen inFigure 3 (left), both SpanDrop and Beta-SpanDrop significantly improve model performancewhen the amount of training data is extremely low. As the amount of training data increases, thisgap slowly closes but remains consistently positive. The final gap when 100% of the training data isused is still sufficient to separate top-2 performing systems on this dataset.
