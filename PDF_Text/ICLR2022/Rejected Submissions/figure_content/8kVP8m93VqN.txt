Figure 1: The disease distribution over symptoms in the real-world dataset (See section 3.1). x-axisstands for symptoms and y-axis is the proportion. Each bar describes the disease distribution givena symptom.
Figure 2: The training and inference process of our model. (a) The framework of our hierarchicalreinforcement learning model with two-layer policies. (b) Illustration of the diagnosis process ofour model with interactions between models in two levels. wi is the action invoking worker wi andd is the action invoking disease classifier.
Figure 3: The error analysis for the disease classifier in different groups on our HRL model, thesquare with true group i and predicted group j means a disease in group i is misclassified into groupj by the disease classifier, the darker the color, the higher the value.
