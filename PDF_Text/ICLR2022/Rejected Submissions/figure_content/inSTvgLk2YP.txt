Figure 1: MeshInversion is an alternative approach to single-view textured mesh reconstructionby exploiting generative prior encapsulated in a pre-trained GAN. Our method has three majoradvantages: 1) It reconstructs highly faithful and realistic 3D objects, even when observed from novelviews; 2) The reconstruction is robust against occlusion in (b), where red arrows indicate texturalerrors; 3) The method generalizes reasonably well to less common shapes, such as birds with (c)extended tails or (d) open wings. Note that both MeshInversion and SMR have access to silhouettesduring inference, whereas UMR does not.
Figure 2: MeshInversion framework. We exploit a pre-trained 3D GAN that synthesizes plausibletextured meshes in the form of topology-aligned deformation map and texture map in the UV space.
Figure 3: Qualitative results on CUB. MeshInversion achieves highly faithful and realistic 3Dreconstruction. In particular, it exhibits superior generalization under various challenging scenarios,including with occlusion (b, c) and extended articulation (d, e).
Figure 4: Novel-view rendering results on CUB for MeshInversion and various baselines. In general,our method gives plausible 3D reconstruction even when observed from novel views, whereas manyof these baseline methods fail to generalize well to invisible regions and challenging articulations.

Figure 6: Qualitative results on PASCAL3D+ Car. Our method gives reasonably good performanceacross different car models and appearances.
