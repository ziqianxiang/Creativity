Figure 1: Sentiments of sample words in EPA space. Circles, squares, and triangles show identities,behaviors, and modifiers. The color represents the activity dimension. Comparing words such as“happy” and “suicidal” we can observe one has positive values in all three dimensions and the otherhas negative values.
Figure 2: Simulating sequential events in an interaction between an employee and employer. Theinitial sentiments for both characters are shown by star signs and the sentiments after each of fourevents are shown by numbers. After the fourth event, based on what the employee does, the finalsentiment for the two characters would be one of the places shown by the question mark.
Figure 3: Visualization of words with different affective meaning in EPA space. Circles, squares,and triangles show identities, behaviors, and modifiers. The color represents the activity dimension.
Figure 4: BERTNN pipeline. Sentences describing an event are generated in the first step and pre-processed to pass to a BERT model. Then the last two layers of the BERT model are concatenatedto make contextual word-embedding. This embedding is passed to a three-layer neural network tofind affective meaning, and finally, the output of the neural network is fine-tuned using a regressionmodel.
