Figure 1: Histograms showing non-Gaussianity of randomly chosen features from the ImageNet validationdataset featurized by ResNet-18, ResNet-50, ResNeXt-101 (32×8d), and Inception-v3. They are non-negativebecause these features are passed through a ReLU layer and then average pooled; for this reason, we have aspike around 0. These histograms are empirical distributions and thus have an area of 1.
Figure 2: The FID score between each pair of the distributions shown above is zero although they are clearlydifferent distributions. This is because Equation (1) is only defined for Gaussians, and FID treats any inputdistribution as Gaussian, even if it is not. We plot one dimensional distributions here for visualization purposes,but the FID score will remain zero even if we extend these distributions to their high dimensional isotrophiccounterparts. All that is required for the FID score between two distributions to be zero is that their first twomoments match. Figure 2a is the only Gaussian distribution. Figures 2b and 2d are Gaussian mixtures with twocomponents, Figure 2c is a uniform distribution, and 2e is a Laplace distribution.
Figure 3: AIC curves for ResNet-18, ResNet-50, ResNeXt-101 (32×8d), and Inception-v3 features used forpicking the number of mixture components K. We choose K = 10 for ResNet-18, K = 50 for ResNet-50,and K = 30 for both ResNeXt-101 (32×8d) and Inception-v3.
Figure 4: Samples of images showing targeted perturbations which artificially inflate FID but not WaM. Thetwo original images above are randomly selected from a set of 50,000 images generated by BigGAN and aset of 50,000 images of the ImageNet training dataset. We cannot visually perceive the difference betweenthe original and perturbed images, despite the datasets from which they were selected clearly demonstrating adrastic change in FID. Note that FID of the original ImageNet training data is approximately 10 times lowerthan for the BigGAN generated images. The FID, WaM, and R values were calculated using ResNet-18.
Figure 5: R values for BigGAN-generated images using additive isotropic Gaussian noise showing that FIDis slightly more sensitive than WaM to noise perturbations of generated images. The noise perturbations in thisexperiment are all greater in magnitude than the targeted perturbations in Section 5.1. The original image abovewas randomly selected from a set of 50,000 images generated by BigGAN. The FID, WaM, and R values werecalculated using ResNet-18.
Figure 6: R values for real images (ImageNet training data) using additive isotropic Gaussian noise showingthat FID is significantly more sensitive than WaM to noise perturbations of real images. The noise perturbationsin this experiment are all greater in magnitude than the targeted perturbations in Section 5.1. The originalimage above was randomly selected from a set of 50,000 images of the ImageNet training dataset. In contrastto Figure 5, we see that FID is more sensitive to these perturbations when the images look more realistic. TheFID and WaM values were calculated using ResNet-18.
Figure 7:	Samples of images shoWing targeted perturbations Which artificially inflate FID but not WaM; hoW-ever, We shoW KID values being indirectly inflated more than WaM. The tWo original images above are ran-domly selected from a set of 50,000 images generated by BigGAN and a set of 50,000 images of the ImageNettraining dataset. We cannot visually perceive the difference betWeen the original and perturbed images, despitethe datasets from Which they Were selected clearly demonstrating a drastic change in KID. The KID, WaM, andR0 values Were calculated using ResNet-18.
Figure 8:	R0 values for BigGAN-generated images using additive isotropic Gaussian noise showing that KIDhas similar sensitivity as WaM to noise perturbations of generated images. The original image above wasrandomly selected from a set of 50,000 images generated by BigGAN. The KID, WaM, and R0 values werecalculated using ResNet-18.

The original imageabove was randomly selected from a set of 50,000 images of the ImageNet training dataset. In contrast toFigure 5, we see that KID is more sensitive to these perturbations when the images look more realistic. TheFID and WaM values were calculated using ResNet-18.
