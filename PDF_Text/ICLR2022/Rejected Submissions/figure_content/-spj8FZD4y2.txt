Again, a ∈ {0, . . . , 15} and s ∈{0,..., 15}, but the Bernoulli parameter μa(S) for action a in state S is 0.8 if bSC = a, and sampleduniformly in (0, 0.75] otherwise. Thus, the best action responses are grouped into 8 different classes,depended on the state realization. In this case, the rate is limited to R = 2.

We start by proving Lemma D.1.
