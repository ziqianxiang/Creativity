Figure 1: Wireline cable position is the distance between the contact point of the cable and the rightflange of the drum. It is a dynamic variable needed by a spooling controller to control the spoolingarm to automate the spooling process. We used computer vision to infer the cable position from alive spooling video in real time.
Figure 2: Illustration of the training procedure of the original REMIND network. At each iteration,old features are decompressed and replayed to the network along with the new features. The weightsin the decoder is re-trained using the combined features by minimizing the prediction error. The newfeatures are then compressed to replace the old ones.
Figure 3: Illustration of the Product Quantization (PQ) method. A batch of features are first flattenedinto a 2D shape. Then the features are divided into sub-sections. K-means clustering is applied oneach sub-section, resulting in K centroids and IDs of the centroids that represent the sub-features.
Figure 4: Illustration of the modified dictionary update rule. Instead of replacing the old dictionarieswith the new ones, we keep both the old and new dictionaries in our modified REMIND network.

Figure 6: Example frames from datasets 1 (left), 2 (middle) and 3 (right). The environment (lightingconditions, weather, camera settings, frame distributions) under which the 3 datasets were takenwere different. We used these 3 datasets to compare the performances of different continual learningmethods.
