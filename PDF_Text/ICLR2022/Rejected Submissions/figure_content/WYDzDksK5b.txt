Figure 1: Architecture of the DiBB framework. This example shows an instantiation on a clusterwith 3 nodes, one head and two workers.
Figure 2: ECDF plots of the performance of DiBB, separable and full CMA-ES in dimenion 320.
Figure 3: The Walker 2D robot fromthe Walker2DBulletEnv-v0 environ-ment in OpenAI Gym. The goal is to makethe robot walk as far as possible withoutfalling. This sophisticated control task pro-vides a significant challenge in reinforce-ment learning control, especially in its Py-Bullet implementation. We tackle it usingDiBB wrapping LM-MA-ES to evolve aneural network policy controller totaling198 neurons and 11590 weights in directencoding.
Figure 4: BBOB-COCO results of DiBB, separable and full CMA-ES. Rows correspond to dimen-sions 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, 320, and 640. Columns correspond to Exp 1/Exp 2 on separable functions,ill-conditioned functions, as well as Exp 3/Exp 4 on separable and ill-conditioned functions.
