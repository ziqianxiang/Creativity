Figure 1: Methods comparison Average episode rewards, averagerewards and cumulative rewards are compared in the course of learn-ing for the MaCAO, SAC, PPO and TD3 frameworks, on 5 contin-uous state/continuous control problems. Row 1: Gym ContinuousMountain Car problem. β = 10, λ = 0.1, γ = 0.99, 2 hidden lay-ers with N = 32 neurons. 5 seeds. Row 2: Gym/MuJoCo Swim-mer problem. β = 30, λ = 0.3, γ = 0.995, 2 hidden layers withN = 32 neurons. 5 seeds. Row 3: Gym/Box2D Bipedal Walker.
