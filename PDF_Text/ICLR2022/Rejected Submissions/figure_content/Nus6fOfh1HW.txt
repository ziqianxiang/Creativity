Figure 1: (Best viewed in color.) Classification accu-racy on clean data and against poison attacks for targetnodes attacked by Nettack. Error bars show standarddeviation across different sets of experiments. Detailedresults are listed in Table 7. As expected, MLP is notinfluenced by the adversarial structural attacks.
Figure 2: Scatter plots of the degrees of the target nodes (x-axis) and gambit nodes (y-axis) involvedin the targeted attacks studied in ยง5.1. Attacks tend to leverage gambit nodes with low degrees,especially on heterophious graphs, which makes attacks increasing heterophily effective followingthe conclusions of Thm. 2.
