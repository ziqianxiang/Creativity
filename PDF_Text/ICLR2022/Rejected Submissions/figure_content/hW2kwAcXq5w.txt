Figure 1: Illustration of DWBC learning mechanismwhere α is the weight factor (α ≥ 1). This new objective essentially transforms the original BC taskinto a cost-sensitive learning problem (Ling & Sheng, 2008) by imposing the following weight onimitating each state-action transition asBehavioral cloning weights = (： -?"? d),	(s,a) ∈ De .
