Figure 1: Experiment results. The x-axis shows the running time (unit: seconds), and the y-axisshows the relative error (err/errstd - 1), where err is the error of the particular approach, and errstdis the error of the static Normal equation. The y-axis is on a log scale. For uniform sampling, wetake sampling probability p = 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5. For row sampling and our algorithm, we take theerror parameter e = 0.1,0.2,0.5,1. Kalman,s approach has a relative error of 0.
