Figure 1: Extrapolation performances depending on the number of nodes in test graphs on three tasks(invsize, harmonic, and maxdegree). Only GIN equipped with GNP performed consistentlywell on all the tasks. We tested 19 competitors and reported the results of the most successful ones.
Figure 2: EmpiriCal behavior of GNP. We showed how the parameters p and q of GNP Changedduring training. For eaCh task, GNP imitated the ideal pooling funCtions if suCh pooling funCtionsexist. For example, for maxdegree, GNP as aggregation and readout funCtions approximated sum(i.e., p+ ≈ 1 and q+ ≈ 0) and max (i.e., p+	1 and q+ ≈ 0), respeCtively, whiCh performed best.
