Figure 4: Robustness comparation between modelsRunning Algorithm 1 as part of this experiment with 10,000 perturbation samples for each imagetook between five seconds (with the VGG16-10 model) to seven seconds (with the Densenet model),for each sample. The whole experiment lasted less than one hour.
