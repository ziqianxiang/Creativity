Figure 1: Numerical simulations of the solution θ2(t)θ1(t) of the FA dynamics with true signal λ = 3 (left andmiddle) and λ = 10 (right), with different initializations.
Figure 2: Comparison of trace norms and reconstruction errors for linear autoencoders. For the FAexperiments, we are plotting the average (with error bars) of 15 experiments.
