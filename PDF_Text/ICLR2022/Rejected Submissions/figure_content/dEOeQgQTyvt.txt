Figure 1: Overview of the SEAL framework. Thefigure on the right shows the update to the en-ergy network (equation 4) and the figure on theleft shows the update to the feed-forward network(equation 3).
Figure 2: (a) The performance of SEAL variants without cross-entropy loss term on LF, i.e. whenλ1 = 1, λ2 = 0 in equation 1, compared to the model that only learns with cross-entropy. (b) Changein test F1 when moving from SEAL-static to SEAL-dynamic.
Figure 3: Validation F1 performance of SEAL framework with LE-regression(FΦ) compared to energy-only (DVN). Further, we compare validation F1 performance of GBI starting from samples drawnfrom feedforward network’s output (FΦ +GBI) and samples drawn randomly (random + GBI).
Figure 4: Validation F1 performance of SEAL framework with LE-NCEranking(FΦ) compared toenergy-only (NCE). Further, we compare validation F1 performance of GBI starting from samplesdrawn from feedforward network’s output (FΦ+GBI) and samples drawn randomly (random + GBI).
Figure 5: Validation F1 performance of SEAL framework with LE-margin(FΦ) compared to energy-only (SPEN). Further, we compare validation F1 performance of GBI starting from samples drawnfrom feedforward network’s output (FΦ +GBI) and samples drawn randomly (random + GBI).
