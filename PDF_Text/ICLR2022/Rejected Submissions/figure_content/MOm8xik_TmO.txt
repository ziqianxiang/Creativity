Figure 1: The proposed Variational Auto-Transformer architecture: Mean and covariance for thevariational loss (blue, dashed lines) are computed through two independent linear layers. The en-coder and decoder (grey, solid lines) architecture is the same as in the original Transformer.
Figure 2: Weighted regularization (top) and reconstruction loss (bottom) for train and test data overseveral epochs for two different Gaussians applied as prior distribution for the regularization term.
Figure 3: Optimizing the scaling factor s with respect to isotropy and loss values.
