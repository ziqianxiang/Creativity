Figure 1: Comparison between the estimator without VP (DNE) and with VP (DNE-VPλ) for Renyidivergence between two one-dimensional Gaussians with Q = N (0, 1.1) and P = N (0, 1). Weuse N = 5K sample size, 512 as batch size and results are averaged over 100 i.i.d. runs. Leftcolumn: DNE and DNE-VPλ estimators for increasing values of α. The variance of DNE becomesuncontrollably high for α > 3. Middle column: Relative MedAE (the lower, the better) for varyingpenalty coefficient λ and two values of α. The relative MedAE for large values of λ is close toone which implies that the estimated value of DNE-VPλ approaches zero. Right column: RelativeMedAE for increasing sample size N . We additionally present a penalty coefficient that varies withsample size, shown in blue (λN = 5N0 and λχ = 2000 for α = 0.5 and α = 10, respectively).
Figure 2: Performance comparison of several MI estimation approaches on a 40-dimensional corre-lated Gaussian random vector. The number of samples is set to 512K and batch size to 64. Panelswith Ra=0.5 in their titles present the Renyi-based MI with α = 0.5 whereas the rest of the methodsestimate the standard MI (i.e., the KL divergence). In each panel, the true values are shown as a stepfunction (black line). The correlation coefficient of the Gaussian, ρ, for each step is: 0.3084, 0.4257,0.5091, 0.5741, 0.6273 and 0.6717. The running estimates per minibatch are displayed as shadowblue curves. The dark blue curves shows the moving average of the estimated MI, with a bandwidthequal to 200 steps.
