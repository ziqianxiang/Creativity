Figure 1: FCause achieves better results than the baselines in all three metrics shown. Thelegend “FCause (PO)” corresponds to running FCause with 30% of the training data missing com-pletely at random. For readability, we highlight the FCause and FCause (PO) results by connectingthem with soft lines. The figure shows mean results across four different random seeds. Resultsincluding standard deviations are included in appendix G.
Figure 2: FCause achieves better results than the baselines in all three metrics shown. Resultsobtained with the dataset with higher levels of noise. The legend “FlowVICause (PO)” correspondsto running FCause with 30% of the training data missing completely at random. For readability, wehighlight the FCause and FCause (PO) results by connecting them with soft lines. For clarity thefigure shows mean results across four different random seeds.
Figure 3: Results for all metrics including standard deviations computed over runs with four differentrandom seeds. For readability, we highlight the FCause and FCause (PO) results by connectingthem with soft lines.
Figure 4: Imputation results. All results are obtained as the mean over four runs with differentrandom seeds. For readability, we highlight the FCause results by connecting them with soft lines.
