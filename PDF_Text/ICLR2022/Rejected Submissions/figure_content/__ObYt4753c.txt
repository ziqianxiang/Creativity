Figure 1: Variation of Robust Accuracy with different perturbation budget(b) 5-shotVariation of Robust Accuracy with number of base neighbors m: We plot the variation of RobustAccuracy with number of base neighbors m in Figure 2. We find best results with m = 2 which weuse for all our experiments. Note that we plot only the mean accuracy over 1000 different tasks.
