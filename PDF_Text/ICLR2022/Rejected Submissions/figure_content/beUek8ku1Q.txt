Figure 1: An illustrative example of a 3-level padded decomposition and corresponding 2-HST.
Figure 2:	k-median cost on MNIST dataset. 1st row: balanced D. 2nd row: imbalanced D .
Figure 3:	k-median costs on graph dataset. 1st row: balanced D. 2nd row: imbalanced D.
Figure 4: Example of synthetic graphs: subgraph of 50 nodes. Left: r = 1. Right: r = 100. Darkerand thicker edged have smaller distance. When r = 100, the graph is more separable.
Figure 5: Empirical time comparision of HST initialization v.s. k-median++, on MNIST datasetwith l2 distance. Left: The running time against k, on a subset ofn = 2000 data points. Right: Therunning time against n, with k = 20 centers.
Figure 6: Iteration cost to reach a locally optimal solution, on MNIST and graph datasets withdifferent k. The demand set is an imbalanced subset of the universe.
Figure 7: The k-median cost of the best solution found by each differentially private algorithm. Thedemand set is an imbalanced subset of the universe. Same comparison holds on graph data.
