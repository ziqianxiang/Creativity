Figure 1:	Comparison of the different GD schemes as a function of p (first column), n (second column), andd (third column). The figures indicate that utilizing the filters improves the performance of GD algorithm formixture of samples.
Figure 2:	Comparison of GD and SGD schemes as a function of p (first column), n (second column), and d(third column). We infer that SGD is more sensitive to corrupted samples compared to GD.
