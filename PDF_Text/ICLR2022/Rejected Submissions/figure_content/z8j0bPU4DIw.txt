Figure 1: Sensor example in the Ant Gather environment. Two black lines enclose an area correlatedwith a position in the input vector. The closest object of interest between the black lines is given anintensity based on its distance to the agent and is added to its input vector position. If no objects arebetween two lines or within sensor range the value of the input vector at the related position is 0.
Figure 2: Ant Gather environment (left) and Ant Maze environment (right). The two environmentsused to evaluate the performance of SHES. In the gather environment the agent must learn to collectas much green food as possible while avoiding the red poison (the pink dot indicates the primitivegoal gt and the blue dot is the agents starting position). In the maze environment the agent mustlearn to reach the red dot on the other side of the maze.
