Figure 1: Visual illustration of steepness (Definition 3). The steepness of φ, S0T(φ), is greater thanS0T(ψ) because φ moves against the vector field of gradient -NL(θ).
Figure 2: Empirical validation of Theorem 1, where the empirical mean exit time has exponentialdependency on sharpness α (〜λ), radius r, and noise magnitude ∖∕η∕B.
Figure 3: Illustration of domains and boundary, D, Bμ、/2(θ*), Bμ 1 (θ*), and ∂Bμ? (D)The illustration can be found in Fig. 3.
Figure 4: A continuous trajectory θt and the Markov chain Zk generated from {θt}t . Coloreddomains indicate D, Bμ、/2(θ*), and Bμ 1 (θ*) as illustrated in Fig. 3.
