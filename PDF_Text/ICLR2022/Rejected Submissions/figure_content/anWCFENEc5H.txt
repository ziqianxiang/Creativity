Figure 1: (a). Infer the natural label by utilizing the transition matrix and the adversarial label. (b).
Figure 2: An overview of the training procedure for the proposed defense method. y0 and y denotethe probability of the estimated mixture label y0 and the probability of the inferred natural label y0	0、、	ʌ/	0respectively, i.e., y0 = δ(hθ (x0)) and y = y0 ∙ T(x0; ω). y is y in the form of a vector.
