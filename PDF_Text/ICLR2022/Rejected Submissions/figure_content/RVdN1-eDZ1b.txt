Figure 1: Inverted images from a robust-ResNet50 model trained on ImageNet-1k.
Figure 2: An image at different stages of optimization with centering (left), and an image invertedwithout centering (right), for the Border Terrier class of a robust ResNet-50.
Figure 3: An image during different stages of optimization with zoom (left), and an image invertedwithout zoom (right), for the Jay class of a robust ResNet-50.
Figure 4: Inversions of the robust ResNet-50 ATM class, with and without ColorShift and withvarying TV regularization strength. The inversion process with ColorShift is robust to changes inthe λtv hyper-parameter, while without it, λtv seems to present a trade-off between noise and blur.
