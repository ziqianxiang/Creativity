Figure 1: 1D Gaussian mixture model in NumPyro.
Figure 2: The blue dashed line is the target pdf, while the solid green line is the density of theparticles. We estimate the particle density for SVGD with Gaussian kernel density estimation. We use100 particles for SVGD, and two or three particles for the Stein-mixture. SVI uses a Gaussian guide.
Figure 3: Particle positions for EinSteinVI with different kernels after 1000 iterations with a pointmass guide, starting from particle positions given in the upper left frame labelled Initial. The MMD,bottom right frame, is evaluated using the RBF kernel.
