Figure 4: Evolution process in pixel-based environments. Every white dot represents a loss candi-date, and the score of y-axis shows its corresponding approximated AULC score (Ghiassian et al.,2020; Stadie et al., 2015). The horizontal lines show the scores of baselines. The AULC score isapproximated with the average evaluation score at 100k, 200k, 300k, 400k, 500k time steps.

Figure 6: Evolution process in state-based environments. Every white dot represents a loss candi-date, and the score of y-axis shows its corresponding approximated AULC score. The horizontallines show the scores of baselines. The AULC score is approximated with the average evaluationscore at 300k, 600k, 900k, 1200k, 1500k time steps (Cheetah-Run at 100k, 200k, 300k, 400K).
