Figure 10: Adversarial examples generated by boundary attack with different MAD scores. We canfind the threshold MAD â‰¤ 30 is roughly enough to indicate an imperceptible adversarial example.
Figure 11: Queries vs. True Success Rate under different thresholds of MAD scoresA.5 Comparison of SALIENCY Attack with other attacksWe randomly choose 10,000 examples from the ImageNet validation set and divide them into 10groups. Then we test different attacks under 3000 query budget and report their mean and stan-dard deviation (SD). The best results are recorded in bold based on Wilcoxon signed-rank test withsignificance level at 0.05. We can find that our Saliency Attack is significantly better than all thebaselines.
