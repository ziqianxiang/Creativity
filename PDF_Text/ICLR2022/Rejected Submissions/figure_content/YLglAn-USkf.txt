Figure 1: The average performance on text classifications with different ensemble methods and num-ber of [MASK]s. (a) shows the results of inserting different number of [MASK]s at start position,while (b) is at the end. (c) inserts the same number of [MASK]s at both start and end positions.
Figure 2: The average performance on textclassifications when the number of similarwords differing. 1/2/3/4 [MASK]s means in-serting one/two/three/four [MASK] tokens atboth the start and end positions.
