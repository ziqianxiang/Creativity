Figure 1: In this figure we visualize the implication of our theoretical results. For a predictionfunction that is locally probabilistically Lipschitz with a constant L, the predictions for any twopoints x, x0 such that dp(x, x0) ≤ r are within Ldp (x, x0) distance from each other with someprobability 1 - α. Given such a prediction function, the explanation for the same data points arealso expected to be within λdp(x, x0) of each other where λ ≥ CLyfd where Cisa constant, Withthe same probability 1 - α.
Figure 2: This figure experimentally shows the implication of our theoretical results. Given thedatasets and the four classifiers trained on each of these datasets, we observe that the explainerastuteness for SHAP, RISE and CXPLAIN is lower bounded by the astuteness predicted by ourtheoretical results given a value of λ along the x-axis. The predicted lower bound is depicted bydashed lines, while solid lines depict the actual estimate of explainer astuteness. See Figure 3 forplots for all seven datasets.
Figure 3: This figure experimentally shows the implication of our theoretical results. Given theseven datasets and the four classifiers trained on these each of these datasets, we observe that theexplainer astuteness for SHAP, RISE and CXPL1A5IN is lower bounded by the astuteness predictedby our theoretical results given a value of λ. The predicted lower bound is depicted by dashed lines,while solid lines depict the actual estimate of explainer astuteness.
