Figure 1: Relative RMSE of a recommendation system trained on MovieLens 100k for 20 independent par-titions measured over the test set (a) starting with GNNs of 200 nodes, compared to a GNN trained on 1000nodes for 37 epochs (b) starting with GNNs of 300 nodes, compared to a GNN trained on 1000 nodes for 29epochs.
Figure 2: Velocity variation of the flocking problem for the whole trajectory in the testing set relative to thecentralized controller (a) starting with 10 nodes and (b) starting with 20 nodes.
Figure 3: In order to satisfy the property that the inner product between the gradient on the GNNVh'(Y^, Φ(Xn; H, Wn)) and the gradient on the graphon Vh'(Y, Φ(X; H, W)) is positive, We rely onthe condition provided in Theorem 2.
