Figure 1: Mistill trains a NN with forwarding decisions from an initial centralized TE system.
Figure 2: The NN architecture consists of four modules: The LocMod, the HNSAMod, theNSMOD and the FWD MOD.
Figure 3: Bar plots for TE policies and traffic patterns.
Figure 4: Training loss for varying number of blocks in the GS for the calculation of HNSAs.
Figure 5: Bit pattern in HNSA messages for edge availability and edge weights.
Figure 6: Attention weights. Each row contains the weights for one switch over all other switches.
