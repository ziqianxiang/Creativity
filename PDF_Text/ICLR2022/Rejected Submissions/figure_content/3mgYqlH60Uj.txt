Figure 1: (a) Behavior of the 3CC model at (b) 50% Maximum Voluntary Contraction (MVC) andat (c) 13% MVC < f+r. Note how the full load cannot be held any longer after 20s in (b) (yellowdashed line), while the load in (c) can be held indefinitely. C(t) denotes the feedback-controllerterm, R and F the rest and fatigue coefficients, respectively.
