Figure 1: Loss distributions used by Attack S, P, R, D for points z1 , z2 and target model θ1 inPurchase100 Configuration IIa, α = 0.1. Note that both z1 and z2 are datapoints from the sameclass. We also show the loss distributions for z1, z2 on another target model θ2 in the appendix.
Figure 2: Loss distributions used by Attack S, P, R, D for points z1, z2 and target models θ1, θ2 inPurchase100 Configuration IIa, α = 0.1. Note that both z1 and z2 are datapoints from the sameclass and are members of both the target models’ training datasets. We show the loss distributionsfor z1 , z2 on target model θ1 in the main paper, and on θ2 here.
Figure 3: FPR vs TPR with AUC scores for all attacks on Configurations Ia and IIa of the Pur-chase100 dataset. Note that models in Configuration Ia have been trained using 2500 points, andmodels in Configuration IIa have been trained using 5000 points.
Figure 4: FPR vs TPR with AUC scores for all attacks on Configuration III of the CIFAR10 datasetand Configuration IV of the Purchase100 dataset. Note that models in Configuration III of CIFAR10use the 3-block VGGNet architecture. Models in Configuration IV of Purchase100 have been trainedusing gradient clipping with an L2 clipping norm of 2.0. All attacks here use n = 30 (shadow,reference, distilled) models.
Figure 5: Scatterplots comparing Attacks S and P, and Attacks R and D in Purchase100 Configura-tion IIa. Each dot on a scatterplot corresponds to a particular train datapoint. The two coordinates ofthe dot are for the two attacks being compared. Each coordinate of the dot corresponds to the differ-ence between the loss of the point on the target model and the loss threshold used by the particularattack on the point. Plot (a) compares Attacks S and P, whereas plot (b) compares Attacks R and D.
