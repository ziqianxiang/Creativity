Figure 1: Comparison of three different ensemble methods on the synthetic checkboard dataset (a).
Figure 2: Ablation studies on CIFAR-100 using VGGNet-19. The values rep-resent the performance difference, aver-age over 3 runs, of each method relativeto the single base model.
Figure 3: Proportion of samples special-ized by the 3 VGGNet-19 models (A/B/C)trained with SANE for the 10 CIFAR-100superclasses (labeled as numbers).
Figure 4: Accuracy comparison of methods with different number of base models K on CIFAR-10 andCIFAR-100.
Figure 5: (a) the confidence-confidence plot with Î¸ as the specialization measurement defined inGontijo-Lopes et al. (2021). (b) and (c) are specialization measurement of two base models trainedby SANE and independently trained when only model 1/2 correct, respectively.
