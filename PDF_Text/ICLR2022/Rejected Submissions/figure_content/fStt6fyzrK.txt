Figure 1: Model-Based Robust Adaptive Training Algorithm (MRTAdapt)domain. Using an adversarial loss for discriminator, the loss will back-propagate to segmentationnetwork to help segmentation network to generate similar distributions in target domain to naturalvariation. Detailed information will be covered in the following sections.
Figure 2: Semantic meaning of an object will not change with natural variation4Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 20223.4	Model-Based Robust Adaptive Training AlgorithmDifferent from AdaptSegNet where the goal was to minimize the gap between the label from sourcedomain and target domain, we build on top of model-based robust training algorithm with differentoptimization goal. Using the idea of semantic meaning invariance, we treat the generated naturalvariation image generated as "source" domain image. For the reason that the generated natural varia-tion image is chosen by model-based robust training algorithm is aiming to represent the worst-casescenario of natural variation. The objective of our proposed model-based robust adaptive trainingalgorithm is trying to reduce the gap on both image and label side.
