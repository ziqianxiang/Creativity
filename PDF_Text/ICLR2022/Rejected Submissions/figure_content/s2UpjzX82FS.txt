Figure 1: Overall framework of TAViT. (a) By subscribing a task-agnostic Transformer body, (b)clients train their heads and tails with the fixed body in parallel by task-specific learning, while aserver trains the body with the fixed head and tail of randomly chosen client for each iteration bytask-agnostic learning, (c) and that the body consists of encoder-only Transformer architecture.
Figure 2: Training scheme of the proposed TAViT, where S denotes a common server, and C denotesclients. The FedAvg with dashed line is applied at the weight aggregation steps.
Figure 3: Results of TAViT for multi-task distributed learning. Each column shows the PSNR andSSIM according to i-th cycle for the deblocking, denoising, deraining, and deblurring, respectively.
Figure 4: Scenarios of TAViT (pink arrow) TAViT(OUrS)	ci,C2,s	27.69	0.786	33.20	0.924and other strategies of (a-b) SL and (c) FL,where C# is clients and S is the server.
Figure 5: Visual comparisons for multiple tasks: (a) deblocking, (b) denoising, (c) deraining, and (d)deblurring. Yellow values are PSNR, and inset box is a magnified view of a red rectangle.
Figure 6: Qualitative results of TAViT according to the cycles. From the left to the right columns,the deblocking results on images with the quantization quality 10 and 50, the denoising results, thederaining results on Rain100H and Rain100L, and the deblurring results. The yellow value is PSNR,and an inset box is a magnified view of a red rectangle.
Figure 7: Visual comparisons of image deblocking task using BSDS500 (Arbelwez et al., 2011). Theyellow value of each result is PSNR. We compare our TAViT with DnCNN (Zhang et al., 2017a),AR-CNN (Dong et al., 2015), and QCN (Li et al., 2020b).
Figure 8: Visual comparisons of image denoising task using CBSD68 (Martin et al., 2001a). Theyellow value of each result is PSNR. We compare the proposed TAViT with CBM3D (Dabov et al.,2007), DnCNN (Zhang et al., 2017a), FFDNet (Zhang et al., 2018b), IRCNN (Zhang et al., 2017b),and DHDN (Park et al., 2019).
Figure 9: Visual comparisons of image deraining task using Rain100H and Rain100L data sets (Yanget al., 2017). The yellow value of each result is PSNR. DerainNet (Fu et al., 2017a), SEMI (Wei et al.,2019), UMRL (Yasarla & Patel, 2019), and PreNet (Ren et al., 2019) are used to compare our TAViT.
Figure 10: Visual comparisons of image deblurring task using GoPro (Nah et al., 2017) dataset. Forvisualization, we enlarge a region of red inset box (left column) for all images and denote PSNR ofeach result with yellow. We compare our TAViT with DeblurGAN (Kupyn et al., 2018), Nah et al.
Figure 11: Results of TAViT with 1/2 data for each task in the task-agnostic learning. Each col-umn shows PSNR and SSIM according to i-th cycle for the deblocking, denoising, deraining, anddeblurring, respectively.
Figure 12: The network output with and without skip-connections between task-specific heads andtail for denoising and deraining task.
Figure 13: Visual comparisons of the application results: (a) inpainting of natural images, and (b)denoising of medical CT images. The average values of PSNR / SSIM are displayed on each result.
