Figure 1: Schematic depicting the forward gener-ative model. Gt is the prior over metacognition(Vt) at time t; Wt is the world state; and Ot arethe observations that are generated. Wt, Ot, andGt collectively influence Gt+1, the prior over Vt1 .

Figure 3: Results for METAGEN and comparison models with DETR. (A) METAGEN OnlineLearning MSE as a function of scenes observed. (B) Average accuracy for all models in TrainingSet and Test Set. (C) Accuracy difference between METAGEN Learned V and the two baselinemodels. Positive values indicated METAGEN outperforms the comparison models.
Figure 4: Three sampled agent trajectories. Thewide circular patterns at the top are camera posi-tions, and the smaller patterns near the bottom arecamera focal points.
