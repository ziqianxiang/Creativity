Figure 3: Learning curves for our methods (MBAIL and BAIL+) and the baseline single task BAILand contextual BCQ. The top row is trained on a batch of sample ratio 0.1, that is 30,000 trainingexamples for Ant-Goal, 20,000 for Ant-Dir and 6,000 for HalfCheetahVel. The bottom row is trainedon a batch of sample ratio 0.8, that is 240,000 training examples for Ant-Goal, 160,000 for Ant-Dirand 48,000 for HalfCheetahVel.
