Figure 1: Detect noisy labels with similar representations. Orange circle: instance with noisy label1. Blue square: instance with noisy label 2. Green dashed circle: A k-NN example.
Figure 2: The trends of δk and probability lower bounds on CIFAR-10 (Krizhevsky et al., 2009) withdifferent g(∙). The outputs of the last convolution layer are adopted. R18/34/50: ResNet18/34/50.
