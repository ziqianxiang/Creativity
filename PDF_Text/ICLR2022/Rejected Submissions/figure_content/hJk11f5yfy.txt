Figure 1: Hierarchical representation of a custom subset of ImageNet. The classes for the classifi-cation task are at the intermediate level, denoted by ‘class’. The constituent subpopulations of eachclass are particular classes from the ImageNet dataset and are marked at the leaf level as ‘subclass’.
Figure 2: Figure shows our conditional training framework applied to a multi-headed neural net-work architecture, on the instance subtree shown on the top left. The bottom of the figure showsconditional training for a single instance of a class ‘Canis’, subclass ‘Collie’. Each head predictsthe hierarchical level-specific label from the instance subtree. The validation matrices dictate whichsamples get propagated for learning to the deeper heads. At the top right, the batch conditional train-ing details are shown. Each element in a validation matrix specifies whether the sample is correctlypredicted at a previous level. Here, the training is shown till the subclass level.
