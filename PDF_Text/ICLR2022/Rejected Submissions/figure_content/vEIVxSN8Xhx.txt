Figure 1: (a) At different locations of an image, local contextual pixels can be divided into differentregions according to their relative distances and directions in the log-polar space. For each location,pixels falling in the same region are generally similar and can share the same weight. (b) The LPSCkernel. For this example, Lr = 3, Lθ = 6, g = 2, thus there are only 18+1 parameters. The LRFcan be arbitrarily large.
Figure 2: (a) The LPSC kernel is slide throughthe feature map. (b) The shape and inclination ofthe LPSC kernel can be changed.
Figure 3: (a) At each position, log-polar spacepooling generates a 2Lr X Lθ /2 matrix using thepre-computed mask. (b) To perform LPSC onthe original input (left), log-polar pooling gener-ates a matrix for each pixel, resulting in an up-sampled map (middle), conventional convolutionwith kernel size and stride equaling (2Lr, Lθ/2)is applied to this map (right).
