Figure 1: A graphical illustration of our GSmooth. We use a surrogate image-to-image translationnetwork to accurately fit a semantic transformation. Then we add a new augmented noise into thesurrogate model and construct the GSmooth classifier. The augmented noise are sampled to ensurethe transformation to be resolvable in the semantic space. We theoretically calculate the certificationbound for the surrogate model to certify the original semantic transformation.
Figure 2: Results of ablation experiments on the influence of smoothing distribution for zoomedblur on CIFAR-10 dataset. The horizontal axis kαk2 is the certified raidus.
Figure 3: Visualization of difference between the augmented noise in the semantic layers and thenoise on raw images. Left: original images from CIFAR-10. Middle: images with augmented noiseof σ2 = 0.2. Right: images with additive Gaussian noise σ = 0.2.
