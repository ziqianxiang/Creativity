Figure 1: Graphical illustration of neural pro-cesses and multi-task neural processes. Shadednodes indicate observed variables, and whitenodes indicate the introduced latent variables.
Figure 2: 1-D multi-task function regression. The plots show sample of curves conditioned on anincreasing number of context samples for each task (4, 8 and 12 in each column respectively). Theground truth is shown in black and the context samples as black dots. The predictions of our MTNPsmore resemble the ground truth than that of NPs, especially in the boundary of different tasks.
Figure 3: The segmentation results by the proposed multi-task neural processes (bottom row) andthe U-Net (upper row). Green outline corresponds to the ground truth and red to the segmentationoutput. The numbers are the DSC scores compared against ground truth. Our multi-task neuralprocesses can predict contours closer to the ground truth ones with higher DSC scores than U-Net,indicating the advantages of exploring spatial context information for brain image segmentation.
Figure 4: Illustration of training loss with iterations on Office-Home. MTNPs converges morestable than NPs under 5%, 10% and 20% train-test splits.
