Figure 1: Overview of the proposed regularization. d and |N | are input dimension size and a batchsize respectively. Time step is not described in the figure, yet one can easily extend the above tosequential classification tasks.
Figure 2: (a) displays the change in the smoothing parameter α throughout the training on the testedcorpora. (b) plots the gradient norm of the methods on IWSLT15 EN→VI.
Figure 3: Reliability diagram of Base method, label smoothing, and ours. Predictions on IWSLT14DE→EN test set are binned to 10 groups based on the predictive scores. Each bar indicates theaverage confidence score and accuracy of each bin.
