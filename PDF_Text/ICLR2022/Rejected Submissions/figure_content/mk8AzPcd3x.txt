Figure 1: DistanCe Confusion of a Conventional model in embedding. (a) random walks rooted atva have muCh diffiCulty in exploring beyond Current Community to vc . (b): Weight deCay on walksCauses instability of shortest distanCe sinCe walks rooted at va have large probability to steer Clearof vb for starters and baCk to vb as the end, whiCh results in a extremely weak Correlation betweenva and vb despite the faCt that they have an immediate edge. (c): A suffiCient number of 2-hop linksbetween vc and va induCe a shorter distanCe in embedding spaCe than that of vb and va . (d): vband vc sharing substantial ConneCtion deserve to be mapped Closed to eaCh other even if they have alarge shortest distanCe gap, while the divergenCe of distanCe between vb , vc and va is also plaguedwith extraCtion.
