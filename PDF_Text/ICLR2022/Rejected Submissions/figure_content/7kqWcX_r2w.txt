Figure 1: (a) Traditional Actor-Critic framework. (b) The meta attention Actor-Critic framework.
Figure 2: When the agent interacts with the environment, in addition to the action produced by thetraditional Actor-critic framework, meta attention also attempts to make further adjustments to theinitially produced results in the hope of achieving better results.
