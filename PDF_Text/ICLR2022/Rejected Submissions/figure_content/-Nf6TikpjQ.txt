Figure 1: Here we plot the temporal behavior ofpt starting atp0 = 0.2 for 100 rounds under variousL and η, and noisy estimation of gradient of mean squared error with m samples. The top row(figs. 1a to 1c) present different combination of (L, η), and bottom row (figs. 1d to 1f) consider thegradient is estimated from m = 10 and m = 100 samples.
Figure 2: The temporal behavior of the total cost for 100 rounds under various η.
