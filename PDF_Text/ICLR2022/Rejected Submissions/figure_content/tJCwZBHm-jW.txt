Figure 1: We investigate the feasibility of pretrained 2D ConvNets transferring to 3D sparse ConvNets.
Figure 2: a) the left figure shows the trainable parameters ratio w.r.t top-1 accuracy on ModelNet 3DWarehouse dataset. b) the right figure shows the performance OfFIP-IO and FIP-IO+BN on top ofResNet50 pretrained on different datasets.
Figure 3: The curves of validation accuracy w.r.t training epoch. We compare the results be-tween training-from-sCratCh and FIP-ALL on the ImageNet1K, on top of ResNet18, ResNet50, andReSNet152, respectively.
Figure 4: Network dissection of FIP-IO+BN. The visualization displays What the units are attendingto on both image dataset and ModelNet 3D Warehouse dataset.
