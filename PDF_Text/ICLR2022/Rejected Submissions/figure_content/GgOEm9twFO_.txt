Figure 1: Visualizations of the ground-truth mel-speCtrogramS and the mel-speCtrogramS generatedby several state-of-the-art attacks and our PhaSeFooL Attacks based on the lp-norm (e.g. C&W’s at-tack (Carlini & Wagner, 2018) and IPC attack (Zhang et al., 2020)) introduce obvious perturbationsto the mel-spectrogram and cause perceptible noises. Qin’s attack leverages the psychoacoustic prin-ciple of auditory masking and hides noises in the inaudible regions while our PhaseFool dissipatesthe energy patterns that are important for classification while less important for human perception.
Figure 3: Pixel-wise difference of the generated audio adversarial examples in the mel-spectrogramdomain. The perturbations of C&W’s attack are disorderly distributed in the mel-spectrogram. Qin’sattack and IPC attack tend to hide perturbations in the utterance regions while our PhaseFool attackgenerates perturbations around the harmonics in the spectrogram.
