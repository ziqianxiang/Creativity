Figure 1: The difference between the exact Green’s function G(x, y) of the unit disc and Green’sfunction calculated by derivative-based and BIE-based methods with fixed x = (0.8427, 0.4386)and x = (0.2923, 0.0674).
Figure 2: (a) is the distribution of relative L2 error of the solution of the PDE with 100 differentsource terms; (b) and (c) is the real part of the exact solution and the numerical solution with thesource term f = (72π2 - 4) cos(6πx1 + n/2) sin(6πx2); (d) is the absolute error between exactsolution and numercal solution.
Figure 3: For fixed x=(-0.4430,0.0938), (a) and (b) are the real part of the exact G(x, y) and nu-merical G(x, y) respectively. (c) and (d) are corresponding imaginary part. (e) is the absolute errorbetween exact and numerical G(x, y).
