Figure 1: An example of the â€˜barrel stave, antimicrobial mechanism. The blue indicates the hy-drophobic amino acids, and the red ones are hydrophilic. On the left, although the peptides withreasonable amino acids has attached to the bacterial membrane, they still can not insert into it. How-ever, by folding into the helix structure, as shown on the right, the peptides maintain a stable holewhich breaks the membrane of the bacterium.
Figure 2: The framework of LSSAMP. The input sequence is first fed into the encoder to get thehidden representation h. Then, we use N pattern selectors to select local patterns with differentscales and use the corresponding codebooks to obtain discrete latent variables for each position. Thecodebooks are made to learn the latent space of the secondary structure by employing the secondarystructure prediction task on them. For inference, we generate peptides from the latent structure spaceby sampling the index sequences on the codebooks. We also try to use some conditions to restrictthe structure motifs to further improve the generation performance.
