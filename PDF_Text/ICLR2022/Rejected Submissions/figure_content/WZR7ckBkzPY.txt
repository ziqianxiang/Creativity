Figure 1: The left figure shows samples from the tar-get 16-GMM distribution and the right figure showssamples obtained by our method. Each plot contains4000 points.
Figure 2: Comparison between the target GMM and fitted measure of generated samples by ourmethod. Samples are projected onto 2D plane by performing PCA. We refer the reader to Mokrovet al. (2021) for the performance of another algorithm in similar setup.
Figure 3: We repeat the experiments for 15 times in dimensions d = 2, 6, 12, 16, 32.
Figure 4: Comparison among exact density, finite difference method solution given by CVXOPT, andthe density given by our method. To better visualize the distributed particles from each distribution,we also plot the histograms of our method as the blue shadow.

Figure 6: Sampling Gaussian mixture models by parameterizing the map by ▽夕.
Figure 7: The steady state is supported on a ring of radius 0.5. Backward converges faster to thesteady rate but is unstable. As k goes large, it cannot keep the regular ring shape and will collapseafter k > 50.
