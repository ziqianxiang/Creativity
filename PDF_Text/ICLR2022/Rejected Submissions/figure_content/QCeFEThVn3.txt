Figure 1: The learning process of our GraphEBM. The detailed annotation is in Appendix A.
Figure 2: Visualization of generated molecules.
Figure 3: Discovered examples with highestQED scores.
Figure 4: (a)&(b) Comparison of QED and plogpdistributions between single-objective generationand random generation, respectively. (c) Com-parison of distributions on QED and plogp be-tween multi-objective generation and random gen-eration.
Figure 5: Examples of constrained property optimization. The values above and below arrowsdenote the similarity scores and improvements, respectively. The modifications are highlighted withred rectangles.
Figure 6: The generation process of our GraphEBM.
Figure 7: Visualization of the implicit generation process of our GraphEBM. The first row denotesatom matrices and the remaining rows represent fours channels of adjacency tensors, correspondingto single, double, triple, and virtual bonds. For better visual results, each atom matrix and adjacencytensor is normalized by dividing by its maximum value.
