Figure 1: Counterfactual generation of Blonde Males using a deep generative model (Karras et al.,2020). CAGE infers the implicit causal structure as Gender → Blonde Hair. Top: The left panelcontains the original image of a blond female, other panels display counterfactual samples wheregender (treatment) is changed to male. Bottom: Equivalent visualizations starting from a non-blond male (left panel) and counterfactually changing hair color (treatment) to blond. Generatingcounterfactual samples that respect the implicit causal structure yields subjectively better samples.
