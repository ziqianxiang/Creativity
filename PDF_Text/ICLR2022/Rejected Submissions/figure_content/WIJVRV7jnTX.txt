Figure 1: In many settings, we have a ‘standard’ model that performs better in-distribution, and a‘robust’ model that performs better out-of-distribution. Simply ensembling these two models (e.g.,by adding their probabilities), gets better ID accuracy than the standard and robust models, andcloses most of the OOD gap. Calibrating the models in-distribution (no access to OOD data) beforeensembling them leads to further improvements. Note that ensembling two standard or two robustmodels does not close the gap and only leads to small improvements.
