In the Electric dataset, each row of the matrix correspondsto a specific residence and the heavy rows are always concentrated on some specific rows; in theGHG data set, each row corresponds to a specific time point and we can select some specific timepoints to be a superset of the heavy rows and then select the heavy rows based on their '2-norm inthis superset.
