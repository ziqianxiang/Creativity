Figure 1: Error of estimated system matrices for different β against time k. The solid lines are themedian among the experiments, and the shades represent the range among the experiments.
Figure 2: The empirical performance of controllers for different β against time k. For each policyπk, the empirical cost Jπk is obtained by approximating the actual cost with random sampling fromthe closed-loop system. The solid lines are the median among the experiments, and the shadesrepresent the interval between the first and third quantiles among the experiments. The purple andbrown dashed lines represent the analytical optimal cost, and the analytical cost of the control-freesystem, respectively.
Figure 3: Comparison between our proposed algorithm (Safe) and the certainty equivalence algo-rithm (CE), in terms of estimation error and policy performance. In a proportion of the experiments,CE causes the estimation error and the policy suboptimality gap to diverge, while our algorithmensures convergence in each experiment.
Figure 4: Illustrative example of oscillation under switching. In this example, t = 1 causes the stateto oscillate, while t = 2 can suppress the oscillation.
