Figure 1: Confusion matrix of the classifications done according to the nearest class mean onCIFAR-10 training set. From left to right, top to bottom; the results belong to the first convolu-tional layer, 1st, 3rd, 10th, 15th and 30th residual block of ResNet-152.
Figure 2: Comparison ofE2CM with existing methods under fixed training time budget of one epochfor ResNet-152 (left) and WideResNet-101 (middle) on CIFAR-10 (top) and KMNIST (bottom).
Figure 3: Accuracy-FLOPs curve on MNIST (left) and Fashion-MNIST (right) for unsupervisedlearning using E2CM. Vertical lines indicate the individual FLOPs of DECs. Each black curve is forone experiment, and the red curve is the average of all experiments.
