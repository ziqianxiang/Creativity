Figure 1: Representing mechanisms in entorhinal-hippocampal system (E-H system for short) andthe framework of spatiotemporal aware embedding model. The proposed STE framework consists ofthree essential parts: the context graph building strategies to construct simplified affinity graphs, thespatiotemporal model to extract rich item-specific spatiotemporal features, and the sequential modelto extract sequential feature embeddings. The uniqueness about our spatiotemporal informationusage is that we represent item from spatiotemporal perspective (not isolated) using observationsand contexts conjunctively.
