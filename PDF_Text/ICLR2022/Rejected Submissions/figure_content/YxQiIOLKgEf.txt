Figure 1: The proposed CFLP learns the causal relationship between the observed graph structure(e.g., neighborhood similarity, considered as treatment variable) and link existence (considered asoutcome). In this example, the link predictor would be trained to estimate the individual treatmenteffect (ITE) as 1 - 1 = 0 so it looks for factors other than neighborhood to predict the factual link.
Figure 2: Causal modeling (not thetarget of our work but related to theidea We propose): Given Z and ob-served outcomes, find treatment ef-fect of T on Y.
Figure 3: Graph learning withcausal model (the proposed idea):leverage the estimated ATE(Y |T)to improve the learning of Z.
