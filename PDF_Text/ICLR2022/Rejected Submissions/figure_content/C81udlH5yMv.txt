Figure 1: A direct acyclic graph (DAG) exhibit-ing our assumptions on the data generating pro-cess. We suppose that the data X is a functionof unobserved generative factors G (e.g., back-ground colors, brightness, noise, shape). Theremay exist some confounders Y and D that areparents of the generative variables. Y is the vari-able that we want to predict. D is the variable wewant to be invariant to. Only X , D and possiblyY are observed at training time. The representa-tion variable Z is a function of the data X thatwe create at training time.
