Figure 1: The overview of EPM-GCN’s computation graph. Φ encodes nodes’ affiliation strength to eachcommunity, which is used to (1) enrich node features with community information (the dashed line) and (2)partition edges via normalized rank factorization (the solid arrows). They are then passed to an array of GCNsto generate node representations that correspond to heterogeneous community-based relations, and finally inte-grated together to optimize the classification task.
Figure 2: Visualization of the spatial distribution of node representations learned by EPM-GCNs on Coraand MUTAG datasets, mapped to 2-D spaCe. (a) and (b) plot the t-SNE projeCtions of nodes’ Community-affiliation sCores (i.e., rows in Φ) at the end of the unsupervised pretrain stage, where nodes are Colored by theirCategories. (C) and (d) plot the t-SNE projeCtions of relation-speCifiC sub-representations of all nodes over alltypes of relations obtained at the end of the supervised finetune stage, the Colors annotate outputs from differentGCN Components in the relational GCN bank (i.e., eaCh Color Corresponds to a relation, eaCh node Correspondsto K points in different Colors). Spatially Clustering of eaCh Colored group supports our Community-based edgepartition and node feature augmentation ((a), (b)), and justifies the learned relation-speCifiC sub-representationsare indeed relation-wise separable.
Figure 3: The average graph classification accuracy of EPM-GCN-g with various settings on the numer ofmetacommunities K ∈ {1, 2, 4, 8, 16}. Results on (a) IMDB-BINARY, (b) IMDB-MULTI, (c) MUTAG, and(d) PTC datasets are shown in the subfigures.
