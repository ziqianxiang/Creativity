Figure 1: Singular value distributions of the test matricesTable 1: α and β values for the test matrices under the three schemes.
Figure 2: Relative singular value errors for the test matrices. Our algorithm is the bold line,randQB_EI is the thin one.
Figure 3: Angle between the top k right singular vectors Vj and their approximations Vj for the testmatrices. Our algorithm is the bold line, randQB_EI is the thin one.
