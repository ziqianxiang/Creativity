Figure 1: Comparing test accuracy over a balanced test set from models trained on imbalanced datawith 5,000 images in the majority class (index 1) and 5-50 images in each of 9 minority classes.
Figure 2: Left: majority class accuracy of models trained in a naive way, with oversampling+mixupand with MetaBalance on the severely imbalanced CIFAR-10 dataset. Right: average accuracy overminority classes for the same models. Solid lines denote test accuracy and dashed lines denote trainaccuracy.
