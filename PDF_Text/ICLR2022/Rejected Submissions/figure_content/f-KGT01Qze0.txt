Figure 1: Illustration of the method. In order to better illustrate the method, We display the Fourierspectrum of the images next to them. We can see that even though 90% of the higher frequenciesbelong to the image of a dog, Robustmix assigns more weight to the boathouse label because itassigns more weight to the lower frequencies.
