Figure 1: Samples from a Generative Posterior Network using a 2D embedding trained on a simplesine-function. On the left are samples from the embedding with corresponding posterior samples onthe right. Black x' represent observed data points.
Figure 2: Predicted posterior distributions of different methods using the same observed data. Em-pirical distributions are constructed using 100 samples for all methods except for the Ensemble-10method, which is only over 10 ensemble members.
Figure 3: Best normalizedsample value for each methodthroughout training averagedacross 5 BO problems and 5 tri-als for each problem.
Figure 4: ROC curves for out of distribution prediction basedon sample variance from 100 samples.
Figure 5: Boxplots of 100 posterior samples from every method for 2 test images, one from a classthat the model was trained on (“In Distribution”) and one from a class that the model wasn’t trainedon (“Out Of Distribution”).
