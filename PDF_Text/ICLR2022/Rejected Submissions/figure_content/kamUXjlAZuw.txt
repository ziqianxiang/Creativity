Figure 1: Trade off between disparity and average loss on adult, german Credit, and loan defaultsdata sets. EaCh Colour Corresponds to a different initialisation, while the symbol’s size Correspondsto the weight λ on disparity in the overall loss funCtion. Results are measures on the train set.
Figure 2: Trade-off between disparity and average loss on Adult, German credit, and Loan defaultsdatasets. Each colour corresponds to a different initialisation, while the symbol’s size correspondsto the weight λ on disparity in the overall loss function. Results are measured on the test set.
