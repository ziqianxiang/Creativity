Figure 1: We display reviews where each word is shaded based on j s(j, ht). Projecting onto U12shows an increase in magnitude for several positive words (blue), whereas projecting onto U34 showsjumps in magnitude around negative words (red). See e.g., amazing, special (blue), mess,waste, muddled (red). We also show two reviews with contextual information which is naturallyhighlighted due to u8 .
Figure 2: We show the median of reconstructions of normal beats when projected to each of the firstfour dominant conjugate pairs of Koopman eigenvectors. The medians (orange, green, red, brown)are plotted on top of the original signals and their reconstruction medians. The dashed black linesindicate important features of the signals which are well captured by the Koopman eigenvectors.
Figure 3: The network reconstructs relatively well both normal and anomalous signals (left), implyingits inner representation is binary. However, the silhouette scores of the Koopman embedding (right)imply that only a single class is being learnt in practice.
Figure 4: On the tasks we consider, our approach approximately reproduces the network classificationoutputs. In particular, we obtain > 99% and > 97% agreement on the sentiment analysis and ECGclassification problems, respectively. See the text for additional details.
