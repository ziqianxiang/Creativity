Figure 1: An approximate minimum entropy coupling. Given marginal distributions PX and PY ,minimum entropy coupling constructs the a joint distribution PX,Y having minimal joint entropy.
Figure 2: A depiction of the structure of MCGs. First, the sender is given a message. Second,the sender is tasked with a MDP, unrelated to the message. Third, the receiver observes the senderâ€™strajectory. Fourth, the receiver estimates the message.
Figure 3: A payoff matrix for a simple MCG.
