Figure 4:	Diagrams describing (a): the duration predictor, (b): Coupling block in normalizng flowsand (c): Prosody diversifying moduleA.1 Prosody predictorTraining It is hard to use the maximum likelihood objective directly to train duration predictorbecause the duration of each phoneme is 1) a discrete integer and a scalar, which hinders expressivetransformation because invertibility should remain in normalizing flow. To train duration predictor,duration values are extended to continuous values using variational dequantization (Ho et al., 2019)and are augmented with extra dimensions using variational data augmentation (Chen et al., 2020).
