Figure 1: Manifold learning in defense3Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2022In the training stage, the models learn the manifold representation of the data and the optimal deci-sion border of classification, taking classification task as an example. The model continuously mapsdifferent images on low dimensions to form a manifold and learns by confirming tags. In the modelchecking stage, the features of the picture are also mapped on low dimensions, and the distancefrom the manifold determined in the learning process is measured to determine the label output bythe model. In the detection stage, the model extracts the characteristics of the input picture and com-pares it with the stored optimal decision border to determine the classification of the input picture.
