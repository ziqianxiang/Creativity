Figure 1: MolSpacE framework: (1)the tested molecule generative model generates novel moleculesby sampling random vector from the latent space and then feeding it into the generator, (2) off-the-shelf property prediction function is used to predict molecular properties from the molecularspace, (3) MolSpacE identifies latent directions which govern molecular properties via the propertyseparation hyperplane.
Figure 2: (a) Molecule clusters in the latent space, the number represents structure similarity (BajUSZet al., 2015), where the red box represents the base molecule, X and y axes denote two randomorthogonal directions to manipulate. (b) Linear interpolation of two (top and bottom) molecules.
