Figure 1: The overall framework of the proposed GMGCN. (a) Model forward propagation consists of five pro-cesses: node-level modeling, node feature redistribution, graph instance modeling, hierarchical graph modelingand consensus loss calculation. (b) During the backward propagation, the distances between graph represen-tations hg obtained via hierGAT and the mean vector μ of each Gaussian weight function will guide graphupdating and further influence the node updating.
Figure 2: 2D visualization of the original node features, the node representations learned by featureClustering, graph Clustering, and GMGCN from 4 randomly sampled graphs in GC4NC4. The dif-ferent shapes represent different graphs and the different Colors represent different node Categories.
