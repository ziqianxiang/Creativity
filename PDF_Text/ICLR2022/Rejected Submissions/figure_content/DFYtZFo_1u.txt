Figure 1: Federated inference: A global label ispredicted collectively based on local data frommultiple owners. Local data may be heteroge-neous and missing data may occur.
Figure 2: Federated inference framework. Local models are trained independently and separatelyfrom the global model. The algorithm is summarized in Algorithm 1 in supplement Section C.
Figure 3: Distributions of prediction en-tropy across local models.
Figure 4: Examples of learned permutation matrices (KT ). All are from Method H.
Figure 5: Time and memory consumption as the matrix size (n, horizontal axis) increases.
