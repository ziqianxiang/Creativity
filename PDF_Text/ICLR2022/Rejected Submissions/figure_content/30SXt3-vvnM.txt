Figure 1: Benefits of kernelized classification. In the second and third images, regions identified by eachclassifier are shown in blue and orange colors. Note that the usual softmax classifier can only separate cap-like“linear” regions on the sphere, whereas our kernelized classifier can do more complex nonlinear classificationthanks to the higher dimensional RKHS embedding of the sphere. See § 6.1 for the experiment details.
