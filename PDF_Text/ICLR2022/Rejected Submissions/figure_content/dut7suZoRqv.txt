Figure 1: Applying SparRL to Zachary,s karate club (Zachary, 1977) graph by setting modularity preservationthe edge reduction goal. Different colors denote different modularity-based partitions, while a node size scaleswith its degree. Modularity partition computed and plotted with Gephi (Bastian et al., 2009)In summary, the contributions of SparRL are the following:•	A novel reinforcement learning-based general-purpose graph Sparsification framework withmodular, task-adaptive, and easily modifiable components;•	Task flexibility because of the plug-in reward function;•	Task scalability as SparRUs time complexity is independent from the size of a graph; and•	Simple to use time v.s. performance trade-offs.

Figure 3: PageRank preservation measures over Spearman,s p. SparRL outperforms all other methods on allcases.
Figure 4: Community structure preservation measures over ARI score. SparRL outperforms all other methodson all cases.
Figure 5: Shortest Path Distance Preservation measured by the average increase of distance between 8196randomly selected pairs. In this figure, as SparRL,s line is below all the others, it increases the SPSP distance theleast and thus outperforms all other methods on all cases.
