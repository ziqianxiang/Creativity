Figure 2: Dense and Sparse Regimes Demonstrated on MNIST and 20newsgroups Data(b) 20newsroups, Unnormalized Norm RatiosThe approach we take here in Theroem 2 is as follows: Note that every element f ∈ F can bewritten as a sumkfA(x,x0) = kgA(x) - gA(x0)k22 = X fj,A(x, x0),	(22)j=1where fj (x, x0) = (g(x)j - g(x0)j)2 ∈ R is the squared difference on the j-th coordinate. For afixed j ≤ k, denote by Gj0 the family of the coordinate functions, gj : Rd → R, where g ∈ G,and by Fj0 the corresponding family of differences fj (x, x0). Note that Gj0 is induced by the samematrix tuples A as the full G, with the exception of the last layer. Similarly to the arguments inTheorem 1, we can obtain bounds on Rn Gj0 from the results in Bartlett et al. (2017). However,then we proceed differently. We first bound Rn Fj0 in terms ofRn Gj0 (Lemma 9, supplementarymaterial), and then use the decomposition (22) to obtain that Rn (F) ≤ P：=i Rn (Fj). The fulldetails are given in supplementary material Section C.
