Figure 1: The Odeen universe. A convenient environment to study and test the process of knowl-edge discovery in machines. Like the night sky was for humans.1 *Galileo did not sketch negative examples.
Figure 2: Odeen Explanatory Learning problem. Given observations and explanations in anunknown language for some phenomena (A), plus a few observations of a new phenomenon, explainthe latter and prove this knowledge by correctly tagging a large set of new samples (B). An empiricistapproach attempts to extract this knowledge from data (C, left); a rationalist one conceives data astheory-laden observations, used to find the true explanation among a set of conjectures (C, right).
Figure 3: Left: Test-time algorithm of CRNs. Right: CRNs are implemented using encoder-decoder transformers blocks, details of the parameters in Appendix B. Right-top: I denotes theinterpreter model (rule encoder and label decoder). Right-bottom: The conjecture generator C G iscomposed by blue blocks. The “radical empiricist” (EMP-R) is composed by orange blocks. The“conscious empiricist” (EMP-C) baseline model consists of all the transformer blocks in the right-bottom figure, board encoder with rule and label decoders (all the blue and orange blocks).

Figure 5: Hamming weight of the binary semantic representation of each rule (a) and each structure(b). We sort them in descending order for visualization purposes.
Figure 6: PCA applied to the binary semantic representation of structures (a) and rules (b). We high-light in red the structures that have two touching pyramids pointing down. To ease the visualization,we pair every structure with a different string of characters. Each character replaces an element ofOdeen according to a well-defined mapping. The rules distribution reflect what can be observed inFigure 5a.
