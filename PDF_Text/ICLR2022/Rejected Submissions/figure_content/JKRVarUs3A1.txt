Figure 1: Comparisons of different methods using linear kernel. Each point of acc-DiODM exceptin Figure (a) indicates the result when every one third of stages executed. Other points except inFigure (e) indicate the result stop at different levels.
Figure 2: Comparisons of different methods using RBF kernel. Each point indicates the result whenstop at different levels.
Figure 3: Comparisons of different gradient based methods.
