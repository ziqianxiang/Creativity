Figure 1: Dataset Visualization. Please zoom-in the figure for better observation. Please note thatthe details of the precipitation map are partially lost due to file compression. Here we plot 2 groupsof typical meteorological phenomena (hurricane and squall) in the dataset. To learn more about thedataset, please visit our project website (coming soon) and supplementary material.
Figure 2:	The pipeline of our proposed baseline model for spatial precipitation downscaling.
Figure 3:	The dynamic property of bench-mark algorithms. The frameWorks of VSRare gathered in the loWer-left corner of thefigure, Which demonstrates that VSR meth-ods are superior to SISR and traditionalmethods in dynamic properties.
Figure 4: Visual comparison with state-of-the-art Super Resolution approaches. Please zoom-in thefigure for better observation. More results can be found in suppl.
