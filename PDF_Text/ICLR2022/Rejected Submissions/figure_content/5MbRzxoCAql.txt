Figure 1: Attention maps of baseline imitation methods and our method, depicted on the CARLAdriving task. Behavioral cloning from single observation (BC-SO) attends to the appropriate visualcues in the scene (the traffic light and pedestrian), but performs suboptimally due to lack of informa-tion. Behavioral cloning from observation history (BC-OH) has access to all required information,but manifests the “copycat problem”; it relies excessively on extrapolating past actions, and failsto attend to important visual cues. Our “coarse-to-fine” imitator combines the advantages of eachmethod, and outperforms both.
Figure 4: The comparison of BC-SO, BC-OH and our model. BC-SO and BC-OH learn the mappingfrom the current observation ot and the observation history ot respectively to the expert action at.
Figure 5: Examples of scenarios with high causal effects. The πθ (do(ζt) = 0.00/0.75) means thatWe manually set the value of Zt to 0.00 and 0.75 respectively, fix the ot and then get the output ofthe πθ. The larger the difference between πθ(do(ζt) = 0.00) and πθ(do(ζt) = 0.75), the stronger thecausal effect of ζt .

Figure 7: The conditional imitation learning architecture we used as our backbone. The input ofBC-SO is the current observation ot and the input of BC-OH is the observation history 0t.
Figure 8: The architecture of our method. For simplicity, we omit the speed prediction module andthe input command when drawing the figures, and sg means stop-gradient.
