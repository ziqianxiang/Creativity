Figure 1: Method overview. Pairs of images with object count ranking labels are used to train aneural network to count and localize objects. Each image xi and xj are passed to the generatormodel and their respective outputs zi and zj are used to calculate Lrank, which provides the weakobject quantity training signal. In addition to this, we include an adversarial density map generationloss, Lgan , which encourages the output of the generator model to have the properties of a densitymap.
