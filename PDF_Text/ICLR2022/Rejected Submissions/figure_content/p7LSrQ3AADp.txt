Figure 1: Our framework offers nine dimensions to characterize and compare saliency methods,which are grouped into three categories corresponding to different phases of the interpretation pro-cess: methodology describes how the saliency is calculated; sensitivity describes relationships be-tween input and output; and perceptibility relates to human interpretation.
Figure 2: Situating methods along dimensions of our framework reveals their multifaceted differ-ences (e.g., SHAP is more minimal but less tractable than VG). Understanding these differences caninform context-specific decisions about how to choose and interpret methods appropriately. It alsoreveals gaps (e.g., SHAP has not been tested for input sensitivity) that can inform future work.
Figure 3: Our framework defines nine dimensions of saliency methods, shown above with examples.
Figure 4: Using our framework, individual methods can be documented in a standardized manner as“saliency cards,” informing users about tradeoffs and limitations, and facilitating rapid comparison.
