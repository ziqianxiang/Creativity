Figure 1: Problem Setup. Comparison between BYOL and DireCtSet(α) on a linear network.
Figure 2: Left: With appropriate weight decay, λp always converge to zero; λs converges to zero when it'sinitialized in the bad basin and converges to positive λ+ when it's initialized in the good basin. Middle: Theevolvement of the eigenvalues of F when it's trained by DirectCopy with e = 0.2 on STL-10. With weightdecay η = 0.0004 (bottom), the eigen-spectrum at epoch 95 has sharp drop; while the drop is much milderwhen η = 0 (top). Right: Similar phenomenon on CIFAR-10 with = 0.3.
Figure 3:	Left: Change of λS when predictor regularization e increases. Right: Eigenvalues of F whentrained by DireCtCoPy under different e on CIFAR-10 for 100 epochs.
Figure 4:	Eigenvalues of F when trained by DirectCopy, BYOL With linear predictor and BYOL With two-layer nonlinear predictor on CIFAR-10 for different epochs. Top-1 accuracy at 500 epoch is 89.62 for Direct-Copy, 88.83 for BYOL with linear predictor and 90.25 for BYOL with two-layer nonlinear predictor.
