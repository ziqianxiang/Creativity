Figure 1: Two GPs with different hyperpara-meters. The left plot shows a GP with high noiseand a long length scale, and the right plot showsa GP with low noise and a short length scale.
Figure 2: Joint posterior of the two hyperpara-meters length scale and noise. The posterior ismultimodal with a low noise, high signal and ahigh noise, low signal mode.
Figure 3: Visualization of the simulators (excl. Ishigami and Hartmann due to the dimensionality).
Figure 4:	Performance across the 10 runs Â±1 standard deviation. The x-axis represents the numberof iterations, and the vertical dotted lines show the reference iterations (also listed in Table 2).
Figure 5:	Visualization of likelihood-ratios and relative change in RMSE (%).
