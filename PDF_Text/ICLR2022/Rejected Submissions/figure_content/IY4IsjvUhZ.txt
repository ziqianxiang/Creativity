Figure 1: Surrogate loss functions.
Figure 2: Disconnectivity graphs showing characteristic LFLs for sigmoid and CE. The vertical axesof the landscapes are not directly comparable, as they correspond to different loss functions.
Figure 3: Disconnectivity graphs showing the LFLs for the alternative surrogate AUC loss functions.
Figure 4: Loss vs AUC correlation for the five different AUC surrogate functions. Minima at lowervalues of loss generally correspond to higher AUC values.
Figure 5: Correlation between CE loss and testingAUC for minima from CE and sigmoid LFLs.
Figure 6: AUC of the best minimum, number of minima of the LFL, difference between appAUCloss value and true AUC, and number of steps per optimiser basin-hopping run for increasing valuesof hyperparameter β in the sigmoid function. The horizontal axes are plotted on a log-scale forvisualisation purposes. The results are smoothed using a 2nd-order Savitzky-Golay filter.
Figure 7: AUC of the best minimum, number of minima of the LFL and number of steps per optimiserbasin-hopping run for increasing values of hyperparameter β in the Exponential function.
