Figure 1: An example of the mask-based updatein IA-MARL when n = 2.
Figure 2: Speaker-Listener environment with a pair of speaker-listener when different training datamissing probability pm and number of pre-training episodes Npre are considered. The training datamissing probability is (a) pm = 0.1, (b) pm = 0.2, (c) pm = 0.3, and (d) pm = 0.4. Figure bestviewed in color.
Figure 3: (a) Speaker-Listener environment with two pairs of agents. (b)-(d) Tag environment, wherethe upper graphs show the average rewards of the prey, and the lower graphs show the average rewardsof the predator. The number of predators is 3 in (b), 4 in (c), and 5 in (d).
Figure 4: Speaker-Listener environment with apair of agents. The average rewards with/withoutthe mask-based update and with GAIN/randomimputation are shown. We use Npre = 104 forGAIN.
