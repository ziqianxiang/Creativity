Figure 1: Overview of transductive universal transport for universal action models. First, we findan optimal mapping from the discrete measure representing unseen actions to the discrete measurerepresenting the mapped test videos. Second, we define the target embedding for each unseen actionas Frechet means over the test videos, weighted by their optimal coupling. Third, We re-positionunseen action embeddings along the geodesic spanned by the original and target embeddings.
Figure 2: Evaluating transdUctive universal transport from seen actions on UCF-101. Left: Theeffect of the number of clusters and the interpolation ratio on the recognition performance, showingthe positive effect of re-positioning unseen actions and the semantic regularization given by thespherical interpolation. Right: An intuition behind the obtained results. Using the original unseenaction embeddings results in large biases during zero-shot inference, here using 1,000 clusters. Without approach, this imbalance is reduced, as indicated by the more even action distributions in theplot and the corresponding higher entropy scores in brackets in the legend.
Figure 3: Fusing action and object information for zero-shot recognition on UCF-101 andHMDB51. Combining universal action and object information benefits zero-shot recognition, withtransductive universal transport preferred regardless of the fusion proportion between both sources.
