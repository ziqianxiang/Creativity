Figure 10: The more homophilic a population is, the more possible cooperation would emerge. Thecooperation proportion and gradient field in the population policy space under different degrees ofhomophily are shown. The increasing volume of the “safe region” and the cooperation proportionincreases with the degree of homophily.
