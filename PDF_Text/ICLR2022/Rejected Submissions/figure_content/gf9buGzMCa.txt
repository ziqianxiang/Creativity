Figure 1: Datasets (a) and (b) together with the learned transformations by each activation functionand layer. When the conditions of Theorem 2 are fulfilled (a), the transformations are similar to theconstruction in the proof. Otherwise (b), the construction in the proof is violated. We report the finaldecision regions, the mean-square error (MSE) and the universal uniform approximation condition(UUAC). Each subplot’s title describes the function which was applied to the previous subplot’s data.
Figure 2: Additional results for Fig. 1 of the main paper. Different input datasets (a) and (b) togetherwith the resulting transformations by each activation function and each layer learned by the neuralnetwork after 500 epochs. We also report the final decision regions, the mean-square error (MSE)and the universal uniform approximation condition (UUAC). When the conditions of Theorem 2 arefulfilled (a), the learned transformations are similar to the construction in the proof of Theorem 2.
