Figure 1: (a) Samples with noisy tasks. Each sample contains two rectangles as tasks and the colormeans whether it is positive or not. There are some noises in each task in the middle of the figure.
Figure 2: (a) Old structure of gradients in the GBDTs. Each rectangle is the G of one sample. As-sume the H equals constant in the square loss and model splits samples by the G; (b) New structureof gradients in the MT-GBM. The arrows in horizontal direction mean the transformation generatingupdating G and the arrows in vertical direction mean the transformation generating ensemble G.
