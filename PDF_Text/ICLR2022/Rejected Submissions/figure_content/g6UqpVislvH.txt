Figure 1: On Euclidean spaces, sinusoids forman orthonormal basis (left) and are used for po-sitional encoding in coordinate-based MLPs. Thesame functions, when applied to other manifold,are distorted and not orthogonal. We propose touse orthonormal basis functions for the underlyingmanifold for positional encoding. For the sphere,we use the spherical harmonics basis (right).
Figure 2: Regressed spherical panoramas. From left to right: no positional encoding, axis-aligned,Gaussian, spherical harmonics (ours) and the ground truth.
Figure 3: Predicted orientation distributions for the cube and icosahedron. Top row shows “IPDF*”and the bottom shows ours. The baseline has several areas of high probability away from the equiv-alent ground truths (marked with solid lines), while our method produces a clean distribution. Weomit the ground truth annotations for the icosahedron to reduce clutter. Refer to Murphy et al. (2021)for details about the visualization.
Figure 4: Rendering spherical light fields on Lego1.5k. Our method using products of spherical har-monics for positional encoding captures high frequency details and produces considerably sharperimages as compared to baselines.
Figure 5: Testing output images(from left to right) with no, Euclidean, Gaussian, and spherical-harmonics encoding and the ground truth (the last column).
Figure 6: Samples from the “Spherical Text" dataset.
Figure 7: Comparison against “Gaussian 3D” for different sizes of encoding and Gaussian scales,on reconstructing the “Spherical Text” dataset. Our spherical harmonics encoding outperforms theGaussian Fourier features in all scenarios. The Gaussian encoding best scale depends on the encod-ing size, which highlights the difficulty to tune these hyperparameters.
