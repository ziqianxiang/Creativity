Figure 2: Adversarial Views: We observe the adversarial views generated during the adversarialattack procedure. Our model gradually rotates the 3D objects to capture less informative views thatcan fool the network. These views are utilized to provide difficulty to the training process and urgethe network to draw more powerful feature representations.
