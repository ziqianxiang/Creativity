Figure 1: Performance of the proposed DGPNet approach on the PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i bench-marks, compared to the state-of-the-art. We plot the mIoU (higher is better) for different number ofsupport samples. For our approach, we show the mean and standard deviation over 5 experiments.
Figure 2: Overview of our approach. Support and query images are fed through an encoder toproduce deep features xS and xQ respectively. The support masks are fed through another encoderto produce yS. Using Gaussian process regression, we infer the probability distribution of the querymask encodings yQ given the support set and the query features (see equations 5-7). We createa representation of this distribution and feed it through a decoder. The decoder then predicts asegmentation at the original resolution.

Figure 5: Qualitative results on challenging episodes in the 1-shot setting from the PASCAL-5ibenchmark.
Figure 6: Qualitative results on challenging episodes in the 1-shot setting from the COCO-20ibenchmark. Human faces have been pixelized in the visualization, but the model makes predic-tions on the non-pixelized images.
Figure 7: Qualitative results of our approach given 1, 5, and 10 support samples. The 1-shot resultsare based on Support 1; the 5-shot results on Support 1 and Support 2-5; and the 10-shot Support1, Support 2-5, and Support 6-10. The results are from COCO-20i and human faces have beenpixelized in the visualization, but the model makes predictions on the non-pixelized images.
