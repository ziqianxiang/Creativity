Figure 1: Diagram of proposed model. MLP - Multilayer Perceptron neural network blocks; RNN - RecurrentNeural Network.
Figure 2: Diagram of the Encoder network composed of an LSTM Encoder and a custom attention layer.
Figure 5: Comparison of bar plots of cluster outcome propensity distributions for the proposed model andbenchmark AC-TPC. On the left (blue), distributions are displayed for each cluster (out of a total of 6), andeach phenotype corresponds to the probability of an outcome. Similar results are shown on the right (yellow)for AC-TPC. The title of each sub-plot indicates the cluster considered, as well as the number of patients as-signed to a given cluster.
Figure 6: Feature-Time Cluster Relevance Map. Each Heatmap represents a feature-time relevance matrix for arandom patient assigned to a given cluster. Vertical Axis indicates time to outcome, in hours, while horizontalaxis indicates different input features.
