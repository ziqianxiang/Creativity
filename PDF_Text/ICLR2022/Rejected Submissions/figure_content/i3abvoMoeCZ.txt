Figure 1: Illustration of near and far Out-of-Distribution data. Top left: CIFAR10 dataset (training).
Figure 2: Diagram of Score functions, Geometric ODIN training and calibration The paperproposes two score functions and an OOD detection and calibration method: Geometric ODIN.
Figure 3: Capturing Covariate Shift (Motion Blur) All results are averaged over 5 runs. Modelingcovairate shift (α-β model) yields the best performance as shown in Fig. 3b. g(x) is more responsiveto covariate shift than h(y, x) as shown in Fig. 3a with the α-β model.
Figure 4: Capturing Concept Shift (CIFAR100 Splits) All results are averaged over 5 runs. Mod-eling concept shift (both α-only and α-β models) yields the best performance as shown in Fig. 4b.
Figure 5: Fig. 5a and Fig. 5b show visualization of a 3-dimensional feature space of a model trainedon CIFAR10. The black cluster represents Gaussian-noise corrupted CIFAR10 data. Fig. 5c showshistogram of pixels of CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and SVHN.
