Figure 1: The model of interest is the tanh network with hidden units H = 576. The data is generatedaccording to p0 (y|x, w) = p(y|x, w0) where w0 = 0. The prior is taken to be N (5.0, 100.0Id). Thepredictive distributions resulting from different variational approximations trained on a dataset ofsize n = 5000 are displayed.
