Figure 2: Training errors for sin(πxι +----+ ∏Xn), single hidden layerand diagonal TMAF neural networks with 3 hidden layers and 400 neurons per layer (except thefirst and last layers). We also consider the tri-diagonal TMAF (denoted by Tri-diag TMAF, seeequation 7) with 3 hidden layers and 300 neurons per layer. The training datasets are 20000 input-output data pairs where the input data are randomly sampled from the interval [-1, 1] based onuniform distribution.

Figure 6: Approximations to sin(100πx) + cos(50πx) + sin(πx), ReLU-typediagonal TMAF as described in Subsection 3.1. Numerical results are shown in Figures 7a, 7b andTable 3. We observe that performance of the TMAF and the ReLU networks are similar. Such abehavior clearly should be expected for a simple dataset such as MNIST.
