Figure 1: The general gradient is intuitively defined in Euclidean space, which means that the di-rection of the general gradient will not be affected by the curvature. On the contrary, the naturalgradient and weak curvature gradient intrinsically contain the curvature of manifolds, although thedefinitions of the manifolds constructing these two gradients are different.
