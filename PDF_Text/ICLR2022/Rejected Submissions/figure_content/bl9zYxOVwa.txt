Figure 2: Measurement of the inter-class similarity and intra-class variance in standard training,PGD-AT and TRADES models.
Figure 3: Results of the single AT experiment. Top line: the classwise errors; Bottom line: the 2-Dfeature representations.
Figure 4: Inter-class similarity of Figure 5: (a) and (b) show the natural/PGD-10 error of bi-standard training model and single nary classification PGD-AT and TRADES models respec-AT models.	tively. Similarity with the class cat in standard training isalso plotted at the green line to see the correlation.
Figure 6: LS and ME can help reduce both the inter-class similarity and intra-class variance in PGD-AT and TRADES.
