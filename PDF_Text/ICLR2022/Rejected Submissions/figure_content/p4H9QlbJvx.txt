Figure 1: Mean JSV (Eq. (1)) of pruned net-works w.r.t. different pruning ratios on theMNIST dataset. Note, with a larger pruningratio, mean JSV is hurt more.
Figure 2: Mean JSV and test accuracy during finetuning with different setups. Note that with OrthP(c, d), mean JSV recovers faster; so does the test accuracy. The pruning ratio in this case is 0.9.
