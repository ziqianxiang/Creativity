Figure 1: (a): representation of the gaussian kernels corresponding to each value sections on eachlatent factor/attribute dimension, in the case of Ndim = 3. Black vertical bars indicate the gl(i)value samples from each gaussian kernels corresponding to the l(i) values instantiated on eachlatent dimension i, to construct the SCS representations of the example stimuli in (b). (b): OHE andSCS representations of example stimuli for a semantic structure/symbolic space with Ndim = 3,d(0) = 4, d(1) = 2, d(2) = 3.
Figure 2: (a): 5-ways 2-shots accuracies on the Recall task with different stimulus representation(OHE:blue ; SCS; orange). (b): Illustration of a discriminative 2-players / L-signal / N -round variantof a referential game.
Figure 3: Left: Instantiation of a dataset of SCS-represented stimuli sampled from the currentepisode’s symbolic space, whose semantic structure is sampled out of the meta-distribution of avail-able semantic structure over Ndim-dimensioned symbolic spaces. Right: illustration of the resulting(meta-)reinforcement learning episode consisting of a series of referential games.
Figure 4: (a): 4-ways (3 distractors) zero-shot compositional test accuracies of different architec-tures. 5 seeds for architectures with DNC and LSTM, and 2 seeds for runs with DNC+Rec andLSTM+Rec, where the auxiliary reconstruction loss is used. (b): Stimulus reconstruction accura-cies for the archiecture augmented with the auxiliary reconstruction task. Accuracies are computedon binary values corresponding to each stimulus’ latent dimension’s reconstructed value being closeenough to the ground truth value, with a threshold of 0.05.
