Figure 1: Fitting a distribution to the histogram of the generation error, which given by the scaleddifference between x0 and the image Xt after t DDPM steps ^ = ，^x0-xt. The model is a pretrainedDDPM (Gaussian) celebA (64x64) model. (a) The fitting of a Gaussian to the histogram of atypical image after t - 50 steps. (b) Fitting a Gamma distribution. (c) The fitting error to Gaussianand Gamma distribution, measured as the MSE between the histogram and the fitted probabilitydistribution function. Each point is the average value for the generation of 100 images. The verticalerror bars denote the standard deviation.
Figure 2: Typical examples of images generated with 100 iterations and η = 0. For models trainedwith different noise distributions - (i) First row - Gaussian noise and (ii) Second row - Gamma noise.
Figure 3: Comparison of generated samples with the (left) Gaussian noise (DDIM) and (right) Gammanoise (DDGM). In each of the nine cases, the two models start from the same noise instance, whichleads to similar output images between the models.
