Figure 1: Generative Adversarial Neural Combinatorial Optimization (GANCO) framework. Weuse 2 adversarial iterations of generation training and optimization training for illustration purpose.
Figure 2: Results of models trained with GANCO on testing sets along the adversarial iterations.
Figure 3: GANCO-AM results ofCVRP100 on distributions generated bythe generation model along the 20 ad-versarial iterations.
