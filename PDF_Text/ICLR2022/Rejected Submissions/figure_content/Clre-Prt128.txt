Figure 1: Exemplary ECG data used for classification. A shows an example of a sinus rhythm(normal ECG) and B shows an example of an ECG exhibiting signs of LBBB. Observe also the highfrequency noise around the baseline which can be filtered using the Fourier transform.
Figure 2: Exemplary waveform (A), real (B) and imaginary (C) spectrogram components from theutterance Stop. Spectrograms are log-magnitude transformed for clarity.
Figure 3: Exemplary reconstruction from a coronal proton-density weighted image of the knee. A:reference image, B: reconstruction model trained non-privately, C: reconstruction model trainedwith ζ -DP-SGD reconstruction.
Figure 4: Gradient norms of the C network calculated using the CR-calculus and of the R2n -network. N “ 100 repetitions. Significantly higher gradient norms are observed when the CR-calculus is not used (Student t-test p “ 0.0043).
