Figure 1: Framework of TransDenoiser: given a clean image x, input perturbation is added to generate per-turbed image z. z is then reconstructed by denoiser g to generate g(z), which is fed into the pre-trainedclassifier h for classification. The input perturbation on x is utilized to achieve certified robustness during test-ing. The denoiser is trained under DP by leveraging the input perturbation added on x and additional gradientperturbation during training.
Figure 2: Comparison among TransDenoiser, baselines and ablation cases for certified accuracy vs. l2 radiion two datasets. The input perturbation scale = 0.25, the overall gradient perturbation scale = 2.0 (≥ 2.0 forTransDenoiser), and guarantee (1.0, 1e-5)-DP for private models.

Figure 4: Comparison among TransDenoiser, baselines and ablation cases for conventional Accuracy vs. e ontwo datasets. The input perturbation scale on CIFAR10 = 0.1, on MNIST = 0.25, attack norm bound = 2.0, theoverall gradient perturbation scale = 2.0 (≥ 2.0 for TransDenoiser), and δ = 1e-5 for DP.
