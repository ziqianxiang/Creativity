Figure 2: Illustration of HSI capturing and reconstruction. An optical system, CASSI (left bluebox, in which a 2D coded aperture and a disperse are displayed while other optical componentsare omitted), compresses the hyperspectral signal F into a 2D measurement Y. For reconstruction(right yellow box), We train the proposed Simple Recon Net (SRN), to learn an E2E mapping fromY (initialized by shifted variants of coded aperture) to F.
Figure 3: Illustration of the proposed Simple Recon Net(SRN). Input go = CONV(Fγ). All the Rk(∙),k =1,..., K, are defined by CONV-RELU-CONV.To maximizeefficiency, rescaling pairs are inserted right after the inter-mediate embeddings, indicated by X. For example, in SRNv2, we do downsample for g4 and then upsample for g12.
Figure 4: Receptive field (RF) dimension and net-work embedding depth comparison (U-Net (Miaoet al., 2019) v.s. Ours). U-Net unnecessarily ob-serves a super large spatial area, at the end,i.e.,532×532, while SRN finally focuses on a suf-ficiently large neighborhood for approximation,compared with the input spatial size denoted asa vertical black bar.
Figure 5: Comparison of reconstructed results for synthetic HSI on the flower Pating scene. Sixstate-of-the-art methods and our proposed method are included. The RGB reference is shown todemonstrate the color (top-left). Our results recover the most details contained in real scene. For thechosen regions a (yellow patch) and b (red patch), density curves of our result (bottom-left) showhighest correlations with the references (0.9792, 0.9975), which indicates the effectiveness of ourmethod within corresponding waveband (yellow: 565nm〜590nm; red: 625nm〜740nm).
Figure 6: Real reconstructed hyperspectral images comparison between λ-net, TSA-NeL GSM-based method and our method from the real-captured CASSI measurement of legoman scene. TheRGB reference is shown to demonstrate the color. By comparison, our results give little distortionand artifact. Within the chosen region a (green patch), our reconstructed pixels yield the highestcorrelation with the reference given by spectrometer, indicating the effectiveness of our methodwithin waveband of green, i.e., 500nm〜565nm.
