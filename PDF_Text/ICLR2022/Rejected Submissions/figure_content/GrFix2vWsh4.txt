Figure 1: The visual improvement of our solution compared to various losses under differentclasses in Cityscapes. The ground-truth is given in the left-most column. A magnified contourof the segmentation is also provided alongside the original target within each image. The numericbelow each image indicates the IoU score for the corresponding prediction result. The examplesshow how Dice has a bias towards small regions, while CE is more stable for different scenarios.
Figure 2: Different label-marginal biases. Theground-truth foreground region proportion is setto 0.1. The expression of penalty DB1 is pro-vided in Appendix B, and corresponds to the two-class (binary) variant of Dice, where the loss isused over the foreground region only. Penalty L1presents better gradient dynamics at the vicinityof label marginal p^Î¹ = 0. Best seen in color.
Figure 3: Visual results on the Retinal Lesions dataset. The ground-truth is depicted in the firstcolumn. At the bottom of each image, we indicate the corresponding obtained DSC score.
