Figure 1: Examples of adversarial samples generated by TI-FGSM (Dong et al., 2019), SGM (Wuet al., 2020), ACE-Ins (Zhao et al., 2020), and Colorfool (Shahin Shamsabadi et al., 2020).
Figure 2: Examples of clean images and their corresponding adversarial example. The adversariallabels are obtained by transferring the modified images to the InceptionResNetV2-ens-adv model.
Figure 3: Examples of different adversarial perturbations styles crafted on the same image by AGV-multi-network with different configurations.
Figure 4: Advesarial samples crafted by SGM (Wu et al., 2020) method. The adversarial perturba-tions creates visible artifacts in the image.
Figure 5: Examples of adversarial samples generated by AGV-multi-network. The adversarial per-turbation does not create artificial patterns in the image.
Figure 6: The effects produced by applying filters individually with default paramters.
