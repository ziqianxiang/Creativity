Figure 1: Test accuracy (%) with ±1 standard error as a function of communication (in GB, inlog-scale). For StackOverflow, we report compression at the end of training, as the learning curvesare based on different subsets of the validation set.
Figure 2: Effect of the bit-width onmodel performance with DP-RECfor clipping targeting ε = 3 after1.5k rounds. The “no-compression”variant communicates a random sam-ple directly from qφ(t) instead of com-pressing it via DP-REC.
Figure 3: Test accuracy (%) as a function of the privacy budget ε (for a fixed δ = 1/N 1.1).
