Figure 1: An example hierarchyfor retail demand forecasting. Theblue triangle represents the sub-tree rooted at the node Store1 withleaves denoted by Item i.
Figure 2: In this figure we show the architectures of our two model components separately. On theleft we show the BD model, where the seq-2-seq model implicitly maintains the basis in a functionalform. Note that the time-series specific weights {Î¸i } are also trained. On the right, we show theTVAR model. The fully connected decoder has a different prediction head for each future time-point.
Figure 3: Left: Plots of the basis generated on thevalidation set of the M5 dataset over 35 days. Right:We plot the true time series over the same time period,and compare it with the predicted time series, ARpredictions and BD predictions.
Figure 4: Coherency metric for all ourdatasets, at all hierarchical levels. Leaf nodemetrics are identically zero, and hence notreported in the table. Leaf nodes for Favoritaand M5 are denoted by L3. Tourism has 5hierarchical levels and hence L3 values arereported in this case.
