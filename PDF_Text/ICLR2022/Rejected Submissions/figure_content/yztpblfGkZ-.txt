Figure 1: Illustration of the BankGCN operator. In each layer, the graph signal x(vm) is decom-posed into a collection of subspaces and processed by an adaptive filter bank to capture distinctfrequency properties. A filter in the filter bank corresponds to an adapted K-hop neighborhoodmessage passing scheme in the spatial domain, as illustrated in (b) and (c).
Figure 2: Illustrations of the frequency responses of the learned filters of BankGCN (s = 8) in thefirst layer of networks. (a)〜(d) are on NCI109 and (e) on FRANKENSTEIN.
