Figure 1: Diagram of the T-Junction environmentWe take an off-policy approach and every policy is an instance of SAC with appropriate action spacesand rewards. Since we learn off-policy every agent can collect the same triplets st, a, st+1, where ais the current action (i.e., either the task action at or the safety action at2,safe). The rewards that thepolicies will receive will differ though. The task policy will receive R1 = R(st, a), the safety policywill get R2 = -L(st, a)-c(at), and the intervention policy rewards are Rint = -L(st, a)-c(a)aint,where aint 〜g2(∙∣st). Note that We chose to use the same triplets for all policies since We useoff-policy algorithms, which allows us to use the acquired data more efficiently.
Figure 2: Empirical evaluation of DESTA and baselines on T-Junction environment. 32 evaluationepisodes were run every 1000 steps and 5 seeds were used per algorithm. Intervention costs of both0.1 and 0.5 were used and learning rates were 0.001. Note that 20 SAC gradient steps were requiredto achieve the reported performance. (a) Average return of evaluation episodes. On this environment,170 is the maximum safe return per episode, obtained by moving through all centre squares, thejunction square and all squares in the safe corridor without turning into the unsafe corridor. Anyhigher means the unsafe corridor was entered. (b) Average cost of evaluation episodes. (c) Averagetraining cost per step so far. (d) Average number of correct (left) goals per evaluation episode.
