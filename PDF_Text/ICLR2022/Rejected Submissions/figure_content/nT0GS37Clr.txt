Figure 1: A single FSL round with three clients and network of 6 edges.
Figure 2: Upper bound on the failureprobability of Vote(.) function in FSL.
Figure 3: Empirical robustness bounds of FSL. Bars are showing the number of votes for a particularedge in first layer of LeNet (trained on MNIST) with selecting 25 clients in each round and nopresence of malicious client. The adversary tries to flip one good edge from the global model. Thehorizontal lines are showing the thresholds for each malicious ratio that if the number of votes isless than them, the adversary can change the decision about this edge.
Figure 4:	Comparing performance of FSL for different subnetwork sizes. k (x-axis) shows the %of weights that each client is including in its subnetwork, test accuracy (y-axis) shows the mean ofaccuracies for all the clients on their test data. The chosen clients in each round send all the ranks tothe server. FSL with subnetworks of âˆˆ [40%, 70%] result in better performances.
Figure 5:	Communication cost Analysis. Please note that the download communication cost of allSFSLs would be the same as FSL.
