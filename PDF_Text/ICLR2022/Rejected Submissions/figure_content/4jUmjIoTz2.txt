Figure 2:	(a) The blue and pink lines denote two sub-models. Each sub-model makes negativepredictions (-) on its left and makes positive predictions on its right (+). The given data will beassigned to the sub-model that has the lowest objective loss. The arrows represent the data assignment.
Figure 3:	Optimization process of the M sub-models in a collaborationfit Data②，because the collaboration can correctly be classified Data② through selecting the pinkmodel as the representative. iii) Data① is correctly classified by both models. The blue model is farfrom Data(D and takes the lowest effort on fitting it; therefore, We assign the blue model to fit Data(1).
