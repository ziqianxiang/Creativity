Figure 1: An example proof with 4 assumptions, 1 goal, and 2 rule applications. Each rule havemultiple premises and one conclusion. Both the premises and the conclusion can have variables thatbind to concrete sentences when the rule is applied.
Figure 3: The minimal complete set of unifiers of two sentences can be empty, finite, or infinite (e.g.,“hello [X]” and “[X] hello”). The minimal complete set of anti-unifiers is non-empty andfinite.
Figure 4: RuleTaker contains ground truth proofs in the form of directed acyclic graphs from theassumptions to the conclusion. The nodes in the graph are concrete sentences without variables.
