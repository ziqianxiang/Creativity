Figure 1: Left: Optimal early stopping time vs. model width d forCIFAR-100 with 20% label noise trained using ResNet networkswith convolutional layers of widths [d, 2d, 4d, 8d]. Right: Testingerror vs. time for CIFAR-100 with 20% label noise trained usingResNet networks using different model widths.
Figure 2: Optimal early stop-ping time vs. hidden layerwidth trained using two-layerReLU networks on randomlygenerated points ofp = 10 clus-ters with 20% label noise.
