Figure 1: PARS: PSeudo-Label Aware Robust Sample Selection. PARS has two stages: (1) First We performrobust warm-up training. (2) We then iteratively obtain pseudo-labels on-the-fly and perform ajoint training withthe original raw labels and self-training with pseudo-labels, filtering the raw labels into ambiguous/noisy samplesand the pseudo-labels into corrected/noisy samples. We apply label-dependent noise-aware loss functions in arobust/negative and positive/negative learning framework for the raw labels and pseudo-labels respectively.
