Figure 1: An illustration of our proposed D2 -GCN technique in onelayer. Specially, Xi ã€œX4 are the 4 nodes in the graph. In this exam-ple, the aggregation and combination phases ofX0 and X2 are skipped(i.e., node-wise skipping as illustrated in Eq. 3) and the hidden fea-tures of X0 and X2 are also skipped in the aggregation phases of theirneighbors (i.e., edge-wise skipping as illustrated in Eq. 5), while theaggregation and combination phases ofX1 and X3 are processed witha precision lower than 32-bits float point (i.e., bit-wise skipping asillustrated in Eq. 4).
