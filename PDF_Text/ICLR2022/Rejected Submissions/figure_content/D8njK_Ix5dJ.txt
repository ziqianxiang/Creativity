Figure 1: Architecture for MMD Representation,MMD Mask and MMD Hybrid. The two bluedashed boxes contain the architectures for MMDMask and MMD Representation respectively, andthe green dashed box contains the architecture forMMD Hybrid, which combines MMD Mask andMMD Representation.
Figure 2: Synthetic data: plots of target y v.s. fea-ture X1 and X2 respectively. Distribution shift ofX1 occurs in blue shaded area and missingnessshift of X1 occurs in pink shaded area.
Figure 3: Synthetic data: residuals v.s. feature X1 and X2 on test set from the baseline model,MMD Representation model, MMD Mask model and MMD Hybrid model. The heatmap shows thesample frequency in each small cell. The black circles and bars represent the average and standarddeviation of residuals in each bucket of X1/X2. Distribution shift of X1 occurs in blue shaded areaand missingness shift of X1 occurs in pink shaded area.
Figure 5: Comparison of masked training datagenerated by MMD Mask and MMD Hybrid withoriginal training and test data. (a) Synthetic data:histograms for feature X1 in original train, testand masked train. (b) The Bike Sharing data: fre-quency percentage of each month in original train,test and masked training data. -1 represents thenew months appearing in test set.
