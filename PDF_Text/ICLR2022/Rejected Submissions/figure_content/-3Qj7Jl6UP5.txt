Figure 1: A schematic example of the filtration. In (a) we introduce three thresholds, 0, 0.5, 1. InF all points below the grey planes are projected to the unit square and in F0 all points above areprojected. (b) is an illustration of the 0.5 level of the filtration F and (c) is is the same for F0. Pointsize and colour indicate the magnitude vector values. In (d) we reconstruct the magnitude vector.
Figure 2: (a) The computation time in seconds of the magnitude vector calculation for each of theten images. Even a small number of patches the computational time deceases drastically. (b) and(c) show box plots of the approximation errors. Although the maximum error can be quite largecompared to the maximum difference of 1, the Frobenius error remains small, indicating a goodoverall approximation.
