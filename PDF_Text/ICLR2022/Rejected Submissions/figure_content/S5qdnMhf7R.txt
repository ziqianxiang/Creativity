Figure 1: The quaternion convolution rule can be expressed as sum of Kronecker products betweenthe matrices Ai that subsume the algebra rules and the matrices Fi that contain the convolutionfilters, with i = 1, 2, 3, 4. In this example, the parameters of Ai are fixed for visualization purposes,but in PHC layers they are learnable parameters.
Figure 2: Loss plots for toy examples. The PHC layer is able to learn the matrix A which describesthe convolution rule for pure quaternions (left) and for full quaternions (right).
Figure 3: Sample spectrograms from L3DAS21 dataset recorded by one microphone with four cap-sules.The first four figures represent the magnitudes while the last four contain the correspondingphases information. The black sections represent silent instants.
