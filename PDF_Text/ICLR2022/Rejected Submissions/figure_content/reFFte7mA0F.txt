Figure 1: NeurADP approach [Shah et al. (2020)]DJV: To ensure scalability, Decomposing the Joint Value function into individual vehicle valuefunctions by extending on the work of Russell et al. [Russell & Zimdars (2003)].
Figure 2: Schematic outlining CEVD’s neighbour aware scoring mechanismwhere γ is the discount factor. Using post-decision state, this expression breaks down nicely:V (St)= maχ(J (St ,at) + YV a (sa));	V a(sa) = E[V (st+ι )|sa ,ξt+ι ]	⑷at∈AtThe advantage of this two step value estimation is that the maximization problem in Equation 4can be solved using a Integer Linear Program (ILP) with matching constraints indicated in ex-pression 2. Step D of Figure 1) provides this aspect of the overall algorithm. The value functionapproximation around post-decision state, V a (sta) is a neural network and is updated (Step E ofFigure 1) by stepping forward through time using sample realizations of exogenous information(i.e. demand observed in data). However, as we describe next, maintaining a joint value functionis not scalable and hence we decompose and maintain individual value functions.
