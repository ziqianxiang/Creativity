Figure 1: Comparison of CoLLIE to Zero-shot and Few-shot learning. Green boxes show wherecontinual learning is taking place.
Figure 2: The CoLLIE transformation.
Figure 3: A principled illustrated of the intu-ition behind CoLLIE.
Figure 4: Performance of the model over five rounds of training on the LAD dataset (averaged over50 iterations, 95% CI), where âˆ£Ctrain | = 50. One training example per category is added per round.
Figure 5: Performance of the model over 30 rounds of training (averaged over 3000 iterations) Whentraining on the colored tangrams (95% CI). One new training example is added per round.
Figure 6: t-SNE dimensionality reduction of the colored tangram CLIP embeddings.
Figure 7: Performance (MRR) on individual tangram shapes and their synonyms. Both the originalzero-shot performance of CLIP (over the 85 candidates), and the performance of CoLLIE (aftertraining on 30 examples with the original names), are shown.
