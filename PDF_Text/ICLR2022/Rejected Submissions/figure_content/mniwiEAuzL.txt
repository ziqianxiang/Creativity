Figure 1: Bandits We plot the probability of action a* for the X policy and b* for the y policy. Results areaveraged over 10 seeds. Alesia: Experiments in a Alesia with length L = 3 and coin budget C = 6. Thesuboptimality gap on the vertical axis is maxy V x,y (s0) - V * (s0) for x and | minx V x,y (s0) - V *(s0)| for ywhere s0 is the initial state that is deterministic in Alesia. Results are averaged over 5 seeds.
