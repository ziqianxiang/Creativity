Figure 1: Example global model with neural networks and its local view. a) To obtain a y predictionfor a data sample x, each party m feeds the local features of x, xm , into a neural network. The outputof this neural network is the embedding hm (θm ; xm). All embeddings are then fed into the servermodel neural network with parameters θ0 . b) When running C-VFL, Party 1 (in green) only has acompressed snapshot of the other parties embeddings and the server model. To calculate y, Party 1uses its own embedding calculated at iteration t, and the embeddings and server model calculated attime t0 , the latest communication iteration, and compressed with Cm .
Figure 2: C-VFL when compressing to 2 bits per component. We show test F1-Score on MIMIC-IIIdataset and test accuracy on ModelNet10 dataset, plotted by epochs and communication cost (MB).
