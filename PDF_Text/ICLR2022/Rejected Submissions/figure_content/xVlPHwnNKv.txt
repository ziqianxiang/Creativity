Figure 1: Toy examples. The first row is the toy example 1 and the second row is the toy example2. The first column is the trajectories of θ and w (The contours are for L(θ, w) value). The secondcolumn is the trajectories of θ and w w.r.t different episodes (The contours are for J (θ, w) value).
Figure 2: Ablations on averageretUrns in different degrees of thediagonal block approximation.
Figure 4:	Average running time per episode of different methods. The enlarged training time perepisode of different methods is shown in Appendix H.
Figure 5:	Ablations of average returns on different Hessian approximation approaches. SDDPG-CG(ours) does not be conducted in HalfCheetah due to its long training time.
Figure 6: Ablations on different Hessian approximation approaches and SDDPG approaches.
Figure 7: The trajectories of θ and w for toy example 1 and toy example 2 (The contours are forJ(θ, w*) value).
Figure 8: Ablations on losses of the critics for different methods.
Figure 9: Average running time per episode of different methods. The first row (a-c) is the trainingtime per episode of different methods without SDDPG. The second row (d-f) is the training time perepisode of all the methods.
