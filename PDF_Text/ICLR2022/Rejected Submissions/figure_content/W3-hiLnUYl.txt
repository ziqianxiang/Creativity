We ShoWthe accuracy, AUROC and rAULC on the corruptionS gauSSian_noiSe (gn) and motion_blur (mb)againSt the corruption Severity. While all methodS, except DCU, demonStrate a Similar accuracy,DUMS - in particular methodS baSed on generative modeling of hidden repreSentationS - yield WorSecalibration. DUQ did not converge on CIFAR100. Other corruptionS are included in the Supplement.
Figure 2: We analySe the SenSitivity of DUQ (13), SNGP (15), MIR (20) and DDU (19) to theirregularization Strength. Therefore, We train modelS on MNIST and evaluate on continuouSly Shifteddata by rotating from 0 to 180 degreeS in StepS of 20 degreeS. We plot the accuracy on the unperturbedteStSet againSt the rAULC computed uSing data from all levelS of perturbation. Only for MIR WeobServe a clear, poSitive correlation betWeen regularization Strength and calibration. For DDU andSNGP, Smaller regularization parameter denoteS Stronger regularization.
Figure 3: Softmax entropy, ensembles (27), MC dropout (7), SNGP (15), MIR (20), DDU (19) onCityscapes-C (74). We show the mIoU, AUROC and rAULC on the corruptions gaussian_noise(upper) and motion_blur (lower) depending on the corruption severity. While all methods demonstratea similar mIoU, DUMs - in particular methods based on generative modeling of hidden representations- yield worse calibration across corruption severities. Other corruptions are in the supplement.
Figure 4: Softmax entropy, ensembles (27), MC dropout (7), SNGP (15), MIR (20), DDU (19)on CARLA-C (74). We show the mIoU, AUROC and rAULC for each method on the corruptions"time of day" (upper) and "rain" (lower) depending on the corruption severity. While all methodsdemonstrate a similar mIoU pattern, DUMs - in particular methods based on generative modeling ofhidden representations - yield worse calibration across corruption severities.
