Figure 1: A cubic fence C in the latent space ofVanilla-VAE trained on the Wiki dataset, with drset at 3 to facilitate visualisation (cf. § 4). C,whose 12 edges are illustrated by dashed lines,surrounds the dimensionally reduced expectationof three encoded training samples. Solid lineswithin the cube indicate the traversed paths.
