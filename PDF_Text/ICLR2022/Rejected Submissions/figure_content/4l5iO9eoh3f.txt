Figure 1: Histograms over the fleet sizes used for solving the VRP. Our approach (blue) is able to solve the VRPwith 20, 50, 100 customers with 4, 7 and 11 vehicles respectively, while the baseline approaches (see section 5)utilize considerably more vehicles. Our approach (orange) refers to the setting of where we ensure a solution tobe found (see section 4.3)The contributions of this work can be summarized as follows:â€¢	Tour-plan construction approach for the capacitated VRP with fixed Vehicle Costs: Wepropose a deep learning framework that learns to solve the NP-hard capacitated VRP andconstructs a complete tour-plan for an specified fleet size. In this way it ensures to solve theproblem for an apriori fixed number of vehicles.
