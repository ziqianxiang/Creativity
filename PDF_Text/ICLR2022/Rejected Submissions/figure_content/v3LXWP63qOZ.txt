Figure 1: Model Invariance (ModInv) A com-mon representation fÎ¸ supports multiple predictorheads, each with a different learning rate. Eachhead is optimized based on the task objective (e.g.,SSL loss) and captures different spurious correla-tions. As diversification in learning of predictorheads increases, the common representation mustbe optimal to reduce the loss for all predictors.
Figure 2: ModInv for Reinforcement Learning. Left: The key idea is to use multiple models of the nextencoded state, each grounded with its own reward decoder. At any training iteration, only one of the heads istrained for the sampled batch of observations. Each head is also independently initialized and uses a differentlearning rate w.r.t. the other heads. Right: Natural Distractor in the background for different tasks from DMCSuite.
Figure 3: ModInv for Vision. The key idea is to usemultiple projectors for both the online and target net-works. At any training iteration, only one of the heads istrained for the sampled batch of data. Each head is alsoindependently initialized and uses a different learningrate w.r.t. the other heads.
