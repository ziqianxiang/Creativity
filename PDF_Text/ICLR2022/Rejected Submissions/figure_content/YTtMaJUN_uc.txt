Figure 1: Illustration of our Lifelong User Representation Model (LURM) for user understanding.
Figure 2: Illustration of the multi-anchor module in SMEN. The module outputs a group of diverserepresentations by assigning different portions of each ‘interest’ to different anchors. The • de-notes the dot product operation, 0 denotes the scalar multiply operation, and ㊉ denotes vector sumoperation.
Figure 3: Comparison of LURM with inputs of different lengths on several downstream tasks. Thetwo figures show the results in terms of AUC and ACC respectively.
