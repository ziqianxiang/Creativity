Figure 1: Meta-learning dynamic forecasting onturbulent flow. The model needs to generalize to aflow with a very different buoyant force.
Figure 2: Overview of DyAd applied to two inputs of fluid turbulence, one with small external forcingand one with larger external forces. The encoder infers the time-shift invariant characteristic variablez which is used to adapt the forecaster network.
Figure 3: Illustration of theAdaPad operation.
Figure 4: Target and predictions by Unet-c, Modular-wt and DyAd at time 1, 5, 10 for turbulentflows with buoyancy factors 9 (left) and 21 (right) respectively. DyAd can easily generate predictionsfor various flows while baselines have trouble understanding and disentangling buoyancy factors.
Figure 5: DyAd, ResNet, U-net, PredRNN veloc-ity norm (7U + V2) predictions on an ocean currentsample in the future test set.
Figure 6: Outputs from DyAd while wevary encoder input but keep the forecasterinput fixed. From left to right, the encoderis fed with flow with different buoyancyfactor c = 5, 15, 25. the forecaster net-work input has fixed buoyancy c = 15.
Figure 7:	Detail of the DyAd encoder. The conv3D layers are shift equivariant and global meanpooling is shift invariant. The network is approximately invariant to spatial and temporal shifts.
Figure 8:	Detail of one block of the forecaster network.
