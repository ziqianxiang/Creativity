Figure 1: The tripartite graph representation and the graph-based machine learning model(b) Graph-based modelDifferent sets of nodes have different features. The feature hl ∈ RN , l ∈ L of suborder node l isan N -dimensional one-hot vector, representing the order that it belongs to. The suborders under thesame order share the same feature. N denotes the maximum size of orders the model is designed tohandle. The feature hk ∈ RM , k ∈ K of warehouse node k is an M -dimensional one-hot vector,representing the different warehouse identification codes (ids). M denotes the maximum size of thewarehouses that the model is designed to handle. The feature hj = [Pj, Wj], j ∈ J of item node j isa two-dimensional vector that consists of the purchase price and weight of the corresponding item.
Figure 2: Boxplot of inference results on test setsis	computed using equation (1a) based on the order fulfillment result. A smaller gap means a betterassignment policy.
Figure 3: An example case with 60 orders (92 suborders, orange points) and 14 warehouses (bluepoints). The cost gap in this example is 3.52%.
