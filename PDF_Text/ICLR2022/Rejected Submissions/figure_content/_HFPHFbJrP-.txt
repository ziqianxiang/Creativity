Figure 2: Results of different smoothing distributions using our W-distance method. Sigma standsfor variance for Gaussian distribution and the norm range for uniform distribution.
Figure 3: Results on sample amounts with different smoothing distributions using W-distance.
Figure 4: An example of a spherical cap in blueLemma G.3. K is a l2 norm ball centered at original point of radius r, then K ∩ (Z + K) = 0 ifand only if ||z ||2 > 2r.
Figure 5:	Graphs of functions f1 (t)	=	(1 — √tn )n,f2 (t)	=((nT)+/；/-(n-1))	(1-√ntn-(nT)) when n = 4,16, 64 from left to right. Accord-ing to the figure, on interval [ Jnn∙1, 1], f2(t) is greater than f1 (t) at first and then f2(t) exceedsf1 (t). Furthermore, as n increases, the horizontal coordinate of the intersection point converge to 1,which can be seen intuitively from the figure above.
Figure 6: Comparing the volume of a ball with that of its central slicewhere the second equality is due to Stirling,s formula for Γ(1 + d--1) and Γ(1 + d); the third equalityjust eliminate the exponential of 2 and Γ(1 + P). Thus, We conclude that the slice has volume about1eP when d is large.
