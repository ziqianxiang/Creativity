Figure 1: A Reconstruction game of 2 attributes with 2 values per each. Vocabulary consists of 2symbols and messages has a length of 3. Each symbol in the message, and values of the attributesare represented as one-hot encoded vectors.
Figure 2: Variation of test accuracy with the topological similarity constant Ct for linear Listener.
Figure 3: Variation of test accuracy with the topological similarity constant Ct for recurrent Listener.
Figure 4: Transmission speed of new listeners. For a given test accuracy, transmission speed ishigher for languages trained with higher topological similarity constant.
Figure 5: Variation of test accuracy against test topological similarity. We plot each experimentâ€™stopological similarity and accuracy that converged to a training accuracy greater than 0.95.
