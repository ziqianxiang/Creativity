Figure 1: HYBRID MODEL. Cheap base (b)and routing models (r) run on, e.g., a micro-controller; Expensive global model (g) runs on,e.g., a cloud server. r uses x and features of bto decide if g is evaluated or not.
Figure 2: Base FLOP gains in the hybrid systemEmpirical Validation. Proposed above is a novelend-to-end methodology to design and train resource-efficient hybrid architectures and models that can per-form at SOTA accuracy whilst satisfying hardwareat different levels of accuracy w.r.t. a stand-alonemodel, collated from Tables 1 and 3 (see AppendixÂ§B.5 for details); 3 in 10 examples routed to acloud model, a 70% reduction in communicationlatency w.r.t. purely cloud-based service.
Figure 3: Plot for FLOPs vs accuracy under no resource constraints. Each intermediate point for the baselinerequires expensive training and fine-tuning. In addition, OFA requires an evolutionary search to find the model.
Figure 4: Evolutionary search based hybrid OFA-models with hybrid FLOP constraints: 150M, 250M, & 350M.
