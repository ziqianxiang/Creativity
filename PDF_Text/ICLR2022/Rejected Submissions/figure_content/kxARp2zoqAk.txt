Figure 1: InfoTS is composed of three parts: (1) candidate transformation that generates differentaugmentations of the original inputs, (2) a meta-network that selects the optimal augmentations,(3) an encoder that learns representations of time series instances. The meta-network is learned intandem with contrastive encoder learning.
Figure 2: Illustration of the criteria. (a) The proposed criteria have two components: high fidelity,and variety. Fidelity is represented by the area of A+B, the mutual information between augmenteddata v and label y. Variety is denoted by A+D, the entropy of v conditioned on the raw input x.
