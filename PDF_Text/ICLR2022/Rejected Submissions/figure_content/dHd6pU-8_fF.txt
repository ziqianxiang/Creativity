Figure 1: The classification results on the IRIS dataset. (a) Training loss of the network. The y-axisrepresents the negative log-likelihood loss and the x-axis represents the number of epochs. (b) Theclassification accuracy for each method, i.e., the percentage of testing samples correctly predictedin the testing dataset.
Figure 2: The classification results on MNIST. The y-axis represents the classification accuracy onthe MNIST dataset, and the x-axis represents the number of epochs. (a) Training response. (b)Testing response.
Figure 3: The plots above show the classification results on the Fashion MNIST dataset. We run thisexperiment for 20 epochs. In this experiment, the proposed method is comparable to L-BFGS butoutperforms the adaptive methods.
Figure 4: The classification results on CIFAR10. (a) The y-axis represents the training cross-entropyloss, and the x-axis represents the number of batches. (b) The y-axis represents the testing responseaccuracy and the x-axis represents the number of epochs.
Figure 5: This graph represents the training accuracy on the training samples. The x-axis showsthe number of epochs and the y-axis represents the accuracy (Mean-Squared error). (a) shows theinitial training error and (b) shows the final training error.
Figure 6: The testing accuracy on MNIST dataset. y-axis represents the Mean-Squared Error losson the testing set and x-axis represents the number of epochs. (a) shows the initial testing response.
Figure 7: Timing analysis for CIFAR10. (a) Evolution of model accuracy with respect to time (x-axis is time in seconds and y-axis is accuracy of prediction in percentage). (b) Computational costfor each epoch (the x-axis corresponds to epochs and the y-axis is time).
