Figure 1: An illustration of our initial assessments via sampling marginal contributions. For each MCsampling step, we iteratively remove one layer edge until all layer edges are removed. In this example,the removed layer edges are shown in bold and purple lines while the corresponding message flowsare shown in arrow lines. For example, in the first iteration, we remove the layer edge between v1and v2 from the first GNN layer and compute the marginal contribution. Then three message flowsare removed and the contribution scores are averaged and assigned to these three message flows.
