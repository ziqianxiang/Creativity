Table 1: Performance ofDARTS and DARTS-ES.
Table 2: Effect of regularization for dispar-ity estimation. Search was conducted onFlyingThings3D (FT) and then evaluated onboth FT and Sintel. Lower is better.
Table 4: DARTS vs. RobustDARTS onthe original DARTS search spaces. Weshow mean ± stddev for 5 repetitions(based on 4 fresh subruns each as in Ta-ble 3); for the more expensive PTB wecould only afford 1 such repetition.
Table 5: Validation (train) and test accuracy on CIFAR-10 of the search and final evaluation models,respectively. The values in the last column show the maximum eigenvalue λαmax (computed on arandom sampled mini-batch) of the Hessian, at the end of search for different maximum drop pathprobability). The four blocks in the table state results for the search spaces S1-S4, respectively.
Table 6: Performance of architectures found by DARTS (-ES / -ADA) vs. RandomNAS with weightsharing. For each of the settings we repeat the search 3 times and report the mean ± std of the 3found architectures retrained from scratch.
