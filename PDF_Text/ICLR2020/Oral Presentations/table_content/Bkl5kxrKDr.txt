Table 1: Theory overview. SP and MP, resp., denote single and multi-population games. BR and PBR,resp., denote best response and preference-based best response. ^Defined in the noted propositions.
Table 2: Symmetric zero-sum game used toanalyze the behavior of PSRO in Example 1.
Table 4: Game of Chicken payoff tablePrisoner’s Dilemma The Prisoner’s Dilemma provides a counterexample that the support of α-Rank- in the multi-population case - does not include the full support of correlated equilibria.
Table 5: Prisoner’s Dilemma payoff tableThis game has correlated equilibria that include (C,D), (D,C) and (C,C) in their support; nevertheless,α-Rank only puts weight on (D,D), effectively being fully disjoint from the support of the correlatedequilibria.
