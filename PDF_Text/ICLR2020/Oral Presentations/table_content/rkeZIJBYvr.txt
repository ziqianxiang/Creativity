Dataset encoding Finally, we perform an ablationstudy of the proposed task encoding network. Theresults in Table 6 show that the proposed hierarchi-cal encoding scheme for classification dataset, withset cardinality and variance is significantly more ef-fective than simple mean-pooling methods (Zaheeret al., 2017; Edwards & Storkey, 2017)4.
