Table 2: Comparison of test error (%) between cSG-MCMC with parallel algorithm (M=4 chains)on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. The method is reported in the format of “step-size schedule (cyclicalor decreasing) + single/parallel chain”. The cost is reported in the format of “#epoch per chain /#epoch used in all chains”. Note that a parallel algorithm with a single chain reduces to a non-parallel algorithm. Integration of the cyclical schedule with parallel algorithms provides lower test-ing errors.
Table 3: Comparison on the testing set of Ima-geNet. cSGHMC yields lower testing NLL thanSnapshot and SGHMC.
Table 4: Mode coverage over 10 different runs, ± standard error.
