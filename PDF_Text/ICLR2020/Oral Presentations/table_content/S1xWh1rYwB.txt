Table 1: Degradation (deg.): Integral between LeRF and MoRF in the degradation benchmark fordifferent models and window sizes over the ImageNet test set. Bounding Box (bbox): the ratioof the highest scored pixels within the bounding box. For ResNet-50, we show no results forPatternAttribution and LRP as no PyTorch implementation supports skip-connections.
Table 2: Hyperparameters for Per-Sample Bottleneck. The layer notations for the ResNet-50 aretaken from the original publication (He et al., 2016). The first index denotes the block and the secondthe layer within the block. For the VGG-16, conv_n denotes the n-th convolutional layer.
Table 4: Influence of β on the information loss LI and the test accuracy on ResNet-50. k is the sizeof the feature map, i.e. k = hwc. Initial: Configuration of the untrained bottleneck with α = 5.
