Table 1: Results from prior work, the ablation study and the proposed model. Mean opinion scoresfor natural speech, WaveNet and Parallel WaveNet are taken from van den Oord et al. (2018) and arenot directly comparable due to dataset differences. For natural speech we present estimated FDSD-non-zero due to the bias of the estimator - and theoretical values of KDSD and cKDSD. CFDSDis unavailable; see Appendix B.2.
Table 2: Architecture of GAN-TTSâ€™s Generator. t denotes the temporal dimension, while ch denotesthe number of channels. The rightmost three columns describe dimensions of the output of thecorresponding layer.
