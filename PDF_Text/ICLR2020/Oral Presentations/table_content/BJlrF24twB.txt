Table 1: Overview of the features supported in the first release of BackPACK.
Table 2: Test problems considered from the DeepOB S library (Schneider et al., 2019).
Table 3: Best hyperparameter settings for optimizers and baselines shown in this work. In the Mo-mentum baselines, the momentum was fixed to 0.9. Parameters for computation of the running aver-ages in Adam use the default values (β1, β2) = (0.9,0.999). The symbols ✓ and X denote whetherthe hyperparameter setting is an interior point of the grid or not, respectively.
Table 4: Overview of the features supported in the first release of BackPACK. The quantities arecomputed separately for all module parameters, i.e. i = 1, . . . , L.
