Figure 1: An iteration of convex layerwise adversarial training. Latent adversarial example x01 isfound in the convex region C1 (x) and propagated through the rest of the layers in a forward pass,shown with the blue line. During backward pass, gradients are propagated through the same layers,shown with the red line. Note that the first convolutional layer does not receive any gradients.
Figure 2: Projection to a region based on linear relaxation using change of variables.
Figure 3: Effect of proposed convex layerwise adversarial training. After each stage of the training,we attack the model with a latent adversarial attack on each of the layers. Note that layer 0 representsstandard PGD attack (attack in the input space).
