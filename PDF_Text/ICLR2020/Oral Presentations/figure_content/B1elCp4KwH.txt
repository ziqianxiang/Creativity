Figure 1: Diagram of the ResDAVEnet-VQ model. On the left, we show the placement of the vectorquantization blocks in the audio branch. Note that each “Res” block is comprised of a stack ofmultiple sub-layers (see Harwath et al. (2019) for details). The right half of the figure depicts thequantization mechanism of each VQ block, as well as the bypass path when the block is disabled.
Figure 2:	R@10 and ABX tracked at various training epochs. The “0" model achieves a final R@10of .735, with ABX scores of 19.77, 11.35, 10.86, and 14.05 for the conv1, res2, res3, and res4 layers.

Figure 5: Two different captions containing the phrase “many people.” In both cases, the VQ4 layerinfers the same unit sequence (872, 360, 712, middle transcription) beneath the phrase. The VQ3units are somewhat noisier, but contain the common subsequence (956, 265, 80, 401, 262, 762, 246,774, 828, 386, bottom transcription).
Figure 6: Two different captions containing word “train”. In both cases, the VQ4 layer infers thesame unit sequence (680, 248, top transcription) surrounding the word “train”. The VQ3 alignmentscontain the same common subsequence (358, 306, 908, 564, 950, 770, bottom transcription). Noticethat the same (358, 306) VQ3 unit sequence is aligned to the /tr/ phone cluster at the beginning ofboth instances of the word “train,” as well as the /tr/ at the beginning of both instances of “tree” inFigure 7. Unit 358 is also found covering the /tr/ at the beginning of the word “tracks” in the topmostspectrogram (although unit 306 is absent in this case).
Figure 7: Two different captions containing word “trees”. In both cases, the VQ4 layer infersthe same unit sequence (8, 412, 50, top transcription) surrounding the word “trees”. The VQ3alignments contain the same common subsequence (358, 306, 648, 677, 730, bottom transcription).
