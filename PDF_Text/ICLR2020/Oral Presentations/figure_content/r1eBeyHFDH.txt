Figure 3: T-SNE Visualization and AUC of predicted sensitive attributeE Minimality of Predictive FamilyDefine Vχ→p(γ) = {g : X → P(Y)∣∃f ∈ V,∀x ∈ X,g[x] = f [x]}. Similarly define V0→p(γ)={g : 0 → P(Y)∣∃f ∈ V,g[0] = f [0]}. Intuitively, Vχ→p(γ)(resp. V0→p(γ)) restricts the domainof functions in V to X (resp. 0).
