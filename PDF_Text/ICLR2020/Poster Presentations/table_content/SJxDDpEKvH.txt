Table 2: FID analysis of BEGAN hybrids. Distance between different pairs of classes (R: Real data,G: Generated data, Ck: Hybrids by intervention on cluster k). The distances are is computed forbalanced number of examples (10k) for each class and normalized by the FID between the real dataand the generated data. It can be seen in the table that Hybrids have a small distance to the generatedand also to each other. This can be interpreted as closeness of the distribution of Hybrids to that ofgenerated data suggesting that Hybridization produces visually plausible images.
Table 3: The classification outcome of several discriminative models for three randomly chosenkoala+teddy hybrids (see Figure. 17). The purpose of this experiment is to investigate the use ofthe proposed intervention procedure for assessing robustness of classifiers. As can be seen in thefollowing images, the resultant hybrids are roughly a teddy bear in a koala context. An ideal classifiermust be sensitive to the object present in the scene not the contextual information. A teddy bear muststill be classified as a teddy bear even if it appears on a tree which is the koala environment in mostof the koala images in the ImageNet dataset. It can be seen in the following table that nasnetJarge ismore robust to the change of context compared to other classifiers.
