Table 2: Spatial resolutionSpatial resolution (Physical Intuition) For a typ-ical particle-grid simulation in CFD, the resolutionof the grid and the number of particles are corre-lated. Making sure that each grid cell should containenough number of particles (e.g., 1-2 particles per83	163	32394.4	95.4	95.16.8	1.6	1.085.4	86.1	86.221.4	5.2	1.7ModeINet10 Acc (1024 PntS)ModelNet10 pnts per cellShapeNet mIoU (2048 pnts)ShapeNet pnts per cellcell), ensures information exchange between these two discretizations is accurate. Empirically, anoverly refined grid will lead to inaccurate Eulerian convolution due to the large bulk of empty cells,while an overly coarse grid will dampen the motion of particles due to artificial viscosity (e.g., seeEvans & Harlow (1957); Brackbill et al. (1987)), which makes the number of particles per cell ppca key hyperparameter.
