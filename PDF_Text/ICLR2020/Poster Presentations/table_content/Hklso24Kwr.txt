Table 1: Average test classification accuracy of the last two tasks in each of the six experiments:Permuted MNIST, Split MNIST, Split notMNIST, Split Fashion-MNIST, Omniglot and CIFAR-100,followed by the corresponding standard error. A bold entry denotes that the classification accuracyof an algorithm is significantly higher than its competitors. Significance results are identified usinga paired t-test with p = 0.05. Average classification accuracy resulting from CLAW is significantlyhigher than its competitors on the 6 experiments.
