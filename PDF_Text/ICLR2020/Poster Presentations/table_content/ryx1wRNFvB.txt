Table 1: Test losses (bpc) on language modeling benchmarks. The numbers represent mean ± s.e.m.
Table 2: Henrici indices, d( W), of trained RNNs initialized with orthogonal recurrent connectivitymatrices. The numbers represent mean ± s.e.m. over all successfully trained networks. We definetraining success as having a validation loss below 50% of a random baseline model. Note that by thismeasure, none of the orthogonally initialized RNNs was successful on the copy task (Figure 3d).
Table 3: Test losses (bpc) on language modeling benchmarks using 3-layer LSTMs (adapted fromMerity et al. (2018a;b)) with different initialization schemes. Other experimental details were identicalto those described in 3.1.2 above. The numbers represent mean ± s.e.m. over 3 independent runs.
