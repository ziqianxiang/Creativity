Table 1: Hyperparameters for SVGH	ExperimentsH. 1 Additional Details on the SVG baselineFor the stochastic value gradients SVG(0) baseline we use the same policy parameterization as forour algorithm, e.g. we have∏θ = N (μθ(s),σ2 (S)I),where I denotes the identity matrix and σθ(s) is computed from the network output via a softplusactivation function.
