Table 1: Certified radii produced by the Randomized Smoothing method for Shadow Attack imagesand also natural images (larger radii means a stronger/more confident certificate).
Table 2: “Robust error” for natural images, and “attack error” for Shadow Attack images using theCIFAR-10 dataset, and CROWN-IBP models. Smaller is better.
Table 3: Certified radii statistics produced by the Adversarially Trained Randomized Smoothingmethod for our adversarial examples crafted using Shadow Attack and the natural examples (largerradii are better).
