Table 1: Summarization of variational estimators of mutual information. The ∈ ∆(Q) columndenotes whether the estimator is a valid density ratio wrt. Q. (X) means any parameterization isvalid; (n → ∞) means any parameterization is valid as the batch size grows to infinity; (tr → ∞)means only the optimal parametrization is valid (infinite training cost).
