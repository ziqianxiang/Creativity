Table 1: Experimental results: accuracy vs. verified accuracy using IBP, for different training meth-ods. All models tuned for verified accuracy, numbers in %.
Table 2: Computational cost of verification. Left: time elapsed (1 GPU) for evaluating 300 SNLIsamples, without cross-sample batching. Right: worst-case number of forward passes. L: sequencelength; b: beam width.
Table 3: Oracle on SNLI sequences up to 12 tokens. Numbers in %.
