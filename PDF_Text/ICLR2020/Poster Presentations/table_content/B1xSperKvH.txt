Table 1: Classification results (Top-1) for CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and ImageNet data sets. Column-1shows the network architecture. Column-2 shows the ANN accuracy when trained under theconstraints as described in Section 3. Column-3 shows the SNN accuracy for T = 2500 whenconverted from a ANN with threshold balancing. Column-4 shows the performance of the sameconverted SNN with lower time steps and adjusted thresholds. Column-5 shows the performanceafter training the Column-4 network with STDB for less than 20 epochs.

The membrane potential is a continuousvalue whereas the spike time is an integer value bounded by the number of time steps. Therefore,gradients that depend on spike time can be pre-computed and stored in a look-up table for fastercomputation. They evaluated their approach on shallow architectures with two convolution layer forMNIST dataset. In this work, we trained deep SNNs with multiple stacked layers for complexcalssification tasks. Wu et al. (2018) performed backpropagation through time on SNN with asurrogate gradient defined on the membrane potential. The surrogate gradient was defined aspiece-wise linear or exponential function of the membrane potential. The other surrogate gradientsproposed in the literature are all computed on the membrane potential (Neftci et al., 2019). Lee et al.
