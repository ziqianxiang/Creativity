The 1st section refers to (oblique) decision tree methods, the 2nd section refersto single model extensions of LCN, the 3rd section refers to ensemble methods, and the last section isGcn. The results of Gcn are copied from (Wu et al., 2018), where the results in SIDER and Tox21are not directly comparable due to lack of standard splittings. The best result in each section is inbold letters.
