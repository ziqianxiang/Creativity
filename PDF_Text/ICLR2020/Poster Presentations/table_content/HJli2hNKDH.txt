Table 3: Hyperparameters for LQRA.3.2 Projection MethodThe basis for producing f, gθ outputs is due to using batch matrix multiplication operations, or”BMV”,where the same network architecture uses different network weights for each batch dimension, andthus each entry in a batchsize of B will be processed by the same architecture, but with differentnetwork weights. This is to simulate the effect ofgθi. The numeric ID i of the enVironment is used asan index to collect a specific set of network weights θi from a global memory of network weights (e.g.
