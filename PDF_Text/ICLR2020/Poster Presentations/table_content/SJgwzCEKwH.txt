Table 1: Error rate of backdoored models. The error rate of clean/backdoored samples meansstandard-test-error/attack-failure-rate, respectively. The results are evaluated on 5000 non-overlappingclean/triggered images selected from the test set. For reference, the test errors of clean images onuntampered models are 12% for CIFAR-10 (VGG), and 4% for SVHN (ResNet), respectively.
Table 2: Performance against single-target backdoor attack. The clean/backdoor accuracy meansstandard-test-accuracy/attack-success-rate, respectively. More results are given in Appendix E.
Table 3: Performance against error-injection attack. The clean/injection accuracy means standard-test-accuracy/attack-success-rate, respectively. Path connection has the best clean accuracy and cancompletely remove injected errors (i.e. 0% attack accuracy). More results are given in Appendix F.

Table A2: Performance comparison of path connection and baselines against single-target backdoorattack. The clean/backdoor accuracy means standard-test-accuracy/attack-success-rate, respectively.
Table A3: Performance evaluation against error-injection attack. The clean/injection accuracy meansstandard-test-accuracy/attack-success-rate, respectively. Path connection attains the highest cleanaccuracy and lowest (0%) attack accuracy among all methods.
