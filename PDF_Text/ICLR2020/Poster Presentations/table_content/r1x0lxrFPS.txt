To back up the claim, we propose a new measure for betterestimation of gradient mismatch. Then, we propose a new training scheme for binary activation net-work called BinaryDuo based on the observation that ternary (or higher bitwidth) activation suffersmuch less from gradient mismatch problem than the binary activation. We show that BinaryDuo canachieve state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks (VGG-7, AlexNet and ResNet). Wealso provide our reference implementation code online1.
