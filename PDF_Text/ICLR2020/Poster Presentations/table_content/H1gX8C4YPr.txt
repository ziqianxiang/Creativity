Table 1: Performance (higher is better) of different architectures for agents with RGB-D andGPS+Compass sensors on the Habitat Challenge 2019 (Savva et al., 2019) validation and test-stdsplits (checkpoint selected on val). 10 samples taken for each episode on val. Gibson-4+ (2+) refersto the subset of Gibson train scenes (Xia et al., 2018) with a quality rating of 4 (2) or higher. SeeTab. 2 for results of the best DD-PPO agent for Blind, RGB, and RGB-D and other baselines.
Table 2: Performance (higher is better) of various sensors and agent methods on the Habitat Chal-lenge 2019 (Savva et al., 2019) validation and test splits (checkpoint selected on val). Random,Forward-only, and Goal-follower taken from Savva et al. (2019). Best visual encoder reported forDD-PPO.
