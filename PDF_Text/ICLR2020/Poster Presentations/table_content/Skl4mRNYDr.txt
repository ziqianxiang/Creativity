Table 1: Desirable attributes of each approach. A green check denotes that a method has a desirableattribute, whereas a red cross denotes the opposite. A “*" indicates an approach We implemented.
Table 2: Algorithmic components of each approach. A “			t ” indicates an approach we implemented.		Approach	Control Algorithm	—Learning Algorithm	—Goal-Generation Algorithm	—Routing Algorithm	High-Dim. Obs.
Table 3: We evaluate different autonomous driving methods on CARLA’s Dynamic Navigation task.
Table 4: Robustness to waypoint noise and test-time pothole adaptation. Our method is robust towaypoints on the wrong side of the road and fairly robust to decoy waypoints. Our method is flexibleenough to safely produce behavior not demonstrated (pothole avoidance) by incorporating a test-timecost. Ten episodes are collected in each Town.
Table 5: Detailed Architecture that implements s1:T = f (z1:T, φ). Typically, T = 40, D = 2,H =W = 200.
Table 6: We evaluate the effect of noise in the traffic-light state (λ) on CARLA’s Dynamic Navigationtask. Noise in the light state predictably degrades overall and red-light performance, but not to thepoint of preventing the method from operating at all.
