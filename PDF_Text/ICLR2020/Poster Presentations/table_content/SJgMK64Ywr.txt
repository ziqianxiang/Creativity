Table 4: Ablation comparing different Assem-bleNet architectures found with full vs. con-strained search spaces. The models are trainedfrom scratch.
Table 3: Comparison between AssembleNet and ar-chitectures without evolution, but with connectionweight learning. Four-stream models are reportedhere for the first time, and are very effective. Allthese models have a similar number of parameters.
