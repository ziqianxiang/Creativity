Table 1: Meta-learned algorithms perform significantly better than constant rewards and statisticallyequivalently to published algorithms found by human researchers (see 2). The table shows the con-fidence interval (one standard deviation) for the mean performance (across trials, across algorithms)for each algorithm category. Performance is defined as mean episode reward for all episodes.
