We consider the Gowalla data set (Cho et al., 2011) in NewYork City (NYC) and California (CA). We use a bounding box of -124.4096, 32.5343, -114.1308,42.0095 for CA and -74.0479, 40.6829, -73.9067, 40.8820 for NYC (both from flickr1). Each userwith at least 20 events (check-ins) is viewed as a subprocess. There are 673,183 events and 6,728users for Gowalla-CA. We randomly select 500 users as the validation set and 500 users as thetesting set. We use the remaining users for training. For Gowalla NYC, there are 86,703 events from1,171 users. We set the size of both validation and testing sets to 100. For the spatial tessellation,we use uniform grids (32 × 32 for NYC and 64 × 64 for CA). Both our model and VAE-CF canwork without grids. We further compare the performance of our model with VAE-CF by viewingeach location as an item.

Table 6: Testing results on MovieLens-100K. These methods share the same network and trainedwith 100 epochs. The test data is evaluating the model with the best performance during the valida-tion. Separate means that GNN is trained separately with VAE-SPP.
