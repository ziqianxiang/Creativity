Table 1: Results (%) on HotpotQA FullWiki Setting. Dev results of previous methods are reportedin their papers. Test results are from the leaderboard. Contemporary method is marked by *.
Table 2: Dev Ans (%) on different scenarios. Reasoning Types are estimated by Min et al. (2019b)via whether single-hop BERT has non-zero Ans F1. The numbers of questions are shown in brackets.
Table 3: FEVER Results. Contemporary work is marked by *. Single and Multi Evidence are resultson Dev claims on which one or multiple sentences are labeled as evidence.
Table 4: Ablation studies on the bridge questions on Dev answer accuracy (%), including modelcomponents (top left), graph structures (bottom left), and hop steps (right). Transformer-XHâ€™s fullmodel uses three hop step and unidirectional Wiki link graph.
Table 5: Examples of Transformer-XH and BERT pipeline results in Hotpot QA.
Table 6: Ablation study on the retrieval systems. Top-10 TFIDF is the one used by CogQA (Dinget al., 2019). BERT IR is the retrieval system used by CogQA (w. BERT IR) and Transformer-XH.
Table 7: Additional examples for model prediction on HotpotQA dataset, the first example is thecorrect prediction (+), the other two examples are the wrong predictions (-).
