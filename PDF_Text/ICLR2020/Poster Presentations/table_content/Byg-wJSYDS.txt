Table 4: The discrepancy ratio âˆ† for the model and annotators (who have labeled at least 100 patients)on the PLAX measurability test set. Here each annotator was individually taken out of the datasetand treated as if they were the model for the purpose of calculating their discrepancy ratio. Theconfidence intervals were obtained using the bootstrap method where the sampling was performed bypatient. We used the validation set to choose the threshold corresponding to the lowest discrepancyratio (as in Fig. 3b).
