Table 1: Micro F1 score on three distinct tasks averaged over 12 runs with standard deviation in parenthesis.
Table 2: Micro F1 score on three distinct tasks over the Citeseer dataset, averaged over 12 runs with standarddeviation in parenthesis. The number within the parenthesis beside the model name indicates the numberof Monte Carlo samples used in the estimation of the structural representation. MC-SVDt ⑴ denotes theSVD procedure run until convergence with one Monte Carlo sample for the representation. Bold values showmaximum empirical average, and multiple bolds happen when its standard deviation overlaps with anotheraverage.
