Table 1: Summary of previous results and the results obtained in this work. We assume that m, M =poly(n). In the column of result type, S denotes space complexity and T denotes time complexity.
Table 2: Summary of the threshold of the heavy hitter oracles used in each problem. Note that twooracles are used for the Fp Moment Fast Update problem.
