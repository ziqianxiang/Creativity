Table 1: Subjective metrics for affect control. Negative is a preference for the controlled model.
Table 2: Metrics of overall quality: Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) alongside 95% confidence inter-vals, speech recognition word error rate (WER), and chararacter error rate (CER). The results showno degradation in performance compared to the baseline.
Table 3: Metrics of overall quality for fully supervised data at varying data-set sizes, showing sig-nificant degradation below 270 minutes.
Table 4: Summary of the hyperparameters described below.
Table 5:	Sample spectrogram and F0 track plots, generated by varying affect labels, valence iny-axis, and arousal in x-axis.
Table 6:	Sample spectrogram and F0 track plots, generated by varying the speaking rate (first col-umn) and F0 variation (second column). We use standard normal prior for these factors and this tabledemos varying the control factor from -5σ to 5σ, demonstrating the controllability, interpolationand extrapolation of conditional generation, and also disentanglement of these factors.
