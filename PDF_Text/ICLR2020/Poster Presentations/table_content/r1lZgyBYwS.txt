Table 1: Indirectly pushing and popping x using BB-ANS. → and J denote pushingand popping respectively. ∆L denotes the change in message length resulting from eachoperation. The three steps to push/pop are ordered, starting at the top of the table anddescending.
Table 2: Compression performance of HiLLoC with RVAE compared to other codecs.
Table 3: The BB-ANS encoding and decoding operations, in order from the top, for ahierarchical latent model with l layers. The Ql are posterior distributions over the indicesil of the discretized latent space for the lth latent, Zl. The discretization for the lth latent iscreated such that the intervals have equal mass under the prior.
Table 4: Codec for an image, x, with shape s. We code the image via the HiLLoC codec,and the dimensions of the image with the uniform codec, U. Since the coder has the samesize, init_size, before and after encoding/decoding, we can use this codec repeatedly tocode any number of arbitrary sized images.
Table 5: The ELBO and compression rate of HiLLoC with PixelVAE, trained to convergenceon ImageNet 64, compared to other schemes. All schemes are evaluated on the ImageNet64 validation set, and measured in bits per pixel-channel.
