Table 1: The classification accuracy (%) ondogs vs. cats dataset. The results show the meanand standard deviation averaged over three runsand the best result is indicated in bold.
Table 2: Success rate (%) and cycle-consistency (%) after 100M timesteps in small-scale CoinRun.
Table 3: Comparison with domain randomization. The results show the mean and standard deviationaveraged over three runs and the best results are indicated in bold.
Table 4: Robustness against FGSM attacks on training environments. The values in parenthesesrepresent the relative reductions from the clean samples.
Table 5: Action set used in the DeepMind Lab experiment. The DeepMind Lab native action setconsists of seven discrete actions encoded in integers ([L,U] indicates the lower/upper bound of thepossible values): 1) yaw (left/right) rotation by pixel [-512,512], 2) pitch (up/down) rotation bypixel [-512,512], 3) horizontal move [-1,1], 4) vertical move [-1,1], 5) fire [0,1], 6) jump [0,1], and7) crouch [0,1].
