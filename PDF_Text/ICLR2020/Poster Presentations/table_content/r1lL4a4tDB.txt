Table 1: Shared hyperparameters for all the algorithms and tasks in the paper, adopted from theoriginal SAC implementation (Haarnoja et al., 2018b).
Table 2: Hyperparameters for the proposed algorithm.
Table 3: Information of environments We used.
Table 4: Wall-clock time and number of parameters of our algorithm and the alternative ones. Theworking environment was a desktop computer using Intel i7-6850K CPU and the task is “Velocities-only RoboschoolHopper”. The wall-clock time include training the first-impression VRM or pre-trainings.
