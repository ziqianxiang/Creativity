Table 1: AUC and AUPR values for network reconstruction. The models trained with the random walkbased approach and the encoder based approach are marked as Hyper-SAGNN-W and Hyper-SAGNN-E,respectively.
Table 2: Performance evaluation based on AUROC and AUPR for hyperedge/edge prediction. Methodswith annotation (mix) represent Hyper-SAGNN trained with a mixture of edges and hyper-edges. Datasetsmarked with “(2)” represent the performance on pair-wise edge prediction (i.e., non-hyperedges).
Table A1: Datasets used in this work. Note that the columns under “#(V)” correspond to the columns under“node type” for each dataset.
