Table 1: Average classification error as percentages. Across several architectures, AugMix obtainsCIFAR-10-C and CIFAR-100-C corruption robustness that exceeds the previous state of the art.
Table 2: Clean Error, Corruption Error (CE), and mCE values for various methods on ImageNet-C.
Table 3: ImageNet-P results. The mean flipping rate is the average of the flipping rates across all 10perturbation types. AugMix improves perturbation stability by approximately 20%.
Table 4: Ablating Components of AugMix on CIFAR-10-C and CIFAR-100-C. Variety throughrandomness, the Jensen-Shannon divergenCe (JSD) loss, and augmentation mixing Confer robustness.
