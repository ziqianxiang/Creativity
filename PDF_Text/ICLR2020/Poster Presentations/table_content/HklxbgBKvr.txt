Table 1: Mean rank of methods across transcription factor binding targets. Mean rank ofmethods across all 41 hold-out transcription factor targets. Ranks were computed within each targetusing the average of metrics across optimization rounds, and then averaged across target. The higherthe rank the better. 7 is the maximum rank. DyNA PPO outperforms the other methods on bothoptimization of f (x) and its ability to identify multiple well-separated local optima.
