Table 1: Domain Adaptation datasets and results. We compare the accuracy of our DAMNet approach withthat of DANN (Ganin & Lempitsky, 2015) and of RPT (Rozantsev et al., 2019), for image classification taskscommonly used to evaluate domain adaptation methods. Our DAMNets yield a significant accuracy boost in thepresence of large domain shifts, particularly when using more than one source domain. A more comprehensiveevaluation on all datasets is provided in Appendix D.

Table 3: We boost the method of Saitoet al. (2018) by replacing their featureextraction with our DAMNets.
Table 4: Domain Adaptation results. We compare the accuracy of our DAMNet approach with that ofDANN (Ganin & Lempitsky, 2015) and of RPT (Rozantsev et al., 2019), for image classification tasks com-monly used to evaluate domain adaptation methods. As illustrated in Appendix B, different source and targetdomain combinations present various degrees of domain shift, and some combinations are clearly more chal-lenging than others. Our DAMNets yield a significant accuracy boost in the presence of large domain shifts,particularly when using more than one source domain.
