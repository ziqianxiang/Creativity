Table 1: Simulation results for the vehicle dynamics example. The standard backpropagationschemes are denoted by BKPR, while the adjoint is denoted by ADJ. The Dormand-Prince method oforder 5 with adaptive time step is denoted by DoPr5, while Euler denotes explicit Euler with timestep equal to the data sampling time. For BKPR-DoPr5 we set rtol=10-7, atol=10-9. Experimentswere performed on a i9 Apple laptop with 32GB of RAM. Reported times are per iteration and wereaveraged over the total number of iterations performed.
Table 2: Simulation results for the multi-agent example. Experiments were performed on a 2.9GHz Intel Core i7 Apple laptop with 16GB of RAM. For the α-SNODE method, each iterationconsists of 10 steps of SGD and 10 of ADAM. In high-data regime, α-SNODE converges in 5x less,2.6x faster, iterations than Euler with 14x smaller test MSE. Method δ-SNODE is even 12x faster,with similar performance. Gains are comparable in low-data regime. Method BKPR-DoPr5 failed.
