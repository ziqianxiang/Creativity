Table 1: Comparision with state-of-the-arts on ImageNet under the mobile setting. * denotes meth-ods using extra network modules such as SWiSh activation and SqUeeze-and-Excitation module. ^ de-notes using extra data augmentation such as MixUP and AutoAugment. * denotes models searchedand trained simultaneously.
Table 2: Influence of awareness of resource metric. The upper block uses equal penalties for allatomic blocks. The lower part uses our resource-aware atomic block selection.
Table 3: Influence of BN recalibration.
Table 4: Comparision with baseline backbones on COCO object detection and instance segmenta-tion. Cls denotes the ImageNet top-1 accuracy; detect-mAP and seg-mAP denotes mean averageprecision for detection and instance segmentation on COCO dataset. The results of baseline modelsare from Stamoulis et al. (2019b). SinglePath+ (Stamoulis et al., 2019b) contains SE module.
