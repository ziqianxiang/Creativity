Table 1: Top 1 and Top 5 accuracy on ImageNet with a same MLP classifier applied to differ-ent representations: Fisher Vectors (Perronnin & Larlus, 2015), AlexNet (Krizhevsky et al., 2012),Scattering with SLE (Oyallon et al., 2019), Scattering alone, Scattering with ISTC for W = Dwhich outputs α1, or which outputs Dα1, or which outputs α1 with unconstrained W .
