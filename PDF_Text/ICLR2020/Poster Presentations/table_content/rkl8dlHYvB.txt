Table 1: Quantitative Evaluation. The number is the average among mean recall of three levelssegmentation results in PartNet. Avg and WAvg are average among categories and weighted averageamong categories over shape numbers, respectively.
Table 2: Cross-validation exper-iments for analyzing how partknowledge transfers across cate-gory boundaries.
Table 3: Quantitative evaluation of involving more context. w/ and w/o denote making decision withand without involving more context, respectively. Note that we only introduce more context in thelate grouping process and the involved context is restricted in a very local region. The number isthe mean recall of segmentation results. The L1, L2 and L3 refer to the three levels of segmentationdefined in PartNet. Avg is the average among mean recall of three levels segmentation results.
Table 4: Quantitative results of the components analysis. We train the models on the Chair, Lamp,Storage Furniture of level-3 annotations and test on the listed categories. The number is the meanrecall of the most fine-grained annotations of each category.
Table 5: Quantitative evaluation of the sub-part proposal module. PosAcc and NegAcc refer topositive accuracy and negative accuracy of the binary segmentation.
Table 6: Quantitative Evaluation. Algorithm P, S, G, W, O refer to PartNet-InsSeg, SGPN, GSPN,WCSeg and Ours, respectively. The number 1, 2 and 3 refer to the three levels of segmentation de-fined in PartNet. We put short lines for the levels that are not defined. Avg is the average among meanrecall of three levels segmentation results in PartNet. SAvg and WSAvg are average among seen cat-egories and weighted average among seen categories over shape numbers, respectively. UAvg andWUAvg are average among unseen categories and the weighted average among unseen categoriesover shape numbers, respectively.
