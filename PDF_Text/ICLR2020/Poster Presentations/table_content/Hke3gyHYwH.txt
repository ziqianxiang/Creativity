Table 1: CIFAR-10 test accuracies of different methods underdifferent noise rates.
Table 2: Relationship between distance to initialization at convergence and other hyper-parameters. “/”:positive correlation; “\”: negative correlation; '—': no correlation as long as width is sufficiently large andlearning rate is sufficiently small.
