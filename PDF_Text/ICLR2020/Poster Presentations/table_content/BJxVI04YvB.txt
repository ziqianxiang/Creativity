Table 1:	ImageNet images with varying ResNet confidence set sizes. The confidence set sizes areon the top. The true label is on the left-hand side. Incorrectly labeled images are boxed in red.
Table 2:	Confidence sets of ImageNet images with varying ResNet confidence set sizes. The pre-dicted confidence set is shown to the right of the corresponding input image. The true label is shownin red, and the predicted label is shown with a hat. See Table 5 in Appendix D for more examples.
Table 3:	Visualization of confidence sets for the tracking dataset (Wu et al., 2013), including theground truth bounding box (white), the bounding box predicted by the original neural network (Heldet al., 2016) (red), and the bounding box produced using our confidence set predictor (green). Wehave overapproximated the predicted ellipsoid confidence set with a box. Our bounding box containsthe ground truth bounding box with high probability. See Table 9 in Appendix D for more examples.
