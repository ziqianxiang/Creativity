Table 1: We compare the realism of the generated trajec-tories using a real-vs-fake 2AFC Amazon MechanicalTurk with SAVP-VAE and SV2P.
Table 2: Left: We report the average bits-per-pixelacross 10 target frames with 3 conditioning frames forthe BAIR action-free dataset.
Table 3: Frechet Video Distance:. We report the mean and standard deviation across 5 runs for 3 differentframe settings. Results are not directly comparable across models due to the differences between the totalnumber of frames seen during training and the number of conditioning frames.
