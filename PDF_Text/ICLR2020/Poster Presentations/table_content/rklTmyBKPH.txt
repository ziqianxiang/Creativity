Table 1: Semantic segmentation results on Cityscapes. OS: output stride, the spatial resolution ratioof input image to backbone output. The result of DPC in the brackets is our implemented versionunder the same settings as FNA. The MAdds of the models are computed with the 1024 × 2048input resolution.
Table 2: Comparisons of computational cost on the semantic segmentation tasks. ArchAdapt: Ar-Chitecture Adaptation. ParamAdapt: Parameter Adaptation. GHs: GPU Hours. * indicates thecomputational cost calculated under our reproducing settings. f indicates the cost estimated accord-ing to the description in the original paper.
Table 3: Object detection results on MS-COCO. The MAdds are calculated with 1088 X 800 input.
Table 4: Comparison of computational cost on the object detection tasks. All our experiments onobject detection are conducted on TIIAN-XP GPUs.
Table 5: Effectiveness evaluation of Parameter Remapping. The experiments are conducted withDeepLabv3 on Cityscapes. Remap: Parameter Remapping. ArchAdapt: Architecture Adaptation.
