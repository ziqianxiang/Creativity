Table 1: Quantitative evaluation of different methods on Moving MNIST. All metrics are averagedover the 10 predictions. Lower MSE and higher SSIM indicates better prediction accuracy.
Table 2: An ablation study w.r.t. 3D convolution,RPM and two-way autoencoder. All metrics areaveraged over the 10 predictions.
Table 3: Quantitative evaluation on Traffic4cast. Lower MSE indicates better prediction accuracy.
Table 4: Quantitative evaluation of different methods on the Caltech Pedestrian dataset. Higher PSNRor SSIM means better prediction accuracy.
Table 5: Quantitative evaluation of different methods on 2D KITTI detection in term of AveragePrecision (AP). The numbers in the "Best Results on the Leaderboard " are achieved by different bestmodels on each class according to the default ranking mechanism on the Leaderboard.
