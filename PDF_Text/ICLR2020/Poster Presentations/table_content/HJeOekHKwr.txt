Table 1: Common GANs, their corresponding loss functions, and their optimal discriminators.
Table 2: Regularity of common GAN losses.
Table 3: Smoothness-inducing regularizers and their convex conjugates. To enforce a regularitycondition on a loss function J, we take a source loss that satisfies it and view it as a regularizer R.
