Table 1: Results for anomaly segmentation on MVTec datasets, expressed in AUROC (Area Un-der the Receiver Operating Characteristics). Four different baselines are trained on normal samplesand are augmented by our proposed gradient based reconstruction (grad) for comparison: A deter-ministic autoencoder trained with L2 loss (L2AE) as in (Bergmann et al., 2019); A deterministicautoencoder trained with DSSIM loss (DSAE) as in (Bergmann et al., 2019); A variational autoen-coder (VAE); And a variational autoencoder with a learned decoder variance (γ-VAE) as in (Dai &Wipf, 2019). For each result a green or red background denotes respectively an improvement or adecrease in performance compared to the baseline. It can be seen that the proposed gradient-basedreconstruction achieves the best segmentation for most datasets, with a mean improvement rate of9.52% over all baselines.
Table 2: Complementary results for anomaly segmentation on MVTec datasets, expressed in AU-ROC for different pixel-wise scores derived from a baseline VAE: from left to right, squared errorreconstruction ||x — fvAE(x)||2 (denoted Lr(X)), gradient of the loss ∣VχL(x)∣, combination ofboth, gradient of the KL divergence ∣DκL(q(z∣x)kp(z)) (denoted VxLKL(X)l) as Well as combi-nation ofKL derivative and error reconstruction as suggested in Zimmerer et al. (2018; 2019).
