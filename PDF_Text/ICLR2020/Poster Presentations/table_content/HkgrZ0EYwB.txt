Table 1: Completion plausibility on synthetic scans and real-world scans and effects of datadistribution discrepancy. (Left) Plausibility comparison on synthetic scans and real-world scans.
Table 2: Comparison with baselines on the 3D-EPN dataset. Note that 3D-EPN and PCN requirepaired supervision data, while ours does not. Ours outperforms 3D-EPN and achieves comparableresults to PCN. Furthermore, after adapted to leverage the ground truth data as well, our methodachieves similar performance to PCN.
Table 3: Effect of varying incompleteness. Performance of AE and ours with increasing incom-pleteness (% of the missing points). Our completions remain robust even with increasing incom-pleteness as our method restricts the completion via the learned latent shape manifolds.
