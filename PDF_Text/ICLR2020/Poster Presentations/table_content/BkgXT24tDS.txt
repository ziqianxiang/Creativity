For 3-bit and 4-bitmodels, APoT quantization has reached comparable results with the full precision baselines. It isworthwhile to note that all state-of-the-arts methods in the table use 4 levels to quantize weights into2-bit. Our model only employs ternary weights for 2-bit representation and still outstrips existingquantization methods.
