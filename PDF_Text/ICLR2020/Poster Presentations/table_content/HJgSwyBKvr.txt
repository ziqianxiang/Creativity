Table 1: We trained a probablistic Gaussian encoder to approximately invert the generative model.
Table 2: Generative model architecture.
Table 3: Discriminator used for restricted labeling. Parts in red are part of hyperparameter search.
Table 4: Discriminator used for match pairing. We use a projection discriminator (Miyato &Koyama, 2018) and thus have an unconditional and conditional head. Parts in red are part of hyper-parameter search.
Table 5: Discriminator used for rank pairing. For rank-pairing, we use a special variant of theprojection discriminator, where the conditional logit is computed via taking the difference betweenthe two pairs and multiplying by y âˆˆ {-1, +1}. The discriminator is thus implicitly taking onthe role of an adversarially trained encoder that checks for violations of the ranking rule in theembedding space. Parts in red are part of hyperparameter search.
