Table 1: Previous state-of-the-art algorithms for molecular graph generation. The comparison of training isonly conducted between autoregressive models.
Table 2: Comparison of different models on density modeling and generation. Reconstruction is only evaluatedon latent variable models. Validity w/o check is only evaluated on models with valency constraints. Result withf is obtained by running GCPN's open-source code. Results With âˆ£ are taken from PoPova et al. (2019).
Table 3: Results of density modeling and generation on three different datasets.
Table 4: Comparison between different graph generative models on general graphs with MMD metrics. Wefollow the evaluation scheme of GNF (Liu et al., 2019). Results of baselines are also taken from GNF.
Table 5: Comparison of the top 3 property scores of generated molecules.
Table 6: Comparison of results on constrained property optimization.
Table 7: Tuned-parameters for policy gradient and their search space.
