Table 1: Performance and training time of a neural network trained on the Adult dataset. The firstand second rows correspond to the networks not regularized, and regularized by Renyi correlationrespectively. As can be seen in the table, while adding Renyi regularizer makes the classifier morefair, it does so by bringing a minimum amount of additional computational overhead.
