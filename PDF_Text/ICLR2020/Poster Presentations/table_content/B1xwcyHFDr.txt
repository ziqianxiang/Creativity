Table 1: Examples of the two views and class label from the Sketchy dataset (on the left) andcomparison between MIB and other popular models in literature on the sketch-based image retrievaltask (on the right). * denotes models that use a 64-bits binary representation. The results for MIBcorresponds to Î² = 1.
Table 2: Comparison of the amount of input information I(x; z), label information I(z; y), andaccuracy of a linear classifier trained with different amount of labeled Examples (Ex) for the modelsreported in Figure 4. Both the results obtained using the Jensen-Shannon IJSD (Devon Hjelm et al.,2019; Poole et al., 2019) and the InfoNCE INCE (van den Oord et al., 2018) estimators are reported.
