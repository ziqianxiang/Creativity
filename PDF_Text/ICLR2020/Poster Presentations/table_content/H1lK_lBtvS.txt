We used exactly thesame setting as Golan & El-Yaniv (2018). GOAD was run with s = 1. OCSVM and GEOMwith Dirichlet were copied from their paper. We run their method without Dirichlet and presentedit in the table (we verified the implementation by running their code with Dirichlet and replicatedthe numbers in the paper). It appears that GEOM is quite dependent on Dirichlet for this dataset,

(2018), 4 datasets are used in this comparison:Arrhythmia: A cardiology dataset from the UCI repository (Asuncion & Newman, 2007) contain-ing attributes related to the diagnosis of cardiac arrhythmia in patients. The datasets consists of 16classes: class 1 are normal patients, 2-15 contain different arrhythmia conditions, and class 16 con-tains undiagnosed cases. Following the protocol established by ODDS (Rayana, 2016), the smallestclasses: 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 14, 15 are taken to be anomalous and the rest normal. Also following ODDS,
