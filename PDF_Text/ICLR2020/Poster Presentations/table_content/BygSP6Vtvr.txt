Table 1: Classification Performance (% Error) on Dtest of size 1000, trained on Dtrn of size 1000with 3 spiral classes. Dataset sizes given as number of examples per class.
Table 2: Classification Performance (% Error) on Dtest , trained on either Dtrn or Dtrn + DAUX . Alldatasets are of size 1000. Data for an ensemble of a 100 models.
Table 3: Mean Classification Error, % PRR , test-set negative log-likelihood (NLL) and expectedcalibration error (ECE) on C10/C100/TIM across three models ±2σ.
Table 4: OOD detection performance (mean % AUC-ROC ±2σ) for C10/C100/TIM models usingmeasures of total (T.Unc) and knowledge (K.Unc) uncertainty.
Table 5: Description of datasets used in the experiments in terms of number of images and classes.
Table 6: Training Configurations. η0 is the initial learning rate, T0 is the initial temperature and’Annealing’ refers to whether a temperature annealing schedule was used. The batch size for allmodels was 128. Dropout rate is quoted in terms of probability of not dropping out a unit.
