Table 1: Precision@1 for the BLI task on the MUSE dataset6. Within each category, unsuper-vised methods are listed at the top while supervised methods are at the bottom. The best resultfor unsupervised methods is Underiined while bold signifies the overall best. “IN” refers to iterativenormalization proposed in Zhang et al. (2019), “AR” refers to alignment refinement and “VR” refersto vocabulary reallocation.
Table 2: Precision@1 for the BLI task on the MUSE dataset with test pairs of same surfaceform removed. The best result for unsupervised methods is Underlined while bold signifies theoverall best.
Table 4: Precision@1 for the BLI task on the MUSE dataset using test set produced by vocabu-lary reallocation. Within each category, unsupervised methods are listed at the top while supervisedmethods are at the bottom. Bold signifies the overall best results. “AR” refers to alignment refine-ment and “VR” refers to vocabulary reallocation.
