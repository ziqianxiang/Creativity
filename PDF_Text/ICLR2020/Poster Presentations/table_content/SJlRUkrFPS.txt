Table 1: Subset matching and pair matching accuracy on test data for two moon datasets. Here thesubset (pair) matching accuracy corresponds to the proportion of the data points that are aligned tothe correct moon (data points) on the test set. Higher is better. We generated 10 independent datasetsand the standard deviation is shown.
Table 2: Subset matching and pair matching test accuracy for the alignment of protein and RNAexpression data in CITE-seq CBMCs experiment. Here subset (pair) matching accuracy denotes theproportion of the cells that are aligned to the correct cluster (cells). Higher is better. For alignmentin the original space, the expression of 5001 mRNAs are mapped to the expression of 13 proteins.
Table 3: Subset matching accuracy on the two held-out cell types, T cell and immature T cell, foraligning FACS and droplet data. The algorithms OT-SI and OT-Procrustes are trained on 2, 5 and 8other cell types. Higher is better.
Table 4: Subset matching accuracy on the two held-out digits 3 and 5 when trained our model on therest eight digits for MNIST dataset. OT is used to align the original images with the perturbed ones.
Table 5: Root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) of pair matching algorithmsfor marriage-matching dataset. Lower is better.
