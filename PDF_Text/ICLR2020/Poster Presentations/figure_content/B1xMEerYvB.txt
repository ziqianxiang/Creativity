Figure 1: Effect of learning rates in two games. Note: x-axis is log-scale. Left: “half a game”,e.g. 2. Right: minimal SM-game, e.g. 3. Top: Both players have same learning rate. Bottom: Secondplayer has 8 learning rate of first (which is same as for top). Reducing the learning rate of the secondplayer destabilizes the dynamics in “half a game”, whereas the SM-game is essentially unaffected.
Figure 2: SM-game graph topologies. A: two-player (e.g. GANs). B: star-shaped (e.g. adversarialtraining). C: bipartite (e.g. task-suites). D: all-to-all.
Figure 3: Legibile dynamics. Panels AB: Dynamics in an SM-game with both positive and negativesentiment, under different learning rates. Panels CD: Cartoon maps of the dynamics.
