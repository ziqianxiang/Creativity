Figure 1: An illustration of magnitude-based pruning (MP) and lookahead pruning (LAP). MP onlyconsiders a single weight while LAP also considers the effects of neighboring edges.
Figure 2: Test accuracy of pruned linear network under varying levels of sparsity, (a) before and (b)after a retraining phase. MP denotes magnitude-based pruning and LAP denotes lookahead pruning.
Figure 3: Test accuracy of FCN with (a) sigmoid, (b) tanh, (c) ReLU activations; (d) test accuracyof FCN with ReLU activation before retraining, for the MNIST dataset.
Figure 4: Test accuracy and generalization gap of FCN trained on MNIST.
