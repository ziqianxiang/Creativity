Figure 2: The proposed KeyPointNet architecture leverages a shared-encoder backbone with threeoutput heads for the regression of keypoint locations (p), scores (s) and descriptions (f). To furtherimprove keypoint description performance, KeyPointNet produces higher-resolution feature-mapsfor the keypoint descriptors via efficient sub-pixel convolutions at the keypoint descriptor head.
Figure 3: Cross-border detection illustration. We illustrate how a warped point (in red) can beassociated to multiple predicted points (in blue) based on a distance threshold (dashed circle). (a)The keypoint location head in Christiansen et al. (2019) forces keypoint predictions in the samecell, causing convergence issues since these points can only be pulled up to the cell-boundary. (b)Instead, in our method, we design the network to predict the localization from the cell-center andallow keypoints to be outside the border for better matching and aggregation.
