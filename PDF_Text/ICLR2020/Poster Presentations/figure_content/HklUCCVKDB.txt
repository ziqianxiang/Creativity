Figure 1: Illustration of the evolution of weight distributions - uncertain weights adapt more quickly -when learning two tasks using UCB. (a) weight parameter initialized by distributions initialized withmean and variance values randomly sampled from N (0, 0 .1). (b) posterior distribution after learningtask one; while θ1 and θ2 exhibit lower uncertainties after learning the first task, θ 3, θ4, and θ5 havelarger uncertainties, making them available to learn more tasks. (c) a second task is learned usinghigher learning rates for previously uncertain parameters (θι, θ2, θ3, and θ4) while learning rates forθι and θ2 are reduced. Size of the arrows indicate the magnitude of the change of the distributionmean upon gradient update.
