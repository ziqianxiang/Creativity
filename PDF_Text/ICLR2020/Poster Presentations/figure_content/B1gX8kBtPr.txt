Figure 2: The ReLU networks n1 (Figure 2a) and n2 (Figure 2c) encode the same function f(Figure 2b). Interval analysis fails certify that n1 does not exceed [0, 1] on [0, 1] while certificationsucceeds for n2 .

Figure 3: Approximating f (Figure 3a) using a ReLU network n = ξ0 +	k nk. The ReLU networksnk (Figure 3c) approximate the N -slicing of f (Figure 3b), as a sum of local bumps (Figure 6).
Figure 4: Neighbors N(x) (blue dots) andN (U)(red squares).
Figure 6: Local bump φc, where c contains the points cll , clu, cul , cuu. The points in N (conv(c)) aredepicted by the red squares.
