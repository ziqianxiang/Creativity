Figure 1: Our visual system infers object identities according to their size, location and orientationin a scene. In this blurred picture, observers describe the scene as containing a car and a pedestrianin the street. However, the pedestrian is in fact the same shape as the car, except for a 90Â° rotation.
Figure 2: Effect of multiple attention strategies for the prioritization of relevant pattern orientationsin rotation equivariant networks for the task of face recognition. Given that all attention strategiesare learned exclusively from upright faces, we show the set of relevant directions for the recognitionof faces in two orientations (Fig. 2a) obtained by: no attention (Fig. 2b), attending to the patternorientations of appearance independently (Fig. 2c) and, attending to the pattern orientations ofappearance relative to one another (Fig. 2d). Built upon Figure 1 from Schwarzer (2000).

Figure 4: Synchronous movement of feature mappings and attention masks as a function of inputrotation in the group p4 (rmax = 4).
