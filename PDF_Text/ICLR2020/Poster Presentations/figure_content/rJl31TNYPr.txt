Figure 1: The complete visual perception pipeline in autonomous driving, i.e., both object detectionand Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) (Baidu; Kato et al., 2018; 2015; Zhao et al., 2018a; Ess et al.,2010; MathWorks; Udacity).
Figure 2: Description of the tracker hijacking attack flow (a), and two different attack scenarios:object move-in (b) and move-out (c), where tracker hijacking may lead to severe safety consequencesincluding emergency stop and rear-end crashes.
Figure 3: Comparison between previous object detection attack and our tracker hijacking attack.
Figure 4: In normal measurement noise covariance range (a), our tracker hijacking attack wouldrequire the AE (adversarial example) to fool only 2~3 consecutive frames on average to successfullydeviate the target tracker despite the (R, H) settings. We also compare the success rate of trackerhijacking with previous adversarial attack against object detectors only under different attackercapabilities, i.e., the number of consecutive frames the AE can reliably fool the object detector (b).
