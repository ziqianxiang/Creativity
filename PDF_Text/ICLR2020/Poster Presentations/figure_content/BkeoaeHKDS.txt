Figure 1: (a) An illustration of our parameterization. We consider a deep network F (x; θ, ω) ,ωT fθ (x) that consists of a ConvNet fθ with its parameters θ , (θ1, θ2) and linear weights ω. (b)An overview of our proposed model. Our model takes the activation fθ (x) and the gradient.% (x)as input (see illustration in (a)), and learns linear weights w1 (matrix) and w2 (vector) for prediction.
