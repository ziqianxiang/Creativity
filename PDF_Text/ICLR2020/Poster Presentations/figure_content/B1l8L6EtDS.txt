Figure 1: (a) Conventional adversarial learning that uses a binary real/fake classifier as its discrimina-tor; (b): Self-adversarial learning that employs a comparative discriminator to compare the currentlygenerated sample to its previously generated samples for obtaining rewards through self-improvement.
Figure 2: The training process of the comparative discriminator.
Figure 3: The performance curves of NLL-oracle Figure 4: The performance curves of perplex-during training in the synthetic dataset	ity during training in the Image COCO datasetTable 3: Performance comparison of different models in the COCO caption generation task. Metricsfrom top to bottom represent respectively the generation quality, the generation diversity, and thedivergence between real data of generated sentences. For all the BLEU metrics, the higher, the better;for NLLgen and FD, the lower, the better.
