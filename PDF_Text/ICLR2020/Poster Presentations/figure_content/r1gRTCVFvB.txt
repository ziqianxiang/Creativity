Figure 1: The performance of different classifiers for each split on ImageNet-LT with ResNeXt-50.
Figure 2: Left: Classifier weight norms for ImageNet-LT validation set when classes are sortedby descending values of nj . Blue line: classifier weights learned with instance-balanced sampling.
Figure 3: Sampling weights pj for ImageNet-LT. Classes are ordered with decreasing nj on thex-axis. Left: instance-balanced, class-balanced and square-root sampling. Right: Progressively-balanced sampling; as epochs progress, sampling goes from instance-balanced to class-balancedsampling.
Figure 4: Illustrations on different classifiers and their corresponding decision boundaries, whereWi and Wj denote the classification weight for class i and j respectively, Ci is the classificationcone belongs to class i in the feature space, mi is the feature mean for class i. From left to right:τ -normalized classifiers with τ → 0: the classifier with larger weights have wider decision bound-aries; τ -normalized classifiers with τ → 1: the decision boundaries are more balanced for differ-ent classes; NCM with cosine-similarity whose decision boundary is independent of the classifierweights; NCM with Euclidean-similarity whose decision boundaries partition the feature space intoVoronoi cells.
