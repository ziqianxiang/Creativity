Figure 1: (a) Computation of hi(x) and hi(x). The reconstruction X is fed to the same autoencoderthat produced itself. (b) Motivation of RaPP. The quantity that RaPP computes, the hidden acti-vation of the reconstruction input, is equivalent to the hidden reconstruction of the input. If f = f,computing h02(x) = h2(x) does not require explicitly evaluating fi but only gi and f = f.
