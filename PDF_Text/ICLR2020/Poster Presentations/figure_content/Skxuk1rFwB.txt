Figure 1: Verified error and 2nd CNNlayer's '∞ induced norm for a modeltrained using (Wong et al., 2018) andCROWN-IBP. e is increased from 0 to0.3 in 60 epochs.
Figure 2: Standard and verified errorsof IBP and CROWN-IBP with differ-ent κstart and κend values.
Figure 3: Verified error vs. schedule length on 8 medium MNIST models and 8 medium CIFAR-10models. The solid bars show median values of verified errors. κstart = 1.0 exCept for the κ = 0setting. The upper and lower ends of an error bar are the worst and best verified error, respeCtively.
Figure A: Interval Bound Propagation viewed as training an augmented neural network (IBP-NN).
Figure B: Bound differences between IBP and CROWN-IBP for DM-large models during training.
Figure C: Verified error vs. schedule length (30, 60, 90, 120) on 9 small models on CIFAR-10. Thesolid boxes show median values of verified errors. κstart = 1.0 except for the κ = 0 setting. Theupper and lower bound of an error bar are worst and best verified error, respectively.
Figure D: Verified error vs. schedule length (10, 15, 30, 60) on 8 medium MNIST models. Theupper and lower ends of a vertical bar represent the worst and best verified error, respectively. Thesolid boxes represent the median values of the verified error. For a small , using a shorter schedulelength improves verified error due to early stopping, which prevents overfitting. All best verifiederrors are achieved by CROWN-IBP regardless of schedule length.
Figure E: Verified error vs. schedule length (10, 15, 30, 60) on 10 small MNIST models. The upperand lower ends of a vertical bar represent the worst and best verified error, respectively. All bestverified errors are achieved by CROWN-IBP regardless of schedule length.
