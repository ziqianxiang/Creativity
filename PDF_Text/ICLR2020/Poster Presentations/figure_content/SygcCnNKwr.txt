Figure 6: Frequency of atoms resp. compounds in the train vs. test set14.	Which art director, star, and editor of [The Brown Bunny] and [Promises Written in Water]did [Cord] star?15.	Did an employee and founder of [Virgin Mobile Australia], [Virgin Mobile USA], and[Virgin Mobile France] found [Virgin America] and found [V2 Records]?16.	Was a Chinese executive producer and star of [Happy Ghost II] and [All’s Well, Ends Well2010] a film director?17.	Was [The Voyeur]’s executive producer an actor’s parent?18.	Did [Erasable Cities]’s writer, producer, editor, art director, cinematographer, and directorproduce and executive produce [Promises Written in Water]?19.	Who was an editor, star, and cinematographer of [Tetsuo: The Iron Man], [A Snake ofJune], and [Bullet Ballet]?20.	Was a costume designer’s employer [Philips High School]?D.2 Quantitative analysis of MCD1Figure 6 shows the frequency of atoms (upper graph) and compounds (lower graph) in the trainand test sets of the maximum compound divergence split for the CFQ data. As the frequency of anatom resp. compound we use the fraction of examples it appears in. Both atoms and compounds areindexed primarily by their frequency in the train set, secondarily by their frequency in the test set,in decreasing order. For practical reasons we only look at a small subset of compounds here but webelieve the analysis is representative.
