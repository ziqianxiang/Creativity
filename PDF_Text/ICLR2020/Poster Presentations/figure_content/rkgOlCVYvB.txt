Figure 1: Pure and spurious critical points: θ1 is a pure critical point, while θ2 is a spurious criticalpoint (the level curves on the manifold MΦ describe the landscape in functional space). Note thatθ3 is mapped to the same function as θ2, but it is not a critical point.
Figure 2: Left: If V ⊂ R2 is an ellipse, the distance function hu(p) = ∣∣p - u∣∣2 restricted to Vgenerally has 2 or 4 real critical points, depending on whether U lies inside or outside the diamond-shaped region bounded by the caustic curve. Right: If V ⊂ R2 is a circle, then the caustic curvedegenerates to a point and the distance function generically has always 2 real critical points.
Figure 3: Real critical points and local minima for random choices of hQ0 ∣M1 as defined in Exam-ple 13. The size of each disk is proportional to the number of instances we found with that numberof critical points and local minima. This shows that linear networks with a convex loss may indeedhave multiple non-global local minima. More details in Appendix A.2 (Table 2 and Experiment 1).
