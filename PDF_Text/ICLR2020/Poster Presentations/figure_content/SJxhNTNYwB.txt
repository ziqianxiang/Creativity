For CIFAR10, the defense model was going throughPGD minimax training (Madry et al., 2018). We directly used their model as the source network2,denoted by WResnet. To test whether these methods can transfer to a defended network with adifferent architecture, we trained a defended ResNeXt (Xie et al., 2017) using the same method. ForImageNet, we used the SOTA model3 from (Xie et al., 2018). We used "ResNet152 Denoise" as thesource model and transfered adversarial perturbations to the most robust "ResNeXt101 DenoiseAll".

Although TREMBAused the same model that is trained on ε = 0.03125, it still outperformed other methods, which showsthat TREMBA can also generalize to different strength of adversarial attack with different ε.

We compared our method with it on thetargeted and un-targeted attack on Imagenet. The targeted attack is 0 and ε = 0.03125. As shown inTable 10 and Table 11, TREMBA requires much lower queries than CombOpt. It demonstrates thegreat improvement by combining the transfer-based and score-based attack.
