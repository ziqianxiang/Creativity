Figure 1:	Learned curvature across epochs (with standard deviation) with latent space dimension of6, diagonal covariance parametrization, on the MNIST dataset.
Figure 2:	Qualitative comparison of reconstruction quality of randomly selected runs of a selectionof well-performing models on MNIST test set digits.
Figure 3: Samples from various models of a grid search around 0 of a single component’s latentspace on MNIST test digits.
Figure 4: Illustrative latent space visualization of a randomly selected run of the models E2 ×H2 ×S2,E6, H6, and S6 on MNIST with spherical covariance. E2 is visualized directly, S2 is visualizedusing a Lambert azimuthal equal-area projection (Snyder, 1987, Chapter 24), H2 is transformed tothe Poincare ball model using a stereographic conformal projection. All other latent space sizeswere first projected using the respective transformation (to PoinCare ball, Lambert projection) ifapplicable, and then projected to R2 using Principal Component Analysis (Abdi & Williams, 2010,PCA) and visualized directly.
