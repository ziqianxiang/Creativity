Figure 1: Summary of the privacy protections guaranteed by local and global DP at the differentlevels of the meta-learning problem (with our notion in blue). On the right, we show what eachspecification would mean in two practical federated scenarios: mobile users and hospital networks.
Figure 2: Performance of different versions of Reptile on a next-word-prediction task for twofederated datasets. We report the test accuracy on unseen tasks and repeat each experiment 10 times.
Figure 3: Performance of task-global DP Reptile on 5-shot-5-way Omniglot and Mini-ImageNet.
