Figure 1: A motivating example: Given an unannotated version of this TypeScript program, atraditional rule-based type inference algorithm cannot soundly deduce the true type annotations(shown in green).
Figure 2: An intermediate representation of the (unannotated version) program from Figure 1. TheTi represent type variables, among which T8-τi6 are newly introduced for intermediate expressions.
Figure 3: Example hyperedges for Figure 2. Edge labels in gray (resp. red) are positional arguments(resp. identifiers). (A) The return statement at line 6 induces a subtype relationship between τ13and τ5. (B) MyNetwork τ8 declares attributes name τ1 and time τ2 and method forward τ9.
