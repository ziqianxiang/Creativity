Figure 1: Visual illustration for several complications from the temporal graphs. (A). The gen-eration process of a temporal graph and its snapshots. It is obvious that the static graphs in thesnapshots only reflect partial temporal information. (B). The final state of the temporal graph whenprojected to the time-independent 2-D plane. Other than the missing temporal information, themulti-edge situation arises as well. (C). When predicting the link between node A and C at timet3, the message-passing paths should be subject to temporal contraints. The solid lines give theappropriate directions, and the dashed lines violates the temporal constraints.
