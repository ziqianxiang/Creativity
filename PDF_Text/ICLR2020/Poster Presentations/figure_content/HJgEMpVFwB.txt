Figure 1: Illustrative snapshots of a victim (in blue) against normal and adversarial opponents (in red).
Figure 2: Illustrations of the zero-sum simulated robotics games from Bansal et al. (2018a) we usefor evaluation. Environments are further described in Section 4.1.
Figure 3: Win rates while training adversary Adv against the median victim in each environment(based on the difference between the win rate for Adv and Zoo). The adversary outperforms theZoo baseline against the median victim in Kick and Defend and You Shall Not Pass, and is compet-itive on Sumo Humans. For full results, see figure 4 below or figure C.1 in the supplementary material.
Figure 4: Percentage of games won by opponent (out of 1000), the maximal cell in each row is in red.
Figure 5: Analysis of activations of the victimâ€™s policy network. Both figures show the adversaryAdv induces off-distribution activations. Key: legends specify opponent the victim played against.
