Figure 2: Classification and regression tasks with permutation equivariant models. All the universalpermutation equivariant models perform similarly, while the equivariant non-universal PointNetdemonstrates reduced performace consistently; MLP baseline (with the same number of parametersas the equivariant models) performs poorly.
Figure 3: Using DeePSets to regress to a single graPh convolution layer. In the left image we variedthe dePth and took a constant width of 200. In the right we varied the width and took a fixed dePthof 6 layers. The y axes are in log scale. Note that even a 2 layer DeePSets can aPProximate a graPhconvolution layer up to an error of ã€œ0.01.
