Figure 1: Discontinuity (red arrow) when rotating the set of points. The coloured points denote whichoutput of the network is responsible for which point. In the top path, the set rotated by 90。is the sameset (exactly the same shape before and after rotation) and encodes to the same feature vector, so theoutput responsibility (colouring) must be the same too. In this example, after 30。and a further smallclockwise rotation by , the point that each output pair is responsible for has to suddenly change.
Figure 2: Overview of our FSPool model for variable-sized sets. In this example, the weights definepiecewise linear functions with two pieces. The four dots on each line correspond to the positionswhere f is evaluated for a set of size four.
