Figure 1: A visual comparison of data augmentation techniques. AugMix produces images withvariety while preserving much of the image semantics and local statistics.
Figure 2: Example ImageNet-C cor-ruptions. These corruptions are en-countered only at test time and notduring training.
Figure 3: A cascade of successive compositions can produce images which drift far from the originalimage, and lead to unrealistic images. However, this divergence can be balanced by controlling thenumber of steps. To increase variety, we generate multiple augmented images and mix them.
Figure 4: A realization of AUGMIX. Augmentation operations SUCh as translates and weights SUCh asm are randomly sampled. Randomly sampled operations and their compositions allow us to explorethe semantiCally equivalent input spaCe around an image. Mixing these images together produCes anew image without veering too far from the original.
Figure 5: Error rates of various methods on CIFAR-10-C using a ResNeXt backbone. Observe thatAugMix halves the error rate of prior methods and approaches the clean error rate.
Figure 6: CIFAR-10-P prediction stability and Root Mean Square Calibration Error values forResNeXt. AugMix simultaneously reduces flip probabilities and calibration error.
Figure 7: UnCertainty results on ImageNet-C. Observe that under severe data shifts, the RMSCalibration error With ensembles and AugMix is remarkably steady. Even though ClassifiCationerror inCreases, Calibration is roughly preserved. Severity zero denotes Clean data.
Figure 8: AUGMIX hyperparameter ablations on ImageNet-C.ImageNet-C classification performanceis stable changes to AUGMIX's hyperparameters.
Figure 9: Fourier Sensitivity Heatmap of the baseline Wide ResNet, Cutout, and AugMix CIFAR-10models. All Fourier basis perturbations are added to clean CIFAR-10 test images. AugMix maintainsrobustness atlow frequencies and is far more robust to mid and high frequency modifications. Exampleperturbed images are shown above, with black pointer lines indicating the Fourier basis vector usedto perturb the image. For each basis vector we compute the error rate of the model after perturbingthe entire test set.
Figure 10: Illustration of augmentation operations applied to the same image. Some operationseverities have been increased to show detail.
Figure 11: An illustration of manifold intrusion (Guo et al., 2019), where histogram color augmenta-tion can change the imageâ€™s class.
Figure 12: AugMix improves corruption robustness across all CIFAR-10-C noise, blur, weather, anddigital corruptions, despite the model never having seen these corruptions during training.
