Figure 1: Design overview and network structures under investigation.
Figure 2: Left: CelebA images reconstructed from different features. From top down: original input,reconstruction from 'encoder' output of the original DNN, dec(a), dec(a*), dec(x). Right: CIFAR-10 images reconstructed from different features. From top down: original input, reconstruction from'encoder' output of the noisy DNN, -, dec(a*), dec(x). Reconstruction has limited resemblance withthe input in the last two rows.
Figure 4: CIFAR-10 images reconstructed from different features on a variety of LeNet-based neuralnetworks.
Figure 5: CUB200-2011 images reconstructed from different features on a variety of VGG-16-basedneural networks.
Figure 6: CelebA images reconstructed from different features on a variety of AlexNet-based neuralnetworks.
Figure 7: CelebA images reconstructed from feature x rotated by different angles within (0, 2π). Wepick the most meaningful ones. The first image of every two row is the original input image.
Figure 8: CelebA images and CIFAR-10 images reconstructed from feature x correctly decoded withthe knowledge of θ . The reconstructed images have high similarity with the original inputs.
