Figure 1: Model architecture of our proposed optimizer. All the operations are applied coordinate-Wisely except querying ZO Oracle to obtain ZO gradient estimator (equation 1). Each coordinateshares the QueryRNN and the UpdateRNN parameters but maintains its own hidden state.
Figure 2: (a)-(b) & (d)-(e): BlaCk-box attaCk loss versus iterations on seleCted test images. The lossCurves are averaged over 10 independent random trails and the shaded areas indiCate the standarddeviation. (C) & (f): BlaCk-box attaCk loss Curves averaged over all 100 test images. AttaCk oneaCh image is run for 10 trails. On CIFAR-10 attaCk task, we also test the performanCe of thelearned optimizer trained on MINST attaCk task with finetuning (ZO-LSTM-finetune, whiCh will beintroduCed in SeCtion 4.3).

Figure 4: Analytical experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed optimizer. (a)-(c): Ablation study on MNIST attack task, CIFAR-10 attack task, and binary classification taskrespectively. For MINST and CIFAR-10 attack task, We average the loss curve over all 100 testimages and attack on each image is run for 10 independent trails (see Appendix A.4 for additionalplots on single test images). (d): Evaluation of average cosine similarity between ZO gradientestimator and ground-truth gradient with and without the QueryRNN. (e): Optimization trajectoryof one coordinate when applying ZO-LSTM on MNIST attack task. In the bottom figure, we applyZO-SGD and ZO-ADAM to the same optimization trajectory as ZO-LSTM, i.e., assume they usethe same ZO gradient estimator at each iteration but produce different parameter updates.
