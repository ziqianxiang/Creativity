Figure 1: Introducing NSM into MANN. At each timestep, the program interface network(PI ) receives input from the state network and queries the program memory Mp , acquiringthe working weight for the interface network (Wtc). The interface network then operates onthe data memory M.
Figure 2: Learning curves on NTM tasks (a) and Associative Recall (AR) ablation study(b). Only mean is plotted in (b) for better visualization.
Figure 3: (a,b,c) visualizes NUTMâ€™s executions in synthetic tasks: the upper rows arememory read (left)/write (right) locations; the lower rows are program distributions overtimesteps. The green line indicates the start of the decoding phase. (d) visualizes persever-ation in NTM: the upper row are input, output, predicted output with errors (orange bits);the lower row is reading location.

Figure 5:	Mean bit accuracy with error bars for the continual algorithmic tasks. Each ofthe first four panels show bit accuracy on four tasks after finishing a task. The rightmostshows the average accuracy.
Figure 6: Visualization of the first two principal components of ct space in NTM (a,c) andNUTM (b,d) for Copy (red) and Repeat Copy (blue). Fader color denotes lower timestep ina sequence. Both can learn clusters of hidden states yet NUTM exhibits clearer partition.
