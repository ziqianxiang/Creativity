Figure 1: Illustration of the two moon datasets and the optimal transport result. The target domain(blue) is built by adding noise to the source (orange) and rotating by 60 degrees. Correspondingsubsets are denoted by circles and crossings. (b-e) Optimal transport plan under (b) Euclidean cost(OT-baseline) (c) learned cost function by OT-SI and (d) Procrustes-based OT. Points learned to bematched are connected by solid curves. When a datapoint is matched to the wrong subset, i.e, to theother moon, the connection curve is colored by red.
