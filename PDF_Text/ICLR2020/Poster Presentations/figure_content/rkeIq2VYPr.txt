Figure 1: (a)-(c): feature distribution of MNIST dataset under different settings. Left and right fortraining and testing samples, respectively. (a) Contrastive loss for metric learning; (b) Contrastiveloss + DPP regularization; (c) Contrastive loss + DPP regularization + WGAN regularization. For (c),the features are generally lying in the space [-1, 1]2. Zoom in for better view.
Figure 2: Visualization of 16-bit hashing code results on CIFAR-10. For (c) the histograms UP anddown correspond to DPP+WGAN and Lin et al. (2015), respectively. Zoom in for better view.
