Figure 1: Following the instructions in LUo et al. (2016), We draw the ERF of FPN in differentresolution features. The size Ofbase plate is 512Ã— 512, with respective anchor boxes ({64,128, 256}for {p3, p4, p5 }) drawn in. The classification CNNs ResNet50 tends to have redundant ERF for highresolution features p3 and limited ERF for low resolution features p5. After stage reallocation, ourSCR-ResNet50 has more balanced ERF across all resolutions which leads to a high performance.
Figure 2: Stage reallocation in different resolution. In supernet training, we random sample a choicein each stage and optimize corresponding weights. In reallocation searching, eligible strategies areevaluated according to the computation budget.
Figure 3: Evaluation of a choice in block operation search approach. As shown in figure, We havepartial architecture ofblock 1 and block 2, and now we need to evaluate the performance of convolu-tion with dilated rate 3 in the third block. We uniform sample the operation of rest blocks to generatea temporary architecture and then evaluate the choice through several temporary architectures.
Figure 4: Architecture sketches. From top to bottom, they are baseline ResNet50, stage reallocationSCR-ResNet50 and final CR-ResNet50.
Figure 5: Detector FLOPs(G) versus AP onCOCO minival. The bold lines and dotted linesare the baselines and our stage computation real-location models(SCR-) respectively.
Figure 6: Top1 accuracy on ImageNet validationset versus AP on COCO minival. Each dot is amodel which has equivalent FLOPs as the base-line.
