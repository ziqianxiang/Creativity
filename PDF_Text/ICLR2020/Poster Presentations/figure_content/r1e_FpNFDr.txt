Figure 2: Generalization gap as a function of W3.3	More comparisonsTheorem 3.1 applies in the case that there are no convolutional layers, i.e. for a fully connectednetwork. In this subsection, we compare its bound in this case with the bound of (Bartlett et al.,2017). Because the bounds are in terms of different quantities, we compare them in a simpleconcrete case. In this case, for D = cd2 , each hidden layer has D components, and there areD classes. For all i, V0(i) = I and V(i) = I + H∕√D, where H is a Hadamard matrix (usingthe Sylvester construction), and χ = M = 1. Then, dropping the superscripts, each layer V has||V ||2 =2, ||V-V0||2 =1, ||V-V0||2,1 =D.
