Figure 2: Physics-aware Difference Graph Networks for graph signal prediction. Blue boxes havelearnable parameters and all parameters are trained through end-to-end learning. The nodes/edgescan be multidimensional.
Figure 4: Gradients and graph structure of sampled points. Left: the synthetic function is fι(χ, y)0.1x2 + 0.5y2. Right: the synthetic function is f2(x, y) = sin(x) + cos(y).
