Figure 1: Performance of BayesOpt attack with GP surrogate in different reduced dimension dr.
Figure 2: Query efficiency of BayesOpt Attacks. The plots show the attack success rate (ASR)of different methods up to certain query counts. The best BayesOpt attacks (i.e. GP-BO-auto-dr(red) and ADDGP-BO (blue)) can achieve an ASR of 98% on MNIST(a) and 87% on CIFAR10(b) within a budget of 1000 queries. To achieve the same success rates, GenAttack (purple) takes3500 for MNIST and 5141 for CIFAR10, and AutoZOOM (green) takes 800 for MNIST and 3880for CIFAR10. For ImageNet (c), the best BayesOpt attack is ADDGP-BO (blue), which achievesan ASR of 60% with 1985 queries. To achieve the same success rates, GenAttack (purple) takes abudget of 4711 queries and AutoZOOM (green) takes 19451 queries. ZOO fails to make any attackon ImageNet within the given budget.

Figure 4:	Attack objective value against BayesOpt iterations(query count) for using variousBayesOpt methods to attack one CIFAR10 image of class label 9 (denoted by i). Curves of dif-ferent colours correspond to the 9 different target labels (denoted by t). Convergence to 0 objectivevalue indicates successful attack. ADDGP-BO and GP-BO-auto-dr enjoy faster convergence andthus higher attack success rates than simple GP-BO.
