Figure 1: Example of Abductive Reasoning. Given observations O1 and O2, the αNLI task is toselect the most plausible explanatory hypothesis. Since the number of hypotheses is massive in anygiven situation, we make a simplifying assumption in our ART dataset to only choose between a pairof explanations.
Figure 2: Illustration of the graphical models described in the probabilistic framework. The “FullyConnected” model can, in theory, combine information from both available observations.
Figure 3: Overview of an αNLG model that integrates commonsense representations obtained fromCOMeT (BoSSelut et al., 2019) with GPT2. Each observation is input to the COMeT model to obtainnine embeddings, each associated with one commonsense inference type.
