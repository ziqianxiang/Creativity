Figure 1: Illustration of structural information. In all three graphs, the degrees of x and y are thesame. However, the Ricci curvature of the edge (x, y) is negative, zero, and positive, respectively.
Figure 2: An overview of our Curvature Graph Network. The top row represents the iterative featureupdate function Ht implemented by consecutive non-linear layers. The bottom row represents thecomputation of reweighting parameter τxty from the edge curvature information.
Figure 3: Heat maps on synthetic data by SBM. The top-right figure is the performance of VanillaGN, CurvGN-1 and CurvGN-n over different graph sizes.
Figure 4: One SBM result with (p, q) = (0.21, 0.025). Small nodes are training set. Large nodes aretesting set. Colors correspond to the predicted node labels.
Figure 5:	Visualization of theoretical graph modelsWe generate 100 different graphs using different combinations of parameters es and el . Herees ∈ {floor(2.5), floor(5),…floor(25)} controls the distance upperbound for short-range neighbors;any nodes within distance es of x is connected with x. es is very similar to k in Wattz-Strogatz graph.
