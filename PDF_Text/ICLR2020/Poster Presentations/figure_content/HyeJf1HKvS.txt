Figure 1: High-level illustration of our two-stage neighborhood consensus architecture. Node fea-tures are first locally matched based on a graph neural network Ψθ1 , before their correspondencescores get iteratively refined based on neighborhood consensus. Here, an injective node coloring ofGs is transferred to Gt via S, and distributed by Ψθ2 on both graphs. Updates on S are performedby a neural network Φθ3 based on pair-wise color differences.

Figure 4: Qualitative examples from the WILLOW-ObjectClass dataset. Images on the leftrepresent the sourCe, whereas images on the right represent the target. For eaCh example, we visual-ize both the result of the initial feature matChing proCedure S(0) (top) and the result obtained afterrefinement S(L) (bottom).
