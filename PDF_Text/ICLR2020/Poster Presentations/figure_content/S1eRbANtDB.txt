Figure 1: An example of the execution tree of Amerge(Dmin, Dmax) for a clustering instance with 4 points. The nestedrectangles show the clustering at each node.
Figure 2: Depiction of Algorithm 2 when given three clusters, C1, C2, and C3. Each line shows the Dα-distancebetween one pair of clusters as a function of the parameter α. On the first iteration, Algorithm 2 determines that clustersC2 and C3 are the closest for the parameter α = αlo, calculates the critical parameter values c12 and c13, and advancesα to c13. Repeating the process partitions of [αlo, αhi) into merge-constant regions.
Figure 3: Empirical loss for interpolating between single and complete linkage (‘SC’ in the legend) as well as betweenaverage and complete linkage (‘AC’ in the legend) over 1000 sampled clustering instances.
Figure 4: Empirical loss interpolating between two distance metrics on Omniglot, Places2, and Places2 distributions. Ineach plot, β = 0 corresponds to the hand-crafted metric and β = 1 corresponds to the neural network embedding.
