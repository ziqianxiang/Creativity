Figure 1: Perplexity gain of JOINT BIT-MED and JOINT BIT-LARGE* (using BASE LM-24L) at each positionrelative to Base LM-24L on the test set of CC-News. At each position the lower and upper bounds (Eq. 5estimated using the method in Eq. 4, see ยง3.2 for more details) are estimated using 20,000 samples. The shorterthe horizon (moving to the right), the tighter the estimation is but also the more limited the gains compared tobase LM as un-normalized models are most useful on longer generations.
Figure 2: Left: PPL estimation for joint BIT-BASE on CC-NeWS validation set as We vary the number ofsamples. Right: Percentage of Unique n-grams found in real data, samples from the joint model BiT-Base andsamples from the base language model. The joint sampling is done With 10,000 samples.
