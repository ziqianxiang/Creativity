Figure 1: FST-enhanced hierarchical encoder-decoder (FeHED). FeHED first takes dialog his-tory u1, u2, ..., ut and feeds it to dialog act and strategy classifiers. Dialog act/strategy classi-fiers then output a sequence of dialog acts da1, da2, ..., dat or strategies st1 , st2, .., stt, which,in turn, are fed to FSTs (green dotted lines). FSTs then output a sequence of state embeddings1da/st, s2da/st, ..., stda/st to the hierarchical encoder-decoder (HED; blue dotted lines). Lastly, HEDgenerates the system response ut+1 and predicts the next strategies st0t+1. The red dotted line indi-cates a posterior constraint.ãŠ‰ represents concatenation.
Figure 2: An example of FST-DA with three states. For each edge, we only show the top frequentdialog acts for better visualization.
