Figure 1: Example of activation vector and how the Softmax layer responses. The image on the leftshows the activation vector ofa natural face in the training set. The Softmax layer performs Softmaxoperation over the linear combination of such activation vectors and assigns high confidence tothe corresponding class. The target-agnostic image (the image on the right) is crafted such that itactivates one neuron in activation vector with extremely large value and all others are almost zero.

However, a successful black-box attack often needs hundreds to millions of queries to thetarget model whereas the high effectiveness of our attack means it only needs a few query to thetarget model to generate adversarial input.

That is thereason the attack becomes less effective when more new layers are added.
