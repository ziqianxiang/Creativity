Figure 1: Estimation performance of MINE, MINE-f and MIGE. Each estimation approach hasbeen taken additional 20 times and plotted with light curves. Top: True MI and correspondingestimation of MINE and MINE-f . Bottom: True gradient and corresponding estimation of MINE,MINE-f and MIGE. Our approach MIGE only appears in bottom figures since it directly givesgradient estimation. As we observe, MIGE gives more stable, smooth and accurate results.
