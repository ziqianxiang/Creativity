Figure 1: Schematic of the architecture used in all ex-periments. The blue components show some criticaldifferences that differentiate it from more abstract stud-ies that reported failures in systematic generalization.
Figure 2: Test and training performance as an agent learns zero-shot predicate-argument binding for (a) ‘lifting’in two variants: (1) training instructions are e.g. find a spaceship, find/lift a pencil, testing instruc-tions are e.g. lift a spaceship. (2) training instructions are e.g. find a spaceship/lift a greenobject, testing instructions are e.g. lift a spaceship. (b) ‘putting’: training instructions are e.g. put aspaceship on the bed, lift a pencil, testing instructions are e.g. put a pencil on the bed.
Figure 3: Screenshots from the agent’s perspective of an episode in the grid-world and Unity environments.
Figure 4: (a) Four (independent) training inputs from the training data for the classifier model. (b) Fourtimesteps of input from a single episode for the situated agent.
Figure 5: Left An episode of the grid-world task that can be posed with or without language. Right Nor-malised episode returns on training and evaluation trials as the agent learns, adjusted to ignore episodes wherethe first object that the agent collects is incorrect.
