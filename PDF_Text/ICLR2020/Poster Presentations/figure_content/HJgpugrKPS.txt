Figure 1: Left: the way steerable filters are computed using steerable filter basis. Middle and right: arepresentation of scale-convolution using Equation 9 and Equation 10. As an example we use inputsignal f with 3 channels. It has 1 scale on T and 4 scales on H. It is convolved with filter κ = w × Ψwithout scale interaction, which produces the output with 2 channels and 4 scales as well. Here werepresent only channels of the signals and the filter. Spatial components are hidden for simplicity.
Figure 2: Equivariance error ∆ as a function of the number of layers (left), downscaling appliedto the input image (middle), and as a function of number of scales in interscale interactions (right).
