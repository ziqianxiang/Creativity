Figure 1: log '(0) at t = 1258 and t = 10000, for different depth-width configurations and differentinitialization schemes. Darker color means smaller loss.
Figure 2: Relative loss v.s. training time. For each plot, we vary width from 50 (yellow) to 1200(purple). Solid and dashed lines represent Gaussian (GS) and orthogonal (OT) initializations.
