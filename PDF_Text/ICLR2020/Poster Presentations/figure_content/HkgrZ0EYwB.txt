Figure 1: We present a point-based shape completion network that can be directly used on rawscans without requiring paired training data. Here we show a sampling of results from the ScanNet,Matterport3D, 3D-EPN, and KITTI datasets.
Figure 2: Unpaired Scan Completion Network.
Figure 3: Effect of unpaired scan completionwithout (Equation 5) and with HL term (Equa-tion 6). Without the HL term, the network pro-duces a clean point set for a complete chair, thatis different in shape from the input. With the HLterm, the network produces a clean point set thatmatches the input.
Figure 4: Qualitative comparisons on real-world data, which includes partial scans of ScanNet chairsand tables, Matterport3D chairs and tables, and KITTI cars. We show the partial input in grey andthe corresponding completion in gold on the right.
Figure 5: Qualitative comparison on 3D-EPN dataset.
Figure 6: Effect of data distribution discrepancy and qualitative comparison on our synthetic dataset.
