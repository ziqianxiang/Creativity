Figure 1: DTLR on the solar wind problem. Left: comparative quantitative assessment w.r.t. the stateof the art (Carrington rotation 2077). Right: qualitative assessment of the prediction.
Figure 2: Geometry of the CSSS Model (Zhao and Hoeksema, 1995). The spherical surface withradius Rcp is the cusp surface, representing the locus of cusp points of helmet streamers and thelocation of the inner corona. The source surface (radius Rss) is free to be placed anywhere outsidethe cusp surface. Figure reproduced from Zhao and Hoeksema (1995).
