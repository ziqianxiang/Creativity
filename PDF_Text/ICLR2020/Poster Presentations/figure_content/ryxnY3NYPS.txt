Figure 1: A toy trajectory forecasting example. (a) The three modes (pink, blue, purple) of thefuture trajectory distribution are shown in both the trajectory space and the latent space of a learnedVAE model. The data distribution is imbalanced, where the blue mode has most data and coversmost of the latent space. (b) Random samples from the VAE only cover the major (blue) mode. (c)Our proposed DSF generates a diverse set of future trajectories covering all three modes.
Figure 2: In real data, contexts (past trajecto-ries) are seldom the same due to noise.
Figure 3: Qualitative results on synthetic data for both balanced and imbalanced data distributionwhen N = 10. Blue represents the past trajectory and red represents forecasted future trajectories.
Figure 4: ADE vs. N for synthetic data and human motion forecasting. cGAN is not shown in thisplot as it is much worse than other methods due to mode collapse.
Figure 5: Qualitative results for human motion forecasting when N = 10. The left shows the startingpose, and the right shows for each method the final pose of all 10 forecasted motion samples.
Figure 6: Network architectures for synthetic data and human motion. Top: for synthetic data, weuse a CNN to process the obstacle map f and directly flatten trajectories x and h into vectors. Thereconstructed trajectory X is decoded with an MLP. Bottom: for human motion, We use Bi-LSTMsto extract temporal features for X and h and decode the reconstructed trajectory X with a forwardLSTM.
Figure 7: Additional visualization for human motion forecasting. The left shows the starting pose,and on the right we show for each method the final pose of 10 forecasted motion samples.
