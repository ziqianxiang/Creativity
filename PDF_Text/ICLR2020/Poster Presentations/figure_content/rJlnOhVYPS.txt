Figure 1: Person image Ai and A2 belong to the same identity while B with similar appearance isfrom another person. However, clustering-generated pseudo labels in state-of-the-art UnsupervisedDomain Adaptation (UDA) methods contain much noise that hinders feature learning. We proposepseudo label refinery with on-line refined soft pseudo labels to effectively mitigate the influence ofnoisy pseudo labels and improve UDA performance on person re-ID.
Figure 2: (a) The pipeline for existing clustering-based UDA methods on person re-ID with noisyhard pseudo labels. (b) Overall framework of the proposed Mutual Mean-Teaching (MMT) withtwo collaborative networks jointly optimized under the supervisions of off-line refined hard pseudolabels and on-line refined soft pseudo labels. A soft identity classification loss and a novel softsoftmax-triplet loss are adopted. (c) One of the average models with better validated performance isadopted for inference as average models perform better than models with current parameters.
Figure 3: The predictions of temporal average models (denoted as “Proposed MMT-500”) serveas more complementary and robust soft pseudo labels than those of ordinary networks (denoted as“ProposedMMT-500 (Wlo E[θ])").
Figure 4: Performance evaluation of our proposed MMT-500 with different values of λttri and λtidin equation 9 on Duke-to-Market and Market-to-Duke tasks in terms of mAP(%) and top-1(%)accuracies. Weighting factors λttri and λitd balance the contributions between hard and soft pseudolabels. Specifically, only hard labels are adopted when the weighting factors are set to 0.0, and onlysoft labels are utilized when the weighting factors are set to 1.0.
