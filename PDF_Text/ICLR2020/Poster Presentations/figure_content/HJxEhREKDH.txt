Figure 1: (a)-(b):Convergence performances for three input and output transformations on a 10-hidden-layer linear ResNets. (c)-(d) Comparison between the convergence performances of trainingdeep linear ResNets with zero initialization on hidden weights and standard deep linear network withGaussian random initialization on hidden weights, where the input and output weights are generatedby random initialization, and remain fixed throughout the training.
