Figure 1: Overview of the proposed GraPhAF model. (a) Illustration of the generative procedure. New nodesor edges are marked in red. Starting from an empty graph and iteratively sample random variables to map themto atom/bond features. The numbered first three steps correspond to the maps in the bottom figure of Fig. 1(b).
