Figure 1: Inter-class to Intra-class variance ratios of embedding space varies with k used in training.
Figure 2: Intrinsic dimension approximated by the number of significant eigenvalues varies with kused in training. Left: Omniglot. Right: miniImageNet and tieredImageNet4.3	Experiments with ESTWe evaluate the performance of EST on the three aforementioned data sets. The performance iscompared against our implementation of vanilla ProtoNets as a baseline, as well as a variant ofProtoNets using principal components obtained from all embedding points (ProtoNet-PCA).
