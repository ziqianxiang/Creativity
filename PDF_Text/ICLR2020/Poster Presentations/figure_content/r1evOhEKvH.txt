Figure 1: The illustration of our proposed GIL framework. For the problem of graph node labeling, the categoryinformation of these unlabeled nodes depends on the similarity computation between a query node (e.g., vj)and these labeled reference nodes (e.g., vi). We consider the similarity from three points: node attributes,the consistency of local topological structures (i.e., the circle with dashed line), and the between-node pathreachability (i.e., the red wave line from vi to vj ). Specifically, the local structures as well as node attributes areencoded as high-level features with graph convolution, while the between-node path reachability is abstracted asreachable probabilities of random walks. To better make the inference generalize to test nodes, we introduce ameta-learning strategy to optimize the structure relations learning from training nodes to validation nodes.
Figure 2: (a) Performance comparisons within different between-node steps on the Cora dataset. The accuracyequals to the number of correctly classified nodes divided by all testing samples, and is accumulated from step 1to step k. (b) Performance comparisons with different label rates on the Pubmed dataset.
