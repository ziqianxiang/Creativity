Figure 2: Illustration of the procedu-ral generation algorithm for the infiniteworld map. The 32 × 32 patches shownin white have already been sampled andthose in gray have been sampled but notfixed in order to avoid boundary effects.

Figure 4: Non-episodic experiment result. Thereward rate is computed using a 100,000-stepwindow and the shaded bands correspond to stan-dard error over 20 runs.
Figure 5:	Non-stationary experiment results. The reward rate is computed using a 100,000-step window and theshaded bands correspond to standard error over 20 runs.
Figure 6:	Multi-modal experiment results. The braces on top of the plots specify the reward function usedin each case. The reward rate is computed using a 100,000-step window and the shaded bands correspond tostandard error over 20 runs. “Greedy Visual” refers to the reward rate obtained by the greedy visual agent baselinedescribed in Section A.7 (which, as explained in that section, is not able to handle occlusion or avoidance).

Figure 8: Results of experiments on the configu-ration shown in Tables 4 and 5.
Figure 9: Visualization of an example environment with spatial non-stationarity. Each tile is colored accordingto its scent. JellyBeans are shown in blue, Bananas in green, and Onions in red. Walls are depicted asgrey squares. This environment was generated using the configuration shown in Tables 6 and 7.
