Figure 1: The trajectory of the standardSGD (left) and SGD with momentum (right).
Figure 2: Performance of SGD with different values of β = {0, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9}; β = 0 corresponds to thestandard SGD. Fig. 4a: We plot convergence in function value f (∙) given in (3). Initialization is always set asw0 = 0. All the algorithms use the same step size η = 5 × 10-5 . Fig. 4b: We plot convergence in relativedistance to the true model w*, defined as min(∣∣wt — w*k, ∣∣wt + w*k)∕kw*k, which more appropriatelycaptures progress as the global sign of the objective (4) is unrecoverable. All the algorithms are initialized at thesame point wo 〜N(0, Id/(10000d)) and use the same step size η = 5 X 10-4.
Figure 3: Plots of the related properties. Sub-figures on the top row are regarding solving (3) and sub-figures onthe bottom row are regarding solving (4) (phase retrieval). Note that the function value/relative distance to w* areplotted on Figure 2. Above, sub-figures (a) and (d): We plot the gradient norms versus iterations. Sub-figures (b)and (e): We plot the values ofhVf (wt),mt — gti∕∣Vf (Wt) ∣∣2 versus iterations. For (b), we only report themwhen the gradient is large (∣Vf (wt)∣ ≥ 0.02). It shows that the value is large than -0.5 except the transition.
Figure 4: Plot regarding the GrACE property. We plot the values of ηh∙f(Wt),gt-m1+2η mt Htmt versusiterations. An interesting observation is that the value is well upper-bounded by zero for the phase retrievalproblem. The results imply that the constant ch is indeed small.
