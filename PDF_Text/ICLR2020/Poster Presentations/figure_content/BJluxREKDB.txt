Figure 1: Sketch of the architecture for a formula φ with n variables Vi and m clauses. Sg is theglobal state of the solver, A is the adjacency matrix, and vi and ci are the variable and clause labels.
Figure 2: The bipartite graphfor (x ∨ y) ∧ (x ∨ y).
Figure 3: Two cactus plots showing how the number of solved formulas from the test set grows withincreasing resource bounds. Left: Comparing the number of formulas solved with growing decisionlimit for Random, VSIDS, and our learned heuristic. Right: Comparing the number of formulassolved with growing wall clock time. Lower and further to the right is better.
Figure 4:	A cactus plot describing how many formulas from the test set were solved within growingdecision limits on the Words test set. Lower and further to the right is better.
Figure 5:	A cactus plot describing how many formulas from the test set were solved within growingdecision limits on the Boolean test set. Lower and further to the right is better.
Figure 6:	A cactus plot describing how many formulas were solved within growing decision limitson the Words30 test set. Lower and further to the right is better. Note that unlike in the other plots,the model Words was not trained on this distribution of formulas, but on the same Words dataset asbefore.
Figure 7:	A cactus plot describing how many formulas were solved within growing decision limits onthe reduction test set with different models. VSIDS, Random, and Learned are same as left side ofFigure 3.
