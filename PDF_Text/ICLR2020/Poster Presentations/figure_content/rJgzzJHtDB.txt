Figure 1: Our proposed RDI-Net framework, a defended multi-output network enabling dynamicinference. Each image, being it clean or adversarially perturbed, adaptively picks one branch to exit.
Figure 2: The exiting behaviours of RDI-ResNet38 defended by (a) Single attack defense (MainBranch); (b) Average defense; and (c) Max-Average defense.
Figure 3: Network architecture of RDI-SmallCNN. Two branch classifiers are inserted after 1stconvolutional layer and 3rd convolutional layer in the original SmallCNN.
Figure 4: Network architecture of RDI-ResNet38. In each residual block group, two branch classi-fiers are inserted after 1st residual block and 4th residual block.
Figure 5: Network architecture of RDI-MobilenetV2. Two branch classfiers are inserted after 3rdinverted residual block and 11th inverted residual block in the orignal MobilenetV2.
Figure 6: Performance comparison between RDI-Net and the pruning + defense baseline. Eachmarker represents a model, whose size is proportional to its MFlops. Î³ is the sparsity trade-offparameter: the larger the sparser (smaller model).
