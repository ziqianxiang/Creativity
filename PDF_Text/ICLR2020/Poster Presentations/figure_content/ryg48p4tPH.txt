Figure 1: ASN of agent i contains n sub-modules:O2Ai ,O2Ai,1, ∙∙∙ , O2Ai,i-1, O2Ai,i+1, ∙∙∙ , O2Ai,neach of which takes different parts of the agent'sobservation as input.
Figure 3: Different variants of ASN. Here We only present the right part of ASN (excluding the leftpart O2Ai of ASN) as different variants.
Figure 2: QMIX-ASN contains one mixing network and nnetworks of all agents, and each agent network follows theASN architecture.
