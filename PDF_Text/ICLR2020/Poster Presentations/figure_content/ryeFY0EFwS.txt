Figure 1: Results of the experiment to reduce similarity by adding label noise (ยง2).
Figure 2: Relative contributions of pristine (similar) and corrupt (dissimilar) examples to point-in-time loss reduction. To get a sense of statistical significance, we show the actual statistic as well as 3simulations under the null assuming there is no difference. See ยง2.4.
Figure 3: Contributions of mean pristine (similar) and corrupt (dissimilar) examples to loss reductionaccumulated over first few steps of training. To get a sense of statistical significance, we show theactual statistic as well as 3 simulations under the null assuming there is no difference. See ยง2.4.
Figure 4: Effect of suppressing weak gradient directions by eliminating outlier per-example gradients.
