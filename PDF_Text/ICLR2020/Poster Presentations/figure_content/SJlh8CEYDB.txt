Figure 1: A scene-graph can describe the relations of objects in an image. The NLIL can utilize thisgraph and explain the presence of objects Car and Person by learning the first-order logic rulesthat characterize the common sub-patterns in the graph. The explanation is globally consistent andcan be interpreted as commonsense knowledge.
Figure 2: Factor graphs of example chain-like, tree-like and conjunctions of rules.
Figure 3: A hierarchical rule space where the operator calls, statement evaluations and logic com-binations are all relaxed into the weight sums with respect to attentions Sφ, Sψ, Sψ, Sf, Sf and s°.
