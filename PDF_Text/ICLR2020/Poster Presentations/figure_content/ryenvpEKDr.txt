Figure 1: Error landscapes in log-log-log scale. Each point (blue dot) is the error resulting fromtraining with a model/data configuration m, n. The surface is a linear interpolation between thepoints, which is then projected on the (m, ), (n, ) and (m, n) planes. See Appendix C for details.
Figure 2: Error vs. data size (left part of each subfigure) and model size (right part) for Wiki103 andCIFAR10. Solid dots are measurements, dashed lines are best fit to saturating power-law.
Figure 3: Error estimation results, using 10-fold cross-validation on all configurations in eachdataset. For reference, in blue is the identity line. The legend shows mean μ and standard devi-ation σ of the divergence δ (± one std). See Appendix C for the actual and estimated landscapes ineach dataset.
Figure 4: Error landscape estimation results on CIFAR10 for width and depth scaling, showing smalland comparable fit errors in both cases. Numbers in legends denote mean/variance of the estimationdivergence.
Figure 6: Extrapolation results. (a) Illustration of the extrapolation setup, where we fit on a subsetof the points (in green) and predict on larger points (in red). (b) and (c) show example results on oneconfiguration in two benchmark datasets. Comprehensive results are given in Appendix D.
