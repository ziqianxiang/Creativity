Recent work has exhibited the surprising cross-lingual abilities of multilingual
BERT (M-BERT) - surprising since it is trained without any cross-lingual objec-
tive and with no aligned data. In this work, we provide a comprehensive study
of the contribution of different components in M-BERT to its cross-lingual abil-
ity. We study the impact of linguistic properties of the languages, the architecture
of the model, and the learning objectives. The experimental study is done in the
context of three typologically different languages - Spanish, Hindi, and Russian
- and using two conceptually different NLP tasks, textual entailment and named
entity recognition. Among our key conclusions is the fact that the lexical overlap
between languages plays a negligible role in the cross-lingual success, while the
depth of the network is an integral part of it. All our models and implementations
can be found on our project page* 1.
1	Introduction
Embeddings of natural language text via unsupervised learning, coupled with sufficient supervised
training data, have been ubiquitous in NLP in recent years and have shown success in a wide range
of monolingual NLP tasks, mostly in English. Training models for other languages has been shown
more difficult, and recent approaches relied on bilingual embeddings that allowed the transfer of
supervision in high resource languages like English to models in lower resource languages; however,
inducing these bilingual embeddings required some level of supervision (Upadhyay et al., 2016).
Multilingual BERT2 (M-BERT), a Transformer-based (Vaswani et al., 2017) language model trained
on raw Wikipedia text of 104 languages suggests an entirely different approach. Not only is the
model contextual, but its training also requires no supervision -no alignment between the languages
is done. Nevertheless, and despite being trained with no explicit cross-lingual objective, M-BERT
produces a representation that seems to generalize well across languages for a variety of downstream
tasks (Wu & Dredze, 2019).
In this work, we attempt to develop an understanding of the success of M-BERT. We study a range
of aspects on two different NLP tasks, in order to identify the key components in the success of
the model. Our study is done in the context of only two languages, source (typically English) and
target (multiple, quite different languages). By involving only a pair of languages, we can study

the performance on a given target language, ensuring that it is influenced only by the cross-lingual
transfer from the source language, without having to worry about a third language interfering.
We analyze the two-languages version of M-BERT (B-BERT, for bilingual BERT, from now on) in
three orthogonal dimensions: (i) linguistic properties and similarities of target and source languages;
(ii) network architecture, and (iii) input and learning objective.
One hypothesis that has been discussed as a way to explain the success of M-BERT has to do
with some level of language similarity. This could be lexical similarity (shared words or word-
parts) or structural similarities (word-ordering or word-frequency), or both. Therefore, we begin
by investigating the contribution of word-piece overlap - the extent to which the same word-pieces
appear in both source and target languages - and distinguish it from other similarities, which We
group into a structural similarity between the source and target languages. Surprisingly, as we
show, B-BERT is cross-lingual even when there is absolutely no word-piece overlap. That is, other
aspects of language similarity must be contributing to the cross-lingual capabilities of the model.
This is contrary to the Pires et al. (2019) hypothesis that M-BERT gains its power from shared
word-pieces. Furthermore, we show that the amount of word-piece overlap in B-BERT’s training
data contributes little to performance improvements.
Our study of the model architecture addresses the importance of (i) the network depth, (ii) the
number of attention heads, and (iii) the total number of model parameters in B-BERT. Our results
suggest that depth and the total number of parameters of B-BERT are crucial for both monolingual
and cross-lingual performance, whereas multi-head attention is not a significant factor. A single
attention head B-BERT can already give satisfactory results.
To understand the role of the learning objective and the input representation, we study the effect of
(i) the next sentence prediction objective, (ii) the language identifier in the training data, and (iii)
the level of tokenization in the input representation (character, word-piece, or word tokenization).
Our results indicate that the next sentence prediction objective actually hurts the performance of
the model while identifying the language in the input does not affect B-BERT’s performance cross-
lingually. Our experiments also show that character-level and word-level tokenization of the input
results in significantly worse performance than word-piece level tokenization.
Overall, we provide an extensive set of experiments on three source-target language pairs, English-
Spanish, English-Russian, and English-Hindi, selected for variance of script and typological fea-
tures. We evaluate the performance of B-BERT on two very different downstream tasks: cross-
lingual Named Entity Recognition - a sequence prediction task that requires only local context -
and cross-lingual Textual Entailment Dagan et al. (2013) that requires more global representation of
the text.
Ours is not the first study of M-BERT. Wu & Dredze (2019) and Pires et al. (2019) identified the
cross-lingual success of the model and tried to understand it. The former by considering M-BERT
layer-wise, relating cross-lingual performance with the amount of shared word-pieces and the latter
by considering the model’s ability to transfer between languages as a function of word order similar-
ity in languages. However, both works treated M-BERT as a black box, comparing performance on
different languages. This work, on the other hand, examines how B-BERT performs cross-lingually
by probing its components along multiple aspects.
We also note that some of the architectural conclusions have been observed earlier, if not inves-
tigated, in other contexts. Liu et al. (2019) and Yang et al. (2019) argued that the next sentence
prediction objective of BERT (the monolingual model) is not very useful; we show that this is the
case in the cross-lingual setting. Voita et al. (2019) prunes attention heads for a transformer based
machine translation model and argues that most attention heads are not important; in this work, we
show that the number of attention heads is not important in the cross-lingual setting.
Our contributions are threefold: (i) we provide the first extensive study of the aspects of M-BERT
that give rise to its cross-lingual ability; (ii) we develop a methodology that facilitates the analysis of
similarities between languages and their impact on cross-lingual models; we do this by mapping En-
glish to a Fake-English language, that is identical in all aspects to English but shares no word-pieces
with any target language; finally, (iii) we develop a set of insights into B-BERT, along linguistic,
architectural, and learning dimensions, that would contribute to further understanding and to the
development of more advanced cross-lingual neural models.

2	Background
2.1	BERT
BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) is a Transformer-based (Vaswani et al., 2017) pre-trained language
representation model that has already seen wide use. In contrast to traditional language model
objectives that predict the next word given a context, BERT learns to predict the value of masked
words (so called, Masked Language Modelling, or MLM (Taylor, 1953)), as well as decide if two
sentences are contiguous, known as next sentence prediction (NSP). Input to BERT is a pair of
sentences3 A and B, such that half of the time B comes after A in the original text and the rest of
the time B is a randomly sampled sentence. Some tokens from the input are randomly masked, and
the MLM objective is to predict the masked tokens. Devlin et al. (2019) argues that MLM enables
a deep representation from both directions, and NSP helps understand the relationship between two
sentences and can be beneficial to representations.
After BERT is pre-trained on a massive amount of unlabeled text, the representations can then be
used in downstream tasks. Typically, a new task-specific layer is added to the top of BERT, and all
parameters are fine-tuned on the target task.
2.2	Multilingual BERT
Multilingual BERT is pre-trained in the same way as monolingual BERT except using Wikipedia
text from the top 104 languages. To account for the differences in the size of Wikipedia, some
languages are sub-sampled, and some are super-sampled using exponential smoothing (Devlin et al.,
2018). It’s worth mentioning that there are no cross-lingual objectives specifically designed nor any
cross-lingual data, e.g. parallel corpus, used.
3	Why Multilingual BERT Works
We present analysis for the cross-lingual ability of multilingual BERT (in our case B-BERT) in three
dimensions: (i) linguistic properties and similarities of target and source languages; (ii) network
architecture, and (iii) input and learning objective.
3.1	Datasets and Experimental Setup
In this work, We conduct all our experiments on two conceptually different downstream tasks - Cross-
lingual Textual Entailment (TE) and cross-lingual Named Entity Recognition (NER). TE measures
natural language understanding (NLU) at a sentence and sentence pair level, whereas NER measures
NLU at a token level. We use the Cross-lingual Natural Language Inference (XNLI) (Conneau et al.,
2018) dataset to evaluate cross-lingual TE performance and LORELEI dataset (Strassel & Tracey,
2016) for Cross-Lingual NER.
3.1.1	Cross-lingual Natural Language Inference (XNLI)
XNLI is a standard cross-lingual textual entailment dataset that extends MultiNLI (Williams et al.,
2018) dataset by creating a new dev and test set and manually translating into 14 different languages.
Each input consists of a premise and hypothesis pair, and the task is to classify the relationship
between premise and hypothesis into one of the three labels: entailment, contradiction, and neutral.
While training, both premise and hypothesis are in English, and while testing, both are in the target
language. XNLI uses the same set of premises and hypotheses for all the language, making the
comparison across languages possible.
3.1.2	Cross-lingual Named Entity Recognition (NER)
Named Entity Recognition is the task of identifying and labeling text spans as named entities, such
as people’s names and locations. The NER dataset (Strassel & Tracey, 2016) we use consists of news
and social media text labeled by native speakers following the same guideline in several languages,
including English, Hindi, Spanish, and Russian. We subsample 80%, 10%, 10% of English NER
3In the implementation, the input is a pair of segments, which can contain multiple sentences

data as training, development, and testing. We use the whole dataset of Hindi, Spanish, and Russian
for testing purposes. The vocabulary size is fixed at 60000 and is estimated through the unigram
language model in the SentencePiece library (Kudo, 2018).
3.1.3	Notation and Experimental setup
We denote B-BERT trained on language A and B as A-B, e.g., B-BERT trained on English (en) and
Hindi (hi) as en-hi, similarly for Spanish (es) and Russian (ru). For pre-training, we subsample en,
es, and ru Wikipedia to 1GB and use the entire Wikipedia for Hindi. Unless otherwise specified, for
B-BERT training, we use a batch size of 32, a learning rate of 0.0001, and 2M training steps.
For XNLI, we use the same fine-tuning approach as BERT uses in English and report accuracy. For
NER, we extract BERT representations as features and fine-tune a Bi-LSTM CRF model (without
character-wise embeddings) and report F1 score averaged from 5 runs and its standard deviation.
3.2	Linguistic Properties
Pires et al. (2019) hypothesizes that the cross-lingual ability of M-BERT arises because of the shared
word-pieces between source and target languages. However, our experiments show that B-BERT is
cross-lingual even when there is no word-piece overlap. Similarly, Wu & Dredze (2019) hypothe-
sizes that source language should be selected such that it shares more word-pieces with the target
language while our experiment suggests that structural similarity (e.g. word-ordering) is much more
important. Motivated by the above hypotheses, in this section, we study the contribution of word-
piece overlap and structural similarity for the cross-lingual ability of B-BERT.
3.2.1	Word-piece Overlap
M-BERT is trained using Wikipedia text from 104 languages, and the texts from different languages
share some common word-piece vocabulary (like numbers, links, etc.. including actual words, if
they have the same script), we refer to this as word-piece overlap. Previous work (Pires et al., 2019)
hypothesizes that M-BERT generalizes across languages because these shared word-pieces force the
other word-pieces to be mapped to the same shared space.
In this section, we perform experiments to compare cross-lingual performance with and without
word-piece overlap. We construct a new corpus - Fake-English (enfake), by shifting the Unicode
of each character in English Wikipedia text by a large constant so that there is strictly no character
overlap with any other Wikipedia text 4. We may consider Fake-English as a different language than
English, but having the exact same properties except word surface forms.
We measure the contribution of word-piece overlap as the drop in performance when the word-piece
overlap is removed. From Table 1, we can see B-BERT is cross-lingual even when there is no word-
piece overlap. We can also see that the contribution of word-piece overlap is very small, which is
quite surprising and contradictory to prior hypotheses (Pires et al., 2019; Wu & Dredze, 2019).
3.2.2	Word-Ordering Similarity
Words are ordered differently between languages. For example, English has a Subject-Verb-Object
order, while Hindi has a Subject-Object-Verb order. We analyze whether similarity in how words are
ordered affects learning cross-lingual transferability. We study the effect of word-ordering similarity
by destroying the word-ordering structure through randomly permuting some percentage of words in
sentences during pre-training. We permute both source (Fake-English) and target language (although
permuting any one of them would also be sufficient). This way, the similarity of word-ordering is
hidden from B-BERT. We quantify the amount of permutation by sampling 25%, 50%, 100% of the
L2 pairs of word-pieces in a sentence with L word-pieces, and swap each pair (e.g. wpi, ..., wpj
becomes wpj, ..., wpi). This way of shuffling by no means generates a uniform random distribution
on permutations, but provides a roughly good way to control the randomness. Note that for each
4Before feeding the text to BERT’s transformer model, there is an additional vocabulary embedding step,
so that each word-piece gets mapped to a certain integer (unrelated to its unicode). Therefore, BERT will not
have access to the exact values of the unicode, and will not be able to learn directly from the linear shift of
unicode we introduced.

Table 1: The Effect of Word-piece Overlap and of Structural Similarity For different pairs of B-BERT
languages, and for two tasks (XNLI and NER), we show the contribution of word-pieces to the success of
the model. In every two consecutive rows, we show results for a pair (e.g., English-Spanish) and then for the
corresponding pair after mapping English to a disjoint set of word-pieces. The gap between the performance in
each group of two rows indicates the loss due to completely eliminating the word-piece contribution. We add
an asterisk to the number for NER when the results are statistically significant at the 0.05 level.
word-piece, the other word-pieces that appear in its context (other word-pieces in the sentence) are
not changed, although the order is changed. We also do not permute during fine-tuning, as we only
want to control cross-lingual ability gained during pre-training.

Table 2: Contribution of Word-Ordering similarity: We study the importance of word-order similarity by
analysing the performance of XNLI and NER when some percent of word-order similarity is reduced. The
percent p controls the amount of similarity (how random each sentence is permuted). We can see that word-
order similarity is quite important, however there must be other components of structural similarity that could
contribute for the cross-lingual ability, as the performance of almost random is still passable.
From Table 2, we can see that the performance drops significantly when we curtail the word-order
similarity between the two languages. However, the cross-lingual performance is still significantly
better than random, which indicates that there are other components of structural similarity, which
could contribute to the cross-lingual ability of B-BERT.
3.2.3	Word-frequency Similarity
We also study whether only knowing unigram word frequency allows for good cross-lingual repre-
sentations. Indeed, Zipf’s law indicates that words appear with different frequency, and one may
suggest similar meaning words appear with relatively similar frequency in a pair of languages, help-
ing B-BERT learn cross-lingually. We collect the frequency of words in the target language and
generate a new monolingual corpus by sampling words based on the frequency, i.e., each sentence is
a set of random words sampled from the original unigram frequency. The only information B-BERT
learns from the languages is their unigram frequency, and perhaps sub-word level information and
distribution of lengths of sentences. We train B-BERT using Fake-English and this newly generated
target corpus. From Table 3, we can see that the performance is very poor. Therefore, unigram
frequencies alone don’t contain enough information for cross-lingual learning.

enfake-ru	No	65.7	54.2 (±0.7)
	Yes	34.4	5.7 (±0.5)
Table 3: Cross-lingual ability from only unigram frequency: We study if only unigram frequency is useful
for cross-lingual transfer. enfake-es indicates B-BERT trained with Fake-English and the new created corpus,
where each sentence is a set of random words sampled from the same unigram distribution as es. The results
show that only unigram frequency is not enough for a reasonable cross-lingual performance.
3.2.4	Structural Similarity
We define the structure of a language as every property of an individual language that is invariant to
the script of the language (e.g., morphology, word-ordering, word frequency are all parts of structure
of a language). From Table 1, we can see that BERT transfers very well from Fake-English to
English. Also note that, despite not sharing any vocabulary, Fake-English transfers to Spanish,
Hindi, Russian almost as well as English. On XNLI, where the scores between languages can be
compared, the cross-lingual transferability from Fake-English to Spanish is much better than from
Fake-English to Hindi/Russian. Since they do not share any word-pieces, this better transferability
comes from the structure similarity being closer between Spanish and Fake-English.
Through Section 3.2.2 we know that between two languages, even when there are no word-piece
overlap, nor any particular order of words in a sentences, B-BERT still learns some cross-lingual
features. Section 3.2.3 shows from the other side that if B-BERT is given only little information
(unigram frequency), it learns almost no cross-lingual features. These results suggest that we should
shed more light on studying the structural similarity between languages, for example, higher order of
k-gram or k-co-occurrence frequencies (notice that the word ordering experiment can be seen as
giving B-BERT k- co-occurrence word frequencies where k is the length of the longest sentence in
the corpus). In this study, we don’t further dissect the structure of language. Despite its amorphous
definition, our experiment clearly shows that structural similarity is crucial for cross-lingual transfer.
3.3	Model Architecture
From Section 3.2, we observe that B-BERT recognizes language structure effectively. In this sec-
tion, we hypothesize this ability is an emergent property of the model architecture. We study the
contribution of different components of B-BERT architecture namely (i) depth, (ii) multi-head at-
tention and (iii) the total number of parameters. The motivation is to understand which components
are crucial for its cross-lingual ability.
We perform all our cross-lingual experiments on the XNLI dataset with Fake-English as the source
and Russian as the target language; we measure cross-lingual ability by the difference between the
performance of Fake-English and Russian (lesser the difference better the cross-lingual ability).
3.3.1	Depth
We presume the ability of B-BERT to extract good semantic and structural features is a crucial
reason for its cross-lingual effectiveness, and the deepness of B-BERT helps it extract good language
features. In this section, we study the effect of depth on both the monolingual and cross-lingual
performance of B-BERT. We fix the number of attention heads and change the size of hidden
units and intermediate units such that the total number of parameters are almost the same (size of
intermediate units is always 4× size of hidden units).
From Table 4, we can see that deeper models not only perform better on English but are also better
cross-lingually. We can also see a strong correlation between performance on English and cross-
lingual ability (∆), which further supports our assumption that the ability to extract good semantic
and structural features is a crucial reason for its cross-lingual effectiveness.

study the effect of depth of B-BERT towards XNLI. We vary the depth and fix both the number of attention
heads and the number of parameters - the size of hidden and intermediate units are changed so that the total
number of parameters remains almost the same. We train only on Fake-English and test on both Fake-English
and Russian and report their test accuracy. The difference between the performance on Fake-English and
Russian(∆) is our measure of cross-lingual ability (lesser the difference, better the cross-lingual ability).
3.3.2	Multi-head attention
In this section, we study the effect of multi-head attention on the cross-lingual ability of B-BERT.
We fix the depth and the total number of parameters - which is a function of depth and size of hidden
and intermediate layers and study the performance for the different number of attention heads. From
Table 5, we can see that the number of attention heads doesn’t have a significant effect on cross-
lingual ability (∆). B-BERT is satisfactorily cross-lingual even with a single attention head, which
is in agreement with the recent study on monolingual BERT (Voita et al., 2019; Clark et al., 2019).

Table 5: The Effect of Multi-head Attention: We study the effect of the number of attention heads of
B-BERT on the performance of Fake-English and Russian language on XNLI data. We fix both the number of
depth and number of parameters of B-BERT and vary the number of attention heads. The difference between
the performance on Fake-English and Russian (∆) is our measure of cross-lingual ability.
3.3.3	Total Number of Parameters
Similar to depth, we also anticipate that a large number of parameters could potentially help
B-BERT extract good semantic and structural features. We study the effect of the total number
of parameters on cross-lingual performance by fixing the number of attention heads and depth; we
change the number of parameters by changing the size of hidden and intermediate units (size of in-
termediate units is always 4× size of hidden units). From Table 6, we can see that the total number
of parameters is not as significant as depth; however, below a threshold, the number of parameters
seems significant, which suggests that B-BERT requires a certain minimum number parameters to
extract good semantic and structural features.
3.3.4	Generalization to BERT with more languages
Here we show that the results for model structure hold also for a more multilingual case; to further
illustrate this, we experiment on four language BERT (en, es, hi, ru). From Table 7, we can see that
the performance on XNLI is comparable even with just 15% of parameters, and just 1 or 3 attention
heads when the depth is good enough, which is in agreement with our observations in the main text.

3.4	Input and Learning Objective
In this section, we study the effect of input representation and learning objectives on cross-lingual
ability of B-BERT. Recall that BERT is trained with Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and
Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) objectives. We study the effect of NSP as recent works (Conneau &
Lample, 2019; Joshi et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019) show that the NSP objective hurts the performance
on several monolingual tasks. To verify whether B-BERT can learn in language agnostic settings,
we also study the use of language identity markers. We are also interested in studying the effect of
tokenization and language representation, using characters and words vocabulary instead of word-
pieces.
3.4.1	Next sentence Prediction (NSP)
The input to BERT is a pair of sentences separated by a special token such that half the time the
second sentence is the next and rest half the time, it is a random sentence. The NSP objective of
BERT (B-BERT) is to predict whether the second sentence comes after the first one in the original
text. We study the effect of NSP objective by comparing the performance of B-BERT pre-trained
with and without this objective. From Table 8, we can see that the NSP objective hurts the cross-
lingual performance even more than monolingual performance.

Table 6: The Effect of Total Number of Parameters: We study the effect of the total number of parameters
of B-BERT on the performance of Fake-English and Russian language on XNLI data. We fix both the number
of depth and number of attention heads of B-BERT and vary the total number of parameters by changing the
size of hidden and intermediate units. The difference between the performance on Fake-English and Russian
(∆) is our measure of cross-lingual ability.

Table 7: Similar results on M-BERT with four languages: We show that the insights derived from bilingual
BERT is also valid in the case of multilingual BERT (4 language BERT). Further, we also show that with
enough depth, we only need a fewer number of parameters and attention heads to get comparable results.

Table 8: Effect of Next Sentence Prediction Objective: We study the effect of NSP objective on XNLI and
NER. Column NSP and No-NSP show the performance (accuracy for XNLI and average (stdev) F1-score for
NER) when B-BERT is trained with and without NSP objective respectively. The difference between the NSP
and No-NSP shows that NSP objective hurts performance.
3.4.2	Language Identity Marker
In Section 3.2, we argue that B-BERT is cross-lingual because of its ability to recognize language
structure similarities, and hence we presume adding a language identity marker doesn’t affect its
cross-lingual ability. Even if we don’t add a language identity marker, BERT learns language iden-
tity (Wu & Dredze, 2019). To incorporate language identity in the input, we add different end of
string tokens ([SEP]) for different languages (i.e., our input format is [CLS] SENT1 [SEP-A] SENT2
[SEP-B], where A and B are languages corresponding to SENT1 and SENT2 respectively). From
Table 9, we can see that adding language identity marker doesn’t affect cross-lingual performance.

		ru	65.7	65.3	54.2 (±0.7)	55.7 (±0.6)
Table 9: Effect of Language Identity Marker in the Input: We study the effect of adding a language
identifier in the input data. We use different end of string ([SEP]) tokens for different languages serving as
language identity marker. Column “With Lang-id” and “No Lang-id” show the performance when B-BERT is
trained with and without language identity marker in the input.
3.4.3	Character vs. Word-Piece vs. word
We compare the performance of B-BERT with character, word-piece, and word tokenized input.
For character B-BERT, we use all the characters as vocabulary, and for word B-BERT, we use
the most frequent 100000 words as vocabulary. From Table 10, we can see that the cross-lingual
performance (difference between source and target language performance) of B-BERT with word-
piece tokenized is similar to that of word tokenized, while both are better than character tokenized.
We believe that this is because word-pieces and words carry much more information than characters,
allowing B-BERT to learn similarities between the two languages easier.
4	Discussion and Future work
This paper provides a systematic empirical study addressing the cross-lingual ability of B-BERT.
The analysis covers three dimensions: (i) linguistic properties and similarities of target and source
languages; (ii) network architecture, and (iii) input and learning objective.
In order to gauge the language similarity aspect needed to make B-BERT successful, we created a
new language - Fake-English - and this allows Us to study the effect of word-piece overlap while
maintaining all other properties of the source language. Our experiments reveal some interesting and

surprising results. The most notable finding is that word-piece overlap on the one hand, and multi-
head attention on the other, are both not significant, whereas structural similarity and the depth of
B-BERT are crucial for its cross-lingual ability.
While in order to better control interference among languages, we studied the cross-lingual ability
of B-BERT instead of those of M-BERT, it would be interesting now to extend this study, allowing
for more interactions among languages. We leave it to future work to study these interactions. In
particular, one important question is to understand the extent to which adding to M-BERT languages
that are related to the target language, helps the model’s cross-lingual ability.
We introduced the term Structural Similarity, despite its obscure definition, and show its significance
in cross-lingual ability. Another interesting future work could be to develop a better definition and,
consequently, a finer set of experiments, to better understand the Structural similarity and study its
individual components.
Finally, we note an interesting observation made in Table 11. We observe a drastic drop in the en-
tailment performance of B-BERT when the premise and hypothesis are in different languages. (This
data was created using XNLI where in the original form the languages contain the same premise and
hypothesis pair). One of the possible explanations could be that BERT is learning to make textual
entailment decisions by matching words or phrases in the premise to those in the hypothesis. This
question, too, is left as a future direction.

Table 11: Premise and Hypothesis in different language: Using XNLI test set, we construct textual en-
tailment data with premise and hypothesis in different languages. The column A-B (e.g. enfake-target) refers
to test data with premise in language A (enfake) and hypothesis in language B (target). We always train on
Fake-English and report test accuracy.
