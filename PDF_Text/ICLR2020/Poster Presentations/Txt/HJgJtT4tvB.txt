Recent powerful pre-trained language models have achieved remarkable perfor-
mance on most of the popular datasets for reading comprehension. It is time
to introduce more challenging datasets to push the development of this field to-
wards more comprehensive reasoning of text. In this paper, we introduce a new
Reading Comprehension dataset requiring logical reasoning (ReClor) extracted
from standardized graduate admission examinations. As earlier studies suggest,
human-annotated datasets usually contain biases, which are often exploited by
models to achieve high accuracy without truly understanding the text. In order
to comprehensively evaluate the logical reasoning ability of models on ReClor,
we propose to identify biased data points and separate them into EASY set while
the rest as HARD set. Empirical results show that state-of-the-art models have an
outstanding ability to capture biases contained in the dataset with high accuracy
on EASY set. However, they struggle on HARD set with poor performance near
that of random guess, indicating more research is needed to essentially enhance
the logical reasoning ability of current models.* 1
1	Introduction
Machine reading comprehension (MRC) is a fundamental task in Natural Language Processing,
which requires models to understand a body of text and answer a particular question related to the
context. With success of unsupervised representation learning in NLP, language pre-training based
models such as GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019), BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), XLNet (Yang et al., 2019)
and RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019) have achieved nearly saturated performance on most of the popular
MRC datasets (Rajpurkar et al., 2016; Lai et al., 2017; Rajpurkar et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018).
It is time to challenge state-of-the-art models with more difficult reading comprehension tasks and
move a step forward to more comprehensive analysis and reasoning over text (Dua et al., 2019).
In natural language understanding, logical reasoning is an important ability to examine, analyze
and critically evaluate arguments as they occur in ordinary language according to the definition
from Law School Admission Council (2019a). It is a significant component of human intelligence
and is essential in negotiation, debate and writing etc. However, existing reading comprehension
datasets have none or merely a small amount of data requiring logical reasoning, e.g., 0% in MCTest
dataset (Richardson et al., 2013) and 1.2% in SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2016) according to Sug-
awara & Aizawa (2016). One related task is natural language inference, which requires models to
label the logical relationships of sentence pairs. However, this task only considers three types of
simple logical relationships and only needs reasoning at sentence-level. To push the development of
models in logical reasoning from simple logical relationship classification to multiple complicated
logical reasoning and from sentence-level to passage-level, it is necessary to introduce a reading
comprehension dataset targeting logical reasoning.
A typical example of logical reasoning questions is shown in Table 1. Similar to the format of
multiple-choice reading comprehension datasets (Richardson et al., 2013; Lai et al., 2017), it con-
tains a context, a question and four options with only one right answer. To answer the question

in this example, readers need to identify the logical connections between the lines to pinpoint the
conflict, then understand each of the options and select an option that solves the conflict. Human
minds need extensive training and practice to get used to complex reasoning, and it will take im-
mense efforts for crowdsourcing workers to design such logical reasoning questions. Inspired by the
datasets extracted from standardized examinations (Lai et al., 2017; Clark et al., 2018), we build a
dataset by selecting such logical reasoning questions from standardized exams such as GMAT 2 and
LSAT 3. We finally collect 6,138 pieces of logical reasoning questions, which constitute a Reading
Comprehension dataset requiring logical reasoning (ReClor).
Human-annotated datasets usually contain biases (Schwartz et al., 2017; Cai et al., 2017; Bugert
et al., 2017; Poliak et al., 2018; Gururangan et al., 2018; Zellers et al., 2019), which are often
exploited by neural network models as shortcut solutions to achieve high testing accuracy. For data
points whose options can be selected correctly without knowing the contexts and questions, we
classify them as biased ones. In order to fully assess the logical reasoning ability of the models,
we propose to identify the biased data points and group them as EASY set, and put the rest into
HARD set. Based on our experiments on these separate sets, we find that even the state-of-the-art
models can only perform well on EASY set and struggle on HARD set as shown in Figure 1. This
phenomenon shows that current models can well capture the biases in the dataset but lack the ability
to understand the text and reason based on connections between the lines. On the other hand, human
beings perform similarly on both the EASY and HARD set. It is thus observed that there is still a
long way to go to equip models with true logical reasoning ability.
The contributions of our paper are two-fold. First, we introduce ReClor, a new reading comprehen-
sion dataset requiring logical reasoning. We use option-only-input baselines trained with different
random seeds to identify the data points with biases in the testing set, and group them as EASY set,
with the rest as HARD set to facilitate comprehensive evaluation. Second, we evaluate several state-
of-the-art models on ReClor and find these pre-trained language models can perform well on EASY
set but struggle on the HARD set. This indicates although current models are good at exploiting
biases in the dataset, they are far from capable of performing real logical reasoning yet.

Reading Comprehension Datasets. A variety of reading comprehension datasets have been intro-
duced to promote the development of this field. MCTest (Richardson et al., 2013) is a dataset with
2,000 multiple-choice reading comprehension questions about fictional stories in the format similar
to ReClor. Rajpurkar et al. (2016) proposed SQuAD dataset, which contains 107,785 question-
answer pairs on 536 Wikipedia articles. The authors manually labeled 192 examples of the dataset
and found that the examples mainly require reasoning of lexical or syntactic variation. In an anal-
ysis of the above-mentioned datasets, Sugawara & Aizawa (2016) found that none of questions
requiring logical reasoning in MCTest dataset (Richardson et al., 2013) and only 1.2% in SQuAD
dataset (Rajpurkar et al., 2016). Lai et al. (2017) introduced RACE dataset by collecting the En-
glish exams for middle and high school Chinese students in the age range between 12 to 18. They
hired crowd workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk to label the reasoning type of 500 samples in the
dataset and show that around 70 % of the samples are in the category of word matching, paraphras-
ing or single-sentence reasoning. To encourage progress on deeper comprehension of language,

Context:
In jurisdictions where use of headlights is optional when visibility is good, drivers who use headlights
at all times are less likely to be involved in a collision than are drivers who use headlights only when
visibility is poor. Yet Highway Safety Department records show that making use of headlights mandatory
at all times does nothing to reduce the overall number of collisions.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy in the
information above?
Options:
A.	In jurisdictions where use of headlights is optional when visibility is good, one driver in four uses
headlights for daytime driving in good weather.
B.	Only very careful drivers use headlights when their use is not legally required.
C.	The jurisdictions where use of headlights is mandatory at all times are those where daytime visibility
is frequently poor.
D.	A law making use of headlights mandatory at all times is not especially difficult to enforce.
Answer: B

Council (2019b).
more reading comprehension datasets requiring more complicated reasoning types are introduced,
such as iterative reasoning about the narrative of a story (Kocisky et al., 2018), multi-hop reasoning
across multiple sentences (Khashabi et al., 2018) and multiple documents (Welbl et al., 2018), com-
monsense knowledge reasoning (Mihaylov et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018; Huang et al., 2019) and
numerical discrete reasoning over paragraphs (Dua et al., 2019). However, to the best of our knowl-
edge, although there are some datasets targeting logical reasoning in other NLP tasks mentioned in
the next section, there is no dataset targeting evaluating logical reasoning in reading comprehension
task. This work introduces a new dataset to fill this gap.
Logical Reasoning in NLP. There are several tasks and datasets introduced to investigate logical
reasoning in NLP. The task of natural language inference, also known as recognizing textual en-
tailment (Fyodorov et al., 2000; Condoravdi et al., 2003; Bos & Markert, 2005; Dagan et al., 2005;
MacCartney & Manning, 2009) requires models to take a pair of sentence as input and classify their
relationship types, i.e., ENTAILMENT, NEUTRAL, or CONTRADICTION. SNLI (Bowman et al.,
2015) and MultiNLI (Williams et al., 2018) datasets are proposed for this task. However, this task
only focuses on sentence-level logical relationship reasoning and the relationships are limited to only
a few types. Another task related to logical reasoning in NLP is argument reasoning comprehension
task introduced by Habernal et al. (2018) with a dataset of this task. Given an argument with a
claim and a premise, this task aims to select the correct implicit warrant from two options. Although
the task is on passage-level logical reasoning, it is limited to only one logical reasoning type, i.e.,
identifying warrants. ReClor and the proposed task integrate various logical reasoning types into
reading comprehension, with the aim to promote the development of models in logical reasoning
not only from sentence-level to passage-level, but also from simple logical reasoning types to the
complicated diverse ones.
Datasets from Examinations. There have been several datasets extracted from human standardized
examinations in NLP, such as RACE dataset (Lai et al., 2017) mentioned above. Besides, NTCIR QA
Lab (Shibuki et al., 2014) offers comparative evaluation for solving real-world university entrance
exam questions; The dataset of CLEF QA Entrance Exams Task (Rodrigo et al., 2015) is extracted
from standardized English examinations for university admission in Japan; ARC dataset (Clark et al.,
2018) consists of 7,787 science questions targeting student grade level, ranging from 3rd grade to
9th; The dialogue-based multiple-choice reading comprehension dataset DREAM (Sun et al., 2019)
contains 10,197 questions for 6,444 multi-turn multi-party dialogues from English language exams
that are designed by human experts to assess the comprehension level of Chinese learners of English.
Compared with these datasets, ReClor distinguishes itself by targeting logical reasoning.

answer options, among which only one option is right/most suitable. We collect reading comprehen-
sion problems that require complicated logical reasoning. However, producing such data requires
the ability to perform complex logical reasoning, which makes it hard for crowdsourcing workers to
generate such logical questions. Fortunately, we find the reading comprehension problems in some
standardized tests, such as GMAT and LSAT, are highly in line with our expectation.
We construct a dataset containing 6,138 logical reasoning questions sourced from open websites
and books. In the original problems, there are five answer options in which only one is right. To
comply with fair use of law4 , we shuffle the order of answer options and randomly delete one of
the wrong options for each data point, which results in four options with one right option and three
wrong options. Furthermore, similar to ImageNet dataset5, ReClor is available for non-commercial
research purpose only. We are also hosting a public evaluation server on EvalAI (Yadav et al., 2019)
to benchmark progress on Reclor.
3.2	Data analysis
As mentioned above, we collect 6,138 data points, in which 91.22% are from actual exams of GMAT
and LSAT while others are from high-quality practice exams. They are divided into training set, val-
idation set and testing set with 4,638, 500 and 1,000 data points respectively. The overall statistics
of ReClor and comparison with other similar multiple-choice MRC datasets are summarized in Ta-
ble 2. As shown, ReClor is of comparable size and relatively large vocabulary size. Compared with
RACE, the length of the context of ReCor is much shorter. In RACE, there are many redundant sen-
tences in context to answer a question. However, in ReClor, every sentence in the context passages
is important, which makes this dataset focus on evaluating the logical reasoning ability of models
rather than the ability to extract relevant information from a long context. The length of answer
options of ReClor is largest among these datasets. We analyze and manually annotate the types of
questions on the testing set and group them into 17 categories, whose percentages and descriptions
are shown in Table 3. The percentages of different types of questions reflect those in the logical
reasoning module of GMAT and LSAT. Some examples of different types of logical reasoning are
listed in Figure 2, and more examples are listed in the Appendix C. Taking two examples, we further
express how humans would solve such questions in Table 4, showing the challenge of ReClor.
3.3	Data Biases in the Dataset
The dataset is collected from exams devised by experts in logical reasoning, which means it is
annotated by humans and may introduce biases in the dataset. Recent studies have shown that
models can utilize the biases in a dataset of natural language understanding to perform well on the
task without truly understanding the text (Schwartz et al., 2017; Cai et al., 2017; Bugert et al., 2017;
Poliak et al., 2018; Gururangan et al., 2018; Zellers et al., 2019). It is necessary to analyze such
data biases to help evaluate models. In the ReClor dataset, the common context and question are
shared across the four options for each data point, so we focus on the analysis of the difference in
lexical choice and sentence length of the right and wrong options without contexts and questions.
We first investigate the biases of lexical choice. We lowercase the options and then use WordPiece
tokenization (Wu et al., 2016) of BERTBASE (Devlin et al., 2019) to get the tokens. Similar to

l ∈ {right, wrong} given by the token t by p(l|t) = count(t, l)/count(t). The larger the correlation

of the tokens with the highest scores are of low frequency. We further analyze the lengths of right
and wrong options (Gururangan et al., 2018) in training set. We notice a slight difference in the
distribution of sentence length for right and wrong options. The average length for wrong options is
around 21.82 whereas that for right options is generally longer with an average length of 23.06.

Context:
If the purpose of laws is to contribute to people’s happiness, we have a basis for criticizing existing laws as well
as proposing new laws. Hence, if that is not the purpose, then we have no basis for the evaluation of existing
laws, from which we must conclude that existing laws acquire legitimacy simply because they are the laws
Question: The reasoning in the argument is flawed in that the argument
Options:
A.	takes a sufficient condition for a state of affairs to be a necessary condition for it
B.	draws a conclusion about how the world actually is on the basis of claims about how it should be
C.	infers a causal relationship from the mere presence of a correlation
D.	trades on the use of a term in one sense in a premise and in a different sense in the conclusion
Answer: A
Reasoning Process of Humans:
We may first look at the question to understand the specific task of the question - identify a flaw. We then
analyze the argument in the context. The conclusion ‘existing laws acquire legitimacy simply because they are
the laws.’ is based on the argument (purpose is NOT happiness) → (NOT basis for criticizing laws), which is
obtained from the first statement: (purpose is happiness) → (basis for criticizing laws). However, we know
A → B cannot be obtained from A → B . Therefore, we should choose option A that describes this flaw.
The distractors here are different types of reasoning flaws. Prior knowledge of basic logical rules is needed to
correctly answer this question.
Context:
Psychologist: Phonemic awareness, or the knowledge that spoken language can be broken into component
sounds, is essential for learning to read an alphabetic language. But one also needs to learn how sounds are
symbolically represented by means of letters; otherwise, phonemic awareness will not translate into the ability
to read an alphabetic language. Yet many children who are taught by the whole-language method, which
emphasizes the ways words sound, learn to read alphabetic languages.
Question: Which one of the following can be properly inferred from the psychologist’s statements?
Options:
A.	The whole-language method invariably succeeds in teaching awareness of how spoken language can be
broken into component sounds.
B.	Some children who are taught by the whole-language method are not prevented from learning how sounds
are represented by means of letters.
C.	The whole-language method succeeds in teaching many children how to represent sounds symbolically by
means of letters.
D.	When the whole-language method succeeds in teaching someone how to represent sounds by means of
letters, that person acquires the ability to read an alphabetic language.
Answer: B
Reasoning Process of Humans:
Looking at the question and we know that it is asking about implication. From the first two sentences in con-
text, we know that there are two necessary conditions to read an alphabetic language: phonemic awareness
and symbolic letters. We also learn [(NOT symbolic letters) AND (phonemic awareness)] 6→ read an alpha-
betic language (denoted as Formula 1). The last sentence in the context says that many children are taught by
the whole-language method to learn a language. As for option A, from the context, we only know the whole
language method works for ‘many’ children, which cannot be inferred to ‘invariably’ works. As for option B,
combing three sentences in the context, we know that the whole-language method meets the two necessary con-
ditions to learn a language, especially the last sentence mentions ‘learn to read alphabetic languages’. Children
learn to read alphabetic languages means that they must recognize symbolic letters that represent sound because
symbolic letters is a necessary condition of read an alphabetic language; otherwise, they cannot read because
of Formula 1 mentioned above. Therefore, option B is correct. As for option C, from the context we only know
the whole-language method teaches phonemic awareness and read an alphabetic language. Symbolic letters
may be taught by other methods, so C is wrong. As for D, similar to C, symbolic letters may be taught by other
methods and we also cannot obtain: symbolic letters → read an alphabetic language.

4.2	Experiments to Find Biased Data
As mentioned earlier, biases prevalently exist in human-annotated datasets (Poliak et al., 2018; Gu-
rurangan et al., 2018; Zellers et al., 2019; Niven & Kao, 2019), which are often exploited by models
to perform well without truly understanding the text. Therefore, it is necessary to find out the biased
data points in ReClor in order to evaluate models in a more comprehensive manner (Sugawara et al.,
2018). To this end, we feed the five strong baseline models (GPT, GPT-2, BERTBAse, XLNetBASE
and ROBERTaBASE) with ONLY THE ANSWER OPTIONS for each problem. In other words, we
purposely remove the context and question in the inputs. In this way, we are able to identify those
problems that can be answered correctly by merely exploiting the biases in answer options without
knowing the relevant context and question. However, the setting of this task is a multiple-choice
question with 4 probable options, and even a chance baseline could have 25% probability to get it
right. To eliminate the effect of random guess, we set four different random seeds for each model
and pick the data points that are predicted correctly in all four cases to form the EASY set. Then,
the data points which are predicted correctly by the models at random could be nearly eliminated,
since any data point only has a probability of (25%)4 = 0.39% to be guessed right consecutively for
four times. Then we unite the sets of data points that are consistently predicted right by each model,

get 440 data points from the testing set CTEST and we denote this subset as EASY set CEASY and

4.3	Transfer learning Through Fine-tuning
Among multiple-choice reading comprehension or QA datasets from exams, although the size of
ReClor is comparable to those of ARC (Clark et al., 2018) and DREAM (Sun et al., 2019), it is
much smaller than RACE Lai et al. (2017). Recent studies (Min et al., 2017; Howard & Ruder,
2018; Huang et al., 2019; Jin et al., 2019) have shown the effectiveness of pre-training on similar
tasks or datasets then fine-tuning on the target dataset for transfer learning. Jin et al. (2019) find
that by first training on RACE (Lai et al., 2017) and then further fine-tuning on the target dataset,
the performances of BERTBASE on multiple-choice dataset MC500 (Richardson et al., 2013) and
DREAM (Sun et al., 2019) can significantly boost from 69.5% to 81.2%, and from 63.2% to 70.2%,
respectively. However, they also find that the model cannot obtain significant improvement even
performs worse if it is first fine-tuned on span-based dataset like SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2016).
ReClor is a multiple-choice dataset, so we choose RACE for fine-tuning study.
4.4	Results and Analysis
The performance of all tested models on the ReClor is presented in Table 7. This dataset is built
on questions designed for students who apply for admission to graduate schools, thus we randomly
choose 100 samples from the testing set and divide them into ten tests, which are distributed to ten
different graduate students in a university. We take the average of their scores and present it as
the baseline of graduate students. The data of ReClor are carefully chosen and modified from only
high-quality questions from standardized graduate entrance exams. We set the ceiling performance
to 100% since ambiguous questions are not included in the dataset.
The performance of fastText is better than random guess, showing that word correlation could be
used to help improve performance to some extent. It is difficult for Bi-LSTM to converge on this

dataset. Transformer-based pre-training models have relatively good performance, close to the per-
formance of graduate students. However, we find that these models only perform well on EASY set
with around 75% accuracy, showing these models have an outstanding ability to capture the biases
of the dataset, but they perform poorly on HARD set with only around 30% accuracy. In contrast,
humans can still keep good performance on HARD set. We notice the difference in testing accuracy
performed by graduate students on EASY and HARD set, but this could be due to the small number
of students participated in the experiments. Therefore, we say humans perform relatively consistent
on both biased and non-biased dataset.
It is noticed that if the models are first trained on RACE and then fine-tuned on ReClor, they
could obtain significant improvement, especially on HARD set. The overall performance of
RoBERTaLARGE is even better than that of graduate students. This similar phenomenon can also
be observed on DREAM dataset (Sun et al., 2019) by Jin et al. (2019), which shows the potential
of transfer learning for reasoning tasks. However, even after fine-tuning on RACE, the best per-
formance of these strong baselines on HARD set is around 50%, still lower than that of graduate
students and far away from ceiling performance.
Experiments in different input settings are also done. Compared with the input setting of answer
options only (A), the setting of questions and answer options (Q, A) can not bring significant im-
provement. This may be because some questions e.g., Which one of the following is an assumption
required by the argument?, Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument? can
be used in the same reasoning types of question, which could not offer much information. Further
adding context causes significant boost, showing the high informativeness of the context.
We further analyze the model performance with respect to different question types of logical rea-
soning. Some results are shown in Figure 4 and the full results are shown in Figure 5, 6 and 7 in the
Appendix E. Three models of BERTLARGE , XLNetLARGE and RoBERTaLARGE perform well on most
of types. On HARD set, the three models perform poorly on certain types such as Strengthen,
Weaken and Role which require extensive logical reasoning. However, they perform relatively
better on other certain types, such as Conclusion/Main Point and Match Structures that
9
Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2020
are more straight-forward. For the result of transfer learning, we analyze XLNetLARGE in detail.
Though the overall performance is significantly boosted after fine-tuning on RACE first, the his-
tograms in the bottom of Figure 4 show that on EASY set, accuracy of the model with fine-tuning
on RACE is similar to that without it among most question types, while on HARD set, significant
improvement on some question types is observed, such as Conclusion/Main Point and Most
S trongly Supported. This may be because these types require less logical reasoning to some
extent compared with other types, and similar question types may also be found in RACE dataset.
Thus, the pre-training on RACE helps enhance the ability of logical reasoning especially of relatively
simple reasoning types, but more methods are still needed to further enhance the ability especially
that of relatively complex reasoning types.

5 Conclusion
In this paper, we introduce ReClor, a reading comprehension dataset requiring logical reasoning,
with the aim to push research progress on logical reasoning in NLP forward from sentence-level
to passage-level and from simple logical reasoning to multiple complicated one. We propose to
identify biased data points and split the testing set into EASY and HARD group for biased and
non-biased data separately. We further empirically study the different behaviors of state-of-the-art
models on these two testing sets, and find recent powerful transformer-based pre-trained language
models have an excellent ability to exploit the biases in the dataset but have difficulty in understand-
ing and reasoning given the non-biased data with low performance close to or slightly better than
random guess. These results show there is a long way to equip deep learning models with real log-
ical reasoning abilities. We hope this work would inspire more research in future to adopt similar
split technique and evaluation scheme when reporting their model performance. We also show by
first fine-tuning on a large-scale dataset RACE then fine-tuning on ReClor, the models could obtain
significant improvement, showing the potential of transfer learning to solve reasoning tasks.

A Baseline Models
fastText. FastText (Joulin et al., 2017) models sentences as a bag of n-grams, and tries to predict
the probability of each answer being correct independently. We choose the answer with the highest
score as the prediction for the multiple-choice setting.
LSTM sentence encoder. A two-layer bi-LSTM is randomly initialized as a sentence encoder with
GloVe word embedding (Pennington et al., 2014). With a span of text as input, the last hidden state
of the second layer is max-pooled and then fed into a fully-connected layer to compute the output
score.
GPT and GPT-2. GPT (Radford et al., 2018) and GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019) are both trans-
former (Vaswani et al., 2017) based models which are pre-trained using unsupervised method with
a standard language modeling objective. GPT is pre-trained on BooksCorpus; GPT-2 is pre-trained
using a larger dataset called WebText. Here we use the smallest model proposed in (Radford et al.,
2019) as our GPT-2 baseline. To fine-tune on ReClor, the final hidden vector corresponding to the
last input token ([.classify.]) is used as the aggregate representation followed by an extra fully
connected layer to compute the score.
BERT. BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) is also a transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) based model which
is trained by using BooksCorpus (Zhu et al., 2015) and English Wikipedia in two unsupervised
tasks, i.e., Masked LM (MLM) and Next Sentence Prediction (NSP). During fine-tuning, the final
hidden vector corresponding to the first input token ([CLS]) is used as the aggregate representation
followed by two extra fully connected layers to compute the score.
XLNet. XLNet (Yang et al., 2019) is trained with Permutation Language Modeling and without
NSP. In addition, beside BooksCorpus and English Wikipedia used in BERT, it uses Giga5 (Parker
et al., 2011), ClueWeb 2012-B (extended from (Callan et al., 2009)), and Common Crawl (com,
2019) for pre-training. We use the final hidden vector corresponding to the last input token <cls>
as the aggregate representation and introduce two fully connected layers to predict the score.
RoBERTa. RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019) is an improved pre-training procedure of BERT with
training the model longer, with bigger batches over more data and removing NSP objective etc..
Extra two fully connected layers are added to transform the final hidden vector of the first input
token (<s> to the score.
The input format of different models is shown in Table 8.

B Implementation Detail
Adam is used by all models. For fastText, we use its python library6 by converting ReClor to the
required form, and keep the default setting of the hyper parameters. For Bi-LSTM, we use a two-
layer Bidirectional LSTM with the GloVe 300d word embedding (Pennington et al., 2014) followed
by max-pooling and a fully-connected layer. We train the model for 100 epochs using a batch size
of 64 and learning rate of 0.1. A learning rate decay of 0.5 is also applied every 10 epochs. For
pre-training models, we modify the code of Transformers of Hugging Face7 to implement them on
ReClor. We use a batch size of24 and fine-tune for 10 epochs. The maximum input sequence length
for all models is 256. The detailed hyperparameters are shown in Table 9.

C Examples
Type: Necessary Assumptions
Definition: identify the claim that must be true or is required in order for the argument to work
Context:
Slash-and-burn agriculture involves burning several acres of forest, leaving vegetable ash that provides
ample fertilizer for three or four years of bountiful crops. On the cleared land nutrients leach out of the
soil, however, and the land becomes too poor to support agriculture. New land is then cleared by burning
and the process starts again. Since most farming in the tropics uses this method, forests in this region will
eventually be permanently eradicated.
Question: The argument depends on the assumption that
Options:
A.	forests in the tropics do not regenerate well enough to restore themselves once they have been cleared
by the slash-and-burn method
B.	some other methods of agriculture are not as destructive to the environment in tropical regions as the
slash-and-burn method is
C.	forests in the tropics are naturally deficient in nutrients that are needed to support the growth of plants
that are not native to those regions
D.	slash-and-burn agriculture is particularly suitable for farming in tropical areas
Answer: A

Context:
Geologist: A new method for forecasting earthquakes has reliably predicted several earthquakes. Unfor-
tunately, this method can predict only that an earthquake will fall somewhere within a range of two and
a half points on the Richter scale. Thus, since a difference of two and a half points can be the difference
between a marginally perceptible shaking and a quake that causes considerable damage, the new method
is unlikely to be useful.
Question: Which one of the following, if assumed, enables the geologist’s conclusion to be properly
inferred?
Options:
A.	An earthquake-forecasting method is unlikely to be useful unless its predictions always differentiate
earthquakes that are barely noticeable from ones that result in substantial destruction.
B.	Several well-established methods for forecasting earthquakes can predict within much narrower ranges
than two and a half points on the Richter scale.
C.	Even if an earthquake-forecasting method makes predictions within a very narrow range on the Richter
scale, this method is not likely to be useful unless its predictions are reliable.
D.	An earthquake-forecasting method has not been shown to be useful until it has been used to reliably
predict a large number of earthquakes.

have achieved financial success reported that they were happy.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strongly supports the conclusion drawn from the
survey results?
Options:
A.	Most of the respondents who reported they were unhappy were in fact happy.
B.	The respondents who reported financial success were, for the most part, financially successful.

Context:
“DNA fingerprinting” is a recently-introduced biochemical procedure that uses a pattern derived from a
person’ s genetic material to match a suspect’ s genetic material against that of a specimen from a crime
scene. Proponents have claimed astronomically high odds against obtaining a match by chance alone.
These odds are based on an assumption that there is independence between the different characteristics
represented by a single pattern.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, casts the most doubt on the claim of the proponents of
DNA fingerprinting?
Options:
A.	The skill required of laboratory technicians performing the DNA fingerprinting procedure is not ex-
traordinary.
B.	There is a generally accepted theoretical basis for interpreting the patterns produced by the procedure.
C. In the whole population there are various different subgroups, within each of which certain sets of
genetic characteristics are shared.
D. In the investigation of certain genetic diseases, the techniques used in DNA fingerprinting have traced
the transmission of the diseases among the living members of very large families.

George: Some scientists say that global warming will occur because people are releasing large amounts of
carbon dioxide into the atmosphere by burning trees and fossil fuels. We can see, though, that the predicted
warming is occurring already. In the middle of last winter, we had a month of springlike weather in our
area, and this fall, because of unusually mild temperatures, the leaves on our town’ s trees were three
weeks late in turning color.
Question: Which one of the following would it be most relevant to investigate in evaluating the conclusion
of George’s argument?
Options:
A.	whether air pollution is causing some trees in the area to lose their leaves
B.	what proportion of global emissions of carbon dioxide is due to the burning of trees by humans
C.	whether unusually warm weather is occurring elsewhere on the globe more frequently than before
D.	when leaves on the trees in the town usually change color

Options:
A.	Any horror-story monster that is threatening is also horrific.
B.	If a monster triggers infantile fears but is not physically dangerous, then it is not horrific.
C.	All monsters that are not physically dangerous, but that are psychologically dangerous and inspire
revulsion, are threatening.
D.	If a monster is both horrific and psychologically threatening, then it does not inspire revulsion.

Context:
After a nuclear power plant accident, researchers found radioactive isotopes of iodine, tellurium, and
cesium-but no heavy isotopes-in the atmosphere downwind. This material came either from spent fuel
rods or from the plant’ s core. Spent fuel rods never contain significant quantities of tellurium isotopes.
Radioactive material ejected into the atmosphere directly from the core would include heavy isotopes.
After the accident, steam, which may have been in contact with the core, was released from the plant. The
core contains iodine, tellurium, and cesium isotopes, which are easily dissolved by steam.
Question:
Of the following statements, which one is most strongly supported by the information above?
Options:
A.	The nuclear power plant’s spent fuel rods were not damaged.
B.	Spent fuel rods do not contain heavy isotopes in significant quantities.
C.	The researchers found some radioactive material from spent fuel rods as well as some material that was
ejected into the atmosphere directly from the plant’s core.
D.	The radioactive material detected by the researchers was carried into the atmosphere by the steam that
was released from the plant.

Context:
To reduce the mosquito population in a resort area, hundreds of trees were planted that bear fruit attractive
to birds. Over the years, as the trees matured, they attracted a variety of bird species and greatly increased
the summer bird population in the area. As expected, the birds ate many mosquitoes. However, the
planting of the fruit trees had the very opposite of its intended effect.
Question:
Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the apparently paradoxical result?
Options:
A.	Most of the species of birds that were attracted by the trees that were planted did not eat mosquitoes.
B.	Increases and decreases in mosquito populations tend to follow a cyclical pattern.
C.	The species of birds that were attracted in the greatest number by the fruit of the trees that were planted
did not eat mosquitoes.
D.	The birds attracted to the area by the trees ate many more insects that prey on mosquitoes than they
did mosquitoes.

Context:
Joanna: The only way for a company to be successful, after emerging from bankruptcy, is to produce the
same goods or services that it did before going bankrupt. It is futile for such a company to try to learn a
whole new business. Ruth: Wrong. The Kelton Company was a major mining operation that went into
bankruptcy. On emerging from bankruptcy, Kelton turned its mines into landfills and is presently a highly
successful waste-management concern.
Question:
Ruth uses which one of the following argumentative techniques in countering Joanna’s argument?
Options:
A.	She undermines a claim by showing that it rests on an ambiguity.
B.	She offers an alternative explanation for a phenomenon.
C.	She presents a counterexample to a claim.
D.	She establishes a conclusion by excluding the only plausible alternative to that conclusion.

Context:
The position that punishment should be proportional to how serious the offense is but that repeat offenders
should receive harsher punishments than first-time offenders is unsustainable. It implies that considera-
tions as remote as what an offender did years ago are relevant to the seriousness of an offense. If such
remote considerations were relevant, almost every other consideration would be too. But this would make
determining the seriousness of an offense so difficult that it would be impossible to apply the proportion-
ality principle.
Question:
The statement that considerations as remote as what an offender did years ago are relevant to the serious-
ness of an offense plays which one of the following roles in the argument?
Options:
A.	It is an allegedly untenable consequence of a view rejected in the argument’s overall conclusion.
B.	It is a statement the argument provides grounds to accept and from which the overall conclusion is
inferred.
C.	It is the overall conclusion in favor of which the argument offers evidence.
D.	It is a premise offered in support of an intermediate conclusion of the argument.

Context:
The tidal range at a particular location is the difference in height between high tide and low tide. Tidal
studies have shown that one of the greatest tidal ranges in the world is found in the Bay of Fundy and
reaches more than seventeen meters. Since the only forces involved in inducing the tides are the sun’ s and
moon’ s gravity, the magnitudes of tidal ranges also must be explained entirely by gravitational forces.
Question:
Which one of the following most accurately describes a flaw in the reasoning above?
Options:
A.	It does not differentiate between the tidal effect of the sun and the tidal effect of the moon.
B.	It fails to consider that the size ofa tidal range could be affected by the conditions in which gravitational
forces act.
C.	It presumes, without providing warrant, that most activity within the world’s oceans is a result of an
interplay of gravitational forces.
D.	It gives only one example of a tidal range.

The museum’ s night security guard maintains that the thieves who stole the portrait did not enter the
museum at any point at or above ground level. Therefore, the thieves must have gained access to the
museum from below ground level.
Question:
The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in which one of the follow-
ing?
Options:
A.	As had generally been expected, not all questionnaires were sent in by the official deadline. It follows
that plans must have been made for the processing of questionnaires received late.
B.	The store’s competitors claim that the store, in selling off the shirts at those prices, neither made any
profit nor broke even. Consequently, the store’s customers must have been able to buy shirts there at less
than the store’s cost.
C.	The product label establishes that this insecticide is safe for both humans and pets. Therefore, the
insecticide must also be safe for such wild mammals as deer and rabbits.
D.	If the census is to be believed, the percentage of men who are married is higher than the percentage of
women who are married. Thus, the census must show a higher number of men than of women overall.

Context:
PhishCo runs a number of farms in the arid province of Nufa, depending largely on irrigation. Now,
as part of a plan to efficiently increase the farms‘ total production, it plans to drill down to an aquifer
containing warm, slightly salty water that will be used to raise fish in ponds. The water from the ponds
will later be used to supplement piped-in irrigation water for PhishCo‘s vegetable fields, and the ponds
and accompanying vegetation should help reduce the heat in the area of the farms.
Question:
Which of the following would, if true, most strongly suggest that the plan, if implemented, would increase
the overall efficiency of PhishCo‘s farms?
Options:
A.	Organic waste from fish in the pond water will help to fertilize fields where it is used for irrigation.
B.	Fish raised on PhishCo’s farms are likely to be saleable in the nearest urban areas.
C.	Ponds will be located on low-lying land now partially occupied by grain crops.
D.	The government of Nufa will help to arrange loan financing to partially cover the costs of drilling.
