Recent improvements in large-scale language models have driven progress on
automatic generation of syntactically and semantically consistent text for many
real-world applications. Many of these advances leverage the availability of large
corpora. While training on such corpora encourages the model to understand long-
range dependencies in text, it can also result in the models internalizing the social
biases present in the corpora. This paper aims to quantify and reduce biases exhib-
ited by language models. Given a conditioning context (e.g. a writing prompt) and
a language model, we analyze if (and how) the sentiment of the generated text is
affected by changes in values of sensitive attributes (e.g. country names, occupa-
tions, genders, etc.) in the conditioning context, a.k.a. counterfactual evaluation.
We quantify these biases by adapting individual and group fairness metrics from
the fair machine learning literature. Extensive evaluation on two different corpora
(news articles and Wikipedia) shows that state-of-the-art Transformer-based lan-
guage models exhibit biases learned from data. We propose embedding-similarity
and sentiment-similarity regularization methods that improve both individual and
group fairness metrics without sacrificing perplexity and semantic similarity—a
positive step toward development and deployment of fairer language models for
real-world applications.
1	Introduction
Text representation learning methods (word and sentence encoders) trained on large unlabeled cor-
pora are widely used in the development of natural language processing systems (Mikolov et al.,
2013; Pennington et al., 2014; Peters et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2018). Progress in this area has led
to consistent improvements of model performances on many downstream tasks. However, recent
studies have found that both context-free and context-dependent word embedding models contain
human-like semantic biases, including gender and race (Bolukbasi et al., 2016; Caliskan et al., 2017;
Zhao et al., 2019). Zhao et al. (2018a) provide an insight into this phenomenon by showing that web
corpora contain biases (e.g., gender) which are inherited by models trained on these datasets.
In this work, we focus on language models which have been shown to exhibit systematic biases (Lu
et al., 2018; Bordia & Bowman, 2019; Qian et al., 2019). We train a Transformer-based language
model (Vaswani et al., 2017; Radford et al., 2019; Dai et al., 2019) on two large corpora: Wikipedia
articles from Wikitext-103 (Merity et al., 2016) and news articles from the English-language news
corpus from WMT-19.1 We analyze systematic variations in sentiment scores of the text gener-
ated by the language model given a conditioning context, under different instantiations of control
variables (e.g. country names, occupations, and person names) in the context. In a counterfactual
experiment, we find that sentiment scores for the text generated by this language model vary sub-
stantially as we change the control variables in the context.
We propose two approaches to reduce counterfactual sentiment biases based on the concept of em-
bedding similarity or sentiment similarity. In the first method, we encourage hidden states of the
conditioning context to be similar irrespective of the instantiations of the control variables in the
context. In the second method, we regularize the difference between sentiment scores of various
instantiations of the control variables. Experiments with counterfactual conditioning demonstrate

that both of these methods reduce sentiment biases while retaining the generation capability of the
language model, as measured by perplexity and semantic similarity.
While specifying optimal model fairness behavior is difficult, our method provides a framework
to address various fairness specifications and an important step toward the deployment of fairer
language models. Our main contributions in this paper are:
•	We demonstrate systematic counterfactual sentiment biases in large-scale language models.
•	We present methods to quantify these biases by adopting individual and group fairness
metrics from the fair machine learning literature.
•	We propose embedding and sentiment similarity-based methods for training language mod-
els to be invariant to certain transformations of their inputs.
•	We empirically demonstrate the efficacy of these methods to reduce counterfactual senti-
ment biases of language models.
We use a sentiment classifier as a proxy to measure biases in this paper. We note that the classifier
itself is not perfect and might exhibit some biases. We leave investigations of an unbiased evaluator
to future work.
2	Background & Related Work
Language models. Given an article X composed of n tokens (xi, ∙∙∙ ,Xn), a language model
estimates the probability p(x) ofx occurring in natural language under the assumption that the joint
probability factorizes over the tokens as follows:
nn
p(x) = "p(xi∣Xl,…，Xi-l) = "p(xi∣XLi-l)
i=1	i=1
where the prefix xi：i-i := (xi, ∙ ∙ ∙ ,Xi-ι) for convenience. Once a language model is learned,
the model can be used to generate sequences that capture long-range dependencies (Graves, 2013).
By using the conditional probability p(xi|x1:i-1), we sample the next token xi given a prefix (or
conditioning inputs) x1:i-1. Then we can iteratively use the generated token xi along with the pre-
vious prompt as the conditioning inputs to generate the next token xi+1 using p(xi+1|x1:i). We use
Transformer-based models (Vaswani et al., 2017) to learn the probability p(xi|x1:i-1), which has
been demonstrated to scale to large self-supervised models with outstanding performance in gen-
eration quality and representation learning, including BERT (Devlin et al., 2018), GPT-2 (Radford
et al., 2019), MT-DNN (Liu et al., 2019), XLNet (Yang et al., 2019) and many others.
Bias in Natural Language Processing Systems. Besides learning to favor language of the au-
thors' demographic group (Hovy & S0gaard, 2015), NLP models pick UP on a variety of cultural
associations and undesirable social biases (Caliskan et al., 2017). Systematic imbalances were ob-
served across NLP tasks, e.g. as gender bias in coreference resolution (Zhao et al., 2018a; Rudinger
et al., 2018), visual semantic role labeling (Zhao et al., 2017), image captioning (Hendricks et al.,
2018), or in text classification (Dixon et al., 2018; Garg et al., 2019). Concretely in sentiment anal-
ysis, Kiritchenko & Mohammad (2018) found systematic biases with respect to race and gender
across more than 200 systems.
For word embeddings, occupational gender bias has been identified and addressed by measuring
projections onto linear gender-related subspaces of word representations (Bolukbasi et al., 2016;
Lemoine et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2018b; Bordia & Bowman, 2019). Gonen & Goldberg (2019)
however pointed out limitations to this approach: bias in word embeddings appear indirectly in
other ways, even after minimizing linear projections onto gender-related subspaces.
Bias in Language Modeling. Rather than debiasing word embeddings, Lu et al. (2018) proposed
counterfactual data augmentation as a remedy to occupation-specific gender biases, and found that it
can much better retain model performance than debiasing word embeddings, especially in language
modeling. Qian et al. (2019) on the other hand regularize a generative language model to predict
similar log-probabilities for either option ofa gendered word pair. Zhao et al. (2019) and Basta et al.

(2019) demonstrate gender bias in pretrained language modeling representations (ELMo), which
translates into downstream tasks, but do not consider language generated by the ELMo language
model.
In contrast to these prior works on debiasing language models, we probe language models’ gen-
erated output using a sentiment analysis system. We do not rely on gendered word pairs for data
augmentation or for approximating linear gender subspaces. Furthermore, prior work mostly con-
siders only comparatively small language modeling training sets. In contrast, we investigate bias in
Transformer-based models with a similar number of parameters to GPT-2. Our models are trained
on English news articles from the WMT-19 news translation challenge, which contains 40GB of
text, as well as WikiText-103, with more than 100 million tokens.
Fairness. A fundamental group fairness definition is “equality of odds”, which requires false pos-
itive and false negative prediction rates to be equal across demographic subgroups (Hardt et al.,
2016). However, this definition of group fairness can be superficially satisfied through post-
processing methods at a potential cost on individual fairness, which requires similar individuals to
be treated similarly (Dwork et al., 2012), as well as other statistical fairness metrics. Furthermore,
ignoring the data generating causal graph of the problem may lead to “corrective discrimination”,
that is, discrimination caused by the very procedure to enforce statistical fairness criteria.
Hence causal inference tools are leveraged in fairness research to deal with these problems that
may occur in satisfying statistical fairness criteria. Similar to individual fairness, counterfactual
fairness requires same model predictions before and after intervention on sensitive attributes in data
generating causal graphs (Kusner et al., 2017; Kilbertus et al., 2017). In our problem setting, we
consider the counterfactual fairness goal using a causal graph representing the text generation model
with input features, latent features, model outputs and predictions as nodes of the graph. We aim
towards counterfactual fairness by de-biasing the learned representation of inputs in the latent space
of the text generative model, contributing to a family of methods to learn fair representations (Beutel
et al., 2017; Zemel et al., 2013; Creager et al., 2019; Edwards & Storkey, 2016; Louizos et al., 2016)
and enforcing independence between sensitive attributes and prediction outputs (Calders et al., 2009;
Lemoine et al., 2018; Jiang et al., 2019).
3 Counterfactual Evaluation of Sentiment Biases
Motivating Examples. To illustrate the problem of biased sentiment, we condition a large-scale
language model (for model details see Section 5) with the prefix “You are a/an <occupation>, and
you”, with the same random seeds using “accountant” and “designer” as occupation. We sample
1,000 sentences with both prefixes and measure the sentiment scores of the generated sentences.
In Fig. 1, we observe systematic sentiment differences in the generated output. In Table 1, we
present some generated examples with large sentiment difference. The systematic difference in
the sentiment distribution, further exemplified in these particular generated sentences, demonstrates
that there exists a bias in sentiment with respect to a counterfactual change of occupation in the
given context. To further quantify this problem and reduce the biases, we illustrate the problem
formulation and our proposed approaches below.
Fairness Specification. Given a predefined specification on a set of sensitive attribute variables
C (e.g., occupations, genders, or countries), we would like to reduce their counterfactual sentiment
biases in language models for every sensitive attribute variable A ∈ C. We letAbethe set of possible
values of the variable A, and use a to denote a particular value of A (e.g. A = {female, male}, a =
female). For each input sequence x containing sensitive tokens φ(a) (such as φ(a)={he, his, him,
husband, Paul} for a = male), We generate a CoUnterfactUalinPUt X to X by replacing all occurrences
of each sensitive token in φ(a) with the corresponding token in φ(α), where a is another sensitive
attribute randomly chosen from the set A \ {a}, and leaving all other non-sensitive tokens of X
unchanged. Given a fixed/pre-defined sentiment classifier fs and a pretrained language model LM,
so that the random variable LM (X) is a sentence sampled from the language model conditioned on
X, define the random variable S(X) = fs (LM (X)) to be the generated sentence sentiment score
in [0, 1], and denote its distribution by PS (X). For binary sentiment classification, typically we
compute prediction y = S > τ given a decision threshold T.

One fundamental fairness concept is “demographic parity”, which requires equal positive classifica-
tion rates across subgroups, i.e. p(y | A = a) = p(y | A = a0) for any sensitive attributes a, a0.
We also measure deviation from it, “demographic disparity”, by differences between the subgroup
positive rates |p(y | A = a) - p(y | A = α0)∣ (Prop. 3.1 in (DWork et al., 2012)). Applying this
concept to measuring fairness between counterfactual pairs, demographic disparity is the difference
between positive sentiment rates of S(X) and S(X), ∣p(S(x) > T) - P(S(X) > T)].
HoWever, often We do not Want our fairness goal to be dependent on a predetermined decision
threshold T, since T may be user-defined or simply not known at training time. We require the
raw output distributions PS(x) and PS(X) to match - instead of the binary prediction y, which is
called “Strong Demographic Parity” (Jiang et al., 2019). We also extend the deviation measurement
by computing statistical disparity averaged over uniformly random choices of T ∈ [0, 1], that is,
ET〜U[o,i] | P(S(X) > τ) - P(S(X) > τ) | where U denotes the random uniform distribution. This
quantity is equal to the Wasserstein-I distance between distributions PS(x) and PS(X) (Jiang et al.,
2019),
Wi(Ps(x),Ps(X)) = ET〜u[o,i] | P(S(X) > T) - P(S(X) > τ) | .	(1)
Sentiment bias by counterfactual evaluation is then the Wasserstein-1 distance between output sen-
timent distributions PS of the original input X and its counterfactual x. Thus our counterfactual
fairness specification for sentiment biases, i.e. counterfactual sentiment bias, is
Wi(Ps(x),Ps(X)) < e,	(2)
for any sensitive attribute a ∈ A and a chosen threshold > 0. This fairness formulation also
expresses individual fairness which requires similar individuals to be treated similarly (Dwork et al.,
2012), provided that similarity is defined by having the same non-sensitive tokens. Note that this
specification addresses the output distribution of a generative model, in which it differs from prior
work on specifications in NLP models which concern individual predictions of discriminative mod-
els (Huang et al., 2019; Jia et al., 2019).
Fairness Evaluation. For each sensitive variable A ∈ C, we measure the individual fairness and
group fairness metrics from distributions of sentiment scores PS on the evaluation set in the follow-
ing way.

Individual Fairness Metric. Based on the fairness property of the Wasserstein-1 distance (Eq. 1), we
compute Average Individual Fairness by averaging Wasserstein-1 distance between the sentiment
score distribution of every evaluation sentence PS (x) and each of its Counterfactual sentence PS (X)
across all M templates2 for sensitive variable A. Formally, this is

where the inner sum is over all |A|(|AIT) unordered pairs of distinct a, α in A. a, a are the sensitive
attributes of xm , xm respectively.
Group Fairness Metric. The evaluation sentences are separated into |A| = K disjoint sub-
groups, assigning a sentence to group a if it contains sensitive tokens from φ(a). For exam-
ple, when sensitive variable A = gender, we have K = 2 for A = {male, female} and
φ(male) = {he, his, him, husband, Paul, . . .}.
For each subgroup a ∈ A, we measure the Wasserstein-1 distance between the sentiment distribu-
tion of all generated sentences of inputs from this subgroup, denoted PSa, and that over the entire
evaluation set, denoted PS. Then We report the sum of all subgroup Wasserstein-1 distances as the
Total Group Fairness metric, i.e.,
EWI(PS,PS).

4 Language Models with Fair Sentiment Distribution
Given an input prefix xi” with i tokens, xi” = (xι, ∙∙∙ , Xi), where the token Xi ∈ φ(a) is asso-
ciated with a group a of a sensitive attribute (e.g., countries, names, occupations), we construct a
perturbed prefix by replacing Xi with a token Xαi ∈ φ(αa) from a different group aα, where fairness
between the two groups should be maintained. We obtain a perturbed prefix Xi：i = (xi：i—i, Xi).
To train the language model towards reducing counterfactual sentiment bias, we want to ensure that
the language model produces similar sentiment distributions for the two prefixes. Specifically, we
would like the Wasserstein-1 distance between the sentiment distributions of generated sentences,
PS(xi：i) and PS(Xi：i), to be small, as shown in Eq. 2. In practice, it is prohibitively expensive
to sample a distribution of generated sequences for every xi：i and Xi：i Instead, we use hidden
features from the language model as a proxy to represent the distribution of future generated se-
quences, since p(χi+ι, Xi+2,…|xi：i) and p(xi+1,Xi+2,…|Xi：i) depend on the hidden states of
the language model conditioned on xi：i and Xi：i, respectively.
We explore two approaches: Fairness through embedding similarity and Fairness through sentiment
similarity by exploiting the hidden states of the language model. Given an L-layer transformer based
language model with an input xi：i,we let h(xi：i) = (h(1)(xi：i),…，h(L)(xi：i)) denote the hidden
features (or contextual embeddings) obtained by its hidden layers.
Fairness through embedding similarity. In this approach, we want to make sure the embed-
ding h(j)(xi：i) and h(j)(Xi：i) are close enough, since the joint probabilities p(χi+ι, Xi+2, ∙ ∙ ∙ |xi：i)
and p(xi+1,Xi+2,…|Xi：i) are determined by the embedding. We call it the “embedding simi-
larity” approach. We define the fairness loss as a distance between the embeddings, denoted as
d(h(xi：i), h(Xi：i). We consider using the cosine distance:
d(h(xi：i),h(Xi：i)):=1 -
h(xi：i)Th(Xi：i)
kh(xi：i)kkh(Xi：i)k
where h(x) = PL=LS ɑjh(j)(x), 1 ≤ Ls ≤ L is a “summary” of embedding layer features, and αj
is the weight of h(j)(x). Typically, the embedding in earlier layers captures word-level information
and embedding in later layers represents more high-level semantics (Tenney et al., 2019). In our
2During inference, for each sensitive variable A we design a set of sentence templates to evaluate the
counterfactual sentiment biases. See Section 5 for details.

case, since we want to capture high-level semantics (e.g., sentiments), we use the average over the
last 2 layers, embedding as the extracted features h(x) (Ls = L - 21α-L-ι = 0.5,αL = 0.5). We
find that averaging too many layers can make the difference between h(x) and h(Xi：i)) very small,
reducing the effectiveness of regularization.
The main drawback of enforcing embedding similarity is that this regularization can be too strong,
as we require the hidden representations (and thus the joint probabilities) to be as close as possible:
in the worst case, the model can learn to ignore individual members and generate the same texts for
all of them. Despite being completely fair in this extreme case, model performance may suffer since
the generated text should contextually depend on Xi or Xi.
Fairness through sentiment similarity. To overcome the above-mentioned drawback, we propose
an alternative method for eliminating sentiment biases using sentiment classifiers. Instead of mea-
suring d(h(xi：i), h(Xi：i)) directly, We first apply the same sentiment classifier fs to both h(xi：i)
and h(Xi：i), and measure d(fs(h(xi：i)),fs(h(Xi：i))) instead. Note that the output of fs can be
multi-dimensional (e.g., a hidden layer in the sentiment classifier), and we can measure the distance
via cosine similarity. The classifier fs can be seen as a projection from h(x) to a subspace that
ideally only contains sentiment related information. If such a perfect projection exists, we can regu-
larize the sentiment difference between the two inputs without affecting the model’s perplexity. The
detailed implementation of fs is introduced in Section 5.1.
On one hand, this classifier-based sentiment similarity approach avoids the strong regularization
in enforcing embedding similarity and can potentially produce better language models with lower
perplexity on test sets. On the other hand, the effectiveness of this method is correlated with the
quality of the sentiment classifier (or sentiment “projection”).
Implementation - Three-Step Curriculum Training. We use a three-step curriculum training
scheme to implement the proposed embedding similarity, sentiment similarity approaches. First, we
train a language model using regular cross-entropy loss for predicting the next token given all the
previous tokens, as done in typical language training setting; a good validation perplexity ensures a
relatively good hidden feature space has been learned. Second, using this language model, we train
a sentiment classifier fs (e.g., a simple multilayer perceptron (MLP)) using the extracted features
from the language model; since sentiment labels are generally unavailable for large-scale corpus, we
label a subset of training data with Google Cloud sentiment analysis API.3 Third, we continue lan-
guage model training with the addition of fairness loss Lfairness based on “embedding similarity” or
“sentiment similarity” with a regularization parameter λ, and in the meanwhile the language model
is still trained on regular negative log-likelihood (NLL) or cross-entropy loss (LLM) on predicting
the next token of unperturbed input x. The loss function for an input sequence x is:
L(X) = LLM(X) + λLfairness(h(x 1:i), h(XLi))
We refer the third step as “debiasing step”, which is illustrated in Figure 3. The second and third
steps may be repeated if desired.

5	Experiments
5.1	Datasets and Training Details
To reflect recent advancements in language modeling, we train two TransformerXL (Dai et al.,
2019) language models similar in scale to GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019) on a medium-scale corpus
of Wikipedia articles, WikiText-103, and a large-scale corpus of English new articles, from the
WMT-19 document-level translation task, which we will refer to as WMT-19.4 We do not use the
pre-trained GPT-2 models themselves, for which the training data is not publicly available. The
wikitext103 dataset (Merity et al., 2016) consists of 28,591 articles and over 100 million tokens
extracted from high quality Wikipedia articles. We use 28,471 articles for training, 60 articles for
validation and 60 articles for tests. WMT-19 consists of 14,635,198 English news articles; we take
the last 10,000 for evaluation with 1,000 for validation and the final 9,000 articles as a test set.
On the WikiText-103 dataset, we train a TransformerXL language model composed of 18-layer
transformers with an embedding size of 1024, 8 attention heads, and 257M parameters. The model
achieved 17.06 perplexity on the validation set. On the WMT-19 dataset, we train a language model
composed of 48 layer transformers with an embedding size of 1024, comprising 2,125 million pa-
rameters. The model achieved 17.46 perplexity on the validation set.
For both models, we train a 3-layer MLP network with hidden layer size 128 as the sentiment
classifier fs for sentiment feature projection. Labels for sentence sentiment are generated using the
Google Cloud sentiment analysis API. As it does not generate perfect labels we only keep sentences
with relatively high sentiment scores (normalized scores close to 0 or 1) to reduce noise in label
generation. The sentiment classifier achieves over 98% test accuracy on both datasets.
5.2	Evaluation Setup
Sensitive groups and attributes. To measure the counterfactual sentiment biases in language
models, we examine three categories of sensitive attributes: Country, Occupation, and Name. Coun-
try contains 10 representative countries and Occupation contains 29 common occupations; for Coun-
try or Occupation, sensitive tokens φ(a) are always a singleton containing either the country name
or the occupation. For Name, we consider gender as the sensitive attribute and sensitive tokens for
both subgroups φ(A= male) and φ(A = female) contain 17 different common names. All attributes
are detailed in Appendix A.
Sentence templates. For each category of sensitive attributes, we design a set of M = 10 tem-
plates to evaluate the counterfactual sentiment biases. Each template is a sentence prefix with length
im , m ∈ [M] containing a placeholder that will be replaced by a sensitive token in φ(a) for each
sensitive attribute value a ∈ A. In other words, for each template we complete it by inputting the
appropriate sensitive token for every a ∈ A, forming a prefix x1:im which is used as a conditioned
input to the language model. We apply an external sentiment classifier fs on the generated sen-
tences and sample 1000 sentences conditioned on each input prefix. All templates are described in
Appendix A.
Sentiment analysis and fairness metrics. Since it is impractical to evaluate each generated sen-
tence manually, we evaluate the generated sentences using both Google Cloud sentiment API and
a simpler, counting-based sentiment classifier. We design the counting-based sentiment classifier
by simply counting the number of positive opinion words p and the number of negative opinion
words n (Hu & Liu, 2004) and define the sentiment scores as p/(p + n) and 0.5 if no opinion words
exist. The counting-based sentiment classifier is introduced because the sentiment API is a black-
box model and may itself contain bias, as researchers have discovered in many existing automatic
sentiment analysis systems (Kiritchenko & Mohammad, 2018). The simple counting-based method,
while being less accurate, is less prone to giving biased judgments as it does not contain sensitive
attributes and only contains opinion words. Furthermore, since we use the same sentiment API to
create the sentiment label of the training data for creating the sentiment projection, it is better to
use a different metric to gauge sentiment and avoid overfitting a specific sentiment analysis system.

As mentioned in Section 3, we report average individual fairness (Eq. 3), and total group fairness
(Eq. 4) for Country, Occupation and Name detailed above.
Trade-off between relevance and fairness. We found that the model could generate irrelevant
sentences if trained using a very large debiasing regularization parameter. In this case, the model
is “fair” in the sense that it completely ignores the sensitive attributes. However this deteriorates
the original language model’s performance, and we expect the model to ideally capture semantics
given by these attributes. Thus, it is important to evaluate the trade-off between generation quality
and fairness. We use three metrics for this purpose. First, we report the perplexity on the whole
test set and the perplexity on a subset of the test set that includes articles with at least one sensitive
attribute. The perplexity on a whole test set reflects the language model performance overall. Given
the sensitive attributes only exist in a small fraction of test data, we report perplexity over a subset
of test set specifically to examine the language model performance related to the sensitive attributes.
Second, we measure the semantic similarity using an universal sentence encoder (Cer et al., 2018).
We calculate the cosine similarity between the embedding of the attribute word and the generated
sentences. We define a generated sentence to be similar if the cosine similarity is above a given
threshold (set to 0.2 empirically). We report semantic similarity ratio as a proxy on whether the
generated sentences capture the original semantics. Note we empirically find it is helpful to measure
whether models generate irrelevant sentences when there is a large semantic similarity ratio drop
(e.g. >20%) compared to baseline language models. Smaller semantic similarity ratio difference
might not reflect obvious semantic changes in generation quality.
Model Selection. We train language models using both embedding-similarity and semantic-
similarity losses with different regularization strengths. Based on the losses in the validation set,
we report λ = {10, 100} for embedding-similarity and λ = {100, 1000} for sentiment-similarity on
WMT-19. On WikiText-103, we report λ = {1, 10} for embedding-similarity and λ = {10, 100}
for sentiment-similarity. Note that it is unlikely that our models overfit the templates - during the
training process (see Figure 3), we do not add these templates explicitly to the dataset.
5.3	Evaluation Results
In Tables 2 and 3, we report the performance on WMT-19 and WikiText-103 dataset, respectively.
Each fairness metric is evaluated twice using the sentiment API and counting-based sentiment
scores. We can observe that the proposed approaches achieve reduced bias in both individual fairness
and group fairness metrics.
For each method, we report the performance of two models with two different regularization pa-
rameters for the fairness loss. A larger regularization produces a model with less bias; however the
semantic similarity scores also reduces slightly. We can balance the trade-off between model perfor-
mance by choosing different regularization parameters. A very strong regularization (not shown in
Tables 2 and 3) will produce a model that generates almost identical texts (under the same random
seed) given different countries, names or occupations in the prefix. We give an example of generated
text in this situation in Appendix C.
We observe that our proposed methods can retain a similar level of perplexity on the subset of test
set containing sensitive attributes (PPLs). Since we do not further train our baseline model on this
subset, with the additional epochs of the debiasing step, subset perplexity (PPLs) can sometimes
improve a little bit, while reducing counterfactual sentiment biases under individual fairness and
group fairness measure. Note the perplexity on the full test set (PPL) is almost unaffected by our
proposed methods, which can be potentially related to the use of a small learning rate during the
debiasing step and the use of small regularization parameters.
In most settings, we found that the sentiment-similarity method performs slightly better - when
semantic similarities are similar, models trained using sentiment-similarity regularization achieve
better fairness metrics (e.g. Emb. Sim. λ = 100 versus Sent. Sim λ = 1000 in Country of Table 2).
When fairness scores are similar, sentiment-similarity regularization achieves better semantic simi-
larity (e.g., Emb. Sim. λ = 10 versus Sent. Sim. λ = 1000 in Occupation of Table 2; Emb. Sim.
λ = 100 versus Sent. Sim. λ = 1000 in Name of Table 2.)

Comparing between Tables 2 and 3, we can observe the degree of bias (average individual fairness
and group fairness) in WikiText-103 is overall smaller than WMT-19, possibly reflecting the char-
acteristics of data source (Wikipedia articles vs. news articles), and the sensitivity/quality of the
language models with smaller model sizes and a smaller dataset (WikiText-103). Finally, in Ta-
ble 4, we randomly sample some sentences from the generated examples to show some qualitative
examples. Note we fix the random seed for each model and only change the attribute in template.

6	Conclusion
As large-scale language models are increasingly deployed for real-world applications, developing
methods for assessing and mitigating bias with respect to sensitive attributes may be an increasingly
important area of inquiry for facilitating pro-social outcomes. Recent work on bias in language
models has made significant progress in this direction (Lu et al., 2018; Qian et al., 2019; Bordia
& Bowman, 2019), but most work to date has focused on comparatively smaller-scale language
models. In this paper, we study counterfactual sentiment biases in large-scale transformer-based
language models. We evaluate and quantify the presence of biases in terms of both individual fair-
ness and group fairness metrics. We have demonstrated that our proposed embedding-similarity and
sentiment-similarity based methods reduce the counterfactual sentiment biases, while maintaining
similar perplexity and generation semantics. While specifying optimal model fairness behavior is
difficult, our method provides a framework to address various fairness specifications and an impor-
tant step toward the deployment of fairer language models. For future work, the proposed framework
could be extended to study counterfactual biases given other specifications (e.g. religion, ethnicity,
age, or multiple-attribute cross-subgroups) that requires fairness guarantees, and could be used with
other predefined measures, such as an emotion classifier.

B Additional experimental details
We provide additional experimental details for training and evaluating the models in this section.
Language model training (step 1 of curriculum training). For WMT-19, we train our model
on 128 TPUv3 cores using Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 2.5 × 10-4, batch size of 256
and a total of 5 × 105 training steps; for WikiText-103, we train our model on 128 TPUv3 cores
using Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 2.5 × 10-4, batch size 512 and a total of 2.5 × 105
training steps. For both datasets, we use a sequence length of 512 per batch, and we keep the states
(embeddings) for the latest 512 tokens in transformer.
Language model debiasing (step 3 of curriculum training). Since the language model has
achieved good validation perplexity in step 1, we decrease learning rate and use a smaller num-
ber of training steps in this step. For both datasets, we reduce learning rate to 2.5 × 10-5 ; we train
WMT-19 for 5 × 104 steps, and train WikiText103 for 2.5 × 104 steps for debiasing. For this step,
we only use 16 TPUv3 cores and reduce batch size to 16 and 32 for WMT-19 and WikiText-103,
respectively. Due to the decrease of step size in this step, we found that sometimes language model
perplexity improves after step 3, despite adding the additional fairness loss.
Sample Generation. We sample 1000 sentences per template given a specified sensitive attribute
to estimate the fairness metrics. The total number of samples generated is huge as we have 10
templates per category and in each category we can have tens of sensitive attributes. Throughout
the sampling experiments, we sample sentences with 50 tokens and we remove unfinished sentences
determined by period or new-line symbol. We sample with temperature of 1.0.
C A Negative Example
In this section we demonstrate a model trained with too large embedding similarity regularization.
Under the same random seed, the model produces almost identical outputs for different occupations,
and the text generated is irrelevant to the context given by occupations (“sheriff” or “designer”).
This model achieves very low semantic similarity score. This example shows an extreme for trading
off between fairness and performance, and it also shows the importance of using a semantic score to
guide model selection.
Table 8:	A negative example: generated texts are produced by a model trained with too large em-
bedding similarity regularization.

D	Trade-off between Semantic Similarity and Fairnes s metrics
In Figure 4, we report semantic similarity scores and individual fairness for models under differ-
ent regularization strengths in the WMT-19 Country category (corresponding to Table 2). We can
observe that the sentiment similarity based models achieve higher semantic similarity scores than
embedding similarity based models at a similar level of individual fairness. On the other hand, with
similar semantic similarity scores, the sentiment similarity based models achieve better individual
fairness than embedding similarity based models. For both proposed approaches, we improve the
individual fairness significantly compared to the baseline model. The sentiment similarity based

model further improves the individual fairness by a large margin while maintaining similar semantic
similarity scores.
E	Gender Biases in Occupation
In addition to the sentiment biases discussed in this paper, we can also observe some gender biases in
occupation, relevant to some findings in Solaiman et al. (2019). Specifically, using templates 2 and 3
in the country category, “My wife/husband just got an exciting new job in <Country>. Starting next
week , she/he will be”, we count occupation words (Zhao et al., 2018a) in the generated samples
across all the countries using a WMT-19 baseline language model. Among the 10,000 generated
sentences, we filter out occupation that occurs less than 5 times and we report the counts in in Fig 5.
We can observe the model has gender biases towards some occupations such as “editor”, “teacher”,
“guard”, “CEO”, and “secretary”.
F Distinct Words
We demonstrate the models capture the distinction between the counterfactual attributes by showing
some examples of distinct words in the generated samples. Specifically we define the distinct words
w for category a between categories a and b as arg maxw p(w|a)/p(w|b). In Table 9, we show
some examples between several pair of categories and the top 10 distinct words.
