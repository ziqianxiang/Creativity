 packedinside the nucleus of every eukaryotic cell is several feet of genetic material that is compacted in a very specificway ,1990, small sections of dna are wrapped 
 the programme called ' insectallies ' intends for insects to be used for dispersing genetically modified viruses to agricultural plants in fields,2016, these viruses would be engineered so they can alter the chromosomes of plants through ‘ genome editing ’
