Figure 1: Comparison the performance of MPO withREINFORCE and VPG on the short-corridor gridworld domain.
Figure 2: Comparison of the empirical performance of MPO between non-Euclidean distance (p 6= 2)and EuClidean distanCe (p = 2) on standard domains: MountainCar, ACrobot and CartPole.
Figure 3: Learning curves for continuous control tasks. The shaded region represents the standarddeviation of the score over the best three trials. Curves are smoothed uniformly for visual clarity.
