Figure 1: Video encoding reproductions at 128x128 pixel resolution from the KTH dataset. (A) Areproduction of Person15-handclapping_d4 using 128 convolutional filters per layer which, althoughnot parameter efficient, achieve high fidelity after 99800 training epochs at full FP32 precision. (B)A reproduction of person15handwaving_d4 using only 32 convolutional filters per layer and dilationd = 2 after 363947 training epochs with mixed FP16 precision. This encoding achieves a compres-sion ratio of 27x but at the cost of some fidelity. (C) Finally, a reproduction of person25boxingd1using 32 convolution filters per layer and dilation d = 2 after 473701 training epochs with FP16precision.

(A) Frames, yi, produced by the base network fθ, with 32convolution filters per layer, which advances the sequence at each application. (B) Upscaled frames,y*, produced by denosing autoencoder, fθ*, with 32 convolution filters per layer. (C) Associatedground truth frames, xi.
Figure 4: Visualizing the training of a high-dimensional autoregressive noise process. The compu-tation, g, as defined is a simple convolutional neural network according to Algorithm 1 and trainedas defined by Algorithm 2. In this instance, gφ was initialized with nconv = 8. To help visualizethe learning process, distance matrices are calculated over the elements of Z at various stages oftraining. After 17000 epochs of training, the distance matrix confirms that the elements generatedby gφ are sufficient to support bijective transformation.

Figure 6: An attempt to decrypt (i.e. recall) an encoded video using an imposter key. (A) Key z00 andimposter key z000. (B) On the left, z00 and gφ applied to generate the appropriate keys {z300, z602 , z801}and decrypted through application of F. On the right, the imposter key, z000, with the same gφ yieldsan invalid key stream {z3000, z6002, z8001} which decrypt to incoherent states under F.
