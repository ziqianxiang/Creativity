Figure 4: TD3 CrossRenorm outperforms other baselines. Here we use the original hyperparametersby Fujimoto et al. (2018) and Haarnoja et al. (2018) re-evaluate on -v2 environments. Evaluationon OpenAI gym continuous control tasks, showing average returns and half standard deviationscomputed over 10 runs; curves are uniformly smoothed.
Figure 5: Plots showing the convergenceof DDPG on a fixed experience buffer ofWalker transitions with size 1 million. Thecurves are the log of the average Q valueprediction of a randomly sampled (s, a)batch of size 1024. All DDPG runs aretrained without target networks.
Figure 6: (a) and (b) are phase diagrams showing Baird's counterexample (CE) log(∣V|) andWaIker2d's log(∣Q|) value estimates after optimization, on the α, β plane of the feature space. Lowervalues are better as all rewards were set to zero. α + β = 1 normalization for α > 1 produces stableresults. Each pixel represents one optimization run for 50k iterations, with results produced usingexpected TD(0) updates with γ = .99, η = 10-3. (c) shows two modifications of Baird’s MDP withrandomly generated feature vectors. The red cross indicates the un-normalized configuration.
