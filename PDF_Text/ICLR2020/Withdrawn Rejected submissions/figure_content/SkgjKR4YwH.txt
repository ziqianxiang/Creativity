Figure 1: The relationship between MixUp, DAT and Untied MixUp.
Figure 2: DAT as a form of adversarial training(b) Adversarial trainingIn DAT, a second sample x0 governs the direction in which x is perturbed. If x0 is chosen froma different class as shown in Figure 2c), then the generated sample bx2 is used to further train themodel. If x0 is chosen from the same class as shown in Figure 2d), then the sample bx3 is usedin further training. Note that the inter-class mixed sample bx2 pushes the modelâ€™s classificationboundary closer to the ground-truth classifier, thus connecting adversarial training and DAT. Theintra-class sample bx3, on the other hand, mainly helps to smooth inner parts of the class region. Thelatter behaviour is an additional feature of DAT and MixUp, which distinguishes these schemes fromadversarial training.
