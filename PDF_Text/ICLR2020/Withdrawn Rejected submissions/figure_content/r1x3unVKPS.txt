Figure 1: The task of Lunar Lander requireslanding the spacecraft between the flags withoutcrashing.
Figure 3: Average reward assignment at the goalstates by different algorithms. SAIL-b assigns signif-icantly higher reward to "no op", enabling the agentto learn the appropriate landing behaviors. Otheralgorithms fail to imitate the expert consistently.
Figure 2: Performance histogram of 50 evaluationruns on Humanoid for RED, GAIL, and SAIL-b.
Figure 4: Training progress for RED, GAIL, GAIL-b, SAIL, and SAIL-b. Consistent with our theoreticalanalysis, SAIL-b (blue) is more stable and sample efficient in Reacher, Ant and Humanoid, and comparable toother algorithms for the remaining tasks.
