Figure 2: An empirical example of MC estimate ofthe induced distribution over simplex. The classi-fier (MCDP) is trained on real-world digits imagesof {0,1, 2} (corresponding to left, right, top cor-ners of simplex). The 1st and 3rd rows indicatethe input while the 2nd and 4th rows indicate MCestimate of Ï€ over a 2-simplex.
Figure 1: An intuitive example of the proposed framework.
Figure 3: Graphical representation of probabilistic structure of the Bayes teacher (left and middle) and thestudent (right). Dashed edges denote deterministic dependence, box nodes are deterministic and circle nodes arestochastic. The left and middle graphs correspond to the LHS and RHS of (2), respectively.
