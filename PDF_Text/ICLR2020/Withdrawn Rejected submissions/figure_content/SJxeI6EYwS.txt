Figure 1: An illustration of the stochastic learning module in a SE-SNN. The output of layer l is sampled fromthe learned distribution defined by f μ(hl-1) and fσ (hl-1).
Figure 2: Adversarial defense accuracy (mean + standard deviation) under untargeted FGS and CWattacks on MNIST.
Figure 3: Label noise results on MINIST (a) and ablation study results on Market-1501 (b,c). In (c), the toprow shows samples with the highest variance and bottom row those with the lowest when there is no label noise.
