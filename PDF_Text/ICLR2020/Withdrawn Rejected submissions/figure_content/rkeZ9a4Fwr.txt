Figure 1: Latent-space adversarial attacks on Chairs, 3D Faces and CelebA for different models,including our proposed Seatbelt-VAE. β = 10 for β-TCVAE, β-TCDLGM and Seatbelt-VAE. L is thenumber of stochastic layers. Clockwise within each plot we show the initial input, its reconstruction,the adversarial input, the adversarial distortion added to make it (shown normalised), the adversarialinput’s reconstruction, and the target image.

Figure 3: Plots showing the effect of varying β under various datasets on the ELBO of β-TCVAEs,β-TCDLGMs and Seatbelt-VAEs [Eqs (4), (11) and (10) respectively]. Shading corresponds to the95% CI over variation due to variation of ||z|| and L.
Figure 4: Top row shows CelebA input data. Below are reconstructions from β-TCVAE, β = 20 andthen Seatbelt VAE, L = 4, β = 20.
Figure 5: ∆iatent∕output for (a) Chairs (b) 3D Faces, for β-TCVAE for different β values. Shadingcorresponds to the 95% CI over variation due to our stable of images and our values of ||z|| and λ.
