Figure 1: Overview of our method demonstrating semantic parsing process. In the example, the topprediction by the generator is y1 whereas the candidate y2 is scored highest by the critic among thecandidates of the generator.
Figure 2: Overview of generating training examples for the critic.
Figure 3: Overview of the proposed three methods with an example demonstrating each one. Rawlogical form method uses logical forms as they are without any change, natural language entitynames method simply changes entities to natural text, and templated expansions method uses atemplate to convert logical forms to canonical utterances.
