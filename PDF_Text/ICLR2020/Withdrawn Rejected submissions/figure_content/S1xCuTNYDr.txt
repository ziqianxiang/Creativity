Figure 1: Left: Neighborhood Fidelity of LIME-generated explanations (lower is better) vs.
Figure 2: Left: A function (blue), its first order Taylor approximations at x = 0.4 (green) andx = 0.5 (red), and a local explanation of the function (orange) computed with x = 0.5 and Nx = [0, 1].
Figure 3: Original im-ages (left) and saliencymaps of an unregularized(middle) and regularized(right) models.
Figure 4: A comparison showing the effects of the σ parameter of Nx and Nxreg on the UCI Housingdataset. The LIME-NF metric grows slowly with σ for Nx as expected. Despite being very large,using σ = 0.5 for Nxreg is generally best for the LIME-NF metric and possibly for accuracy.
