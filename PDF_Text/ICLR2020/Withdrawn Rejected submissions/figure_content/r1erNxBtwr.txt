Figure 1: (a) shows dependency between Y, X and A. (b) and (c) are dense and sparse graphgenerated by SBM, which have uniform degree distribution. (d) and (e) are dense and sparse graphgenerated by DCSBM, which have power-law degree distribution.
Figure 2: Each row corresponds to a graph. The i-th column corresponds to the feature distributionafter applying filter (DD-1/2AD-1/2)i-1. Both graphs include three classes of same size and hasstructure generated by SBM (p = 0.6, q = 0.03). The first graph’s feature follows a circulardistribution with radius = 1, 0.9, 0.8 and Gaussian noise = 0.02 for each class. The second graph’sfeature follows a circular distribution with radius = 1 and Gaussian noise = 0.02 for all classes.

Figure 7: Examples of “No Best Order for All”A.3.3 Illustration of Graph Generator for Curves in Section 3.2For the curves indicating how powerlaw coefficient influence the choice of normalization in Figure3, we generate the corresponding graphs structure by DCSBM with fixed p = 0.3, q = 0.2 andvaries the powerlaw coefficient from -0.3 to 0. The graph contains two classes of nodes, and is ofsize 400 and 600 for each class respectively. The feature for each class satisfies multivariate normaldistribution with identity co-variance matrix, and with mean (0,0) and (0.2,0.2).

Theirstatictics are in table4. Beside number of nodes, edges, classes, the dimension of feature, and thedata split strategy, we also show the class ratio variance, which can indicates if this dataset isimbalance or not, density gap, which indicates the dependency of structure and labels, and density,which indicates the overall connectivity of a graph. We provide the degree distribution in Figure 10,and we can clearly find that these benchmark datasets has power law degree distribution.
