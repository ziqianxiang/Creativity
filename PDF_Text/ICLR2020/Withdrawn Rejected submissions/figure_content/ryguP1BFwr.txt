Figure 1: Loss plots for the three datasets for both seeds. Each columns corresponds to a dataset.
Figure 2: Reconstructions of randomly picked samples. The left column contains samples from thetraining data, while on the right, we show samples from the test data. In each subfigure, the rowscorrespond to CAEs with the same bottleneck size (height, width), increasing from top to bottom.
Figure 3:	Results from training linear models on latent codes to predict the labels associated witheach dataset. For Pokemon, CelebA attributes and STL-10 (macro) f1-score is shown. The plotsfor CelebA regression show MSE. The top row corresponds to models trained on latent codes fromthe CAE training data, while the bottom row is from CAE test data. Color is based on difference tobaseline, where red signifies an improvement.
Figure 4:	Results of pair-wise SVCCA. Labels on the x and y axis correspond to (height=width)-(number of channels) in the bottleneck.
