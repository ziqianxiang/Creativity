More algorithms with different level accessto the target classifier have been proposed, including white-box attack models, which have accessto the gradients (Moosavi-Dezfooli et al., 2016; Kurakin et al., 2016; Carlini & Wagner, 2017) andblack-box attack model, which have limited access to the target classifier (Chen et al., 2017; Chenget al., 2018; Ilyas et al., 2018).

Figure 3: Comparison in the change of eigenvaluesD Statistics of the DatasetsThe statistics of the datasets are given in Table 2. In this table, #nodes denotes the average numberof nodes over all graphs and #edges denotes the average number of edges over all graphs. ACCdenotes the mean of Average Clustering Coefficient (ACC) over all graphs. GCC denotes the meanof Global Clustering Coefficient (GCC) over all graphs.
