Figure 1: The training, compressing and finetuning pipeline of the proposed method.
Figure 2: Effect of different decomposition methods and regularizers. Dash lines show the approxi-mated tendency of the accuracy-compression tradeoff. See Appendix B for detailed data.
Figure 3: Comparison of accuracy-#FLOPs tradeoff against previous methods. Being closer to thetop-right corner indicates a better tradeoff point. See Appendix B for detailed data.
