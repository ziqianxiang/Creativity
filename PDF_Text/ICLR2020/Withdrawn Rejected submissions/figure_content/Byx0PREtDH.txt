Figure 1: Problem definition and analysis.
Figure 2: The overview of our network architecture. The network is composed of the visual pathwayand the linguistic pathway. In the visual pathway, an input image is processed by the ConvolutionNeural Network (CNN), the visual encoding module and an attractor network, obtaining the visualattractor feature AV. In the linguistic pathway, the data flows are different for the training procedureand testing procedure. During the training, the linguistic attribute feature aL and the linguisticobject feature oL that correspond to the input image are firstly extracted, and then processed bythe linguistic encoding module and an attractor network, obtaining the linguistic attractor featureAL . The loss measuring the similarity between AV and AL as well as other losses are computed totrain the neural network. During the testing, the linguistic attractor features of all possible unseenattribute-object pairs are computed (for simplicity, only one pair is illustrated in the figure) andcompared with the visual attractor feature of the input image to predict the most likely attribute-object pair.
