Figure 1: Multiple graph convolution networks with different output node embedding sizes areneeded since graph sizes and complexities are not consistent, e.g., (a) and (b). Multiple graphpooling networks are needed to coarsen graphs according to different graph properties. For example,the original graph can be coarsened according to graph structure as shown in (c) or according to nodefeatures as shown in (d), where circle vertices have similar node features and triangle vertices havesimilar node features.
Figure 2: An illustrative example of MxPool. At each hierarchical layer, we first run multiple GCNswith different hyperparameters on the original graph, so we will have multiple diverse sets of nodeembeddings, which form the multiplex convolution step. Next, we use a learnable approach to mergethese embeddings for each node into one. We also run multiple differentiable pooling operations onthe original graph and cluster nodes together in diverse ways, which forms the multiplex poolingstep. These coarsened graphs are then merged into one in a learnable approach. The merged nodeembeddings and the merged coarsened graph are used to generate a new coarsened graph with a newset of node features, which is going to be processed in the next hierarchical layer.
