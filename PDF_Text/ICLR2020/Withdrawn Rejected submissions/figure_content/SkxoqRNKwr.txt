Figure 1: Performance on privacy preservation of different methods (the larger the better). Thehorizontal lines across the bars indicate the corresponding privacy guarantees given by our lowerbound in Theorem 3.1.
Figure 2: The joint conditional error (Err0 + Err1, the smaller the better) of different methods.
Figure 3: Relationships between different notions of fairness and privacy.
Figure 4: Classification accuracy of multi-attribute defense on the UTKFace dataset. For targetaccuracy, the larger accuracy the better. For private accuracy, the smaller accuracy the better.
