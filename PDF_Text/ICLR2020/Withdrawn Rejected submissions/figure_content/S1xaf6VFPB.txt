Figure 1: (Left) The ratio of the uniform 4-SAT problems solved versus α. The green vertical linesindicate the theoretical phase transition thresholds for uniform 4-SAT as N → ∞. (Right) Theaccuracy and time for Glucose vs. PDP (parallel), PDP (serial) and PDP (serial with batch replication)on uniform 4-SAT. All PDP methods were run up to 1000 iterations, whereas Glucose was let tosolve all the problems without time restriction.
Figure 2: The ratio of the modular 4-SAT problems solved versus α for Glucose and the two PDPsolvers trained on uniform and modular random 4-SAT.
