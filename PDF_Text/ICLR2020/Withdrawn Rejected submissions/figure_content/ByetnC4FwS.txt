Figure 1: The influence of the distance between the center of the answer span and the center of thechunk. The test performance (in F1 score) is evaluated on the CoQA dataset using a BERT-basedreader.
Figure 2: Model overview: BERT generates a representation for each input chunk, and recurrenceaccumulates information over chunks. Based on these representations, the answer extractor extractsanswers from the current chunk, and the policy network takes chunking action and moves to the nextchunk. Chunk scorer scores each chunk by giving its likelihood of containing an answer and selectsanswers among predictions from multiple chunks.
