Figure 4: The red and green points are real rear-right and front-right grounding points separately,the blue and white points are the predicted results separately. (a) Identify the center of the vehiclebottom edge as the grounding point. (b) Cut off the gradients corresponding to invisible points(a)(b)(c)Figure 5: The red and green points are real rear-right and front-right grounding points separately, theblue and white points are the predicted results separately. (a) Invisible point at center. (b) Invisiblepoint at top left corner. (c)Invisible point at lower right corner.
