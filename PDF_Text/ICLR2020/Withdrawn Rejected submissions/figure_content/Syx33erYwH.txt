Figure 1: AMAGAIL with three player function structures. (a) Synchronous participation: Theplayer function is equal to 1, all agents take actions at all time steps. (b) Deterministic partici-pation: In this example, three agents take turns to make actions with a fixed order. (c) Stochasticparticipation: Three agents all have stochastic player functions (i.e., yellow boxes), thus, eachagent has a certain probability to make an action w.r.t the player function given the participationhistory ht-1; in this example, only agents #2 and #3 happen to make actions, and agent #1 does not.
Figure 2: Average true reward from cooperative tasks. Performance of experts and random policiesare normalized to one and zero respectively. We use inverse log scale for better comparison.
