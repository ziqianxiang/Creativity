Figure 2: Training and Validation Gap(average value with smoothing)Our mixed-level method lies between them: when λ is small (0.1), the gap is closer to that of thesingle-level method, while when λ is large (999), the gap is closer to that of the bilevel method.

Figure 4: Searched Architectures. The left two sub-figures show an architecture that has an errorrate of 2.34% with a parameter size of 3.87M; The right two sub-figures show an architecture thathas an error rate of 2.50% with a parameter size of 2.86M.

In this setting, the epochnumber was set to 200 and the parameter range was tracked by using the method introduced in sec-tion 2.3. We evaluated the best architecture in each parameter range, and then found the relationshipbetween the parameter number and the model performance (accuracy). From Figure 6, we learnthat our method can also find high-performance architecture with a smaller parameter number. Forexample, a smaller parameter number of 2.86M gains an error rate of 2.50%, exceeding the reported1As of the publication of this paper, GDAS still has not published the source code.
