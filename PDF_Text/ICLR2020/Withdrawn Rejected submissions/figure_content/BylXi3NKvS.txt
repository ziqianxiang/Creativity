Figure 1: Comparison of architectures. BN denotes batch-normalization. Relu and Relu6 are activa-tion functions. (a) Standard convolution. (b) Our proposed Falcon. (c) Standard convolution withbranch (StConv-branch). (d) Falcon-branch which combines Falcon with StConv-branch.
Figure 2:	(a) Relation between standard convolution and depthwise separable convolution ex-pressed with EHP. The common axes correspond to the input channel-axis of standard convolution.
Figure 3: Accuracy w.r.t. number of parameters on different models and datasets. The three blueCirCles Correspond to rank-1, 2, 3 Falcon (from left to right order), respeCtively. Falcon providesthe best accuracy for a given number of parameters.
Figure 4: Accuracy w.r.t. FLOPs on different models and datasets. The three blue circles correspondto rank-1, 2, 3 Falcon (from left to right order), respectively. Falcon provides the best accuracyfor a given number of FLOPs.
Figure 5: Comparison of architectures based on depthwise separable convolution. BN denotes batch-normalization, and Relu is an activation function.
