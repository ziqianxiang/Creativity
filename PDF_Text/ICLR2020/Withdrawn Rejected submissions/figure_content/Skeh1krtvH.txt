Figure 1: The Jacobian %â‘¦(X) of (a) an autoregressive transformation, and (b) a bipartite trans-formation. The blank cells are 0s and represent the independent relations between zi and xj . Thelight-blue cells are scaling variables and represent the linear dependencies between zi and xi . Thedark-blue cells represent complex non-linear dependencies defined by neural networks.
Figure 2: The receptive fields over the squeezed inputs X for computing Zi,j in (a) WaveFlow,(b) WaveGlow, (c) autoregressive flow with column-major order (e.g., WaveNet), and (d) autoregres-sive flow with row-major order.
