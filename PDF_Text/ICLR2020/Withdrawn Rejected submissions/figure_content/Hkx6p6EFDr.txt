Figure 3: Left (Embeddings). Ground truth versus predicted embedding for COURSE instances in thetransductive (a) and inductive (b) settings. The x-y location of each point encodes the prediction Zcd, while thesize and color of each encodes the ground-truth Zd . In the inductive setting, training and test databases contain% test time obs.
