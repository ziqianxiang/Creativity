Figure 1: We introduce cultural transmission into language emergence between neural agents. Thestarting point of our study is a goal-oriented dialog task (similar to that of Kottur et al. (2017)),summarized in Fig. 1a. During learning we periodically replace some agents with new ones (grayagents). These new agents do not know any language, but instead of creating one they learn it fromolder agents. This creates generations of language that become more compositional over time.
Figure 2: Test set accuracies (with standard deviations) are reported against our new harder datasetusing models similar to those in Kottur et al. (2017). Our variations on cultural transmission (darkerblue bars) outperform the baselines where language does not change over generations.
Figure 4: Each sub-figure summarizes an A-bot’s language, as described in Section 5.3. By com-paring the baseline of Fig. 4a to a similar pair of bots from our approach Section 4b we can see thatour approach encourages compositional language to emerge. Furthermore, the similarity betweenFig. 4b and Fig. 4c suggests language is indeed transmitted in our approach.
Figure 5: Test set accuracies (with standard deviations) are reported by training and evaluating thesame models as in our main results Fig. 2 against the dataset from Kottur et al. (2017). These resultsdo not perform cross-validation, following Kottur et al. (2017). They only vary across 4 differentrandom seeds. This dataset is significantly easier than our new dataset, as indicated by the Ourproposed approach still outperforms models without replacement or multiple agents.
