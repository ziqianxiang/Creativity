Figure 1:	Attention Encoder with Dynamic State for 4 Boxes Case. Every previous packing stepoutput leads to corresponding box state update and re-encodes in the following step.
Figure 2:	Conditional Query Process. The figure demonstrates the condition query process whenpacking box i, which embed previous sub-action results as conditional query for current decoder.
Figure 4: The Packing Results of CQL. It is worth to note that the goal is to minimize the final binheight. Whether the boxes are close to each other does not affect the final height in many cases, sothe results do not show very neat arrangement but already achieve near optimal bin height.
