Figure 1: The clustering results of GPD k-means in three isotropic Gaussian blobs. The color of thesurface and contour in the figures represent the probability density of GPD. The closer to yellow, thegreater the probability density. The closer to blue, the smaller the probability density.
Figure 2: Visualization of six synthetic datasets shows the result of our Extreme Value k-meanscompared to k-means, k-means++, k-medoid, bidecting k-means and spectral clustering. The resultsfrom top to down are the clustering results on the datasets D1, D2, D3, D4, D5 and D6, respectively.
Figure 3: On a dataset of 5 Gaussian clusters with 5000 samples, we analyze our accelerationmethod, block size s and the percentage of excess Î±.
