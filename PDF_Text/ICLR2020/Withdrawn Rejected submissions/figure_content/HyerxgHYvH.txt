Figure 1: Fundamental operationsplex function such as multiplication and division and show that these fundamental blocks can beused to design several complex functions including a arithmetic equation calculator.
Figure 2: Multiplication and Division using fundamental operations. (a) and (b) are the high-levelrepresentation of signed multiplication and signed division operations respectively. (c) and (d) rep-resents the unrolled architecture for n-digit multiplication and n-digit division (respectively) of twopositive integers.
