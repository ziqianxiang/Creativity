Figure 1: A snapshot of the crash simulation of the 3D model used for data collection with a zoomunto the studied longitudinal beams, from Bohn et al. (2013) (left). The four selected parts (beams)after the crash for one selected simulation, later used for illustration (right). The colors of the partsare used to display error behavior per part.
Figure 2: Localization and histogram of errors between original parts and their reconstruction fromtheir spectral representation with m = 40 spectral coefficients. Histogram color coding follows thecolor convention in Figure 1, right.
Figure 3: The two branches LSTM autoencoder network architecture. The data sequence of f S arefeed into the network in two lengths and a joint encoder is learned. The top decoder is learning thereconstruction, while the bottom decoder is performing future prediction.
Figure 4: Histogram of the reconstruction (blue) and prediction (red) errors for the spectral coeffi-cients by the network, left for the training data, on the right for the testing data.
Figure 5: Localization and histogram of the error accumulation AE. First and third rows showthe reconstruction and prediction error, respectively, for the first bifurcation branch. Second andforth rows show the reconstruction and prediction error, respectively, for the second bifurcationbranch. The error is shown on a representative final time step of each branch to illustrate the differentdeformation behaviors. Histogram color coding follows the color convention in Figure 1, right.
Figure 6: 2D embedding of LSTMâ€™s reconstruction weights. Two branches of the bifurcation arewell separated in the 2D visualization made by t-SNE. First bifurcation branch is marrked by reddots and the second one by blue triangles.
Figure 7: Localization and histogram of the error accumulation AE for the prediction per time step.
