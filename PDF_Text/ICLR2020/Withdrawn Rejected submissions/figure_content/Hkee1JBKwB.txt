Figure 1: Illustration of (a) convolutional tensor-train (Eqs. (5) and (6)) and the difference betweenconvolutional tensor-train LSTM (b) Fixed window version (Eqs. (11a) and (10)) and (c) Slidingwindow version (Eqs. (11b) and (10)). The fixed window version use all steps to compute each inputto convolutional tensor-train, while sliding window version uses a window of steps for each input.
Figure 2: Frame-wise comparison in MSE, SSIM and PIPS on Moving-MNIST-2. For MSE andLPIPS, lower curves denote higher quality; while for SSIM, higher curves imply better quality.
Figure 4: 20 frames prediction on KTH given 10 input frames. Every 2 frames are shown.
Figure 5: Illustration of the network architecture for the 12-layers model used in the experiments.
