Figure 1: A setup with 7 workers (3 are Byzantine)and 4 servers (1 is Byzantine). Byzantine machinesform together a single adversarial entity, wherethey communicate over their own covert network.
Figure 2: Convergence in a non-Byzantine environment.
Figure 3: Throughput gain of Li-uBei compared to GuanYu (15).
Figure 4: Convergence in the presenceof Byzantine workers.
Figure 5: Convergence in the presenceof a Byzantine server.
Figure 6: The effect of changing T onperformance.
Figure 7: False negative percentage withdifferent values of T .
Figure 1: Variance to norm ratio with different batch sizes, compared to the bound/thresholdrequired by two Byzantine-resilient GARs: MDA and Multi-Krum. To satisfy a GAR assump-tion/condition, the real variance/norm value should be lower than the GAR bound. For instance,MDA can be used with batch-size=32 with f = 1, but not with f = 5 (as the real variance/normvalue is higher than the MDA threshold).
