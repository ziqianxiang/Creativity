Figure 1: The overall architecture of the proposed model.The detailed structure for ClassificationEmbedding Extraction is will be shown in following Section3.2	Embedding extraction for entity classWord Lexicon has played an important role in dealing model NER problems. However, a high-quality lexicon construction requires a lot of manpower and might be incompetent to handle OOVissues. Since the ideal word embedding assumes that words with identical classes would have clus-tered representations, it is suggested that the embedding of known entities may help to find newentities of the same class.

Figure 3: Entity-sentence relation heatmap of the case in Weibo Dataset4.1.8	Case studyTo explore the process of the Classification Attention, a case study of Weibo Dataset will be shownin this section. We pick a real test sentence from Weibo. The four entity classification embeddingsare extracted from the training data which do not contain entities in the test case sentence. Themodel is trained following the hyperparameters described in the Implementation Details section.
