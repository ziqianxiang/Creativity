Figure 1: The output of our conditional detector. The two examples show: Left - the detector input.
Figure 2: The core Siamese tracker takes the target and search images as input and outputs thebounding box proposal heatmap and offsets.
Figure 3: Joint tracking and detection model.
Figure 4: Joint tracking and detection model output. Top: ground truth target crop if input to thetarget branch. Bottom: a random patch from the first frame is input to the target branch.
Figure 5: Left: Mean and standard error plot of VOT2018 robustness versus training iteration. Theerror bars were obtained using six random seeds. The dashed line represents the training iterationwhen the learning rate was reduced. Right: Table comparing final VOT2018 performance to recentstate-of-the-art Siamese trackers.
Figure 6: Search window location sensitivity analysis of our network. Left: sampling procedure,Middle: fraction of IoU (normalized by the IoU at displacement (0, 0)) for our network withoutdetector, Right: fraction of IoU for our network with detector.
Figure 7: Target crop location sensitivity analysis of our network. Left: sampling procedure, Mid-dle: fraction of IoU for our network without detector, Right: fraction of IoU for our network withdetector.
Figure 8: Target crop temporal sensitivity analysis of our network. Left: sampling procedure, Right:mean fraction of IoU for our network without and without detector (normalized by the iou at dt = 0.)switches to saliency detection. In this case, the IoU actually increases from the central low to somebackground constant.
