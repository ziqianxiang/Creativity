Defferrard et al. (2016) considers 25 steps diffusive filters to approximate a 5 × 5kernel with 10 feature maps(10 hidden units). For comparison, we take an 8-step-ballistic kernel withthe same number of feature maps. The feature maps are then fully connected to 10/32 units and thenconnected to 10 units for classification. The notations are denoted as Ball10 and Ball32. Table 1summarizes the capabilities of our model compared to other recent modeling approaches.
