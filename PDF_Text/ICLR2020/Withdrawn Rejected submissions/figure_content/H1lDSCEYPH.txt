Figure 1: (a) Neuron editing interrupts the standard feedforward process, editing the neurons of atrained encoder/decoder to include the source-to-target variation, and letting the trained decoder cas-cade the resulting transformation back into the original data space. (b) The neuron editing process.
Figure 2: Data from CelebA where the source data consists of males with black hair and the targetdata consists of males with blond hair. The extrapolation is then applied to females with black hair.
Figure 4: Neuron editing corrects the variation in IFNg while preserving the variation in CCR6 andcorrectly predicting the effect of combining two drugs.
Figure 5: (a) The global shift in the two controls (light blue tored) is isolated and this variation is edited into the sample (darkblue to red), with all other variation preserved. (b) The medianchange in the sample in each dimension corresponds accuratelywith the evidence in each dimension in the controls.
