Figure 1: Comparison between domain adaptation with or without double blind constraint. (a)Domain adaptation without double blind constraint leverages source and target data simultaneouslyat training time. (b) Domain adaptation with double blind constraint cannot feed data from sourceand target domains simultaneously into model at training time.
Figure 2: Structure of TAN. In training step 1, we train an autoencoder with unlabeled sourceinstances. In training step 2, we train a stack of classifier and the encoder using labeled sourceinstances. Then, after transferring the model to a target domain, we fine-tune the autoencoder onunlabeled target instances in training step 3. In training step 4, a transfer aligner (in red color)is trained to map the target feature space back to the source feature space using unlabeled targetinstances. At test time, each instance goes through the final model consisting of the fine-tunedautoencoder and the transfer aligner trained at step 4, and the source classifier trained at step 2.
