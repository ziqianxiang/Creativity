Figure 2: Overview of the proposed AdVMixUP framework.
Figure 3: Prediction error rates of the model (trained with only labeled data) on the virtual samplesalong the interpolation paths (blue line) defined by the ICT model Verma et al. (2019) and theinterpolation paths (orange line) defined by the proposed AdvMixup. (a) Results on the CIFAR-10dataset where 4000 labeled data samples are used. (b) Results on the SVHN dataset where 1000labeled data samples are used. Best viewed in color.
