Figure 1: Illustration of EXAID. First, an image is classified by a standard image clas-sification system like ResNet. Then, an explanation is created based on the image, thenetwork activations and the network output. Finally, a detector checks if the generatedexplanation is consistent with the predicted label. (a) An image of an owl is correctlyclassified, and the produced explanation is consistent with the label “owl”. (b) An imageof peacock is perturbed and used as an attack. It is falsely classified as an owl, and isdetected as adversarial because its explanation is inconsistent with the predicted label.
Figure 2: Defense methods comparison. Each sub-figure compares 2 EXAID variants tofive baselines. (a,b) defend against FGSM, for CIFAR-10 and SVHN. (c,d) same againstPGD (d,e) Same against C&W. EXAID outperforms all baselines in low-noise scenarios,and is comparable in the high-noise regime.
