Figure 1: Down-scaled search space.
Figure 2: S-Tau evaluated after everyepochs for “Diff. seeds”, “Diff. orders(shuffle)” and “Ground truth”.
Figure 3: Distribution of rank achieved for each child model, ordered from the ground-truth-best toworst. Each box extends from the lower to upper quartile values of its corresponding data, with a linemarking the median. The whiskers show the range of the data. Outliers are marked with circles.
Figure 4: For the solid line part, all the child models share one copy, while the dotted lines representthe part where each child model training independently. The accuracies are evaluated after eachmini-batch, and GT-Tau is calculated correspondingly.
Figure 5: The validation performance of all child models, evaluated after each of the last 128mini-batches. Each curve corresponds to one child model. Markers are marked on the child modeltrained in the current mini-batch. Lighter colors correspond to higher ground truth ranks. Thedifference between ordered and shuffled is “shuffled” generate a new order of child models every 64mini-batches. Each figure shows a window of 128 mini-batches. It’s clear that in Figure 5a a patternis repeated twice and the periodicity is 64 mini-batches.
Figure 6: Validation accuracy of a group with 4 child models. Markers are marked on child modelstrained in the current mini-batch.
Figure 7: Validation accuracy for all child models for each of the last 128 mini-batches of 2000epochs.
Figure 8: GT-Tau curves over last 128 mini-batches. Each color represents one instance.
Figure 9: Validation accuracy for all child models for each of the last 128 mini-batches, when SGDmomentum is set to 0.
