Figure 2: Match results against perfect player8Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 20204.2	Effect of noise added policies in master game treeIn the result of the previous experiment, the proposed method MbM showed good performance.
Figure 3: Comparison between modified version of MbMThe results in Fig. 3 show that MbM-NoNoise, which does not add noise, is even worse than AlphaZero. MbM-UniformRelaxation, which the fixed amount of diversity is added to the policy, was notso good as MbM but pretty better than Alpha Zero. This point will be discussed in the final section.
