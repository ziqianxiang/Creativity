Figure 1: The framework of the five featuretypes.
Figure 2: The memory state is decomposedinto short and long term components, and thenthe standard LSTM updates are performed.
Figure 3: Full wiring for the STLSTM cell. Thesparse feature update follows one of two possiblepaths dependent on the masking.
Figure 4: Static features are embedded andthen concatenated to RNN output.
Figure 5: Relative change in F1 score between STLSTM and TLSTM cell. For single sparse fea-tures, random sampling is first and group sampling second. Third is 2, 3, and 4 sparse features usinggroup sampling. Fourth is relative performance on different sparse subsets of features for the churndata set.
Figure 6: The creation of sequences from the electric power consumption dataset.
