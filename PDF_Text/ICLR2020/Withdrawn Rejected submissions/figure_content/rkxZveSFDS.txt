Figure 1: Left: Batch average infidelity with respect to ground truth state sampled at 15 randomlychosen times of quantum Hamiltonian evolution. We see the initial guess has a densely connectedtopology and the QGRNN learns the ring structure of the true Hamiltonian. Right: Ising Hamiltonianparameters (weights & biases) on a color scale.
Figure 2: Left: Stabilizer Hamiltonian expectation and fidelity over training iterations. A picture ofthe quantum network topology is inset. Right: Quantum phase kickback test on the learned GHZstate. We observe a 7x boost in Rabi oscillation frequency for a 7-node network, thus demonstratingwe have reached the Heisenberg limit of sensitivity for the quantum sensor network.
Figure 3: QSGCNN spectral clustering results for 5-qubit precision (top) with quartic double-wellpotential and 1-qubit precision (bottom) for different graphs. Weight values are represented as opacityof edges, output sampled node values as grayscale. Lower precision allows for more nodes in thesimulation of the quantum neural network. The graphs displayed are the most probable (populated)configurations, and to their right is the output probability distribution over potential energies. We seelower energies are most probable and that these configurations have node values clustered.
