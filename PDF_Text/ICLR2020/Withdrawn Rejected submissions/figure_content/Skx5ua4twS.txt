Figure 2:	UAS (a) and LAS (a) against the model size relative to the original full-sized model:BaseE, the baseline models of equivalent size to the distilled models; Distill, the distilled models;Base, the performance of the original full-sized model.
Figure 3:	Delta UAS and LAS for when comparing both the original base model and equivalent-sized base models for each treebank for two of our distilled models: (a) D-20, 20% of original modeland (b) D-80, 80% of original model.
