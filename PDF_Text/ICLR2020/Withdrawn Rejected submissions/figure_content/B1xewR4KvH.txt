Figure 1:	MORF outperforms other algorithms in three two-class classification settings. Upper row shows examples ofsimulated data from each setting and class. Lower row shows misclassification rate in each setting, tested on 10,000 testsamples. (A) Two segments in a discretized circle. Segment lengths vary by class. (B) Image setting with uniformlydistributed horizontal or vertical bars. (C) White noise (class 0) vs. exponentially decaying unit impulse plus whitenoise (class 1).
Figure 2:	Algorithm train times (above) and test times (below). MORF runtime is not particularly costly and well belowCNN runtime in most examples.
Figure 3: MORF improves classification accuracy over all other non-CNN algorithms for all sample sizes, especially insmall sample sizes.
Figure 4: Averages of images in the two classes and their difference (above). Feature importance from MORF (bottomright) shows less noise than SP ORF (bottom middle) and is smoother than RF (bottom left).
