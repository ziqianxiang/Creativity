Figure 1: Hyperspherical energy during training. All net-works are initialized with the same random weights, so thehyperpsherical energy is the same before the training starts.
Figure 2: Visualization of the first-layer filters in ResNet.
Figure 3: 2D CNN features with or without MHE on both training set and testing set. The features are computedby setting the output feature dimension as 2, similar to [34]. Each point denotes the 2D feature of a data point,and each color denotes a class. The red arrows are the classifier neurons of the output layer.
