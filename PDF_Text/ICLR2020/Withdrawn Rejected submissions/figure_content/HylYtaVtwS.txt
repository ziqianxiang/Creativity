Figure 1: Schematic illustration ofthe cache model (adapted from Orhan(2018)). The key for a new image x iscompared with the keys in the cache. Aprediction is made by a linear combina-tion of the values weighted by the simi-larity to the corresponding keys.
Figure 2: Top-1 accuracy of the ResNet-50 backbone and cache models in the (a) gray-box, (b)black-box and (c) white-box adversarial settings. The 0 perturbation size corresponds to the cleanimages. Note that the gray-box setting is meaningful for the cache models only and is not well-definedfor the backbone ResNet-50 model.
Figure 3: Similar to Figure 2, but with Shape-ResNet-50 as the backbone.
Figure 4: The effects of three cache design choices on the cleanand adversarial accuracy in the gray-box setting. The resultsshown here are for the layer4ä¸ŠOttleneck1_relu layer.
Figure 5: The effect of using Shape-ResNet-50 (shape) vs. ResNet-50 (texture) derived features inthe cache on clean and adversarial accuracies in the (a) gray-box, (b) black-box and (c) white-boxsettings. The results shown here are for the layer4_bottleneck1_relu layer.
