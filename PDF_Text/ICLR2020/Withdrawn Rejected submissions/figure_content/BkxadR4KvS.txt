Figure 2: Results of transferring policies learned on one task to the other task. Train reward whilelearning target set B (left) and target set A ∪ B (right) under three different regimes.
Figure 3: (Left) PWCCA analysis on the spatially disjoint target sets for SqueezeNet. (Right) Transferresults on the spatially disjoint split for SqueezeNet(left) imply that using the representation learned on A as a feature-extractor may provide an efficientmethod for learning new sets of target objects.
