Figure 1: Overview of the framwork of the current Relational reasoning networks based on graphnetworks.
Figure 2: RA-GCN network. The RA-GCN network performs visual reasoning by iterating throughseveral RA-GCN modules and concatenates all the global pooling information from each module asthe last vector feature for classification.
