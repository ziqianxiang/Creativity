Figure 1: TWo example use cases of interactive classification system: providing customer thebest trouble-shooting suggestion (left) and helping user identify bird species from text interactions(right). The top parts show example classification labels: FAQ documents or bird species, where theground truth label of each interaction example is shaded. The loWer parts shoW hoW a user interactwith the system typically. The user starts with an initial natural language query. At each step, thesystem asks a clarification question. The interaction ends when the system returns an output label.
