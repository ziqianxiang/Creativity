Figure 1: Comparison of running time on ARTIFICIAL dataset with different number oftraining samples (n = 1, 000/5, 000/10, 000/50, 000). The horizontal axis is the hash length(k = 2/4/8/16/32). The vertical axis is the running time (seconds) in log-scale. When n = 50, 000,the LIFTING algorithm didnâ€™t finish within 12 hours and its result is not reported.
