Figure 1: For a graph pair (G1, G2), previous works (Bai et al., 2019a; 2018; Li et al., 2019) focus onpredicting their graph-graph similarity score. In this work, we aim to find the Maximum CommonSubgraph (MCS) (circled in red), which requires fine-grained node-node correspondence prediction.
Figure 2: A detailed illustration of NeuralMCS using the example graph pair in Figure 1. Forthe input graph pair (G1, G2), the NEURALMCS first generates a matching matrix encoding thelikelihood of each pair of node being matched ((a) and (b)). The Guided Subgraph Extraction(GSE) process uses the matching matrix as follows: NeuralMCS selects the initial pair to beincluded in the predicted MCS, node 2 in G1 and node 6 in G2 ((b) and (c)). Next, NEURALMCSsets its search frontier as the neighbors of the selected nodes, circled in dashed blue lines. Byselecting the pair with the largest matching score which still preserves subgraph isomorphism, node3 in G1 and node 5 in G2, the extracted subgraphs in both graphs grow to size 2 ((d) and (e)). Theprocedure continues until a stopping condition is reached, which is detailed in Section 3.3.
