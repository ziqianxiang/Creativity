Figure 1: Forward transformation of the proposed GraphNVP. The original discrete A and X are firstdequantized into A0 and X0 . Layers of invertible couplings are applied to these dequantized tensors.
Figure 2: Masking schemes used in proposed affine coupling layers. Left: Adjacency couplinglayer: A single row of adjacency tensor is masked. Right: Node feature coupling layer: All channelsbelonging to a single node are masked.
Figure 3: Generative process of the proposed GraphNVP. We apply the inverse of the coupling layersin the reverse order, so that the dequantized inputs A and X are recovered. Additional quantizationreconstructs the original discrete graph, G = (A, X).
Figure 4: Visualization of the learned latent spaces along two randomly selected orthogonal axes.
Figure 5: Chemical property optimization. Given the left-most molecule, we interpolate its latentvector along the direction which maximizes its QED property. Upper: Molecule optimization forZINC. Lower: Molecule optimization for QM9.
Figure 6: Impact of temperature on the quality of graph generation. Sampling with a smallertemperature yields more valid molecules but with less diversity (uniqueness) among them. Eachexperiment is performed five times and the average is reported in this figure. Left panel: impact oftemperature on sampling from latent space of QM9. Right panel:Impact of temperature on samplingfrom latent space of ZINC.
Figure 7: Chemical property optimization. We select a molecule from QM9 dataset randomly andthen interpolate its latent vector along the axis which maximizes water-octanol partition coefficient(logP).
