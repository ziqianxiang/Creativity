Figure 1: Illustration of Iterated Local Searchframework. Given a local minimum S *, a per-turbation leads to a solution S0 . Then, a call ofa local search algorithm obtains a local minimumS0* which is potentially better than S*.
Figure 2: ILS-SUMM selection in Cosmos Laundromat movie from OSTD data set. The middleframe of shot is presented. A red circle denotes the shots that were chosen by ILS-SUMM algorithm.
Figure 3: Visualization of the features of the shots of ”Bearpark Climbing” video from SumMedataset. In each figure the features dimension were reduced to two dimensions using PCA. Figure(a) visualizes the color histogram features, and Figure (b) visualizes the deep features.
