Figure 1: Crane system. The long-term goal is to move the payload to the target location, (xd, yd) as soon aspossible. The short-term goal is to have zero sway at the destination, ωp =0.

Figure 3:	LLQL for MountainCarContinuous. The network’s parameters are presented in Section D.
Figure 4:	MountainCarContinuous with short-term and long-term goals. γ1 =1, γ2 = 2000.
Figure 5:	State variables for MountainCarContinuous with long-term goal and short-term constraint. Thehorizontal red lines, |vk | = 0.035, represent the boundaries. The car reaches the goal in 97 steps.
Figure 6:	Long-term performance vs short-term goals. We run the model with each short-term goal 10 timesand present the average and standard deviation of the long-term goal.
Figure 7: LLQL for the crane system.
Figure 8: State variables for the crane system with required short-term trajectory, ωpayload =0. Thefinal error is 0.0001. The crane reaches the goal in 12.5s. γ1 =1, γ2 = 1000.
