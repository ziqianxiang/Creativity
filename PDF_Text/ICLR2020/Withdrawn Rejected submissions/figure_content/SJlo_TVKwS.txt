Figure 1:	General frameworks of VAE and DAE for text modeling.
Figure 2:	Training dynamics of DAE, VAE, and the proposed Couple-VAE (λc = 10.0) on the Yelptest set. Please find the analysis in Section 3 and Section 5.5. Best viewed in color.
Figure 3:	A graphical overview of CoUPle-VAE. The upper path is deterministic and optimizedby the coupled reconstruction loss LCeC, and the lower path is the VAE model optimized by thereconstruction loss Le, the regularization loss Lreg, and the coupling loss Lcouple.
Figure 4: Training dynamiCs of DAE, VAE, and Couple-VAE (λc = 10.0). (a), (d), and (g) areIldLyee/∂e∣∣2 for DAE and VAE, and ||9(£也 + L黑”∂e∣b for CoUPle-VAE. (b), (e), (h) denote∣∣∂Lreg/de]]. (c), (f), (i) stand for ∣∣∂h∕∂e∣F / ∣∣h∣∣2. Best viewed in color.
