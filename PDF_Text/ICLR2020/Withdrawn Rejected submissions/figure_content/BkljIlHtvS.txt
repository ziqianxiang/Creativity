Figure 1: Meta learning results on two datasets: Synthetic binary classification (left) and Omniglot (right).
Figure 2: Layer-wise study of each layerâ€™s effect on adaptation, in the left and the middle plots. The rightmostplot shows that both C4 and FC have to work together to adapt. See texts for details.
Figure 3: The effect of the number of convolutional layers on adaptation performance. While the modelbecomes smaller, the performance drops. However, our approach degrades in a slower pace, as the adaptationis shared by both the model and the meta-optimizer, thus leaving more freedom for the model to represent thetasks.
