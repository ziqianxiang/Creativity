Figure 1: Main architecture describing semi-supervised approach with CutMix augmentation forsemantic segmentation. Two losses, consistency and structured consistency, are calculated fromprediction of teacher and student networks each.
Figure 2: Structured consistency loss calculation procedure is described visually. CutMix box sizeof 3 by 3 is used for simplicity. Note that the each pair of cosine similarity (asn , atn) with same colorare used to calculate the loss. (a) Masking the covered region (denoted as black box) by anotherCutMix box since it doesnâ€™t include uncovered box related information. (b) Random elimination ofcosine similarities when the number of similarities exceed Npair .

Figure 4: Qualitative results on the validation data of Cityscapes. From the left to the right areoriginal images, supervised-only, addition of consistency loss, addition of structured consistencyloss, and ground truth.
