Figure 1: Left: Input image; Middle: response after ReLU of first COnv-Iayer in ReSNet-50; Right: responseof first EVPCOnv-layer in EVPNet-50 (by replacing all k × k conv-layers in ResNet-50). Note multi-channelfeature maps are merged into one channel with per-pixel max-out operations for easy illustration. Clearly,ResNet-50 has more noise responses, while EVPNet-50 gives more responses on object boundary.
