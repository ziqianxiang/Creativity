Figure 1: The overview of our proposed AWGIM. The input task is 5-way 1-shot with X as supportset and X as one query example. Different colors of the data in support set indicate different cat-egories. The encoding process in contextual path produces context-aware support representationsXcp. Similarly, the attentive path enables the query sample X to be equipped with task knowl-edge. Both paths are achieved by attention mechanism. Xap is repeated to concatenate with Xcp.
