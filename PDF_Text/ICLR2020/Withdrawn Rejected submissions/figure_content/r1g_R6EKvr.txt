Figure 1: The minimum of attentionweight sum in LNAS and DNAS.
Figure 2: Center distance values after lower-normalized attention (LNAS, blue solid curve) anddoubly-normalized attention (DNAS, red dashed curve), as a function of cluster mass ratio r =N0/N1 with different a values (initial distance between centers is 2a).
Figure 3: The hybrid weight heavilyfavors DNAS for the VQA task.
Figure 4: The hybrid weight favorsDNAS in all layers of the encoder(u â‰¥ .5); LNAS gains more weightfor closer-to-output layers.
Figure 5: Mode-collapsing behavior on balanced mixture of Gaussian data: LNAS and DNAS behavesimilarly without mode collapsing after 4 steps.
Figure 6: Mode-Collapsing behavior on unbalanCed mixture of Gaussian data: LNAS Collapses toone Cluster after 4 steps, while DNAS maintains 2 Clusters.
