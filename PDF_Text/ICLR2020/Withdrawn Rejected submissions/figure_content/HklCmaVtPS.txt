Figure 1: The structure of the UW-Net. The bottom part is the output of the eighth layer in theI-A module. The red area represents a higher response of features for the underwater image clas-sification. As shown, our I-A module concerns more about the background regions of underwaterimages.
Figure 2: The structure of the UW-Net. After two I-A modules, one branch serves as an auxiliaryclassification branch and one branch serves as the backbone of the network. The final model hastwo outputs, in which the output of the auxiliary branch is used to compute the loss function.
