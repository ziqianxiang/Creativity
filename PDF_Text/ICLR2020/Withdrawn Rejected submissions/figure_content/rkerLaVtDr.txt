Figure 1: (a) Legend used in entire paper. (b) Joint error (area 2 and 5) is penalized such thatextractor must try to separate the overlap. (c) fT does not necessarily classify source samples.
Figure 2: (a) Failure due to improper constraint. (b) Proper constraint helps for huge domain shift.
Figure 3: (a) Comparisons for binary classification case. (b) Failure due to steep gradient nearby thedecision boundary.
Figure 4: (a) Sensitivity w.r.t. γ. (b)-(c) Comparisons for convergence rate. (d) Comparisons formarginal discrepancy.
Figure 5: (a) Comparisons for convergence rate. (b) Comparisons for marginal discrepancy. (c)Sensitivity w.r.t. γ. (d) Sensitivity w.r.t. η.
