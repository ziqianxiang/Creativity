Figure 1: Parallel Scheduled Sampling for K = 3 passes. On each pass, the model is conditionedon the previous pass’s output. New tokens are sampled according to the model’s logits, which arethen mixed with the gold sequence. After the final pass, the loss is calculated with respect to the goldtokens.
