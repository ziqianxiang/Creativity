Figure 1: The Vietoris-RiPs complex Re(X) of a point cloud X at different scales e0, eÎ¹, and e2.
Figure 2: Latent representations of the Spheres data set. Only our method is capable of representingthe complicated nesting relationship inherent to the data. TopoAE used a batch-size of 28. SeeFigure A.2 in the supplementary materials for an enlarged version.
Figure 3: Latent representations of the Fashion-MNIST (top row), MNIST (middle row),CIFAR-10 (bottom row) data sets. TopoAE batch-sizes (same data set order): (95, 126, 82). Pleaserefer to Figures A.3, A.4, and A.5 in the supplementary materials for enlarged versions.
