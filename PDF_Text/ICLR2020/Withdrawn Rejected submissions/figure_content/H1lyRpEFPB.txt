Figure 1: For each of3 distances of 0.1, 0.45, 0.80meters representing 3 difficulty tiers, we generate5 targets at that distance away from the initial end-effector position. We visualize the initial positionand example target joint configurations for each.
Figure 2: MBRL learning curves with learned dynamics models. Here, we plot the best reward foundso far averaged over 3 seeds. PETS takes much longer to reach convergence, so we additionally plotthe best reward over any trajectory seen by PETS over the full 300 episode training.
