Figure 1: Overall Model Architecture of Hierarchical Graph Matching Networks (HGMN)(V2, E2q is represented as a set of M nodes Vi P V2 with a feature matrix X2 P RM'd, edges(vi, Vjq P E2 (binary or weighted) formulating an adjacency matrix A2 P RMXM, and a degreematrix Dili “ Xj Aj. Note that, when performing graph-graph classification task the scalar y isthe class labels y “ t´1, 1u; when performing graph-graph regression task the scalar y is the themeasure of the similarity score y P r0, 1s. We train a graph matching model based on a set of trainingtriplet of structured input pairs and scalar output score (G1,G2,yi),..., (G^n, Gn, —) P G X G X Ydrawn from some fixed but unknown probability distribution in real applications.
Figure 2: (a) and (b) show the impact of the number of perspectives on classification performanceof FFmpeg and OpenSSL respectively.
