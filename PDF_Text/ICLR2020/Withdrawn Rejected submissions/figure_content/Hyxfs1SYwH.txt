Figure 1: A causal predictive model includes onlythe parents of Y (a) and (b). Panel (c) shows thegeneralization to a Markov Blanket.
Figure 2: Results for Child dataset with XrayReport as the output. ( a) is the target model accuracy. ( b) is theattack accuracy for different dataset sizes on which the target model is trained and ( c) is the attack accuracy fortest distribution with varying amount of noise for total dataset size of 100K samples.
Figure 3: (a)Target accuracy, (b) Attack accuracy, (c) Attack accuracy for true, learned causal model and DNN.
