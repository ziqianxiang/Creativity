Figure 1: Experimental Setup. The network is stimulated by gratings of varying spatial frequency.
Figure 2: Characterizing spatial frequency and orientation tuning in channels across different layersof the pre-trained VGG-16.
Figure 3: Two different feature maps may have different sensitivities to important visual frequencies.
Figure 4: Correlation of metric scores in Eq. 1 with human subjective DMOS for the'fire2_ReLU_exp2x2' layer of the 'SqueezeNet'. It can be seen that the metric in Eq. 1 with thechannel subset H-10 has a much better correlation with DMOS, compared to Eq. 1 with the L-10subset of channels.
Figure 5: Correlation of metric scores in Eq. 1 with human subjective DMOS shows that the metricin Eq. 1 with the channel subset H has a much better correlation with DMOS compared to Eq. 1with the L subset of channels. Each pair shown side by side is for a different network.
