Figure 1: Performance of widely used operators in NAS (c.f Table 1). (a): Latency and FLOPs onthree types of hardware: (1) DSP (HexagonTM 685 DSP), (2) CPU (Snapdragon 845 ARM CPU),(3) VPU (MovidiusTM MyriadTM X Vision Processing Unit). The input/output feature maps are allthe same, equal to 562 × 64. (b): Latency in different input feature map sizes on VPU.
Figure 2: Accuracy vs. supernet training reduced time of HURRICANE-iter1 by different t onOUI-Adience-Age for DSP. When t ≤ 8, HURRICANE-iter1 achieves a same level accuracy withMobileNetV2.
Figure 3: Operations in Section 3. SE* indicates the position to add SqueeZe-and-eXCitation block.
