Figure 1: Selected frames from videos generated by a DVD-GAN trained on Kinetics-600 at 256×256,128 × 128, and 64 × 64 resolutions (top to bottom).
Figure 2: Generated video samples with interesting behavior. In raster-scan order: a) On-screengenerated text with further lines appearing.. b) Zooming in on an object. C) Colored detail from a penbeing left on paper. d) A generated camera change and return.

Figure 4: Each row is the first frame of 15 videos from a random class, all from the same check-point. The classes are: cooking scallops, changing wheel (not on bike), calculating, dribblingbasketball.
Figure 5: All 48 frames (in raster-scan order) from a 64 × 64 sample from watermelon cutting class.
Figure 6: The effect of φ in DT (left two) and k in DS (right two). FID is similar for any choice of φ,while IS declines as downsampling increases. Increasing k improves both with diminishing returns.

Figure 17: An example intra-class interpolation. Each column is a separate video (the vertical axis isthe time dimension). The left and rightmost columns are randomly sampled latent vectors and aregenerated under a shared class. Columns in between represent videos generated under the same classacross the linear interpolation between the two random samples. Note the smooth transition betweenvideos at all six timesteps displayed here.
Figure 18: An example of class interpolation. As before, each column is a sequence of timesteps of asingle video. Here, we sample a single latent vector, and the left and rightmost columns representgenerating a video of that latent under two different classes. Columns in between represent videos ofthat same latent generated across an interpolation of the class embedding. Even though at no pointhas DVD-GAN been trained on data under an interpolated class, it nevertheless produces reasonablesamples.
