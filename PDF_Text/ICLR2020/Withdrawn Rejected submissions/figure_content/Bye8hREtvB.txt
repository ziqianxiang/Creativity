Figure 1: CelebA interpolation comparing PixelCNN activations (top row) versus Fisher scores (bottom row)as embedding spaces for autoregressive models1Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2020back from Fisher score space to natural images, we train a decoder by minimizing reconstructionerror. We show that interpolations in Fisher score space provide higher-level semantic meaningcompared to baselines such as interpolations in PixelCNN activation space, which produce blurryand incoherent intermediate interpolations similar in nature to interpolations using pixel values.
Figure 2: Comparison between between using network activations and Fisher scores as underlying embeddingspaces for reconstruction and interpolation. (a) and (b) show reconstructions, where for each image pair, theleft image is the true image, and the right image is the reconstruction. For (c) and (d), each row shows aninterpolation from one image in the MNIST dataset to another.
Figure 3: (a) shows reconstruction error on our decoder for different different combinations of density andprojection dimensions for sparse matrices. The top row is density, and the left column is projection dimension.
Figure 4: Comparison between using network activations and Fisher scores as underlying embedding spacesfor reconstruction and interpolation. (a) and (b) show reconstructions, where for each image pair, the left imageis the true image, and the right image is the reconstruction. For (c) and (d), each row shows an interpolationfrom one image in the CelebA dataset to another. The left-most and right-most of each row is the true imagepair from the dataset.
Figure 5: We compare semantic manipulation on glasses and smiling attributes for PixelCNN activation versusFisher score (ours) embedding spacesFigure 6: The top two rows show interpolation using Conv and RealNVP decoders respectively with Pix-elCNN activations as an embedding space. The bottom four rows show interpolations using Conv, WGAN,Pyramid PixelCNN, and RealNVP decoders with Fisher scores (our method) as an embedding space. We cansee that interpolations using our method are consistent across different decoders, which supports our claim thathigh-level semantic information is indeed stored in the Fisher scores, and not due to the decoder architecturesthemselvesa decoder to reconstruct images, interpolations do not begin and end with the true images of thedataset, and instead, are approximations constructed from the decoder. We see similar results an inour MNIST experiments. Reconstruction quality for activations is better than with Fisher scores.
