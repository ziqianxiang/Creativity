Figure 1: Construction of the TT-matrix from the standard embedding matrix. Blue color depictshow the single element in the initial matrix is transformed into the product of the highlighted vectorsand matrices in the TT-cores.
Figure 2: Distribution of matrix elements of the TT-matrix of shape (5, 5, 5, 5) × (5, 5, 5, 5) initializedby formula (2) with σ = 1. As the TT-rank increases, the resulting distribution approaches N(0, 1).
