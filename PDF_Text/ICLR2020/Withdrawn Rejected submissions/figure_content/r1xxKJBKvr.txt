Figure 1: PassNet architecture for a coarse soccer field representation of 104 Ã— 68 and 8 inputchannels.
Figure 2: In the left a calibration reliability plot, where for a series of 10 bins of equal sizes, the Xaxis presents the mean predicted value for samples in each bin, and the Y axis the fraction of samplesin each bin containing positive examples. On the right, a comparison of pass probability surfacesfrom Logistic Net, Dense2 Net and PassNet models, from top to bottom.
Figure 3: On the left column a 2D representation of the pass probability surface (top) and the passselection surface (bottom) for a given game situation. Yellow and blue circles represent locationsof players on the attacking and defending team, respectively, and the arrows represent the velocityvector for each player. The white circle represents the location of the ball. Pass selection likelihood isrepresented on logarithmic scale. The right-hand column presents a video capture from the associatedsoccer match with an overlay of the corresponding surface.
