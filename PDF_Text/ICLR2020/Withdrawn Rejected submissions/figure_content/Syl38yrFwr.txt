Figure 1: Overview of the proposed approach: firstly, the private data is partition to non-overlappingsplits to train the teacher models. To train the student model, the ensemble of teachers then aggregatetheir predictions on the queried example from student, followed by adding a large constant on thehighest counted class vote. The count vector then gets randomly perturbed with noise followed by anArgMax operation. Finally, the student model is trained by using the returned label from the teacherensemble.
Figure 2: (a) shows the trade-off between number of teachers and the performance of the teacherensemble; (b) shows the percentage of qualified sample which satisfy the distance-n in whole datasetwhen using 250 teachers; (c) shows the percentage of distance-2 qualified samples over the dataset.
