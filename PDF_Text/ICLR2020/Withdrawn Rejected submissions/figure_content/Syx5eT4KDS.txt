Figure 1: A graphical overview of Discrete InfoMax COdes (DIMCO). A dataset D consists ofpairs of images X and labels Y . DIMCO is a stochastic encoder that maps each image X to adistribution of discrete codes P(X|X). Each discrete code X ã€œP(X|X) is a P-Way code of length d.
Figure 2: Left: Pairwise correlation between MI = I (X; X) and previous metrics. Right: Visualiza-tion of codes of a small trained DIMCO model (d = 16, p = 64); we show the top 10 test set imagesthat assign highest probability to a specific code, for 4 different codes.
Figure 3: Image retrieval performance of DIMCO and N-pair loss on the CUB-200 dataset. They-axis for both figures are the Recall@1 metric, and error bars reflect standard deviation computedfrom n = 5 runs per configuration. The x-axes represent (left) bits required to store one representationand (right) seconds required to perform retrieval for one query. Both x-axes are log-scale.
Figure 4: Performance of methods trained using subsets of miniImageNet of varying size. Thelowermost y axis value for each metric corresponds to the expected performance of random guessing.
Figure 5: Correlation between few-shot accuracy and retrieval measures.
Figure 6: Additional visualizations of codes.
