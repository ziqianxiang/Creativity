Figure 1: Temperature Scaling exhibits system-atic bias. On CIFAR10 data, systematic bias wasquantified by the Jensen-Shannon divergence be-tween the true class label proportions and the aver-age class predictions on a held-out test set drawnfrom the same distribution as the dataset used forcalibration. TS: Temperature Scaling, NBVS: No-Bias Vector Scaling, BCTS: Bias-Corrected Tem-perature Scaling, VS: Vector Scaling. BCTS andVS had significantly lower systematic bias com-pared to TS and NBVS. Results are averaged overmultiple models and dataset samples (Sec. 4.1).
