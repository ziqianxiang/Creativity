Figure 1: Gridworld environments. S denotes initial states. G denotes goals with +100 reward.
Figure 2: (a) Plots of entropies during a sample episode in Breakout. The x-axis represents episodesteps. The y-axis represents negative entropies of the weights. (b) Bar graphs next to the gameframes show the corresponding weights with the Q-function index on the x-axis. White arrows onthe game frames show the ball positions and past trajectory.
Figure 3: Plots of the number of observations with a certain entropy through 100K evaluation steps(TDW Average policy). x-axis represents entropy values with 20 bins. y-axis represents correspond-ing numbers in log scale.
Figure 4: Learned table-based Q values at Two-slit Grid World. Each cell corresponds to state s,and its color represents a value of maxa Q(s, a).
Figure 5: Learned table-based Q values at Four-slit Grid World. Each cell corresponds to state s,and its color represents a value of maxa Q(s, a).
