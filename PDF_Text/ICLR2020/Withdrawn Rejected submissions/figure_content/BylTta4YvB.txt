Figure 1: Estimating the distance be-tween two standard 2-dimensional Gaus-sian distributions that have been shiftedby ±[1, 1].
Figure 2: Approximating the minibatch-wise distances while training a generator. Left: generatedfaces after 5 × 104 generator iterations. Right: True and estimated log-distances between sampledbatches. The large values of GP and WC can be attributed to the fact that they are susceptible tofailure in enforcing the Lipschitz constraints on the discriminator.
Figure 3: Stability. While training the discriminators on minibatches, taken from two measuresconsisting of 512 samples from CIFAR10, we also report the estimated distance between the fullmeasures.
Figure 4: Repeating the experiment presented in Fig. 2, but with the simpler MLP architecture forthe discriminator. Presented here are the estimated batchwise distances at each iteration against theground truth.
Figure 5: Repeating the experiment presented in Fig. 2, but with the simpler MLP architecture forthe discriminator. Presented here are generated samples after 5 × 104 iterations.
