Figure 1: Fig. (a) shows the frequency histogram of the calculated uncertainties against the errormagnitude (kcal/mol) for the FreeSolv hydration energy dataset ([12]). Fig. (b) shows a similar plotfor the experimental uncertainties.

Figure 3: Toy 1D Problem. The toy objective in a) is corrupted with heteroscedastic noise accordingto the function in b). The combined objective, which when optimised maximises the sin wave subjectto the minimisation of aleatoric noise, is given in c) and is obtained by subtracting the noise functionfrom the 1D sinusoid.
Figure 4: Toy 2D Problem. The Branin-Hoo objective function in a) is corrupted by the heteroscedasticnoise function in b) s(x1, x2) = 1.4x12 + 0.3x2. The black-box objective function c) is obtained bysumming the functions in a) and b). The sum is required to penalise regions of large aleatoric noisebecause the objective is being minimised.
Figure 5: Results of heteroscedastic and homoscedastic Bayesian Optimisation on the 3 robustnessproblems considered. Error bars are computed using 10 random initialisations. The first problem is amaximisation problem whereas the second and third are minimisation problems.
Figure 6: Results of heteroscedastic and homoscedastic Bayesian Optimisation on the sin and Branintoy problems where antifragility to aleatoric uncertainty is desirable. Error bars are computed using10 random initialisations. The first problem is a maximisation problem whereas the second is aminimisation problem. Heteroscedastic AEI in this instance is the AAEI acquisition function.
