Figure 1: Three-dimensional representations of test-set MNIST images generated by the restrictedmultiset model trained on multisets of sizes ∈ [2, 5]; the model is trained on images of zeros, ones,twos.
Figure 2: Three-dimensional rePresentations of test-set MNIST images generated by the restrictedmultiset model trained on multisets of sizes ∈ [2, 5]. Note that in (b) the rePresentations of twos andthrees are essentially inseParable.
Figure 3: Three-dimensional representations of test-set MNIST images generated by the unrestrictedmultiset model trained on multisets of sizes ∈ [2, 5]. Note that in (c), the clusters essentially form atetrahedron, with one of the vertices being the combination of twos and threes.
Figure 4: Two dimensional TSNE (van der Maaten and Hinton, 2008) “projections” of the ten-dimensional representations of test-set MNIST images generated by the models; the models weretrained on multisets of sizes ∈ [2, 5].
