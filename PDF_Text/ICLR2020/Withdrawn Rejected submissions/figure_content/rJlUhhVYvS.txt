Figure 1: Examples of distributions of orbit sizes without considering labels.
Figure 2: Examples of distributions of orbit sizes with node labels.
Figure 3: Distribution of orbits sizes. wo-labels correspond to isomorphism without considering thelabels. node-labels correspond to isomorphism that considers node labels. Part-1.
