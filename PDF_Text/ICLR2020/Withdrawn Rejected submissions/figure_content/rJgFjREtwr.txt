Figure 1: (a) An example of the comparison of the expected saliency map (the last one) to others. (b) Anexample of right-skewed distributions. (c) The illustration of the benefits of using right-skewed distributionsfor explanation. (d) The framework of our mask predictor, where a distribution controller is introduced rightafter the mask generator. In particular, pdf stands for the probability density function.
