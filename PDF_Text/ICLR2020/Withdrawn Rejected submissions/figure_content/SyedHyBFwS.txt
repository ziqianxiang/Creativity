Figure 1: Marginal distribution of absolute and relative (to the left pixel) pixel intensities in thetraining set of CIFAR-10.
Figure 2: Illustration of the copy and adjustment mechanism. The copy mechanism selects apreviously generated pixel and the adjustment mechanism modifies the pixel to generate the nextpixel.
Figure 3: 32×32 images generated by our model on CIFAR-10. Columns correspond to the input ofthe model, the sample obtained from the model, the sampled latent variables and the reference. Threecolors are used for the latent variables: White → absolute predictor; Blue → relative predictor fromthe left pixel and Green → relative predictor from the top pixel.
Figure 4: Effects of the pruning threshold when both absolute and relative predictors are used. TheX-axis denotes the percentage of values that kept in the relative predictor’s softmax.
Figure 5: Effects of changing the number of parameters in the model using the absolute (red line)and relative predictors (blue line). The x-axis denotes the fraction of the parameters used in thehidden layers, and the y-axis reports the log-likelihood obtained on the CIFAR-10 validation set forunconditional image generation.
Figure 6: Predictor usage in different setups for colorization in CIFAR-10. Each bar denotes thepercentage of usages after sampling once for each image in the validation set.
Figure 7: 32×32 images generated by models trained on CIFAR-10 with using the absolute predictor(Column “Absolute”), a relative predictor that always copies from the left pixel (Column “Left PixelOnly”) and the combination of the absolute predictor and a relative predictor that copies from the topand left pixels (Column “Absolute+Relative”).
