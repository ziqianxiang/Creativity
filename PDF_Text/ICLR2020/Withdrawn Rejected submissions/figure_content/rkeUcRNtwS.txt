Figure 1: Salient explanation. As the value of decreases, the heat map concentrates more and moreon the most discriminative part of the relevant objects, the birdâ€™s face in this case. The salient expla-nation is very important for a variety of tasks such as the fine-grained classification and biomarkerdiscovery in medical image. Note that the salient explanation is possible due to our idea of adoptingGaussian mask.

Figure 3: Framework of RGLAS. The GLAS instances are repeated until all discriminative patternsrelated to a given class have been dis-covered.
Figure 4: Visual comparison with the existing models. From top to bottom: red-winged blackbird,Northern flicker, European goldfinch, and crested auklet. We introduce the uniform characteristicsof each bird: first row (red wings), second row (red below the eyes and black spots on the body),third row (red face and yellow on the wings), and fourth row (orange beak).

Figure 6: Visual comparisons of GLAS, RISE, and Deconvaccording to their parameters controlling the locality. Theexample is the Eu-ropean goldfinch characterized by redface and yellow spot on the wings. GLAS adjusts the stan-dard deviation. Deconv adjusts the occlusion mask size. TheRISE adjusts the size of the initial mask.

The first rowsillustrate a brain template image overlapped with important biomarkers (rank 1 of Table 1: red, rank2: green, rank 3: blue, rank 4: yellow, rank 5: purple). The second rows show AAL wise saliencymap.
