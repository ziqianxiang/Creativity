Figure 1: Comparing MI Estimation performance of DEMINE and Meta-DEMINE with the KSGestimator Kraskov et al. (2004) and MINE-f Belghazi et al. (2018) on different datasets using varyingnumber of samples. The bars show estimator mean and standard deviation averaged over 5 runswith different seeds. The error bars show 95% confidence interval (not available for MI-KSG). Thestatistical significance focused variants DEMINE-sig and Meta-DEMINE-sig achieves the highest95% confident MI estimation. Meta-DEMINE improves over DEMINE most of the time.
Figure 2: To study the effect of task augmentation and number of adaptation steps, we run Meta-DEMINE-vr with different task augmentation modes and vary number of adaptation iterationsNO ∈ {0, 10, 20} on Gaussian 20D, ρ = 0.3 dataset. Combinations of permutation and mirror-ing operations are effective in reducing overfitting and improving performance.
