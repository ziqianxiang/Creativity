Figure 1: Results on the toy binary classification task. The top and bottom rows correspond to thepredictions on the test and unlabeled data respectively. Points in green and pink are labeled trainingsamples. Best seen in color.
Figure 2: Illustration of the meta update,s effect on facial landmarks detection. Cyan curves are theloss of the model after the meta update while orange curves are the model,s loss before the metaupdate. Best seen in color.
