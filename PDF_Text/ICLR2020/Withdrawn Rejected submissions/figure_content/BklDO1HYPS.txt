Figure 1:	Comparison of experimental results of different algorithms for Lasso (top) and Elastic-Net(bottom) problems on different data sets. The y-axis represents the gap between the objective valueand the minimum, and the x-axis corresponds to running time.
Figure 2:	Comparison of experimental results of different algorithms for Lasso (the first tWocolumns) and Elastic-Net (the latter tWo columns) problems on different data sets. The y-axis repre-sents the gap of objective value, and the x-axis corresponds to the number of effective passes (top)or running time (bottom).
Figure 3:	Comparison of experimental results about different choices of K in AVR-SExtraGD forLasso on different data sets. The y-axis represents the gap of objective value, and the x-axis corre-sponds to the number of effective passes ((a.1) and (b.1)) or running time ((a.2) and (b.2)).
Figure 4:	Comparison of experimental results of different algorithms for Lasso on different datasets. The y-axis represents the gap between the objective value and the minimum, and the x-axiscorresponds to the number of effective passes (top) or running time (bottom).
Figure 5:	Comparison of experimental results of different algorithms for the 'Î¹-norm regularizedlogistic regression problem. on different data sets. The y-axis represents the gap between the objec-tive value and the minimum, and the x-axis corresponds to the number of effective passes (top) orrunning time (bottom).
