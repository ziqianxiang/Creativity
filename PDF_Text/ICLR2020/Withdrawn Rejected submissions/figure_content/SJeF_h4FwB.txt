Figure 1: The overview of our method.
Figure 2: An illustration of the label correction algorithm. ∆ is set to 1. (a): a corrupted sampleand its corresponding classifier prediction f . (b): after correction, the labels are consistent with thetrue conditional probability, η. (c): likelihood ratio for ye = 1. Data with x < 0 are corrected toηenew = 0 as LR(x) are below ∆ = 1. (d): likelihood ratio for ye = 0. Data with x > 0 are correctedto ηenew = 1 as LR(x) are below ∆ = 1.
Figure 3: Convergence curves for CIFAR10 with uniform 0.4 noisy level. Left: AdaCorr - trainingaccuracy evaluated against the corrected label (ynew), testing accuracy against clean label. Right:Standard - training accuracy against noisy label (ye) and testing accuracy against clean label.
