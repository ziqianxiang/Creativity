Figure 1: A Fair Region in memory M consists of the most similar keys to h given a uniformdistribution over genders (e.g., 1: male, and 2: female). The input consists of a sequence tokensannotated with gender information, e.g., (The, 0), (president, 0), (gave, 0), (her, 2), (speech, 0).
Figure 2: Architecture of the neural dialogue model that incorporates the memory approach discussedin Section 1. The figure shows the ith decoding step of the word y^i given the sparse update within aFair Region centered at hdeco .
