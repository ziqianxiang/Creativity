Figure 1: Motivational example: (a) affinity graph of 6 images from CIFAR-10, the objective is to cluster theseimages into two clusters. (b) CNC model is trained to minimize expected normalized cuts in an unsupervisedmanner without the need for any labeled data. For each data point, our model directly outputs the probabilitiesof it belonging to each of the clusters. (c) The CNC loss converges to the optimal normalized cuts value. InAlgorithm 1 we show how we can scale this approach through a batch processing technique to large datasets.
Figure 4: Reuters: CNC is trainedby fixing some parameters and vary-ing others. With lr = 5e — 4, b =128,k = 3: ACC is 0.821 ±4e — 3.
Figure 2:	Normalized cuts(right axis) and clustering ac-curacy (left axis) are anti-correlated. Lower normalizedcuts results in better accuracy.
Figure 3:	Reuters: with only 10%training data the ACC and NMI ofCNC are only 14% and 18% lowerthan ACC and NMI with 90% train-ing data.
