Figure 1: Diagram of search space of CNAS. (a) Shape of search space. We usually set N = 6.
Figure 2: Results of sparse models. (a) Correlation between the one-shot and the final sparse modelin terms of test error. (b) Comparison among no-pruning, randomly pruning, and our pruning (allhave the same number of parameters of 0.15 M).
Figure 3: Test error of CNAS with different settings. (a) Varying the number of nodes per cell. Thenumber of parameters of all models is 1.1 M regardless of the number of nodes. (b) Varying thenumber of operations per node. The number of parameters of all models is 0.15 M regardless of thenumber of operations.
Figure 4: Diagram of DenseNet-like search space for CNAS. The meaning of boxes and edges is thesame in Figure 1.
