Figure 1: The convergence path for the solution of the quadratic problem in 1.1. The blue pointsrepresent the ascent step and the red the descent step. Note the circular path the algorithm takes forconvergence. This path is typical when solving a saddle point problem using an a/descent method.
Figure 2: Template points drawn from a Gaussian random distribution (blue) are transformed usinga simple ResNet to generate new reference points (red). There is no correspondence between thered/blue points. The goal of the training is to recover a transformation that move the blue points intothe red ones without known correspondence.
Figure 3: Path of the optimization. Top two panels: The template points are transformed into thereference space using our approach in 8 epochs. The density estimated from the red points is displayedin colour. The bottom panel is the path of optimization taken by the GAN training. It takes more than8000 epochs and the results are clearly not worse.
Figure 4: Convergence path of our method. Note the jumps in misfit when we change Ïƒ .
