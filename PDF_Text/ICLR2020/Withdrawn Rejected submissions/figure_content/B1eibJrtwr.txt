Figure 1: SPNet overview. The blue and yellow box is the user and system encoder respectively. Theencoders take the delexicalized conversation as input. The slots values are aligned with their slotsposition. Pointing mechanism merges attention distribution and vocabulary distribution to obtainthe final distribution. We then fill the slots values into the slot tokens to convert the template to acomplete summary. SPNet also performs domain classification to improve encoder representation.
