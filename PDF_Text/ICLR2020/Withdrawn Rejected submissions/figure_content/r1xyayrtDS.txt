Figure 1: Measuring estimation bias in the Q-value estimates of DDPG, CDQ and Balanced ClippedDouble Q-learning (BCDQ) on three different OpenAI gym environments. The first row shows theestimates of DDPG and CDQ and it can be seen that DDPG leads to an overestimation bias, whileCDQ leads to an underestimation bias. In the second row the value estimates of BCDQ are shown.
Figure 2: The plots show the average over 10 runs of the weighting parameter β for three OpenAIgym environments.
Figure 3:	Learning curves for six different continuous control tasks from OpenAi gym. The shadedarea represents half a standard deviation over the 10 trials (5 for Humanoid-v3). For readability thecurves showing the mean are filtered with a uniform filter of size 15.
Figure 4:	Learning curves for four different continuous control tasks from OpenAi gym over 10random seeds each. The show algorithms are BTD3 and versions of it with a fixed value of β. Foreach algorithm the curves show the mean over 10 runs with different random seeds and are filteredwith a uniform filter of size 15.
