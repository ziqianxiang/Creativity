Figure 1: Schematic for the network architecture for the turbulent flow superresolution task. Thenetwork is a modified GauGAN (?) architecture for 3D fields that utilizes spatially-adaptive nor-malization for conditioning with the input, and residual blocks for facilitating gradient flows. Thenetwork inputs a low resolution flow field in R32×32×32 and outputs an output field of R128×128×128with an upscaling factor of 4 in each dimension.
Figure 2:	Comparison of computational performance for direct solve using Lagrangian multipliermethod and our PDE Layer (PDEL). Computational performance for a single Conv3d layer of kernelsize 3 is also included for comparison purposes. Our PDEL fairs well with respect to size of thelinear system, even compared with the highly optimized 3D convolution layers, allowing for its directintegration into CNN architectures. Direct solve leads to memory overflow at very small outputresolutions (243). Above computation benchmarks performed on a 2.4 GHz CPU chip.
Figure 3:	Probability Density Function plots of samples generated by various models as well asground truth distributions (highlighted in red). The quality of the distributions compared against theground truth distributions are captured well by the KS statistic and mean difference measurementsin Tab. 1. (d) Shows the spectrum, where all methods trail the data distribution well in the lowwavenumber regime and deviate at higher wavenumbers.
Figure 4: Visualizations for low resolution inputs from the test set, predictions by various models, aswell as ground truth flow fields. The flow fields are colored by mapping the three velocity componentsto RGB channels respectively. The 2d images are slice plots in the z dimension.
