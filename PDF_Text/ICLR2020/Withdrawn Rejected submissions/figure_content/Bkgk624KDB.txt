Figure 1:	Results for the Learning to Rank task. (Left) Learning curve on the MSLR-10K dataset:x-axis shows the number of queries observed, and y-axis shows the progressive reward. (Right)Win/Loss counts for all pairs of algorithms over 16 random shuffles for the MSLR-10K dataset.
Figure 2:	Behavior of MELEE in comparison to baseline and state-of-the-art exploration algorithms.
Figure 3:	Win/Loss counts for all pairs of algorithms (columns match the rows).
Figure 4:	Scatterplots comparing MELEE to the best baseline and to a variant with fewer features.
