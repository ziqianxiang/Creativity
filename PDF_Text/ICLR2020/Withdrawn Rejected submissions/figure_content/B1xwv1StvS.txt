Figure 1: Dissimilarity Network architectureThe Dissimilarity Network computes prototypes that are dissimilar to one another, in the sense thatthe components of the class prototypes are orthogonal to the direction of the weighted average ofclosely-related classes. This lifts the burden of the classifier as the classes are more easily distin-guishable - since What remains are their differences. The model works by iteratively enhancingthe representation of the prototypes through a set of learned transformations (embedding functions).
Figure 2: Illustration on construction of harder dataset. The base dataset uses the superclass taxon-omy (e.g., cat, dog, and bird) instead its subclass (e.g., siamese, boxer, and owl).
