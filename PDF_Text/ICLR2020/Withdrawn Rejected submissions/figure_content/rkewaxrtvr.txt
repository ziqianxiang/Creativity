Figure 1: Our proposed method: (a) Schematic illustration of the general idea: Here we havetwo private information attributes (red and blue) and two public information attributes (circle andcross). The dashed line is a classifier trained in public information only. Our method, in solid line,both learns to classify the public information and preserve private information. (b) Our proposedarchitecture: the architecture is based on three sub-networks: one going from input to representation,one from representation to predicted regular labels, and one from representation to predicted privatelabels.
Figure 2: Confusion accuracy of different approaches. Blue indicates supervised approach, red semi-supervised. Solid line is the accuracy on ID classification, dashed average accuracy on attributes.
