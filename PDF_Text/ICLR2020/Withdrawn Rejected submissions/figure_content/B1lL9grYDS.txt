Figure 1: Illustration of initialization error,local training error and local-global error.
Figure 2: Accuracy on test data of CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST with imbalanced and balanceddata partitions.
Figure 3: Test accuracy and loss with different proportion of stale workers on CIFAR-10 dataset in1,000 communication rounds. We respectively test the performance with 20%, 60%, 80%, and 90%of stale workers. The green dotted line is FedAvg which waits all selected workers.
Figure 4: Impact visualization of different levels of staleness using cosine angles between the updateterms defined in section 2 of fresh nodes (40 out of 100) and stale nodes (60 out of 100 worker nodes)on CIFAR-10 at different communication round. The blue numbers represent the staleness levels byusing the differences of version numbers of models between the stale nodes and the fresh nodes.
