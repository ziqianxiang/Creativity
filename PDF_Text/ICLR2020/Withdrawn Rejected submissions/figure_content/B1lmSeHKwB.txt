Figure 1: The overall workflow of the SZSL classifier and architecture of the proposed MLP. Layers #1 and #2provide the nonlinear embedding gw (.) to map visual features to attribute space and their weights Wι, W2 arelearned by SGD. The output layer with non-trainable weights A, basically calculates dot-products of semanticrepresentation of the input and all class attributes simultaneously. Soft-labels are also shown for a sample imagefrom squirrel class.
Figure 2:	Plots of seen (AS), unseen (AU) and harmonic average (AH) accuracies versus total probability (q)assigned to unseen classes are shown for all five ZSL datasets. The maximum obtained harmonic accuracy isalso marked by (×).
Figure 3:	The impact of temperature parameter τ for AwA dataset. (a) unseen soft labels (before multiplying q)produced by temperature Softmax Equation (1) for various τ , (b) accuracies versus τ for proposed Z-SoftmaxDU classifier.
