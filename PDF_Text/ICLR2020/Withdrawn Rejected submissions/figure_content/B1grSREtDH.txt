Figure 1: An overview of Bayesian Residual Policy Optimization. (a) Cheese location is unknownand expert proposals disagree about which direction to move in. (b) The Bayesian residual policylearns to smell for cheese, reducing uncertainty. (c) The experts, recommendation guides the agentto the cheese! BRPO balances exploration (Bayesian residual policy) with exploitation (expertrecommendations).
