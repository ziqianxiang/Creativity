Figure 1: (Left) The supervised learning model and augmented model respectively where w is ex-pressed as a sum of independent auxiliary variables. (Right) Illustration of the refining algorithm.
Figure 3: A simple multi-modal example demonstrating how our method can capture a more com-plex distribution by refining a simple mean-field posterior. In (a) the true posterior is too com-plex to be well approximated by a Gaussian. (b) The Gaussian approximate posterior after opti-mizing the ELBO (ELBO = -1.79). (c) After sampling a1, we optimize the conditional ELBOw.r.t. φι∣aι. Wm is drawn from qg.ai(w). (d) Samples from the refined posterior approximation.
