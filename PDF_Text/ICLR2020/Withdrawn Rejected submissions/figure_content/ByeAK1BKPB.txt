Given theComPlEx decomposition X = Re([U,V,U]), a low-rank decomposition of the entity factor U as∙-vPU leads to the model PComplEx we use in the experiments of Section 7:(PCOMPLEX) Xijk = hPui,Vj,PUki=hui, P>Diag(Vj)P, Ui, ui,wk ∈ Cd,vj ∈ CD, fixed P ∈ RD×dPComplEx is similar to ComplEx but with interactions described by full matrices of rank D thatshare a same basis. We learn this decomposition with Algorithms 1 and 4.
