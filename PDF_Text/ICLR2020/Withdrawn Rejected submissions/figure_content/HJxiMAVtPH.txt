Figure 1: Phenomena affecting and inspiring the design of the multi-scale attributed network embed-ding procedure. In Figure 1a attributed nodes D and G have the same feature set and their nearestneighbours also exhibit equivalent sets of features, whereas features at higher order neighbourhoodsdiffer. Figure 1b shows that as the order of neighbourhoods considered (r) increases, the productof the adjacency matrix power and the feature matrix becomes less sparse. This suggests that animplicit decomposition method would be computationally beneficial.
