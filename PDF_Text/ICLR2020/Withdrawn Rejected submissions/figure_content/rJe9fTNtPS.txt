Figure 1: A toy example of existing works and our design goal with k = 5. The hash valuesof elements at the bottom are MinHash values.
Figure 2: A toy example of AHash with k = 5.
Figure 3: Average MSE in Jaccard Similarity estimation with varing the number of MinHashvalues (k). Results are averaged over 2000 repetitions.
Figure 4: SVM test accuracy. We set k as 150 and apply the b-bit hash with b as 8.
Figure 5: FI-SCOre of fast near neighbour search. We set k as 10 and apply the b-bit hashwith b as 32. Results are averaged over 2000 queries.
