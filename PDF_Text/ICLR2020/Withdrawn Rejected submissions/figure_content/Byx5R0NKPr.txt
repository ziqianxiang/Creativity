Figure 1: Basketball trajectories from policies that are: (a) the expert; (b) calibrated to move at lowspeeds; (c) calibrated to terminate near the basket (within green boundary); and (d) calibrated forboth (b) & (c) simultaneously. Diamonds () and dots (â€¢) indicate initial and final positions.

Figure 5: Histogram of basketball labeling functions applied on the training set (before applyingthresholds). Basketball trajectories are collected from tracking real players in the NBA.
Figure 6: Histogram of Cheetah labeling functions applied on the training set (before applyingthresholds). Note that SPEED is the most diverse behavior because we pre-trained the policies toachieve various speeds when collecting demonstrations, similar to (Wang et al., 2017). For morediversity with respect to other behaviors, we can also incorporate a target behavior as part of thereward when pre-training Cheetah policies.
