Figure 1: Three adjacency matrices of graphs generated by the Barabasi-Albert model with m =m0 = 0.1n. A black dot at location (i, j) denotes an edge from node i to node j. The sequence ofmatrices converges to its limit, the graphon, as n → ∞.
Figure 2: Graphons for common random graph models. Different shades denote different proba-bilities (e.g., P and 1 - p). The ErdoS-Renyi model has two parameters: number of nodes n andprobability p. The Watts-Strogatz (WS) model has three parameters: number of nodes n, replace-ment probability p, and initial neighborhood width k . Technically, the WS model has a constantnumber of edges, violating exchangeability for random graphs; graphs sampled from (b) convergesin probability to the same number of edges as n increases.
Figure 3: The intuition on the search for the optimal graphon. When searching in the space ofadjacency matrices, we only can only move on the 0-1 lattice. The optimal graphon, denoted by thefilled black dot, is estimated by taking the average of the states visited by SGD.
