Figure 2: Comparison between PPO and TPO training curves. Each data point represents the average return of the last 100 trainingepisodes. MCTS rollout starts after 50% of the total number of timesteps, i.e. ∼2M.
Figure 3: TPO training curves when the switching ratio (ρ in Algorithm 1) is 10%, 50% (default value in TPO), and 90%.
Figure 4: TPO training curves with varying the number of actions per node.
Figure 5: TPO training curves with varying number of MCTS simulations.
