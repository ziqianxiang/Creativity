Figure 1: Histograms of LL (left) and B^VAE-ESSθφ (right) on FashionMNIST (in-distribution) andMNIST (out-of-distribution). The ESS score separates the data more clearly than the LL score.
Figure 2: (Left) Precision-recall curves (treating OoD data as the upper class) and (right) ROCcurves of all methods on the FashionMNIST vs. MNIST benchmark.
Figure 3: (Left) Precision-recall curves (treating OoD data as the upper class) and (right) ROCcurves of all methods on the FashionMNIST based latent space OoD detection benchmark.
Figure 4: Histograms of LL (left) and BVAE-ESS (right) on SVHN (in-distribution) and CIFAR10(out-of-distribution). The ESS score separates the data more clearly than the LL score.
Figure 5: (Left) Precision-recall curves (treating OoD data as the upper class) and (right) ROCcurves of all methods on the SVHN vs. CIFAR10 benchmark.
Figure 6: (Left) Precision-recall curves and (right) ROC curves of all methods on the FashionMNIST(held-out classes) benchmark with classes 0 and 1 held-out.
Figure 7:	(Left) Precision-recall curves and (right) ROC curves of all methods on the FashionMNIST(held-out classes) benchmark with classes 2 and 3 held-out.
