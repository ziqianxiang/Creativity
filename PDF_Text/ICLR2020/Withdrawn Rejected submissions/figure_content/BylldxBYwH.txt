Figure 1: Our architecture for fluid data inpainting consists of a velocity branch using Dense Blocksand a stream function branch to predict incompressible velocities. Our method supports differentocclusion and obstacle masks to mimic different real-world settings.
Figure 2: Mean Absolute Error of different model configurations at each mask occlusion level.
Figure 3: Inpainted flow fields with different masked inputs and obstacle configurations. From leftto right: masked velocity input , output from configuration (a), output velocity from configuration(b), output from configuration (c), ground truth. All the masks used on the examples above have anapproximate occlusion rate of 52%.
Figure 4: Examples of predictions on Simple Plume dataset. From left to right of each example:masked velocity input, output from configuration (a), ground truth velocity.
Figure 5: Examples of predictions on Wind Tunnel Dataset. From left to right of each example:masked velocity input, output from configuration (a), ground truth velocity.
Figure 6: Comparison of model configuration (a) with image inpainting model Liu et al. (2018).
