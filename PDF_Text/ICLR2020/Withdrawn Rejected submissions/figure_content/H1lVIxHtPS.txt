Figure 1: SARNet consists of a thought unit, question unit, memory unit and action unit. The thoughtunit operates over the current observation, to represent the information for the communication andaction step.  The question unit attends to the information from communicating agents, representingthe importance of each neighboring agentâ€™s information. The memory unit, guided by the QuestionUnit, performs a reasoning operation to extract relevant information from communicated informa-tion, which is then integrated into memory.  The Action Unit, processes the information from thememory and the observation encoding to predict an action for the current time-step.

Figure 3:  Visualizing attention predicted by agent i over all agents during the initial stages of thetask.  We observe that agents learn to devalue their own information if it is more advantageous toplace importance on information from other agents when reading and writing to the memory unit.
