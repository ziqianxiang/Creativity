Figure 3:  Comparison of provable adversarial risk for conventional CNN versus OVANettrained with Lipschitz penalty regularization over a range of model sizes.  The lâ‚‚ Lipschitzconstant  is  used  for  regularisation  and  computing  the  bound.   OVANet  shows  superiorprovable robustness, especially at larger model sizes.
