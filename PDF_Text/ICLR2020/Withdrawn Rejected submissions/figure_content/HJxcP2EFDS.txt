Figure 1: Proposed Framework for Amharic Sentiment ClassificationThe stages in the framework are briefly described as follows:2Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 20202.5	PREPROCESSINGWe apply basic preprocessing on Amharic News Comments. These include normalization of Amharicscript symbols, tokenization, stop word removal, punctuation mark removal and so on. Amharicwriting system is expressed using only consonants. To handle the features of the language is verychallenging. We require conversion of Amharic scripts to consonant-vowel form. Particularly, be-fore performing negation handling and stemming, the algorithm converts each Amharic word to itsconsonant vowel form.
Figure 2: State Automata for Amharic MorPhological Negation CluesAssume the ith Amharic news comment, Ci in Amharic News Comments collection,da, has preprocessed and finally, the comment is tokenized into lists. That is, Ci= Wii,Wi2,,…,wj,,∙∙∙, WiN, ), where N is the number of tokens in ith comments,Ci. Let the Amharic Sentiment Lexicon is denoted by Sa . As part of preprocessing,we normalized not only all Amharic words in the Amharic News Comments butalso handling entries of Amharic Sentiment Lexicon by replacing varied alphabets ofthe same sound with identical symbols. Moreover, a stemmer is applied for afternegation identification is completed. As Amharic is morphologically rich, to reducethe mismatch of Amharic words during string comparison operation, we used stemmingfor this purpose. Below is the Negation handling algorithm in 1.
