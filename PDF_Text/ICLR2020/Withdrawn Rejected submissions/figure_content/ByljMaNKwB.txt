Figure 1: Optimal solution to Eq. (5) (best viewedin color). Î»* compensates what is below the V*,while V* is chosen such that the vector of thegreen bars has L2 norm of 1.
Figure 2: Model architecture with two source domains (best viewed in color). Mini-batches of xSiand xT are fed to the network. xSi will go through the classification/regression path on the upperhy box, while all x will go through to the corresponding discrepancies (in the lower hd box). Thegradients from the discrepancies will be reverted during backpropagation.
