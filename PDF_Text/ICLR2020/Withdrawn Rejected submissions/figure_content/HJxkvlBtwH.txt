Figure 1: End-to-End Audio Certifica-tion Flow using DAC.
Figure 2: Robustness verification illustrated on a toy example. Each box shows the constraintscomputed by the verifier after processing a given operation (shown on edges). Green color denoteselements of the MFCC audio processing stage: the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), the FilterbankTransform (FB), and the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). Blue color denotes components of thenetwork: ReLU layer, LSTM and Fully Connected layer. Approximations computed with this workare shown in the bottom row. The operations which the abstract transformers handle are shown nextto the downward edges. Edges without labels represent affine transforms.
Figure 3: Our DeepPoly approximations of (a) the natural logarithm and (b) the square function. Bluelines represent the valid (in case of square, non-negative) upper and lower bounds which minimize thearea between the planes under the given domain [lx , ux]. The red bound on (b) grants smaller area,but contains the negative value, which occurs the analysis failure in the audio processing pipeline.
