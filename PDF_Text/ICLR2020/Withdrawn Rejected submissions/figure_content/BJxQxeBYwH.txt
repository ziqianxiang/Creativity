Figure 1: Training and test performance versus training epoch.
Figure 2: Training time comparisons. The annotation, e.g. 1.0Ã—, denotes speedup compared to GCN.
Figure 3: Training and test performance versus training epoch.
Figure 4: Performances under varied dataset size. As dataset sizes increases, it becomes harder tooverfit (especially for GFN), but GFN still performs as well as, if not better, than GCN.

Figure 6: Random and mis-classified samples from PROTEINS. Each row represents a (true) class.
Figure 7: Random and mis-classified samples from IMDB-B. Each row represents a (true) class.
Figure 8: Random and mis-classified samples from IMDB-M. Each row represents a (true) class.
