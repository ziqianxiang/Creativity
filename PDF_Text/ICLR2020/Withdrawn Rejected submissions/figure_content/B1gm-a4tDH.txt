Figure 1: Left: Comparisons between fPCA, SLI and CSI in estimating Y with different obser-vation rates. Lines with colors red, green and blue correspond to fPCA, SLI and CSI respectively.
Figure 2: Box plot for test errorsTable 2: Test error on GDI dataset(a) Top 3 PCs from CSI algorithm(b) Predicted curve of patient ID 5416Figure 3: Low-rank decomposition of disease progression curvesthrough age 1-10 and partially recovers during puberty. The second and third PC reflects fluctuationsduring different periods of child growth. By visual inspection, similar trends can be find in the topcomponents of SLI and fPCA as well.
