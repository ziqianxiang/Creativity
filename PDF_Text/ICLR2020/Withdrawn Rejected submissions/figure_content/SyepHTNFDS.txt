Figure 1: Overall architecture of the proposed generative model. During a forward path (encoding), discretegraph components A, X are inputted for dequantization. We apply the proposed GRFs to the dequantizedcomponents and obtain the latent representations, ZA , ZX . During a backward path (graph generation), we firstapply the inversion of the ResBlock to ZA, yielding noise-overlapped A0. Denoised (recovered) A and ZX arethe input arguments for the inverted ResGCN, recovering the noise-overlapped X0.
Figure 2: (a) L2 reconstruction error of GRF against the number of fixed-point iterations. L2 errors aremeasured between dequantized A0, X0 and reconstructed A0, X0, normalized by the number of entries. Weobserve that the error decays exponentially with the number of iterations in both datasets. (b) The original andreconstructed molecules sampled from QM9 and ZINC-250k with 100 fixed-point iterations. The color mapsdepict the values of the dequantized feature and adjacency matrices. Feature matrices have single channel whileadjacency matrices have three channels excluding the virtual bond channel and are visualized as RGB channels.
Figure 3: Visualization of the learned latent spaces along the first and the second principal components. Theempty space in the grid indicates that an invalid molecule is generated.
