Figure 1: Schematic of the poisoning process inweight space. Poisons are crafted to adjust weight tra-jectories within the low training loss basin so that thenetwork misclassifies the target image.
Figure 2: Visuals of the target image (left) and a random sampling of the poisons (top) along with theirperturbations (bottom).
Figure 3:	A look into the process of crafting poisons.
Figure 4:	Training curves of the victim networks. Each curve corresponds to a different source-target classpair and is averaged over 8 training runs with different random initializations. For target loss and success rate,the each point on the curve corresponds to an epoch and is the average over all the steps within that epochclipped to within the -ball. Finally, the model weights are updated by passing the same mini-batchbut without the poison perturbations1.
