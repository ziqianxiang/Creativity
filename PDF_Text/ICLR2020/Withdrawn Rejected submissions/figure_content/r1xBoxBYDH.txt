Figure 2: Top-1/5 errors (%) of our module with different group sizes on CIFAR-100 dataset. Weuse a ResNet50 as a backbone network (denoted as baseline). A clear trend is observed that an errordecreases according to smaller group size g. For top-1 error, the case of g = 2 reaches 22.42%. Forcomparison, the original ResNet101 yields a result of 23.17% as shown in Table 1.
Figure 3: Scatter plot of variance versus mean of activation per data sample from CIFAR-100test images. Note that this is a scatter plot for 10,000 samples. Each dot is composed ofactivations as all variances have a zero value and share the same mean activation.
