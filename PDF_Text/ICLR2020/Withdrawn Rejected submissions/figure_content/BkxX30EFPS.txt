Figure 1: Illustration of the training process of PGAs. The overall loss function consists of (a) thebasic PGA losses, and either (b) the LPGA-specific losses or (c) the VPGA-specific losses. Circlesindicate where the gradient is truncated, and dashed lines indicate where the gradient is ignored whenupdating parameters.
