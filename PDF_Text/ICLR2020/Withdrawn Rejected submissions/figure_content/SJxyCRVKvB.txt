Figure 2: 2D t-SNE projections ofattention vectors from 500 individ-uals. Color of a node indicates theunderlying causal structures. Thecausal groundtruth ωi is shown inthe legend (S=10,T=100).
Figure 3: The result of online A/B test. The interven-tion starts from 08/19, and results in the item popularityimprovement rate of Bucket A consistently outperformingBucket B after 8/22, and the gap between the two bucketsincreases significantly since 08/25.
Figure 4: The visualization of prototypes and ground-truth causal structures. Plots are shown forvarious number of common causal structures C (S=10, T =1000). Each column of the heat mapvisualizes one structure.
Figure 5: The visualization of Granger causal attention vectors over epochs during the training phaseand the ground-truth causal structures. Each column of the heat map visualizes one structure (C=5,S=10,T=1000).
Figure 6: Performance results w.r.t. different numbers of prototypes K and different values of thehyper-parameter α, λ1, λ2 and γ.
