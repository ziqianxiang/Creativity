Figure 1: Semantic Scholar co-authorship network (S2b), subsampled for readability; (a) the net-work is laid out first, documents are randomly placed along edges; (b) the network is laid out first,documents are randomly placed around nodes; (c) documents are part of the network layout as nodesin the graph that replace author-author edges; (d) the document landscape is laid out first, nodes arepositioned at the centre of their associated documents; (e) tSNE is applied on papers and authorstogether, where documents are aggregated to represent authorsoften does not generate visualisations in which classes can be clearly distinguished, the clusteringalgorithm is still able to separate them with competitive results compared to tSNE and MODiR.
Figure 2: MODiR visualisation of Semantic Scholar (S2), all six communities become clear.
Figure 3: MODiR visualisation business news about Commerzbank, highlighted on articles aboutVolkswagen. All nodes (companies) in the network are connected to the centre node (Commerzbank)and our algorithm still manages to retain the semantic areas.
