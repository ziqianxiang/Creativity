Figure 1: Illustration of three models: (a) BERT; (b) Inverted Bottleneck BERT (IB-BERT); and (c)MobileBERT. In (b) and (c), red lines denote inter-block flows while blue lines intra-block flows.
Figure 2: Left panel: diagram of progressive knowledge transfer. Lighter colored blocks representthat they are frozen in that stage. Right panel: algorithm of progressive knowledge transfer.
Figure 3: The visualization of the attention distributions in some attention heads of the IB-BERTteacher and different MobileBERT models. We provide the visualization of attention distributionsof all 24 layer in Appendix G to readers for further details.
