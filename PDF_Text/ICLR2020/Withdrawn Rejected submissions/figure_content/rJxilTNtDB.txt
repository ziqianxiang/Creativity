Figure 1: Overall process of the graph-based molecular machine learning. In the molecular graph,three and two-dimensional vectors mean atom-features and bond-features, respectively.
Figure 2: Example of reverse self-attention in the graphs containing five nodes.
Figure 3: Overall process of building machine learning-based atomic importance estimator with thereverse self-attention mechanism and selecting important atom or group of atoms using the estimator.
Figure 4: An original molecule made of the carbon ring and its selected sub-molecule that consistsof 1-hop neighbor atoms. Note that hydrogens are automatically attached to make a valid molecularstructure. The group of atoms that is marked by a red mask means the most important atomic groupestimated by MIAIE. White node: hydrogen (H); Gray node: carbon (C).
Figure 5: Original molecules and their selected sub-molecules in terms of aqueous solubility. Bluenode: nitrogen (N); Red node: oxygen (O); Yellow-green node: Fluorine (F); Yellow node: Sulfur(S); Orange node: Phosphorus (P); Green node: Chlorine (Cl).
Figure 6: Two original molecules with symmetric structure and their selected sub-molecules in termsof aqueous solubility. The group of atoms that is marked by a blue mask means the second mostimportant atomic group estimated by MIAIE.
Figure 7: Original molecules (left) on QM9 dataset and their sub-molecules (right) showing ex-tremely small error (< 0.0001) on AIEE. Sub-caption means the index of the original molecules onQM9 dataset.
Figure 8: Original molecules (left) on QM9 dataset and their sub-molecules (right) showing ex-tremely large error (> 0.01) on AIEE.
