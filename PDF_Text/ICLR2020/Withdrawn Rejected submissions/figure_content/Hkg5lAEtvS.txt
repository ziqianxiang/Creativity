Figure 1: A snapshot of the Rayleigh-Benard convection flow, the velocity fields along X direction(top) and y direction (bottom) (Chirila, 2018). The spatial resolution is 1792 x 256 pixels.
Figure 2: Turbulent Flow Net: three identical encoders to learn the transformations of the threecomponents of different scales, and one shared decoder that learns the interactions among these threecomponents to generate the predicted 2D velocity field at the next instant. Each encoder-decoderpair can be viewed as a U-net and the aggregation is weighted summation.
