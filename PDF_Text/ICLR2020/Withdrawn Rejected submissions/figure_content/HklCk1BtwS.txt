Figure 1: Illustration of the local neighborhood structure in the embedding space E = Ud ∙ ∑αwith different α. From (a) to (c): t-SNE (Maaten & Hinton, 2008) visualization of the nearest 20neighbors ofan arbitrarily chosen word summer with α equals to 0.0, 0.5 and 1.0 respectively. Moreresults corresponding other α can be founded in appendix A.9.
Figure 2: Compare the best α (black vertical line) in terms of the performance on the word similaritytask and the best α? (blue vertical line) in terms of equation 4. α? is searched from [-1, 1] with 0.1as increment. From (a) to (e): y-axis is the correlation between the embedding score and the humanassignend score. x-axis is different α.
