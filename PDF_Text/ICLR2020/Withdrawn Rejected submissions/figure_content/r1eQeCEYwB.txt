Figure 1: The red box demonstrates a GNN Equipped with Spatial Representation (GNN-ESR).
Figure 2:	Part (a): This part represents two graphs. Each circle represents a cluster of nodes.
Figure 3:	Each circle represents a cluster and both graphs are composed of 6 clusters. A whitecluster means that the labels of its corresponding nodes are equal to 1 and black means they arelabeled 0. In the NLC task, the neural network is trained to count the number of white clusters. Inthe MDC, the neural network is trained to check if the diagonal clusters are labeled similarly. A pairof clusters are called diagonal clusters if they are in the maximum distance from each other. In theleft graph, the labels of one pair of diagonal clusters are not equal. In the right graphs, the labels ofall the diagonal clusters are equal.
