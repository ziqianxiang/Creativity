Figure 1: Top: Classification errors and sparsificaton performance of various pruning methods for LeNet-500-300 and LeNet5-Caffe on the MNIST dataset. Bottom: Error-Speedup tradeoff plots for LeNet 500-300 (left)and LeNet5-Caffe (right).
Figure 2: Top: Classification errors and sparsification performances of various pruning methods onCIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. Bottom: Error-Speedup tradeoff plots (left, middle) and anempirical analysis of learned filters from DBB (right).
Figure 3: Correlation coefficients of class averages of 夕(x) for the four layers in LeNet5-Caffe, wherethe darker shows the more correlation between the class average values of 夕(x). The correlationbetween classes diminishes as layer goes up, implying that the input filters are being specialized tothe classes.
