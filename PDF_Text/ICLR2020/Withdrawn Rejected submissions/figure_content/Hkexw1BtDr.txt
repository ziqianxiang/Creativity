Figure 1: Illustration of the proposed Markov decision process.
Figure 2: Illustration of the transition function withthe update and the clean-up phases.
Figure 3: Illustration of coupled MDP withthe corresponding solution diversity reward.
Figure 4:	Evaluation of trade-off between time and objective (upper-left side is of better trade-off).
Figure 5:	Illustration of ablation studies done on ER-(50, 100) dataset. The solid line and shadedregions represent the mean and standard deviation across 3 runs respectively Note that the standarddeviation in (c) was enlarged ten times for better visibility.
