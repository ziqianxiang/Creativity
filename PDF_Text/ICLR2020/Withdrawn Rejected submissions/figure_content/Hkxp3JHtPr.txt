Figure 1: t-SNE of the latent space of a conventional VAE (left), and our proposed dual-prior VAE(right), trained on the Thyroid dataset, and evaluated on an unseen test sample. Note that latentvectors for outliers (red crosses) in DP-VAE are pushed away from the normal samples.
Figure 2: Motion planning with VAE. Following the work of Ichter et al. (2018), a conditionalVAE is trained to generate robot configurations to be used within a sampling based motion planningalgorithm. The VAE generates 6D robot configurations (robot position and velocity; here projectedonto the 2D plane) given an image of obstacles, an initial state (blue) and a goal state (red). Usingour DP-VAE method, we added to the VAE training negative samples on obstacle boundaries. Wecompare samples from the standard VAE (left) and DP-VAE (right) on three unseen obstacle maps.
