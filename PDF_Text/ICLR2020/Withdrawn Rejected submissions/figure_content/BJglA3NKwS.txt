Figure 1: Illustration of the similarity function using a single-layer feed-forward network (a) and theSiamese similarity function (b). In (a), different input elements use different weights. In (b), twoinput vectors share the same network. The lines with the same color indicate weights sharing.
Figure 2: Architectures of the BaseModule (a) and AttnModule (b) as introduced in Section 3.3. Theskip connection between inputs and outputs is used when S = 1 and C = d. The one between inputsand outputs of SAO is used when S = 1.
