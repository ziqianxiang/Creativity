Figure 1: Example of achievable risk tradeoffs for a binary regression problem with two unbalancedsensitive groups a = {0, 1} (Pa=1 > Pa=0). Bottom left and top left figures show conditionaldistributions of observation variable pa(x), and target variable p(y = 1|x, a) respectively. p(y =1|x, a) are simple piece-wise constant functions with levels ρlow and ρhigh. Middle figure showsthe Pareto front defined by subgroup risks; we observe that noise levels differ across subgroups andperfect Pareto fairness is unattainable. Equality of Risk requires pure degradation of service forgroup a = 1. Both Naive and Rebalanced Naive classifiers do not attain the best possible no-harmclassifier in this case. The proposed Pareto-fair point is shown in green, with its correspondingoptimal Equal risk classifier shown in purple. The utopic point (Ro0pt,Ro1pt) can only be attainedwhen the classifier also has access to the sensitive attribute (h(X, A)). Rightmost figure shows thetrade-offs attainable between discrimination and mean risks, an alternative perspective to the risktrade-off figure.
Figure 2: Synthetic data experiment. Bottom left figure shows the conditional distribution of the observa-tion variables for each of the three subgroups, while upper left shows the distribution of the target variableconditioned on both the observation and sensitive attribute; it additionally shows the theoretical and empiricalPareto-fair classifier. Center figure shows the empirical validation risks (dashed lines) as a function of epochsduring the optimization procedure, the theoretical Pareto-Fair risks are also shown (solid lines). Rightmostshows how the maximum discrimination shrinks with the number of epochs.
