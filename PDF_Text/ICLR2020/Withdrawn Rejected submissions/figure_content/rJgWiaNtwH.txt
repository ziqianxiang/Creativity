Figure 1: Clustering of MNIST: From left to right: Tanh, ReLu, Leaky ReLu. Top row: StandardVAE training with ELBO objective, Middle row: Standard VAE with ELBO objective and latentclipping, Bottom row: μ-VAE objective function and latent clipping.
Figure 2:	Training curves of the model trained on MNIST Fashion using each of four objectives:VAE (ELBO), β-VAE (β = 4), m-VAE#1 and m-VAE#2. Plots from left to right: reconstruc-tion loss, KL divergence, classification accuracy and regularization loss of μ-VAE (PB=I μn∣ +PnB=1 log σ2n) i.e. the term that replaces KL.
Figure 3:	Clustering of samples from latent layer obtained using t-SNE and test datasets of MNIST(top row) and MNIST Fashion (bottom row). From left to right: VAE, β-VAE, m-VAE#1, andM-VAE#2.
Figure 4: Sample distribution obtained at each dimension of latent variable using test dataset ofMNIST Fashion. From top to bottom: VAE, β-VAE, m-VAE#1, and m-VAE#2.
Figure 5: Reconstructions of input data obtained using test dataset of MNIST Fashion. Top row:vae (left), β-VAE (right). Bottom row: m-VAE#1 (left), m-VAE#2 (right).
Figure 6: Random samples drawn from multi-variate Gaussian, N(0, σ).From left to right, model(σ): VAE (σ=1), β-VAE (σ=1), m-VAE#1 (σ=3), and m-VAE#2 (σ=3). Higger σ is used for μ-VAEmodels since their samples are more spread out.
Figure 7: Traversing each dimension of latent variable in 40 steps. From top to bottom, the modeland sweeping range used for the model: VAE [-2,2], β-VAE [-2,2], m-VAE#1 [-10,10], m-VAE#2[-20,20].
Figure 8: Training curves of the model trained on MNIST. Regularization loss of μ-VAE defined asPB=I μn∣ + PB=1 [logσ2]n, i.e. term that replaces KL.
Figure 9: Traversing each dimension of latent variable in 40 steps. From top to bottom, model[range]: VAE [-2,2], β-VAE [-2,2], 〃-VAE#1 [-10,10], and 〃-VAE#2 [-20,20].
Figure 10: Random samples drawn from multi-variate Gaussian, N(0, σ).From left to right, model(σ): VAE (σ=1), β-VAE (σ=1), m-VAE#1 (σ=3), and m-VAE#2 (σ=3). Higger σ is used for μ-VAEmodels since their samples are more spread out.
