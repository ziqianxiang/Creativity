Figure 1: The architecture of our Deep Complex Extractor. It consists of a pipeline containinga U-Net and a Complex Extractor Masking operator (see Algorithm 1). The Deep Extractor takesas input the mixed speech signal which is fed to the U-Net. The downsampling blocks of the U-Net are denoted by Di where i ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4} and the upsampling blocks are denoted by Ui wherei ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4}. The output of the U-Net along with the input mix are then fed to the ComplexExtractor Masking operator in order to estimate the clean speech for each of the speakers.
Figure 2: The basic structures of our U-Net downsampling block Di (Left) and our U-Net upsamplingblock Ui (Middle) used respectively in the encoding and the decoding paths of Figure 1. The structureof a basic complex residual block (Right) in each of Di and Ui .
Figure 3: Validation curves of models with and without performing multiple input transfor-mations. The plotted curves relate to models reported in Table 3. Models with multiple inputtransformations outperform those without transformations. The former achieved higher SDR scores,on average.
Figure 4: Validation curves of the models that yielded the highest SDRs using either the L2 spectralloss or our CSimLoss. The Drawn curves are related to models reported in Table 3.
Figure 5: Validation curves of the models that yielded the highest SDRs for both cases where dropouton the input mixture transformations was used and where it was not. The Drawn curves are related tomodels reported in Table 3.
