Figure 1: (a) The block marked pulse ∆ encoder is similar to the aI&F neuron model. The LPF stageat the input makes it an asynchronous Σ∆ loop. (b) Evolution of the feedback signal, s(t), over time.
Figure 2: SDR of the Σ∆ neuron as a function of sinusoidal input parameters. The Σ∆ neuronis fed a single-tone sinusoid riding on a Dc bias to ensures that the input is non-negative. Thetransient simulations are run With a simulation time step of 1μs. This is the reason for the saturationin the firing rate in (b). The SDR ratio is reported after subtracting the Dc component. The neuronparameters for the simulation are τmem = 0.007s, τw = 0.0014s, αL = 5000, αs = 1, ∆ = 0.1nA,Iin = 40nA, IL = 0nA.
