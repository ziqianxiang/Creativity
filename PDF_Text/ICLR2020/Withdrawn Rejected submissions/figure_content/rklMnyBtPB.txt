Figure 1: (left) A depiction of the steepest descent directions for '∞, '2, and '1 norms. The gradientis the black arrow, and the α radius step sizes and their corresponding steepest descent directions '∞,'2 , and '1 are shown in blue, red, and green respectively. (right) An example of the projection backto an '2 ball of radius after a steepest descent step from the starting perturbation δ. The steepestdescent step is the black arrow, and the corresponding projection back onto the '2 ball is red arrow.
