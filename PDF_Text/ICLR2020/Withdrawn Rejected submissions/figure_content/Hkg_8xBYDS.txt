Figure 1: Example of population based evaluation on N = 3 learners each with 3 strategies and 5copies. a) Each population obtains a fitness value Pi depending on the strategies chosen, b) mutationstrategy (red star), and c) population either selecting original strategy, or adopting the novel strategy.
