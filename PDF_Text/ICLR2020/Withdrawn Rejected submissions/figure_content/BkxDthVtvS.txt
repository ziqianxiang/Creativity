Figure 1: For any X and F, there exists a unique lift F such that the diagram commutes.
Figure 2: Equivarification layer by layer.
Figure 3: In this figure, conv1 is a standard convolution layer with input = X0 and output = X1.
Figure 4: On the left, we have the rotated images; on the right, we have the predicted numbers,angles, and the probability vectors in R40 , each component of which corresponds to the probabilityof a (number, angle) combination. The equivariance in this case means that the four vectors arerelated by shifts.
Figure 5: Factors through.
