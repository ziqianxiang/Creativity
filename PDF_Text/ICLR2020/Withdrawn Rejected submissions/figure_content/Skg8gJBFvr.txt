Figure 1: Starting from radius distri-bution in Equation (8) with d = 100σ = 1 and k = 0 (black start), increas-ing k (green curve) allows us to movethe mean towards zero without signifi-cantly reducing the variance. Decreas-ing σ (red curve) can also decrease themean, but with a cost of decreasing thevariance quadratically.
Figure 3: For '∞ attacking, the mixednorm distribution (right) yields smallerTV distances (larger overlap areas), andhence higher robustness.
Figure 4: The Pareto frontier of accuracy and robustness(in the sense of Equation (7)) of the three smoothing fam-ilies in Equation (8), Equation (9), and Equation (10) for'∞ attacking, when We search for the best parameters (k, σ)for each of them. The mixed norm family Equation (9)yields the best trade-off than the other two. We assumef](x) = I(kxk2 ≤ r) and dimension d = 5. The casewhen f](x) = I(kxk∞ ≤ r) has similar result (not shown).
