Figure 1: Illustration of input space divided into sub-regions by a biased neural network. The blacklines are the hyperplanes for the first network layer, while the blue lines are for the second layer andthe red lines are for the third layer. A small perturbation from point A to point B may possibly crossmany hyperplanes.
