Figure 1: Certifying DMR robustness in `2 norm on CIFAR-10: vary the Gaussian noise used in thetraining process and fix the σ of the Gaussian mechanism as σ = 0.5. c = 1 (left) and c = 3 (right)largest radius that can be certified is upper bounded by O (r√Fα), and the largest radius that can becertified by GaUSSian mechanism is OQNdlog d) (and σ is Ω(√∣0=)). If α and e are both setto be O(1), the largest radius that can be certified using Gaussian mechanism to achieve DMR-robustness is greater than the largest radius that can be certified to achieve D∞ -robustness by atleast a factor of O(<d/ log d). This is reasonable since the definition of DMR-robustness is morerelaxed. Obviously, there is some trade-off between the rigorousness of the notion of robustnessand the largest certified robust radius, i.e., when the robustness is relaxed, the largest certified radiusincreases. We will investigate this trade-off more in the future research.

Figure 5: Certifying DMR robustness in `2 norm on ImageNet: vary the σ in the Gaussian mecha-nism and fix the σ of the training noise as σ = 0.5. c = 1 (left) and c = 3 (right). There is no greenline because the accuracy is 0 when adding σ = 1.0 Gaussian noise to the images.

The classifier is trained with σ = 0.50 Gaussiannoise. As we can see, the certified radius is smaller than 1/255.
