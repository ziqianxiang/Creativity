Figure 1: illustration of an external subspace. All the data Y are normalized to have unit norm forillustration purpose, so they lie on the surface of the sphere. S1 and S2 are two subspaces in thethree-dimensional ambient space. The subspace spanned by yi ∈ S1 and yj ∈ S2 is an externalsubspace, and the intersection of this external subspace and S1 is a dashed line yi OA.
