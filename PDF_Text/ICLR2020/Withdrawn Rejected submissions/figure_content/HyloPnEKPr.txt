Figure 1: The model of computing the span embedding representations.
Figure 2: The Feature Attention model. The model learns to weigh each feature based on contexts.
Figure 3: Example of span feature attention weights in different features. The rows show the spanfeature attention weights of features of each ”it’s”.
