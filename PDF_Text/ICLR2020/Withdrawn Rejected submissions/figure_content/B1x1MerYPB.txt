Figure 1: Graphical model showing the factorization of our noisy channel model where yi indicatesthe ith target language sentence and xi indicates the ith source language sentence. In the prior (left)the target sentences (the yi â€™s) only influence the corresponding source sentence and therefore canbe learned and modeled independently, but at test time (right), when the target is not observed, eachyi is dependent on every xi .
Figure 2: The decoding process. In Phase 1, the auxiliary proposal model generates candidate trans-lations (3 candidates in the diagram) for each sentence in the document (containing 4 sentences). InPhase 2, beam search is employed to search for the best path from the candidate translations.
