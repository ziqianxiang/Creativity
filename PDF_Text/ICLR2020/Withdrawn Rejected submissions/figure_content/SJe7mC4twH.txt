Figure 1: The overview of Q-Layer. The forward paths for the quantized output and the non-quantized output are drawn with solid black arrows and the four backward paths are drawn withred, blue, green and yellow arrows.
Figure 2: Visualization of the pixel and concept distributions for MNIST. We use FGSM attack with= 0.4 to generate adversarial samples for better visualization. For this case, the KL divergence is5.39 for the pixel distribution and 4.33 for the concept distribution.
