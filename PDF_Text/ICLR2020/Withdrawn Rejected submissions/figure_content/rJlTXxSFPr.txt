Figure 1: Temperature sweep curves for the synthetic-data experiments of sentence length 20 (left)and 40 (right) over NLLtest vs. NLLoracle space (lower is better for both metrics)Figure 2: Frontier curves of our models and three baseline models. Left is better and down isbetter. The models trained via our proposed adversarial objective perform better compared withMLE model and other GANs variants.
