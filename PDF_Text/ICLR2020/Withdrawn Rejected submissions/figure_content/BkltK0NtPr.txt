Figure 1: An example of a weakly global function (a) and a non-weakly-global function (b). Bothfunctions have bad non-strict local minima, consisting a plateau of (-3, -1). The plateau in the rightfigure is the bottom of a basin, entailing a bad strict local minimum in the sense of sets.
Figure 2: The figure of the output data (a) and activation function σ(∙) (b) in the proposed 1-hidden-layer-1-neuron example. In (a), (y1,y2) = (2,0) is the true data, (y1 ,y2) = (1,1) is thecurrent output and the cyan area is the feasible region of (y1 ,y'2) if We perturb both V and w. In(b), wx1 = wx2 = 0 is the current input of σ(∙), while w2x1 and w2x2 are possible inputs afterperturbation.
Figure 3: The loss surface of Example 1 with d = 1, (x, y) = (1, 1), and σ(z) = -(z - 1)2/8. Thepoint (v, W) = (1, 1) is a bad non-strict local minimum.
