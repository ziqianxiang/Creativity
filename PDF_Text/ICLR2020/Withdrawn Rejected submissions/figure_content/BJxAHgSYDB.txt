Figure 1: Learning curve prediction tries to predict from the partial learning curve (solid line) thefinal performance.
Figure 2: LCRankNet has three different components, each dealing with one type of input: partiallearning curve, architecture encoding and data set ID.
Figure 3: The x-axis indicates the length observed of the learning curve. We report the mean often repetitions. The shaded area is the standard deviation. Our method LCRankNet outperforms itscompetitors on all data sets.
Figure 4:	LCRankNet is speeding up architecture search for SVHN. Difference between learningcurves is small, making this the hardest task.
Figure 5:	Analysis of the predicted probability of LCRankNet with growing learning curve length.
Figure 6:	Analysis of the different components of LCRankNet. Every single component, metadata,consideration of the learning curve and architecture description, is vital.
