Figure 1: LoopGAN framework: for simplicity, only a single loop starting at one real domain in a four-domainproblem is illustrated here. All four steps share a single generator G, parameterized by the step variable. Whentraining G, our objective function actually consists of four loops including A → B → C → D → A,B → C → D → A → B, C → D → A → B → C, and D → A → B → C → D. This is consistent withhow CycleGAN is trained where two cycles are included.

Figure 3:	Face Aging and Alps seasons change with LoopGAN compared to baselines. Input real images arehighlighted with rectangles (viewed in color).

Figure 5: Additional datasets. Top row: (left) changing azimuth of a chair, (right) increasing degree of smile.
Figure 6: (a). Ablation study for the architecture changes. (b) Model size comparison. * Note that theparameter count for vanilla and chained versions of bi-domain models (CycleGAN, Chained-CycleGAN, UNIT,and Chained-UNIT) are totals of separate pair-wise generators that together facilitate sequence generation.
Figure 7: Two failure cases. Input images and failure generations are highlighted respectively in red and purple(viewed in color). In both cases, the highlighted generated images (the first column in (a) and the last column in(b)) bear some semantic dissimilarity to the input images. It seems that sometimes the network overfit to moredrastic transformations that only preserve overall facial structure and orientation but neglects all other features.
