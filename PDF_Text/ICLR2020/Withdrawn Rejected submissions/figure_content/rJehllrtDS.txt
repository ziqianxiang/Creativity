Figure 1: Average accuracy vs. cycle on differentsetups and acquisition strategies.
Figure 2: Average accuracy vs. cycle on differentsetups and acquisition strategies with PRE.
Figure 3: Average accuracy vs. cycle on differentsetups and acquisition strategies.
Figure 4: Average accuracy vs. cycle on different setups and acquisition strategies: Baseline, PRE andPRE +SEMI. PRE and PRE + SEMI scenarios are represented using different dashed lines as presentedin the legend. For reference, the full training accuracy is 96.97% for SVHN, 94.84 % for CIFAR-10and 76.43 % for CIFAR-100.
Figure  5:  Ranks  of  examples  obtained  by  one  acquisition  strategy  vs.  the  ranks  of  another  onCIFAR-10 with b = 1000 after cycle 1. A random 5% subset of all examples is shown.
