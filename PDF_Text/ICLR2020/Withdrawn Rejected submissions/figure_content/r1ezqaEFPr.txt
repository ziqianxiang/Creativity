Figure 1: Architectures of the original Mask R-CNN in (a) and our proposed model in (b). Obvi-ously, our model is different from the original model by reformimg two modules. SA-FPN (ScaleAware Feature Pyramid Networks) combines TD-FPN (Top-Down style FPN, as shown in green)and BU-FPN (Bottom-Up style FPN, as shown in yellow) together. And EJ-Head (Effective JointHead) proposes three operations. “Enriched feature” represents enhencing the extracted RoI feature,“Boundary Refinement” means adding additional convolutions on this pathway for optimization ofthe boundary , “Interleaving” is an operation to filter the predicted bounding boxes which get a highIoU (Intersection-over-Union) with ground truth and then feed positive samples into the instancesegmentation branch.
Figure 2: Three different architectures of FPNs. (a) is the most widely used Top-Down style FPN,which is used in the baseline model. (b) and (c) are two newly designed Bottom-Up style FPNs.
Figure 3: Detail of Boundary Refinement(BR) module in EJ-Head. There are two branches, one istwo stacked convolutions, the other is a shortcut. Finally two branches are added at the pixel level,which brings the boundary alignment effect.
Figure 4: Examples of multi-task learning results on COCO 2017test-dev. Predicted detection re-sults are shown in yellow bounding boxes, masks are also shown.
