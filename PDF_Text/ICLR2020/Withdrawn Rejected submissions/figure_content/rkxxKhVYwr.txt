Figure 3: Illustration of the special max pooling operator. Fi denotes features correspond topoints in neighborhood N(i) w.r.t. point xi. Each column of Fi represents the feature of a specificpoint in N(i).
Figure 4: Illustration of fixed sampling and grouping. f denotes the pixel value/point-wisefeature of pixel/point Xi.
