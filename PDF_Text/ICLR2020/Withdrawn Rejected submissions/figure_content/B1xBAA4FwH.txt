Figure 1: Examples of the proposed algorithm for correctnessInterestingly, these masked accuracies are similar to the precision and recall metrics used in infor-mation retrieval (Manning et al., 2009). This provides motivation to combine these differences into41. - saliency map as we pre-process the saliency map values to lie in [0, 1] using min-max scaling4Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2020a Pseudo-F1 score by computing the harmonic mean of accuracy on normal masked images and 1 -accuracy on inverse masked images. Formally this can be computed as:P seudo - F 12(1 - acc@1inverSe)T +(acc@1)-1(3)3.2.2	ConsistencyWe define consistency as the ability of the explainer to capture the same relevant components undervarious transformations to the input. More specifically, if the classifier predicts the same classfor both the original and transformed inputs. Then, consistency measures whether the generatedexplanation for the transformed input (after applying an inverse transform) is similar to the onegenerated for the original input.
Figure 2: Effect of k on correctness with normal and inverse masking4.2	Evaluating ConsistencyNext, we evaluate consistency by computing the distance with FastDTW between the saliency mapsgenerated on the original images and those generated when transformations are applied to the inputimage (Following Eq. 4). Fig. 3 and Table 8 report the normalized distances relative to eachtransformation (i.e., heatmaps sum to 1).
