Figure 1: The illustration of VAENAS mechanism. VAENAS mechanism contains two modules,one is VAE model, and the other is an architecture search system. These two modules are updatedalternately. Specifically, three steps are carried out on VAENAS mechanism. 1) Architectures aresampled from VAE model and fed into the architecture search system. 2) The architecture searchsystem evaluates and sorts sampled architectures. 3) The VAE model is trained with top-50% archi-tectures.
Figure 2: Compare the distribution of VAE Sampling with Random Sampling. (a) VAENAS trainedwith super-network. (b) VAENAS trained with ground truth accuracy. (c) VAENAS trained with0.1% noise on accuracy. (d) VAENAS trained with 0.5% noise on accuracy.

Figure 6: One sampled cell on NAS-Bench-101 super-network. Every path contains 9edges, while some edges may be useless inthe cell.
Figure 7: One example of weight-shared ten-sors for convolution kernel. O × C × K × Kis the size of kernel. The blue cube showsthe whole tensor, and the green cube showsthe part used for the ? X C X K X K Con-volution operation.
