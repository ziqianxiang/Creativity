Figure 1:  Our method creates representations for individual samples that can be interpreted alongcontextual dimensions,  which we call environments.   Those subvectors can then be compared togeneric class representations, which we refer to as ‘templates’.
Figure 2:  Overview of the WDVec approach.  A neural network obtains nf  features from inputs.
Figure A1:  Influence of R and nₑ on the F1 score for multi-label image classification using theWDVec approach with ResNet-18. When modifying R, nₑ is fixed to 300. When modifying nₑ, Ris fixed to 40. All datapoints are the average of three runs.
Figure A2: Some results for image retrieval with the different methods. The column ‘nearest neigh-bor‘ shows the most similar image without modification of the content. The column ‘content change’refers to how the class of the representations was altered.  The nearest neighbors to the altered rep-resentations are then retrieved with the ‘SIM’, ‘COMP slight’ and ‘COMP heavy’ methods respec-tively.
