Figure 1: Binary and ternary regularizers; R1 encourages binary weights, with minimums at{—μ, +μ}, and R2 encourages ternary weights, with minimums at {—μ, 0, +μ}.
Figure 2: Adaptive regularization function. When β → 2 the regularization function switches fromternary to binary.
Figure 3: Effect of Y on the weights distribution ofa layer while training.
Figure 4: Layer wise weights distribution in VGG-7 for STQ. The weights are pushed to binarywhen the shape parameter β is close to ∏ ≈ 1.57.
