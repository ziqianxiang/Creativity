Figure 1: (a) Illustration of the encoder structure, following the design ofDozat & Manning (2018).
Figure 2: Results with fixed amount of labeled data and varying amount of unlabeled data. Exper-iments are carried out on DM representations. +10U represents using 10% unlabeled data, and soon. Numbers on Y-axes represent F1 scores. Dashed horizontal lines are results of the supervisedbaseline (Dozat & Manning, 2018) trained on labeled data only. Solid lines are our results.
