Figure 1: Self-Learning Reinforcement Learning in AutoAssemblet: a. Training Pipeline is composed ofself-Learning and with re-adjustment of sampling strategy b. Monte Carlo Tree Search(MCTS) searches forbest policy by utilizing policy networks and value networks.
Figure 2: Performance comparison under four experiments settingIncrease of search difficulty. In our first experiment shown in Figure 2a), we evaluated our modelson increasing task pool sizes and tested for the accuracy of the generated program. Notice, bothresults from imitation learning and REINFORCE drop after task pool scales larger. This is largelydue to the policy learned by networks overfits to simple and redundant tasks. Our AutoAssembletmodel shows more robust improvements with high data efficiency.
