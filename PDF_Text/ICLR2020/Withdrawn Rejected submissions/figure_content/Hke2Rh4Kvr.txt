Figure 1: The lower bound (Equation 5) on different combinations of meta-models. The triangular and circularmarkers correspond to RBMs and VAEs respectively. (1): All meta-models are VAEs. After incorporating twoVAEs, the lower bound becomes stable. (2): The first two meta-models are RBMs and the rest are VAEs. Thesecond RBM and the first VAE greatly promote the lower bound. (3): The first four meta-models are RBMsand the rest are VAEs. The lower bound grows as the first two RBMs are incorporated, while the incorporationof next two RBMs doesnâ€™t help promote the lower bound. We further improve the lower bound by adding twoVAEs. (4): All meta-models are RBMs. After incorporating two RBMs, the lower bound becomes stable.
