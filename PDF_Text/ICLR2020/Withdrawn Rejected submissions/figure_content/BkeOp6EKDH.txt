Figure 1: 2-D Visualizations of the S-curve dataset: (a) original dataset in 3-D, (b) t-SNE, (c)UMAP, (d) TriMap, and (e) PCA. The values of AUC and global score, for respectively measuringlocal and global accuracy, are shown in order as a pair (AUC, GS) for each embedding. Despitehaving higher AUC values, t-SNE and UMAP both fail to reflect the overall shape of the S-curve.
Figure 2: The Effect of the weight transformation on the MNIST dataset: (a) no weight transfor-mation, (b) γ = 50, (c) γ = 500 (default), and (d) γ = 5000. The values of nearest neighboraccuracy and global score are shown as a tuple (NN,GS) on top of each figure. Larger values of γemphasizes more on the local accuracy rather than the global accuracy.
Figure 3: Effect of changing the number of triplets on the quality of the embeddings of the MNISTdataset. We consider (m, m0,r)=c × (2, 1, 1) for: (a) c =1, (b) c =2, (c) c = 5 (default), (d)c = 10, and (e) c = 20. The values of nearest neighbor accuracy and global score are shown asa tuple (NN,GS) on top of each figure. The quality of embedding does not improve significantlyafter adding a certain number of triplets.

Figure 5: Visualizations of different datasets using t-SNE, UMAP, TriMap, and PCA. Each rowcorresponds to one dataset and each column represents one method. The values of nearest neighboraccuracy and global score are shown as a pair (NN,GS) on top of each figure.

Figure 6: Visualizations of Covertype and RCV1 datasets using UMAP, TriMap, and PCA, andvisualizations of the Character Font Images dataset using LargeVis, TriMap, and PCA. The valuesof nearest neighbor accuracy and global score are shown as a tuple (NN,GS) on top of each figure.
Figure 7: Visualizations of different datasets using LargeVis, TriMap, and PCA. Each row corre-sponds to one dataset and each column represents one method. The values of nearest neighboraccuracy and global score are shown as a pair (NN,GS) on top of each figure.

Figure 8: Visualizations of Covertype and RCV1 datasets using LargeVis, TriMap, and PCA, andvisualizations of the Character Font Images dataset using LargeVis, TriMap, and PCA. The valuesof nearest neighbor accuracy and global score are shown as a tuple (NN,GS) on top of each figure.
Figure 9: Visualizations of KKDCup99 and HIGGS datasets TriMap and PCA. Each row corre-sponds to one dataset and each column represents one method. The values of nearest neighbor ac-curacy and global score are shown as a tuple (NN,GS) on top of each figure. TriMap shows morestructure for both datasets than PCA. Note that GS is uninformative for the KDDCup99 dataset.
