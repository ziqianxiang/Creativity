Figure 1: An overview of the TriGAN generator. We schematically show 3 domains {T, S1, S2} -objects with holes, 3D objects and skewered objects, respectively. The content is represented by theobjectâ€™s shape - square, circle or triangle. The style is represented by the color: each image input toG has a different color and each domain has it own set of styles. First, the encoder E creates a style-invariant representation using IWT blocks. DWT blocks are then used to obtain a domain-invariantrepresentation. Symmetrically, the decoder D brings back domain-specific information with cDWTblocks (for simplicity we show only a single domain, T). Finally, we apply a reference style. Thereference style is extracted using style path and it is applied using Adaptive IWT blocks.
Figure 2: Image generated by TriGAN across different domains (i.e., seasons). We show two gener-ated images for each domain combination.
Figure 3: Generations of our G across different domains. Leftmost column shows the source images,one from each domain and the topmost row shows the style image from the target domain, two fromeach domain.
