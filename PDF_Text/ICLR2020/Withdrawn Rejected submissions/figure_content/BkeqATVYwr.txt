Figure 1: The apn (A) and Gap (B) models forward execution for question answering and context-sensitive node representation, respectively.
Figure 2: Sensitivity of GAP to the size of node’s neighborhood (S, T) on the link prediction taskSetup: Since each node belongs to exactly one cluster, we employ the Spectral Clustering algo-rithm to identify clusters. The learned representations of nodes by a certain algorithm are the inputfeatures of the clustering algorithm. In this experiment the percentage of training edges varies from25% to 95% by a step of 20%, for the rest we use the same configuration as in the above experiment.
Figure 3: (a) Sensitivity of Gap to the size of node’s neighborhood on the node clustering task and(b) the run time comparison of Gap and cane using two real and two synthetic datasetsChitecture. For this experiment We include two randomly generated graphs, using ErdosRenyi (ERG)and BarabasiAlbert (BAG) models. ERG has 200K edges, and BAG has 1.5M edges. Figure 3(b)clearly shows that Gap is at least 2 times faster than cane in all the graphs.
