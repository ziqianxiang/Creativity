Figure 1: A multi-hop example chosen from the HotpotQA development set. Several documentsare given as context to answer a question. We show two possible “reasoning chains” that leverageconnections (shared entities or coreference relations) between sentences to arrive at the answer. Thefirst chain is most appropriate, while the second requires a less well-supported inferential leap.
Figure 2: The BERT-Para variant of our proposed chain extractor. Left side: we encode each doc-ument paragraph jointly with the question and use pooling to form sentence representations. Rightside: a pointer network extracts a sequence of sentences.
Figure 3: Examples of different chains picked up by our chain extractor on the development set ofHotpotQA. The first shows a standard success case, the second shows success on a less commonquestion type, and the third shows a failure case.
