Figure 4: Term D•	Large δ Improves Generalization. Zaheer et al. (2018) suggest that one should use large δ suchas 10-3 to improve generalization but with only empirical studies. In Theorem 2, it can be seenclearly that the growth rate of ∆t is slower for large δ, which in result improves generalization.
