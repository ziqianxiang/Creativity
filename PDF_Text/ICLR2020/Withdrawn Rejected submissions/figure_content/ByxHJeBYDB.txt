Figure 1: Real and predicted evaluation accu-racy curves, see text on the left for details.
Figure 2: Discretization procedure where xt is the discretized sequence. It is represented in fixed-precision encoding with 2 base-8 digits per number, so each symbol si corresponds to 3 bits ofprecision. Weights of symbols are decayed with parameter β according to their significance, so themore significant digit has weight 1 and the other has weight β .
Figure 3: Synthetic curves generated by discrete Transformer decoder with weighted cross-entropyloss together with the histogram of estimated α values. In the generation process we used a uniformdistribution and the histogram approximates it well.
Figure 4: Synthetic curves generated by continuous Transformer decoder with L2 loss together withthe histogram of α values that shows collapse.
Figure 5: SimPLe: π is the policy, the en-vironment model, and T the set of collectedtrajectories.
Figure 6: Test accuracy plots for all considered tasks. Each plot shows the minimum, mean andmaximum accuracy aggregated over 4 runs of each experiment.
