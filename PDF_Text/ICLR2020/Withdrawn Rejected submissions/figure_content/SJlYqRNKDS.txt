Figure 1: Expected regret with different B ’s(note that curves for B = 2 and 4 overlap).
Figure 2: Results on CIFAR-10. Top: ResNet56; Bottom: ResNet110. Note that the training error(%) is plotted in log scale.
Figure 3: Results on CIFAR-10 for the proposed method with all four block construction schemesand the baselines. Top: ResNet56; Bottom: ResNet110. The training error (%) is plotted on alogarithmic scale.
Figure 4: Coefficient of variation of {σ2}i∈gb for all the blocks with B.1. The blocks with higherindices in the abscissa belong to deeper layers.
