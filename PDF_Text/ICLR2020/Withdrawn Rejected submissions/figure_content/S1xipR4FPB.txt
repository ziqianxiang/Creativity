Figure 1: (a-e) Student test accuracy (Higgs) and test AUC (Evergreen and MAGIC) when com-pressing a 500 tree random forest into a compact forest. (f) For all datasets, GAN-TSC studentsincrease test time throughput 25 to 336-fold over teacher with less than 1.2% loss of accuracy.
Figure 2: Student performance for L2 logit-matching compression on CIFAR-10 (see Sec. 4), aver-aged over 3 independent student training runs. The teacher and student are NIN and LeNet with testaccuracies of 78.1% and 66.2% (red dashed curve in (a)) when trained without compression.

Figure 4: Without compression, a random forest student is trained for the original supervised learn-ing task on MAGIC using only training data (‘Student Only’), only GAN data, or a mixture oftraining and GAN data.
