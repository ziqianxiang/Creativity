Figure 1: Overview of our cleaning approach for 1-shot learning with noisy examples. We usethe class name admiral to crawl noisy images from web and create an adjacency graph based onvisual similarity. We then assign a relevance score to each noisy example with a graph convolutionalnetwork (GCN). Relevance scores are displayed next to the images.
Figure 2: Examples of clean images (left) for 1-shot classification, cumulative histogram of thepredicted relevance for noisy images (middle), and representative noisy images (right), each havingits position in the (descending) ranked list according to relevance and relevance value reported below.
Figure 3: (a) Number of additional images per class c sampled from YFCC-100M for all novel classesof Low-Shot ImageNet. (b) Number of classes per group, when |XZc | is sampled logarithmically intogroups. (c) Accuracy improvement ∆ Acc (difference of accuracy between our method with noisyexamples and the baseline without noisy examples) for prototype classifier, for same groups as in (b).
