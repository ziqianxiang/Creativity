Figure 1: Left: lean images contain mostly geometric features: edges (left), faces (center), anddePth information (right), which are Projections of a 3D model. Center: Birdâ€™s-eye view of one ofthe areas we used. Right: a toP view of a city area (buildings are marked as white) where colorindicates the localization success rate of the network from red (high) to blue (low). Note how oPensPaces are more distinct than narrow streets.
Figure 2: (a)-(b) Illustration in 2D of the evaluation measures for geo-matching (a) and geo-interpolation (b). The real measures are 4D in nature. (c) Example of sampling positions on aarea of the map. For the training set: green indicates valid samples and red invalid samples. For thetest set: blue indicates valid samples and orange invalid samples (please zoon-in on screen).
