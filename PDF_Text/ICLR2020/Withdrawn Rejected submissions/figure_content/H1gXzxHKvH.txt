Figure 1: Deep 2FBSDE neural network architecture. The blocks F C1,2 are fully connectedlayers with linear activations while the LST M block represents recurrent layers of stacked LSTMcells with standard nonlinear activations. These layers are parameterized by θ and shared temporally.
Figure 2: The 2FBSDE solution is very similar tothe analytical solution for a scalar linear system.
Figure 3: Cartpole Swing-up Task: 2FBSDE is most aware of the presence of control multiplicativenoise and uses least control effort to perform the task. This is evident from the cart velocity plot, adirectly actuated state, which tries to stay as close to zero as possible.
Figure 4: Quadcopter Reach and Hover task: 2FBSDE clearly out-performs both FBSDE andiLQG, as indicated by the smaller variance in all states.
Figure 5: Comparison of 2FBSDE and iLQG for Human Arm system: Plots show terminal costversus additive (Σ) and control multiplicative noise standard deviations (σ). The FBSDE resultsare omitted as failure (divergence) occurred in all test trials. When additive noise is varied (left),2FBSDE outperforms iLQG at lower Σ and performance deteriorates much slower than iLQG as Σincreases. When multiplicative noise is varied (right), iLQG exhibits very erratic behaviour while theterminal cost gradually increases with σ for 2FBSDE.
Figure 7: Single control trajectory as well as mean and variance of 2FBSDE on Human Arm. Thesingle trajectory demonstrates the feasibility of the resulting controls.
Figure 8: Comparison of 2FBSDE, FBSDE and iLQG on the quadcopter velocities and angular rates.
Figure 9: Phase plot at control multiplicative standard deviation σ = 0.1 and additive noise standarddeviation Σ = 0.1I. The yellow circle denotes the starting point, and yellow star denotes the target.
Figure 10: Quadcopter state trajectories of 2FBSDE for 3 seconds. The plots demonstrate thecontroller’s capability to reach and hover.
