Figure 1: Illustration of GT-Net Algorithm. The red squares indicate the newly added filters of eachlayer in (a), and newly added layers of each block in (b), respectively.
Figure 2: Different growing filters strategies: GT-filters Alg, Random, Order. Left subfigure is thetraining process, and right is corresponding testing accuracy. After growing finished, there will be alearning rate decay and go on training for some epochs.
