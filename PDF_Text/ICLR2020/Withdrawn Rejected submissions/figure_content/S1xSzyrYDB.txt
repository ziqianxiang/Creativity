Figure 2: (a): Two waves with a phase shift. The above wave x represented by Xt = Sin 篙 + 0.3 Sin 1j6∏twith 0 ≤ t ≤ 140 and the below x0 is phase shifted wave of x with 30 delay. (b): The graphsobtained from the left waves by the operation in Section 2.2 with ws = 20, ss = 15, euclideandistance as d and ε = 4.5. (c): The subgraphs of the left graphs whose are equivalence up to cyclicorder of vertices.
