Figure 1: An example of two-dimensionalPoinCare embeddings computed by a hyperbolicneural network trained on MNIST, and evaluatedadditionally on Omniglot. Ambiguous and un-clear images from MNIST, as well as most ofthe images from Omniglot are embedded near thecenter, while samples with clear class labels (orcharacters from Omniglot similar to one of thedigits) lie near the boundary.
Figure 2: In many computer vision tasks, we want to learn image embeddings that obey the hierar-chical constraints as shown above.
Figure 3: Distributions of the hyperbolic distance to the origin of the MNIST and Omniglot datasetsembedded into the PoinCare ball. Embeddings are computed by a hyperbolic neural network trainedfor the MNIST classification task. We observe a significant difference between these distributions:embeddings of the Omniglot images are much closer to the origin. Table 2 provides the KS distancesbetween the distributions.
