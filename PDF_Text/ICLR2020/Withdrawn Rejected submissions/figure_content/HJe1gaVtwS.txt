Figure 1: The basic architecture of a convolutional neural network (CNN). It consists of tree parts,a feature extractor, an aggregate module and a classifier.
Figure 2: The scatter plots of singular values of bilinear matrices on some typical computer visiondatasets:  CUB (Welinder et al. (2010)), Airplane (Maji et al. (2013)), MIT (Quattoni & Torralba(2009)) and DTD (Cimpoi et al. (2014)). The indices of singular values are along x axis and scaledmagnitudes of singular values are on y axis.  For the ease of illustration, each magnitude is dividedby        its corresponding largest singular value and the scaled magnitudes are in the range of [0, 1].  Weplot the first 100 singular values of all samples on each dataset.
Figure 3: The architecture of the proposed convolutional neural network. RUN denotes the proposedrank-1 update normalization, which takes input the feature map of the last convolutional layer.  BPdenotes the bilinear pooling and CBP represents compact bilinear pooling.
Figure 4: The accuacy changes in the training process.
