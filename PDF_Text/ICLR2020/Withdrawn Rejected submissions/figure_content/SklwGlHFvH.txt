Figure 1: Left panel: The experimental learning curve (solid line) for a depth 4 ReLU networktrained in the NTK regime on quadratic target function on a d = 50 hypersphere is shown along withour analytical predictions for the leading (dotted line) and leading plus sub-leading behavior (dashedline). Right panel: For the same dataset, we plot the dataset-averaged difference between predictionsbased on NTK (gâˆž? ) and the renormalized NTK at scale r (gr?) showing an excellent agreement as rincreases.
