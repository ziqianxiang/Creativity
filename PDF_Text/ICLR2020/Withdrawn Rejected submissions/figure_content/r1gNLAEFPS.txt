Figure 1: Transversal slices ofCT scans. Leftmost image: initial contour provided by a UNet model.
Figure 2: Diagrams for the contour and image evolution methods described in sections 2.1 and 2.2.
Figure 3: Kidney segmentation results. Black and orange contours are ground truth and modelprediction, respectively. Blue, white and orange images are narrow band distance map prediction.
Figure 4: Salient object results. Black and orange contours are ground truth and model prediction,respectively. Blue, white and orange images are narrow band distance map prediction.
