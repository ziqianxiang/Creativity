Figure 1: Top: Our goal is to extract an imagedescriptor incorporating different levels ofgranularity, so that we can solve, classificationand particular object recognition tasks: Thedescriptor is either fed to a linear classifier, ordirectly compared with cosine similarity.
Figure 2: Retrieval and classification accuracies as a function of pooling exponent P* andthe image resolution. At training time, the pooling was P = 3. Note the clear interactionbetween the resolution s* and the pooling exponent p* .
