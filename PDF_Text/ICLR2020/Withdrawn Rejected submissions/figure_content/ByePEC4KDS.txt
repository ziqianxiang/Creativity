Figure 1:	A toy example of two sentence em-bedders and how they might affect nearestneighbor sentences.
Figure 2:	Computation of N2O for two em-bedders, eA and eB, using a corpus C; thenumber of nearest neighbors is given by k. nis the number of queries (q1 . . . qn), whichare sampled uniformly from the corpus with-out replacement. The output is in [0, 1],where 0 indicates no overlap between near-est neighbors for all queries, and 1 indicatesperfect overlap.
Figure 3: Heatmap of N2O for every pair of sentence embedders in Table 1 for k = 50, averagedacross five samples of n = 100 queries; darker colors indicate higher overlap. A larger version ofthis plot (annotated with N2O values) is in Appendix B.
Figure 4: N2O values for a subset of embedders (L: static; R: contextual), k = 50.
Figure 5: Average token overlap between a query and its nearest neighbors (k = 50), averaged overall queries. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals.
Figure 6: Comparison of N2O distribution between each embedder and all others.
