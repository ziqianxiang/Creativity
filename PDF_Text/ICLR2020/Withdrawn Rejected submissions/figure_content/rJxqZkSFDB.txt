Figure 1: Memorization effects are shown in Fig.(a) and (b), where training accuracy continuouslyincreases while testing accuracy first increases and then significantly decreases due to noisy labels.
Figure 2: Construction elements for fi (cf. left table) and some approximated curves as examples(cf. right figure). Target is an example of the ground-truth R(t) to approximate.
Figure 3: Comparison of the search space (cf. the middle figure) and search algorithm (cf. the rightfigure) on the synthetic data.
Figure 4: Comparison on testing accuracy between the proposed and other human-designed meth-ods. Top to bottom: MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. Best testing accuracy of each method isreported in Appendix B.1.
Figure 5: Comparison on R(t) between the proposed (automatically searched from the data) andCo-teaching (note that Co-teaching+ uses the same R(t) as Co-teaching). Top to bottom: MNIST,CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.
Figure 6: Comparison between the proposed search and other HPO algorithm. CIFAR-10 is used.
Figure 7: Comparison on precision of clean samples between the proposed method and Co-teaching.
