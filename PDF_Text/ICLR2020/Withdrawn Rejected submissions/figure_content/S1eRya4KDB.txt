Figure 1: Word similarity results in Spearman rank correlationWord-level Sentiment Analysis Results. The word-level sentiment analysis task isconducted on the dataset of single-word entries. The DLJT2 model outperforms other wordembedding models by incorporating sentiment information into the learning processes, asshown in Fig.2. Compared to the state-of-the-arts, our model fails to exceed the outcomeof the best method on average accuracy. Encouragingly, the BESWE model shows an evenbetter performance in tackling the low-frequency words.
Figure 2: Word-level sentiment analysis results8Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2020Sentence-level Sentiment Analysis Results. The working performance of the proposedmodel is further evaluated on the sentence-level sentiment analysis task. From Fig.3, we seethat SE-HyRank has a better performance than any other algorithms in average accuracy.
Figure 3: Sentence-level sentiment analysis resultsEffects of λ1 and λ2 . The hyperparameters in BESWE, i.e. regulatory factors λ1 and λ2 , areused to represent the semantic and the sentiment information. The settings of the involvingparameter can be therefore determined. The values of λ1 and λ2 are varied within thecollection of {1, 0.75, 0.5, 0.25, 0.1, 0.05, 0.02, 0.01}. Firstly, the value of λ1 is set as {1,0.75, 0.5, 0.25, 0.1, 0.05, 0.02, 0.01}. When λ2 = 1, we name BESWE as BESWE#1 andλ2 = 0.75 as BESWE#2, and so on so forth. Correspondingly, the value of λ2 is also pickedfrom the same set and named from BESWE#9 to BESWE#16 in the same order. Totally,we get 16 different models.
Figure 4: Sensitivity of λ1 and λ2 on BESWE with Sentence-level Sentiment AnalysisThe sentence-level sentiment analysis reaches the highest accuracy 71.64% at the pointλ1 = 0.05 and λ2 = 0.02. For the analysis of low-frequency sentences, the optimal values ofλ1 and λ2 are 0.1 and 0.01, which results in an accuracy of 79.92%.
