Figure 1: The effect of the BM method. Samples are plotted as blue dots. Left to right: MCMC,MED, HE and BM. All methods are run for 200 iterations With the same initialization.
Figure 2: The acceleration effect of W-AIG flow and the strength of adaptive restart (ODE level).
Figure 3: The acceleration effect of W-AIG flow and the strength of adaptive restart (particle level).
Figure 4: Comparison of different methods on Bayesian logistic regression, averaged over 10 inde-pendent trials. The shaded areas show the variance over 10 trials. Top: BM; Bottom: MED. Left:Test accuracy; Right: Test log-likelihood.
