Figure 1: An illustration of the missing mode and boundary distortion problems of DDAN. In thejoint space, the target distribution misses source mode 2, while the source distribution can onlypartly cover the target mode 2 in the target distribution and the target distribution can only partlycover the source mode 1 in the source distribution.
Figure 2: The architecture of our Dual Generator-Discriminator Deep Code Domain AdaptationNetwork (Dual-GD-DDAN). The generators GS and GT take the sequential code tokens of thesource domain and target domain in vectorial form respectively and map this sequence to the jointlayer (i.e., the joint space). The discriminators DS and DT are invoked to discriminate the sourceand target data. The source classifier C is trained on the source domain with labels. We note that thesource and target networks do not share parameters and are not identical.
Figure 3: A 2D t-SNE projection for the case of the FFmpeg â†’ LibPNG domain adaptation. Theblue and red points represent the source and target domains in the joint space respectively. In bothcases of the source and target domains, data points labeled 0 stand for non-vulnerable samples anddata points labeled 1 stand for vulnerable samples.
Figure 4: An example of two source code functions (with some parts omitted for brevity) in theC programming language obtained from the VLC (Left) and LibPNG project (Right). These twosource code examples highlight the same vulnerability due to the misuse of the memcpy function.
