Figure 1: A comparison between S-RSVD and RSVD based on (a) number of principal components,(b) sample size, (c) data distribution, (d) explicit versus implicit mean-centering, (e) the power valueq, and (f) the difference of their accuracies with respect to the power value q and the data distribution.
Figure 2: The effect of mean-centering on (a) handwritten digits and (b) facial data. In each sub-figure, the top row is the original image, the rows in the middle and bottom are the S-RSVD andRSVD reconstructed images, respectively. The reconstruction errors are shown on top of each image.
