Figure 1: Explanations for the MNIST digits 9 and 3, generated by: VarGrad (Adebayo et al., 2018),SmoothGrad (Smilkov et al., 2017), LIME (Ribeiro et al., 2016), and NormLIME (ours).
Figure 2: A LIME-based Local Explanation using the input pixels as features. On the right, greenand red indicate pixels whose presence/absence offers support for the class label “3”. On the left,we show the 20 pixels with the largest weights.
Figure 3: Example survey questions.
Figure 4: Prediction errors on MNIST as the least important features are gradually removed from: (a)the input. (b) the output of the last convolutional layers. The horizontal axis indicate the percentageof of features removed. The vertical axis shows absolute error in log scale.
