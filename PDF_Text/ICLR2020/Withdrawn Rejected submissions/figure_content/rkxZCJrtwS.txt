Figure 1: Computation graph for Qi.
Figure 2: Visualization of critic surfaces: (a) return-timestep curves; (b-e) intermediate critic Sur-faces at epoch 1 and 10 for original DDPG, only Vsi Qi regularization, only Vai Qi regularization,and both regularization respectively; (f and g) converged critic surfaces and ground truth of Q atepoch 75. The black curves on Q surfaces demonstrate πθ (s) at corresponding epochs.
Figure 4: Learning curves of different algorithms (with “Hybrid” being ours) on all 7 tasks, summa-rized over 16 runs with random initialization for each algorithm. Returnmean and Return.historyare demonstrated in the first and second row respectively. Solid curves represent mean reward over16 runs, and shaded area shows its standard deviation.

Figure 5: Comparison of the hybrid algorithm with cosine angle regularization with un-regularizedDDPG. In all examples, our hybrid algorithm achieves similar or better performance than pureDDPG.
Figure 6: Comparison of the hybrid algorithm with L2 norm regularization with un-regularized SAC.
