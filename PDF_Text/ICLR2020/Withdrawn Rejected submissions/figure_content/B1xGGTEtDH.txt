Figure 1: A simple example of how to prove the Register Model. The values x1, . . . , xn are inputsto the network, and the value PjM=1 σj is the output. Each cell represents one neuron. Each σi is ofthe form ψi ◦ ρ ◦ φi , where ψi and φi are affine functions and ρ is the activation function.
Figure 2: A layer with square activation functions is equivalent to multiple layers with only a singlesquare activation function in each layer. The other neurons use the identity activation function,denoted ι.
Figure 3: The thick lines delimit groups of layers; the zth group computes ..., σiβi. The inputs to the network are ʃi,..., χn, depicted at the bottom. Theoutputs from the network are G1,..., Gm, depicted at the top. The identity activation function R → R is denoted l.
