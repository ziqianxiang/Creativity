Figure 1: The structure of the variational distribution. The left box shows the amortization, which fits Î¼i-s andRij -s from their related prior kernel and observations. The right part shows the generation process of fi -s.
Figure 2: The first two plots compare predictive distributions of full GP and LAIN with K = 10. The rightthree plots show how SVGP, AIGP, and LAIN perform with a very small number of inducing points/neighbors.
Figure 3: ELBO trajectories of LAIN withand without inference networks.
