Figure 1: We use a GAN-like deep architecture to learn an image encoding z on unlabeled trainingdata that will be suitable for few-shot recognition in testing. Our unsupervised training integratesadversarial, self-supervision, and metric learning. The figure illustrates our first contribution thatextends the vanilla GAN (the red dashed line) with regularization so the encoding z0 of a “fake”image is similar to the randomly sampled code z0 which has been used for generating the “fake”image. The self-supervision task is to predict the rotation angle of rotated real training images.
Figure 2: Details of the discrimina-tor from Fig. 1 with three heads: dis-criminating head, encoding head androtation-prediction head.
Figure 3: Our second contribution is to use metric learningof the discriminator shown in Figures 1, 2. We compilea set of training triplets hanchor, positive, negativei forestimating the standard triplet loss.
Figure 4: Our image masking with rectangular patches for Mini-Imagenet. In every row, the imagesare organized from left to right in the descending order by their estimated distance to the original(unmasked) image.
