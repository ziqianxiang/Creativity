Figure 1: Overview of the proposed algorithm and probabilistic model.
Figure 2: Visualization of the learned predictor embeddings. Each dot in the figures represents a predictorprojected on 2D plane using UMAP. One the left, the predictors were first clustered based on which instancesthey make mistakes on and then colored and shaped based on which cluster they belong to (in the embeddingspace, predictors that make similar mistakes tend to cluster together). In the middle, the predictors are coloredbased on their false positive rate. On the right, they are colored based on their false negative rate.
