Figure 1: (a) Distribution of activations from three different image types at a single node underconsideration. Noised images tend to have higher activations at this node than the background im-ages. Clean images have activations similar to the background images. (b) Distribution of empiricalp-values for clean and noised images at the same node considered in the left panel. Higher activa-tions from noised images (as compared to the background) create larger number of smaller p-values.
Figure 2: (a) Distribution of subset scores for test sets of 500 images. Test sets containing all naturalimages had lower than scores than test sets containing noised images. Higher proportion of noisedimages resulted in higher scores. (b) ROC curves for each of the noised cases as compared to thescores from test sets containing all natural images. The AUROC values for all cases are reported inTable 1.
