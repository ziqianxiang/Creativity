Figure 1: Desired behavior of a DPN to indicate the three different uncertainties.
Figure 2: Dirichlet distributions become flatter as the precision is reduced (from (a) to (b)) and the densitiesmove to the edges as the concentration parameters become fractional i.e αc ∈ (0, 1).
Figure 3: Visualizing the uncertainty measures for different data-points for DPN(β = 0.0) in the top row andfor DPN(β = 0.5) in the bottom row.
