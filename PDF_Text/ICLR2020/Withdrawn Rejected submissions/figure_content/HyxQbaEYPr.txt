Figure 1: Above (left) we see the % of training set points assigned weight 0 by SRatio at optimalÎ² values for each complex (BT, RF) and simple model (Tree, SVM) combination on the 6 UCIdatasets. We see that < 1% of the training set has weights 0 in all cases. Above (right) we analyzewhy intuitively our reweighting seems to work by considering the % of nearest neighbors that havezero weight, high weight, and in-between weight. Results are averaged over all complex-simplemodel combinations. Both plots represent averaged values over 10 random train/test splits with 95%confidence intervals.
