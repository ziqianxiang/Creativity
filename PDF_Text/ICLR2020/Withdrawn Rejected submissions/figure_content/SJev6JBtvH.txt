Figure 1: Random projections of samples from a 100-dimensional Mixture of Gaussians Distribu-tion.
Figure 2: Learning curve for the Mixture of Gaussian Experiment. Average (across experiments)train and test neg-log-likelihoods are plotted along with their Â±1 standard deviation region.
Figure 3: Bar plots showing the relative weighting of the mixture components in the learned densitiesin the Mixture of Gaussians experiment. Here it can be seen that each of the 5 learned densities useonly approximately 12 out of the 20 modes to explain the data.
Figure 4: Histograms of the negative log-likelihood of the ground truth distribution, evaluated onsamples from the ground-truth distribution (top-left), and samples from each of the learned distribu-tions in the Mixture of Gaussians experiment. As it can be seen, only about a third of samples fromeach learned distribution have negative log-likelihood close to the ground-truth sample average.
Figure 5: Samples from learned densities which are parameterized as Mixture of Gaussians. Randomprojections (columns) of samples from different learned densities (rows), are overlaid on samplesfrom the target Mixture of Gaussians distribution. The bottom row displays the ground-truth samplesunobstructed for reference.
