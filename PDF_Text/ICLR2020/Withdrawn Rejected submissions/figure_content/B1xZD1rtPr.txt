Figure 1: Example of the evolution of the IB decoder with growing β. (a) The bifurcation diagram;each color corresponds to one component of the representation X ∈ X and depicts the decoderPβ(y = 0 | ^), inthesimplex [0,1]. The black dots correspond to the input distributionp(y = 0 | x).
Figure 2: Same as Figure 1 for the dualIB solutions with the Cydyu0alIB matriX. (a) The representationsbifurcate at the critical values of β. (b) Critical points appear when an eigenvalue (color) crosses theβ-1 (black) line. (c) Near these points there is critical slowing down and the numbers of iterationsof Algorithm 1 diverge.
Figure 3: The IB’s and dualIB’s Information Plane. (a) IY vs. IX for the two algorithms. Theblack dots are the dualIB critical points, βcdualIB , and the grey triangles are the IB critical points,βcIB. The corresponding distortion functions are shown in the inset. (b) The functions IXIB (β) andIXdualIB(β). Both curves are monotonic and concave between the critical points. The inset indicatesthe relative difference between the curves, where the alternating order of the critical points is clearlyobserved. (c) Similarly, IYIB (β) and IYdualIB (β ) are monotonic and piece-wise concave. The relativediscrepancy between the information curves is clearly minimized at the dualIB critical points (inset).
Figure 4: The IB,s and dualExpIB,s behavior over data sampled from P(y | x)	〜N(0, a + b| sin(cπx)∣) andP(X)〜U(-1, 1). (a) The decoder Pe(y | ^) as a function of y for someX ∈ ( — 1, 1) at log2(β) = 4. (b) The Information Plane with respect to Y, I(Y; Y) vs. I(X; X). (c)The Li- expected loss, Ep(X) [∣∣P(y | x) - Pe (^ | x)k], as a function of the trade off parameter β.
