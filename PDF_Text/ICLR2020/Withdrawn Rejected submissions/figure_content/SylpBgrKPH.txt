Figure 1: Unconfoundedness with missing values. X represents a the complete covariates, andM a missing data mechanism, X * represents the observed incomplete covariates, confounding thetreatment assignment. The formalism of Pearl (1995) and Richardson & Robins (2013) is used.
Figure 2: Graphical representation of the model underlying MissDeepCausal. Z represents theunobserved latent confounders of the treatment W and the effect Y . X represents a proxy for theconfounders, and M a missing data mechanism; X* represents the observed incomplete covariates.
Figure 3: Estimated ATE via regression adjustment; covariates generated from a DLVM,(logistic-)linear model specification for (e, μo, μι); results with Z_true results are obtained usingthe true confounders Z .
Figure 4: Estimated ATE for 10% of missing values; covariates are generated according to LRMF;Z_true results are obtained using the true ConfoUnders Z.
Figure 5: Estimated ATE for 10% of missing values; covariates are generated according to DLVM;Z_true results are obtained using the true ConfoUnders Z.
Figure 6: Estimated ATE for different amounts of missing values with regression estimation;p = 100 covariates, n = 1, 000 observations, d = 3 latent confounders, logistic-linear model speci-fication for (e, μo, μι); top: LRMF; bottom: DLVM.
Figure 7: Estimated ATE for different amounts of missing values with doubly robust estimation;p = 100 covariates, n = 1, 000 observations, d = 3 latent confounders, logistic-linear model speci-fication for (e, μo, μι); top: LRMF; bottom: DLVM.
Figure 8: Estimated ATE with MDC.mi + doubly robust estimation for different choices of B;DLVM setting, n = 1, 000 observations, d = 3 latent confounders, logistic-linear model specifica-tion for (e, μo, μι).
