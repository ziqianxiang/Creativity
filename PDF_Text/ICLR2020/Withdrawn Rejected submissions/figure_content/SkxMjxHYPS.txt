Figure 1: Filters per layer using the proposed templates for filter redistribution in the VGG 19 model.
Figure 2: Average Accuracy versus Parameters in CIFAR-10 (top row) and CIFAR-100 (bottom row)datasets using templates with VGG, ResNet, Inception and MobileNet. Curves are created by reduc-ing models using width multiplier scaling. An arbitrary vertical line in the plot compares templateseffects using the same amount of parameters. An arbitrary horizontal line compares parameters forreaching the same accuracy. Errors bars denote maximum and minimum of three repetitions.
Figure 3: Accuracy versus Memory Footprint (batch size = 64) in CIFAR-10 (top row) and CIFAR-100 (bottom row) datasets using templates with VGG, ResNet, Inception and MobileNet. Curvesare created by reducing models using width multiplier scaling. An arbitrary vertical line in the plotcompares templates effects in accuracy using the same amount of memory. An arbitrary horizontalline compares memory consumption for reaching the same accuracy. Dashed lines crosses in theoriginal model with no reduction.
Figure 4: Accuracy versus Inference Time (batch size = 64) in CIFAR-10 (top row) and CIFAR-100(bottom row) datasets using templates with VGG, ResNet, Inception and MobileNet. Curves arecreated by reducing models using width multiplier scaling. An arbitrary vertical line in the plotcompares templates effects in accuracy between models with same inference speed. An arbitraryhorizontal line compares inference time of models with the same accuracy.
Figure 5: Increasing filters per layer is a common design in convolutional models. We apply tem-plates to existing models to change filters distribution. (ResNet shows filters per sets of residualblocks. The number is keep fixed inside them).
