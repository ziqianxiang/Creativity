Figure 1: Discretised continuous control with growing action spaces. We report the mean andstandard error (over 10 random seeds) of the returns during training, with a moving average over thepast 20 episodes. A2 (slow ) is an ablation of A2 that decays at a quarter the rate.
Figure 2: Architecture for GAS with hierarchical clustering. For clarity, only two levels of hierarchyare shown. The dark shaded regions identify the locations that are pooled over before state-value orgroup-action scores are computed.
Figure 3: StarCraft micromanagement with growing action spaces. We report the mean and standarderror (over 5 random seeds) of the evaluation winrate during training, with a moving average overthe past 500 episodes.

Figure 5: Final learned policies of StarCraft micromanagement unit control with growing actionspaces. Scenarios shown from left to right at time 0, 3, 5, 10, 15 seconds. Top to bottom thescenarios are: 60 marines vs 65 marines, 50 hydralisks vs 50 hydralisks, 95 zerglings vs 50 marines.
