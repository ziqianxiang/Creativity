Figure 1: Reconstruction loss vs. embedding dimensionality for a variety of heuristic and variationalmodels. For the variational model (Var.), we vary the capacity limit, C. Notice how the reconstructionloss flattens out at lower values for higher values of C. The heuristic models are denoted by PT andGST for Prosody Transfer and Global Style Tokens. Figure B.1 in the appendix shows how the KLterm changes when varying C as well as the KL weight, Î² .

Figure 4:	Comparing same-text transfer (STT), inter-text transfer (ITT), and prior samples (Prior) forvariational models with and without text dependencies in the variational posterior (Var+Txt and Var,respectively). Error bars show 95% confidence intervals for the subjective evaluations.
