This algorithm starts from decoupled low dimensional systems andgradually transforms to the coupled original system with complex structure. Then the complexneural networks can be trained by the HTA with a better accuracy. The convergence of the HTAfor any given L is proved for the non-convex optimization. Then existence of solution path Î¸(L) isdemonstrated theoretically for the convex case although that it exists numerically in the non-convexcase. Several numerical examples have used to demonstrate the efficiency and feasibility of HTA.
