Figure 1: Sample edit generated by our span-copying model on the WikiAtomicEdits dataset on theedit representation task of Yin et al. (2019). B and C represent the BPE start/end tokens. The modelfirst copies a long initial span of text Copy(1 : 28). The next two actions generate the tokens “and”and “translator”, as in a standard sequence generation models. Then, the model again copies a longspan of text and finally generates the end-of-sentence token (not shown).

Figure 7: Length histograms of Copy(∙ : ∙) actions during beam decoding in log-y scale. Beammerging is disabled for computing the statistics of this experiment. For BFPSmaii 43.7% of the copyactions are single-copy actions, whereas for BFPmediUm 37.6% of the actions are single-copy actions.
