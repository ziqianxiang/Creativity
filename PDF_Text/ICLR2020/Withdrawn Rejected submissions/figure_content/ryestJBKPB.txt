Figure 1: (Best seen in colour) Examples of real-world networks modelled as directed hypergraphsin which labels on the vertices can be represented by probability distributions. To the left is a co-authorship network in which vertices are authors, hyperedges are collaborations (documents), anddirections are citations between documents. Research topic interests of authors can be naturallyrepresented by probability distributions (labels are shown for a couple of authors in the figure). Tothe right is a recommendation network in which vertices are products, hyperedges are users andcontain all the products bought by them, and directions represent user similarity (two-way). Productratings can be naturally represented by probability distributions (labels are shown for a couple ofproducts in the figure). Please see Section 1 for more details.
