Figure 1: Attack methodology comparison. In existing studies, attackers should decide the triggerpattern and target class pairs in the trojaning phase. In contrast, our method inserts a general trojanin the trojaning phase and decide the target class in the trigger phase.
Figure 2: Trojan Insertion. We train a trigger generator together with the front-end model. The leftside shows the network architecture of our generator. It accepts a target image and uses ResNet50pre-trained convolutional layers to encode it into a 1024-length vector. Then We use multiple trans-posed convolutional layers to generate the trigger pattern from the vector. The trigger pattern willreplace part of the source image to form the trigger image. Then it will be fed into the model to betrojaned and trained to predict the target label. To keep the original functionality. Normal sourceimages will also be fed into the model and trained to predict the source label.
