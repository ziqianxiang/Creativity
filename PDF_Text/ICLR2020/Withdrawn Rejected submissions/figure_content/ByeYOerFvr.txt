Figure 1: Schematic overview of our proposed solution using mixture density networks.
Figure 2: Sample predictions by the MDN3 on coco-val. Instance scale variance (in X and Ydimensions) is shown by an ellipse around the predicted center. Blue and red color of boxes andellipses represent the two different modes (the third mode is redundant as shown in Table 1).
