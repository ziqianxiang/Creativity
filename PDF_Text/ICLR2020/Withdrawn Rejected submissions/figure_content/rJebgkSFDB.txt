Figure 1: The inference framework of our meta variational random features (MetaVRF) with a longshort-term memory (LSTM) network (t is the task index). The meta-learner employs an LSTMnetwork to infer random Fourier features from the support set St of the current task and bases ωt-1of previous tasks, which explores task dependency to extract shared knowledge. The base-learner is aclassifier with kernels obtained by variational features from the meta-learner.
Figure 2: Illustration of MetaVRF in a directed graphical model. (x, y) is a test sample in the queryset Qt. The base ωt is inferred by conditioning on both the base ωt-1 from the previous task and thesupport set St of the current task.
