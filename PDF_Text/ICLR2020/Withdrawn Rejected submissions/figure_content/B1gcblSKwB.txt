Figure 1: (a) The meta-overfitting phenomenon on MiniImageNet (5-way 1-shot) tasks when in-creasing the number of channels from 32 to 128 in a 4-layer CNN. (b) The proposed DSD andIHT based Reptile algorithms are effective in closing the gap between training accuracy and testingaccuracy. Bested viewed in color.
Figure 2: Demonstration of overfitting reduction with network pruning: (a) DSD-based Reptile inthe setting of 64-channel and 5-way tasks. (b) IHT-based Reptile in the setting of 128-channel and5-way tasks. In most cases, the gap between training accuracy and testing accuracy reduces as thepruning rate increases, which confirms that both our DSD and IHT-based Reptile approaches canconsiderably ease meta-overfitting.
