Figure 1: Illustration of the filter pruning of a standard convolution. Suppose that there are 4 filtersin Conv1, pruning the third filter will remove the third channel of output feature maps. After that,the third channel in all filters in the next layer (Conv2) should also be removed.
Figure 2: Pruning a depthwise separable convolution. Suppose that there are 4 filters in DepthwiseConv2, pruning the third one, as depicted in red cross, will remove the third channel of both inputand output feature maps due to the parallelism in depthwise convolution. Thus, the correspondingkernels in Pointwise Conv1 and Depthwise Conv2 are also removed, as shown in double crosses.
Figure 3: Illustration of pruning residual blocks following the strategy in (Ding et al. (2019)). Sup-posed that there are 2 filters in Standard Conv1 which is followed by 2 residual blocks. Let LastConv2 and Last Conv3 be the last layers of the two residual blocks, respectively. Pruning the secondfilter in Conv1 will force the second filters in Last Conv2 and Last Conv3 to be removed.
