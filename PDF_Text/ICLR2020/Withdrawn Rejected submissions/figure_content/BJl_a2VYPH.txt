Figure 1: The neighborhood of a data point x in the input space. (a) Traditional training: there existssome data point x0 that the model has never seen before and yields wrong classification, in otherwords, such data point x0 will be an adversarial example. (b) Adding infinite labeled data: this is anideal case that the model has seen all the data points to resist adversarial examples. (c) Constructinga convex outer bound: all data points in this polytope will share the label of x. (d) Mapping neigh-borhood data points: mapping all neighbors to the center x so as to eliminate adversarial examples.
