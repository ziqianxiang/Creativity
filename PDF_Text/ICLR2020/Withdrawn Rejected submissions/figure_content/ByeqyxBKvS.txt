Figure 1: Quantum circuit for creating ρ0 = |0ih0| 0ρ00+ |1ih1| 0 ρ000. The circuit is to be read fromleft-to-right. Each wire at left shows its corresponding input state. The vertical rectangle denotes thecyclic permutation operator P on K, L, K defined in (10). H is the Hadamard gate, and the wastebins show partial trace. The measurement on the first quantum state is in computational basis.
