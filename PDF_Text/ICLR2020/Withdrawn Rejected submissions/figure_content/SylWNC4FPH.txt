Figure 1: A schematic illustration of UI layout completion problems. The elements with solidbounding boxes are already added by the designer, and those with dashed bounding boxes arepredicted to complete the layout given the solid elementsâ€”the partial layout. The tree on the rightshows the UI structure with the line colors and styles corresponding the UI elements on the left. Thefigure is best viewed in color.
Figure 2: A schematic illustration of Recursive Transformer for decoding the tree on the left. Thesame Transformer model is applied to decoding the children for each parent, top-down from the root.
Figure 3: Examples of predicted layouts given a partial layout, with respect to the correspondinggroundtruth complete layout.
