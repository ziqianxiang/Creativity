Figure 1: Schematic diagrams of localized generations.
Figure 2: Qualitative evaluation of the randomly-selected conditional prior samples.
Figure 3: The reference training samples and their corresponding generated images of the LocalVAE with α =1. The leftmost column shows the reference training samples. Each row visualizesthe generated images conditioned on the reference sample. The images shown in the same columnshare their latent code. The trained model extracted the color information as the global features andother information as the local features.
Figure 4: Interpolation of Local VAE’s latent space. Each i-th row corresponds to the reconstructedimage with the latent code zi modified in the range of [-2, 2].
