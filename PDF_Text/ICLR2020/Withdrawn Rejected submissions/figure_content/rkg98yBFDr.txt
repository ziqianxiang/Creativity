Figure 1: Components of SDIM framework. (1)The encoder Eφ takes input x, and produces pairsof local feature maps Lφ(x) and global representations Eφ(x). (2) The MI evaluation network Tωmaps every possible positive pairs and negative pairs to MI scores specified by corresponding MIlower-bound. Negative pairs are simply obtained by combine all unpaired local feature maps andglobal representations within the same mini-batch. (3) Supervised constraints are imposed on theglobal representations X = Eφ(x) with loss JNLL + JLM for generative classification. The trueclass conditionals are maximized, while false class conditionals are minimized. See following partsof this section for details.
