Figure 1: Left: Instance of a Barabsi-Albert random network with |N| = 10 that was used in our analyses(unless otherwise stated). Middle: stereotypical clustered network with |N | = 12 with three (nc = 3) fullyconnected clusters of four nodes (sc = 4) each. Right: the clustered network in balanced form produced byrandom rewiring of link pairs (preserves degree distribution). These networks were used in our analysis of theeffectiveness of information aggregation and attack (i) in clustered vs. balanced networks and (ii) for spreadout vs. focused attack strategies.
Figure 2: (A-B): Information aggregation over time in Barabasi-Albert graph. (A) Baseline scenario. Underthe attack test scenario, a single agent receives a biased signal. (B) Biased signal attack scenario. The upperand lower dashed lines corresponds to the benchmarks E[1{θ = θ}] and E[1{θ = θ}] respectively. Squaremarkers correspond to the accuracy achieved by the De Groot information aggration heuristic in the baselineand biased signal attack scenarios respectively. (C-D) Agents are trained in the absence of any attacker on aBarabasi-Albert graph. (C) Top: Average decline in accuracy conditional on agent id which determines networkposition. Bottom: degree of attacked agent. (D) Effectiveness of conditioning on attacked agent signal strength.
Figure 3: Dynamics of co-evolving attacker and citizen agents on a Barabsi-Albert graph. (A) Red lines areexponentially weighted moving averages. Top: accuracy in the last time step (t = T = 10) over episodes.
