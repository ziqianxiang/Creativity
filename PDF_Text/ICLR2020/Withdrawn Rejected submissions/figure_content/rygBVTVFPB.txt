Figure 1: First row: solutions of RL-WENO (red), WENO (blue) and exact solutions (green). Secondrow: zoom-in views corresponding to the first row.
Figure 2: This figure compares the weights generated by the learned numerical flux policy π RL andthose of WENO. The weights shown in (a) are {wjr- 1 }1=-2; while those in (b) are {wjr+1 }1=-2∙In each of the two plots, the 4 numbers in the upper bracket of each location are the weights of RL-WENO and those in the lower bracket are the weights of WENO. The relative errors of RL-WENOand WENO are 8.0 × 10-3 and 2.5 × 10-2 respectively.
Figure 3: These figures show the total number of grids whose error is under a specific value (i.e. theaccumulated distribution function). The x-axis is the error in logarithmic (base 10) scale. (a) and (c)show the distribution in smooth regions, (b) and (d) are near singularities.
