Figure 1: Neural architecture for (left to right) LSTM, GRU, DeepSets, and our model. Each cell indicateslayer type and output dimension. Color indicates which part of a multiset automaton it corresponds to, thoughonly our model is fully general for multiset automata.
Figure 2: Results for task 1 (left) and task 2 (right). In task 1, the LSTM and GRU models were unableto generalize to examPles larger than seen in training, while DeePSets and our model generalize to all testlengths. For task 2, only our model is able to return the correct units digit for all test lengths. The GRU,LSTM, and DeePSets models fail to learn any behavior beyond random guessing.
