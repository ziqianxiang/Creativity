Figure 1: A closed tableau tree of the Proofof 1 âˆ™ 1=1.
Figure 2: Value and Policy network architectures in PPO.
Figure 4: Comparing the length of proofs found by FLoP (blue) and rlCoP (orange) on the Robinson Arithmetic dataset. All figures arecumulative histograms, vertical axes show the number of proofs, horizontal axes show the length of proofs. Best models are shown for bothFLoP (based on Experiment 3) and rlCoP. Figures (a), (b), (c) correspond to Stage 1, 2, 3 respectively. FLoP found more proofs in all stages.
Figure 5: (a)-(c) - Stages 1-3, training graphs centered at the mean reward, darker bars are delimited by quantiles at 0.25 and 0.75, lighterbars extending from min to max; in total 36 models, 6 models per graph, 20M samples per experiment. Curriculum helps in Stages 2 and 3.
