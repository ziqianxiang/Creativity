Figure 1: Multiple (hyper)spheres as quotient spaces of a topology space on Euclidean space might be foundby gluing process with identifying points. Those separated hyperspheres are assumed to be under the quotientspace conditions (Tu, 2010). Within an individual (hyper)sphere, projection parameters in deep neural networkspreserve a hierarchical structure. The space can be formed in a series: (a), (b), (c), and (d)points in a discrete metric space are finite and isolated, search efforts to satisfy those constraints canbe reduced.
Figure 2: A series of levelwise (l) spheres With a radius (ri) is shown: (a) A radius of an oveall area convergesto ιr0δ (= P∞ r0δl: the sum of radius series) as l goes to infinity where l denotes a level, r° is their initialradius, and δ is the ratio between radiuses (rι,rι-ι), rrl < L (b) The radius of the overall area is boundedto the initial radius r0 of spheres. This bears a resemblance to the process of repeat of Hypersphere packingwhich arranges non-overlapping spheres within a containing space. (c) 2-sphere is defined following (b) whichis appropriate to model a hierarchical structure. This can be generalized with a hypersphere (Sd, d ≥ 3) in ahigher dimensional space.
Figure 4:	Rl,p(Ws(,lg,li-1), wc(l,,gli-1))	=	d(wg(li,,ln-1),wg(li,,lm-1))	+	d(wg(li,,lm-1),	wg(li,,lk-1))	+d(wg(li,,lk-1) , wg(li,,ln-1)) + . . . corresponds to Eq (6) and Rl,c(wc(l,,glk-1)) = d(wc(l,,gli-1) , wc(l,,glj-1)) +d(wc(l,,glj-1), wc(l,,glk-1)) . . . corresponds to Eq (7)Constraints in Eq. 4 Cl := k λk Cl,k can be given as follows:1.	Constraint 1 (C1 ): This constraint describes that a radius of an inner sphere must be smallerthan that of its outer sphere.
