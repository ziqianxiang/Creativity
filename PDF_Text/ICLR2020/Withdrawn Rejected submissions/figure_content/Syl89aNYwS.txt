Figure 1: Workflow for creating decoy-enhanced saliency maps.
Figure 2: An illustrative exam-ple of the swap operator swap-ping image patches between o-riginal and decoy images.
Figure 3: Visualization of saliency maps comparing three state-of-the-art saliency methods with andwithout decoy images generated from three techniques (i.e., our decoy generation method, blurring,and inpainting). More examples can be found in Supplementary Section A14.
Figure 4: Visualization of saliency maps under adversarial attacks. More examples can be found inSupplementary Section A14.
Figure 5: Generating decoys with respect to different DNN layers.
Figure 6: Visualization of saliency maps under different CNN architectures.
Figure A7: A toy example to illustrate why decoys exist.
Figure A8: Cascading randomization on VGG16 network. The figure shows the original saliency map(first column) for the terrier. Progression from left to right corresponds to complete randomization ofthe pretrained VGG16 network weights from the top layer to the bottom layer.
