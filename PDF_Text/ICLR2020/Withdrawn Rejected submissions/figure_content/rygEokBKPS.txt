Figure 1: Illustration of the tiling trick: the same noise is applied on small tile squares.
Figure 2: Success rate of a single shot random attacks on ImageNet vs. the number of tiles used tocraft the attack. On the left, attacks are plotted against InceptionV3 classifier with different noiseintensities ( ∈ {0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.1}). On the right, is fixed to 0.05 and the single shot attack isevaluated on InceptionV3, ResNet50 and VGG16bn.
Figure 3: The cumulative success rate in terms the number of queries for the number of queriesrequired for attacks on ImageNet with = 0.05 in the untargeted (left) and targeted setting (right).
Figure 4: Random attack success rate against InceptionV3 (left), ResNet50 (center), VGG16bn(right) for different noise intensities. We just randomly draw one tiled attack and check if it issuccessful.
Figure 5: Random attack success rate for different noise intensities ∈ {0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.1} (fromright to left) against different architectures. We just randomly draw one tiled attack and check if itis successful.
