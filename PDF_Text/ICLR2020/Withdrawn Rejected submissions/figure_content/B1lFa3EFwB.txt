Figure 1: Comparison between the previous method and the proposed method. As with AII, theproposed method ensure the invariance to the nuisance attribute by deceiving the external attributeclassifier, but the proposed method deceives it deferentially. The detail is explained in Section 4.
Figure 2: Visualizing how AII and the proposed method update the encoder. The arrow in (b, c)represents the gradient vectors. (a) Both methods utilize qφ(a∣z), which represented as counterplotin the figure. (b) AII update fθ by keeping a distribution away from the decision boundary withoutconsidering the information piθ6=j(z). (c) Our proposal considers both the decision boundary and theinformation from the marginal distribution of different attribute piθ6=j (z).
