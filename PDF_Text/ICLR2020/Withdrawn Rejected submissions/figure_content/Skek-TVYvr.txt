Figure 1:	The blue point cloud represents Strain , a sample from a Gaussian Mixture distribution. The redpoints are {g(zi)}m=train ,while {zi}m=train Rd N2(0,I).
Figure 2:	Each dot on the graph represents the average generalization error and the generalization bound ofWGAN with d ∈ {50, 70, 90, 110, 130}.
Figure 3:	The blue points cloud represents S train , a sample from a Gaussian Mixture distribution. The redpoints are {g(zi)}mtrain, while {zi}mrain i七d N2(0, I).
Figure 4:	A representative result of the hypothesis test with the generators in figure 3. In every experiment, wereject H0 if the training loss is larger than T.
Figure 5:	In such a extreme case, the values of training loss and T are stable.
Figure 6:	In every figure, the blue points cloud represents S train , a sample from a Gaussian Mixture distribu-tion. Thered points are {g(zi)}mrain, while {zi}mtrain i七d N2(0,I).
Figure 7:	Though our hypothesis test fails to detect the 24 th generator, it shows that train loss is extremelyclosed to T for the 24 th generator. This unusual acceptance is caused by randomness. In this case, the sampleset Strain is not rich enough to reject H0, at a 0.95 confidential level.
