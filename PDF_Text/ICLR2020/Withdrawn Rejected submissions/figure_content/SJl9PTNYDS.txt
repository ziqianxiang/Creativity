Figure 1: Narrow-band parallel transport convo-lution on point cloud: black and blue points aresample points of the surface (blue). Each kernel(colored dots) is defined on the tangent plane (yel-low). The vectors on the tangent planes that are ofthe same color are in a parallel fashion.
Figure 2: Illustration of a point cloud P sampled from the unit sphere. (a) shows the narrow-bandapproximation (blue boxes) of part of P (in red). (b) is a cross section of (a). (c), (d) show thedistance function P and vector field {~u1x} ({VP P(x)}) on the point cloud. We can see that distancepropagates from the bottom center to the top center reflecting the geometry of the sphere.
Figure 3: Architecture of NPTC-net. The network for segmentation tasks is at the top right withencoding and the network for classification tasks is at the bottom right with encoding. Top 2 maxpooling means taking the maximum two values among all the points in each channel and then con-catenate into one vector representing global feature. ”Tile” means repeating the global feature andconcatenating to each point as extra channels.
Figure 4: Feature Visualization: each feature from low or high level is displayed on 2 point cloudsfrom different categories. High-level activations are in yellow and low-level activations are in blue.
Figure 5: Different strategies induce different vector fields: (a) is the vector field which selects thecorner as the origin of the distance function. (b) is the vector field which selects the middle as theorigin. (c) is the linear combination of two vector fields with different origins. The combinationcoefficients depend on the distance to the origin at each point: ~vx = d(y1, x) ~vx1 - d(y2, x) ~vx2. { ~vi}represent the vector field with the origin yi and d(yi, x) represent the geodesic distance. The absolutevalue of combination coefficient for one vector field will descend to 0 as x approaches the origin toprevent the singularity at the origin.
