Figure 1: Comparison of SimPLe with OTRainbow. Bars represent the number of interactionsrequired by OTRainbow to reach the same score as SimPLe achieves using exactly 100k interactions.
Figure 2: Median human normalized performance across all 26 games. Labels on the Y-axis specifythe type of the algorithm used. Values in the brackets inform about the number of interactions beforethe method was evaluated. Bars represent the median result achieved by each of the approachesaccordingly and are colorized depending on the type of algorithm used.
