Figure 1: Illustration of our proposed approach using the BERT pre-trained sentence encoder. Textclassification tasks are posed as those of span extraction by appending the choices to the input. Simi-larly, regression tasks are posed by appending bucketed values to the input. For question answering,no changes over the BERT approach are necessary. The figure includes four examples from theSQuAD, SST, MNLI, and STS datasets, respectively.
