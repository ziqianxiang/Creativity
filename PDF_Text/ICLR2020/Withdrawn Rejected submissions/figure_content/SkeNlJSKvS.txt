Figure 2: Interpolations of z from ResnetVAE,between the centers of qφ (z|x) of two trainingpoints, and heatmaps of log pλ (z). The left- andright-most columns are the training points.
Figure 1: Sample means from pλ (z) of Resnet-VAE with: (left) Gaussian prior; (right) Real-NVP prior. The last column of each 6x6 gridshows the training set images, most similar to thesecond-to-last column in pixel-wise L2 distance.
