Table 1: Network architectures, training and simulation parameters. The size of the convolutionalkernels are shown in the format: [# features, # channels, width, height] (stride). To describe therange of explored parameters during simulations, we use the format [0.3 : 0.7 :: 0.1, 0.5] ,whichmeans that we vary λ1 from 0.3 to 0.7 by step of 0.1 while λ2 is fixed to 0.5.
