Table 1: Summary of evaluation metrics in DP synthetic data generation. We list applicability ofeach metric to each of the data type. Parts in bold are our new contributions. Evaluation methodswith asterisk * are predictive-model-specific, and their applicability therefore depends on types ofdata that the chosen predictive model is appropriate for. Methods with asterisks ** are equippedwith any any distributional distance of choice such as Wasserstein distance.
Table 2: Accuracy scores of prediction on salary feature evaluated on different values.
Table 3: Wasserstein distance scores on 2-way PCA marginal and on whole dataset, for different â€™s.
Table 4: Algorithmic frameworks for differentially private synthetic data generation. Our newalgorithmic framework (in bold) is the first to combine both DPGAN and autoencoder into oneframework by using GAN to learn generative model in latent space.
