Table 1: Performance comparison of existing metrics (top block), experimental designs (middleblock), and variants of the proposed method (bottom block) on validation and test data sets measuredin terms of Spearmanâ€™s rank correlation coefficient. Bold values show the best performing metricfor each data set and bold+italic values are within a 0.01 error margin of the best performing. Onthe right a visualization of the combined test data results is shown for selected models.
Table 2: Performance comparison on validation and test data sets measured in terms of the Pearsoncorrelation coefficient. Bold values shoW the best performing metric for each data set and bold+italicvalues are Within a 0.01 error margin of the best performing. On the right a visualization of thecombined test data results is shoWn for selected models.
