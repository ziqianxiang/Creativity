Table 1: Feature Imputation on UCI datasets. Missing ratio is 0.5. Categorical and numericaldatasets are respectively evaluated by PFC and NRMSE. Last two rows are trained with fully-observeddata, potentially serving as an upper bound for imputation models. We show mean and standarddeviation over 3 independent runs. For both lower is better.
Table 2: Imputation on Bimodal datasets.. Missing ratio is 0.5. Last two rows are trained withfully-observed data. We show mean and standard deviation over 3 independent runs (lower is better).
Table 3: Imputation. NRMSE onYeast. Lower is better. ∆ < 0.01.
Table 4: Imputation on Categorical datasets. Missing ratio is 0.5. Last two rows are trained withfully-observed data. Evaluated by PFC, lower is better.
Table 5: Imputation on Numerical datasets. Missing ratio is 0.5. Last two rows are trained withfully-observed data. Evaluated by NRMSE, lower is better.
Table 6: Imputation on MNIST+MNIST. Missing ratio is 0.3, 0.5 and 0.7. Last two rows aretrained with fully-observed data. Evaluated by combined errors of two modalities, lower is better.
Table 7: Imputation on MNIST+SVHN. Missing ratio is 0.5. Last two rows are trained withfully-observed data. Evaluated by combined errors of two modalities, lower is better.
Table 8: Imputation on MNIST+SVHN. Missing ratio is 0.3, 0.5 and 0.7. Last two rows are trainedwith fully-observed data. Evaluated by combined errors of two modalities, lower is better.
Table 9: Imputation on MAR/NMAR masking. Missing ratio is based on the values of datafollowing the defined rules above. We show mean and standard deviation over 3 independent runs(lower is better) on Yeast dataset.
Table 10: Imputation on Image+Text datasets.. Missing ratio is 0.5. Image and text modality areevaluated by MSE and PFC respectively. Last two rows are trained with fully-observed data. Weshow mean and standard deviation over 3 independent runs (lower is better). ∆ < 0.01.
