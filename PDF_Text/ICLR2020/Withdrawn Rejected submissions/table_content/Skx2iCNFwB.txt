Table 1: Evaluating the model generalization under different choices of diffusion matrix G(ht, t; v)introduced above. For the last three noise types, we search a suitable parameter σt for each so thatthe diffusion matrix G properly regularizes the model. TTN means testing time noise. Model size iscounted by #Parameters.
Table 2: Testing accuracy results under different levels of non-adversarial perturbations.
Table 3: Model hyper-parameters. We follow the parameter convention in PyTorch (Paszke et al.,2017). “GAP” means global average pooling Zhou et al. (2016).
