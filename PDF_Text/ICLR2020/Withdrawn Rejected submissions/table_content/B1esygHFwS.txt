Table 1: Results on generated setThe results clearly show that regular CPD approaches fail to detect most changes in the seasonalpattern when it comes to a seasonal spike. They also demonstrate that ATR-CSPD performs at leastas well as classical algorithms on detecting change points in seasonal time-series. Indeed, in cate-gories C and D, the impact of the changes on the kernel mean estimate of the windows is minimalor nonexistent, which explains why KCpE and RDR hardly detect them. We can notice that usingdecomposition of the seasonal component helped DS-KCpE for category D, still the detection isfar from ATR-CSPD. A similar explanation can be derived for the next categories. Except for thecategory F, the changes are made only on a minor section of the periods and the statistical impact issmaller.

In all of them, it is not reflected by a drastic change in the mean. Top charts:electricity consumption. Bottom charts: the mean consumption of each day. In orange: periodsrecognized by ATR-CSPD as differentWe can observe that the weekends, in those cases, is characterized by a different shape whetherthe level (mean) changes seem to occur at different places in the time-series. In Figure 3a we caneasily distinguish the working hours of the weekdays, whether on the weekend no drop is observed.
