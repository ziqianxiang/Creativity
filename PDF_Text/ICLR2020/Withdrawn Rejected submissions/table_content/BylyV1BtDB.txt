Table 1: Accuracy and fairness performances on the clean and poisoned synthetic datasets w.r.t.
Table 2: Accuracy and fairness performances on real data for disparate impact. Two types of meth- ods are compared: (1) non-fairness methods: logistic regression (LR), the meta learning by Ren et al. (2018) (ML), and R-GAN (FR-GAN with λ1 = 0); (2) fairness-only methods: FAIRNESS CON- straints (Zafar et al., 2017) (FC), Label bias correction (Jiang & Nachum, 2019) (LBC), and Adversarial debiasing (Zhang et al., 2018) (AD). Also “+ LD” denotes loss defense (Koh et al., 2018) (a data sanitization technique that is applied prior to model training). For FR-GAN, the validation set is 10% of Dtr . For each fairness or accuracy result of the poisoned data, we compare with the clean data result and show the percentage increase or decrease.

Table 3: Accuracy and fairness performances of the meta learning method by Ren et al. (2018) on theclean and poisoned synthetic datasets for different validation set sizes. We used the same z-flippingpoisoning attack described in Section 3.
Table 4: Accuracy and fairness performances on real data for disparate impact where the data ispoisoned using a label flipping attack (Paudice et al., 2018). Two types of methods are compared:(1) non-fairness methods: logistic regression (LR), the meta learning by Ren et al. (2018) (ML),and R-GAN (FR-GAN with λ1 = 0); (2) fairness-only methods: FAIRNESS CONSTRAINTS (Zafaret al., 2017) (FC), Label bias correction (Jiang & Nachum, 2019) (LBC), and Adversarialdebiasing (Zhang et al., 2018) (AD). Also “+ LD” denotes loss defense (Koh et al., 2018) (a datasanitization technique that is applied prior to model training). For FR-GAN, the validation set is10% of Dtr. For each fairness or accuracy result of the poisoned data, we make a comparison withthe clean data result and show the percentage increase or decrease.
