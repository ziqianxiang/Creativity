Table 1: Performance of MMA on 5 repeated runs on CIFAR-10.
Table 2: Performance of MMA on 5 repeated runs on CIFAR-100.
Table 3: Performance of MMA on 5 repeated runs on SVHN (no extra data).
Table 4: A summary of hyper-parameters. Î»U is the hyper-parameter controlling the importance ofthe unlabeled data to the training process.
Table 5: This is the full version of Tabel 1. Performance of MMA on CIFAR-10. Each entry isthe average of 5 repeated runs with standard deviation. The highlighted entries are the two bestperforming methods within each column. The best methods for 500 is max-kmeans and for therest is diff2.aug-direct.
Table 6: This is the full version of Tabel 2. Performance of MMA on CIFAR-100. Each entry is theaverage of 5 repeated runs with standard deviation. The highlighted entries are the two best perform-ing methods within each column. Methods with diversification (kmeans or infoD) consistentlyoutperform their variants without diversification (direct).
Table 7: CIFAR-100. Starting from 2500 random samples trained for 262144 steps, querying 100and training for 16384 steps each time. Each entry is the average of 5 repeated runs with standarddeviation. The highlighted entries are the two best performing methods within each column. Theaccuracy is not significant different from that when query 500 each time (Table 6).
Table 8: This is the full version of Tabel 3. Performance of MMA on SVHN (no extra data). Eachentry is the average of 5 repeated runs with standard deviation. The highlighted entries are thetwo best performing methods within each column. Methods with kmeans diversification generallyoutperforms the other methods.
