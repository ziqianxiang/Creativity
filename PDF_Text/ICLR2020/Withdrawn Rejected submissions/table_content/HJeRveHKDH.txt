Table 1: As can be seen from the table, both generators – probabilistic grammar based (Prob) andneural guided (Guided) lead to improvements (over randomly sampled puzzles) in the time requiredfor the solvers, with the guided solver showing the highest gains.  Note that randomly sampledpuzzles can sometimes be unsolvable – in which case the solver just times out. Further, all values aremeasured in seconds and solvers have a time bound B = 5s.
