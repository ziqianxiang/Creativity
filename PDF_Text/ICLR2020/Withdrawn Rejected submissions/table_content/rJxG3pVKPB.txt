Table 1: Mean squared loss of simple encoder-decoder methods, simple seq2seq methods and ourwave2wave in earthquake ground motion data5	Evaluation on real-life data: ground motion translationIn this section, we apply our proposed method, wave2wave, to predict a broadband-ground mo-tion from only its long-period motion, caused by the same earthquake. In this section, wave2wavetranslates one dimensional signal wave into one dimensional signal wave.
Table 2: Figure shows major experimental results for acc2moc.
