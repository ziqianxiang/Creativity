Table 1: Accuracy (Eq. 2) and Forgetting (Eq. 3) results of continual learning experiments. Averagesand standard deviations are computed over five random seeds. When used, episodic memories containup to one example per class per task. Last two rows are oracle baselines.
Table 2: Accuracy (Eq. 2) results for large (3 to 5 examples per class per task) episodic memory sizes.
Table 3: Impact of anchor selection, where we compare random-noise anchors (Random-), onerandom example-per-class anchors (Data-), and our optimized anchor selection (HAL).
Table 4: Forgetting (Eq. 3) results for large (3 to 5 examples per class per task) episodic memorysizes. Here we only compare methods that use an episodic memory. Averages and standard deviationsare computed over five random seeds.
