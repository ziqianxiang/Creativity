Table 1: Performance on the Seizures task. A Accuracy × Skip% is the geometric mean ofAccuracy and Skip Percent. The first section contains the baseline GRU, the second contains non-reactive methods, the third contains learned methods, and the fourth is our proposed method andrandom baseline. For SA-RNN we use λ = 2e-4.
Table 2: Performance on the Yahoo task. For SA-RNN we use λ = 1e-3.
Table 3: Performance on the TwitterBuzz task. For SA-RNN we use λ = 2e-3.
Table 4: Adding task with 500 timesteps.
