Table 1: Table of hyperparameters used to demonstrate Theorem 1.
Table 2: Table of hyperparameters used for training. "C" and "VF" respectively denote "continual"and "vector-field", "-#h" stands for the number of hidden layers. The sigmoid activation is definedby Eq. (102).
Table 3:  Training results on MNIST with EP, C-EP and C-VF. "#h" stands for the number of hiddenlayers. We indicate over five trials the mean and standard deviation for the test error, the mean errorin parenthesis for the train error. T  (resp. K) is the number of iterations in the first (resp. second)phase.
