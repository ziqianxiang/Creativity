Table 1: Below are the averaged operators for well-known algorithms. We assume α > 0 and,when α is multiplied by a gradient, we also assume α < 2/L, with L the Lipschitz constant for thegradient. The dual of a function is denoted by a superscript * and Ω := {(x,z) : Ax + Bz = b}. Theblock matrix M is M = (α-1Id, AT; -A, β-1Id). In each case, L is the associated Lagrangian.
Table 2: Choices for μk updates that ensure Assumption 3 holds. Here α ∈ (0,1) and, for fixedm ∈ N, Ξk is the set of the most recent min{m, k} indices for which the inequality in Line 6 holds.
