Table 1: Online hard keypoints mining experiment based on gradient. The gradient-based hard key-points mining can improve the accuracy of model predictions, and this dynamic gradient adjustmentmechanism will make the parameter update of the network more efficient. “一“ represent withoutOHKM methods.
Table 2: Effects with different scaling ratios. For our training data, when the scaling coefficient is10, we can achieve the expected effect of accelerating convergence. The number of intervals was20.
Table 3: The experimental results of the three methods regressing the grounding point separately:direct regression to the grounding point, identify the center of bottom edge of the wheel as thegrounding point, and two-stage strategy proposed by us.
Table 4: Contrast between fixing the position of invisible points and our methodMethod	Position	AP	AP50	AP75	APM	APL	Center	69.8	79.9	74.9	66.2	75.8Fix the position of invisible points	Left-top	30.9	42.3	38.1	26.0	35.7	Right-down	33.5	45.4	39.2	27.9	36.6Our method	—	78.8	90.3	85.4	75.8	82.7When the position of invisible points is fixed, the accuracy is 10 percent lower than the method ofdetecting wheel information. Comparing with the mainstream methods of truncating the gradient,it is essential to control the fluctuation of the gradient when the number of invisible points is largeand the fluctuation is severe. Detecting wheel information will avoid ambiguity of target spaceconstructed, and the proposed method can learn location information better.

The maincontribution points of the method proposed in this paper are as follows:1)	A novel 3D vehicle poses prediction method based on grounding points is proposed. This methodcan avoid the use of 3D detection results or Lidar information, which allows our method to work inreal-time and reduce the use cost.
