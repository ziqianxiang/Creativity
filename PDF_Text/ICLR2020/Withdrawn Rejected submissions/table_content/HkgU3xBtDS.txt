Table 1: Values stored in ordinal game tree and master game tree		variable	ordinal game tree	master game treeps,a	PoIicy by DNN	Policy by MCTSvs	value by DNN	value by MCTSns,a	the number of simulations	the number of ePisodesqs,a	estimated action value in simulations	estimated action value in ePisodesThus, the values stored in each node in the master game tree has a one-to-one correspondence withthe values stored in the ordinal Monte Carlo tree search node. Therefore the master game tree canbe implemented as same as the ordinal one.
