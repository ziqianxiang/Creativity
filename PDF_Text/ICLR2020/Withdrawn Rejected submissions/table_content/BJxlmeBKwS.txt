Table 2: Network architectureLAYER	DESCRIPTIONInput	Raw speech segment with shape [3072,1]Convolutional Stage 1	[32/6, 48]Convolutional Stage 2	[8/3, 64] x 6Convolutional Stage 3	[8/3, 64] x 6Convolutional Stage 4	[8/2, 80] x 6Convolutional Stage 5	[8/2, 96] x 6Global Average	1D global average poolingOutput	Single sigmoid neuron2.3 Alternative architectures	We experimented widely with the network architecture: the input segment size, the number of layers,the number of features. The network in Table 2 achieved the best performance in our experiments.
Table 3:	Precision, Recall and F1-Score in % for our phoneme detection algorithm. Number ofSamples indicates the total number of time samples (at 16 kHz) in the test set.
Table 4:	Fricative phoneme detection rates. Recallf, Recalln and UAR are given in %.
Table 5: Comparison betWeen this Work and Ruinskiy & Lavner (2014). First roW: the rates of Ru-inskiy & Lavner (2014) for unvoiced fricative phonemes With majority voting. Second roW: therates for our basic approach that does not rely on any post-processing introducing delay and also isevaluated With all 8 fricative phonemes. Third roW: the rates for our basic approach evaluated onlyWith unvoiced fricative phonemes as in Ruinskiy & Lavner (2014). Forth roW: the rates for our basicapproach folloWed by majority voting (introducing delay as in Ruinskiy & Lavner (2014)) evaluatedWith unvoiced fricative phonemes. All the rates are given in %. Our rates reported in Forth roWWere obtained using the same evaluation strategy as in Ruinskiy & Lavner (2014) except the medianfiltering (since the details for this step Were not given in their paper).
Table 6: Fricative phoneme detection rates and computational time for different model sizes. Net25is trained 10 times, Net19 and Net25h are trained 4 times. The reported results are for the networksthat perform best on the validation set.
Table 7: Rates for fricative phoneme detection as a function of extrapolation gap reported in %.

Table A.2: Recallf in % on fricative phoneme detection task for related approaches. In all thesecontributions the primary task is generic phoneme identification, but the results are evaluated on thefricative phoneme detection task. Delays are given in frames if they were not stated in the originalwork in seconds. Note that these contributions are not evaluated on the TIMIT dataset.
Table B.1: Rates of Net25 on detection of fricative boundaries task. The boundaries for the begin-ning and the end of a phoneme are detected and compared to the ground truth separately. We reportthe average scores over beginning of phoneme/end of phoneme boundaries.
