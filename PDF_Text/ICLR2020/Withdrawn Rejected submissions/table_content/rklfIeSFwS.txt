Table 1: Statistics of the one-shot model and the final sparse model in CNAS for CIFAR-10. Thenumber of cells is 20, and the number of nodes per cell is five. |X | and |Y | are the numbers of inputchannels and output channels in all nodes of the one-shot model, respectively. | X *| is the numberof input channels of the final sparse model. z means the output channels of nodes, and d the inputchannels of cells after being preprocessed as in Figure 1(b). Cell 7 and cell 14 are reduction cells,and other cells are all normal cells. |d → x| and |z → x| are the numbers of the edges from {di} to{xj} and from {zi} to {xj} in Figure 1, respectively.
Table 2: Comparison results among the state-of-the-art architecture search methods for CIFAR-10.
Table 3: Comparison results among the state-of-the-art architecture search methods for ImageNet.
Table 4: Characteristics of recently proposed NAS methods. Search space: OS (Operations andskip connections), HS (Hyperparameters of filters and skip connections) and CS (Channels and skipconnections). Search algorithm: PD (Performance prediction) and RS (Random Search). Search range:Micro (Cell-level search and repeating the structure), Macro (Network-level search), Both (Cell- andNetwork-level search). Candidate parameters: Independent (generating parameters Independently),Shared (exploiting Shared parameters) and Dynamic (generating parameters dynamically). Searchcost (GPU-days): All numbers except (*) are the costs of searching for CIFAR-10. (*) mean the costsfor ImageNet due to no numbers for CIFAR-10 (i.e., no proxy) in the corresponding papers.
