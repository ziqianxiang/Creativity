Table 1: Selected Seeds for Corpus based Amharic Sentiment Lexicon ExpansionPart of speech	Negative	PositiveAdjectives	99	79Nouns	145	120Verbs	36	404.2	STEMMINGAmharic is highly morphological language both inflectional and derivational morphologyis complex. Thus, without applying stemming, it is not easy to do computational5Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2020linguistic tasks like sentiment classification. Amharic roots are very few thousandsfrom which other words are derived. The level of stemming determines whetherstemmed terms preserve the semantics of original word or not. So, in this case, wedeveloped light stemmer to reduce surface words into corresponding stems with minimallose of semantic information. A sample of stemmed words with thier corespondingsurface words are presented in Table 2.

Externalto lexicon is to test the usefulness and the correctness of each of the lexicon to find6Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2020sentiment score of sentiment labeled Amharic comments corpus. Internal evaluation iscompute the degree to which each of the generated lexicons are overlapped( or agreed) with manual, SOCAL and SWN(Amharic) Sentiment lexicons.

Where as Lexicon from SWN outperforms the PPMI based Lexicon with 2%accuracy.

However, it has less coveragethan SWN. Unlike SWN, PPMI based lexicon is generated from corpus. Due to thisreason its coverage to work on a general domain is limited. It also demonstrated thatthe positive and negative count in almost all lexicons seems to have balanced anduniform distribution of sentiment polarity terms in the corpus.
