Table 1: Quantitative results using relative pixel prediction. Each cell reports the negative log-likelihoods in bits/dim on CIFAR-10’s test set and ImageNet’s validation set for unconditional imagegeneration (u), colorization (c) and super-resolution (s). Row 0 is the baseline. Rows 1 and 2describe the results obtained using only the input and output predictors, respectively. Rows 3 and 4combines them with the absolute predictor. Row 5 denotes the combination of the input and outputpredictors.
Table 2: Comparison between state-of-the-art models in unconditional image generation on CIFAR-10.
Table 3: Ablation study over different predictors. Each cell reports the negative log-likelihoodsin bits/dim on the CIFAR-10 for unconditional image generation (u), colorization (c) and super-resolution (S). Row 0 is the baseline. Rows 1-3 denote results using only relative predictors fromthe left pixel, top pixel and both, respectively. Rows 3 and 4 allow the usage of a 2×2 and 3×3grid centered around the predicted pixel. Rows 6-8 combine the absolute predictor with the relativeone, and rows 9-11 use a pruned distance list for the relative predictors. Rows 12-14 use only therelative predictor that copies from the input pixel in the same position as the predicted pixel, and in a2×2 and 3×3 grids around that position. Rows 15-17 denote the combinations between the absoluteand relative predictor from the input. Finally, we combine all the aforementioned predictors in rows18-19.
