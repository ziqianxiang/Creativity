Table 4: AUROC in %. Highest score among all methods and highest score among all unsupervisedmethods are highlighted. On complex datasets such as CIFAR-10 and CatVsDog, our proposedmethod has higher performance gain among all unsupervised methods. The last column presentsresults obtained using distribution clustering alone.
