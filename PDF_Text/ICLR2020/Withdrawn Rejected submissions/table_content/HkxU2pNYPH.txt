Table 1: Performance on WikiBio test set. Two Fluency measures differ in whether to include sentences gradedas Mostly Fluent. Starred numbers are statistically significant against baselines (p < .001), by bootstrap test.
Table 2: Ablative tests on three components of our confident decoding method, and a truncation test.
Table 3: Hyper-parameters. We did a hyper-parameter search for ρ, γ and λ, within the range [0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1],[1/16, 1/8, 1/4] and [1/64, 1/16, 1/4, 1], respectively. Model selection is based on PARENT F1.
