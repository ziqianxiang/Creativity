Table 1: Success rates (%) of different methods attacking the classifier of PointNet (Qi et al., 2017a)under defenses of SOR (Zhou et al., 2018) and Random Romoval (RR). We report results withdifferent numbers of dropping points for the two defense methods. For all methods, attack successrates are 100% without defense. More details of RR and SOR please refer to A.7.
Table 2: Classification accuracy (%) of different networks trained on different source of data, in-cluding vanilla point clouds, cooperative point clouds and its variant generated based on PointNet.
Table 3: Quantitative results of the ablation study of Figure 1. We evaluate smoothness metric S(P)with and without individual components. We take average over all the samples. Lower value meanssmoother point clouds.
