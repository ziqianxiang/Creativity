Table 1: Ablation study with the mean validation accuracy on CelebA.
Table 2: Mean attribute classification accuracy (%) on CelebA test set.
Table 3: Accuracy (%) on CelebA validation set. Neg Att is the attribute (Att) that has the highest ac-curacy drop when trained with multi-task learning. Sin is the accuracy from single task training. TheMul is the accuracy from multi-task training with the Neg Att Adv is the accuracy from adversarialtraining with the Neg Att.

Table 6: Accuracy (%) on DukeMTMC-attribute dataset. Neg Att is the attribute (Att) that has thehighest accuracy drop when trained with multi-task learning. Sin. is the accuracy from single tasktraining. The Mul is the accuracy from multi-task training with the Neg Att. Adv is the accuracyfrom adversarial training with the Neg Att. The attribute 14 does not have negative transfer with anyother attribute so we show the accuracy from the single task training.
