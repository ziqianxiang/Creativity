Table 1: Properties of different GNN classes. Shows the upper bound computational complexitywhen the maximum discriminatory power is obtained. Here we assume hidden size p is the same asfeature input size. Final column contains some examples of features that can be learned by each class.
Table 2: Results of experiments on synthetic datasets (i) Count the number of triangles in the graph(ii) Count the number of 4 cycles in the graph. The reported metric is MSE over the testing set.
Table 3: Details of benchmark datasets used. Types of tasks are: NC for node classification, GC forgraph classification, GR for graph regression.
Table 4: Results of experiments on real-world datasets. The reported metrics are accuracy onclassification tasks and MSE on regression tasks. Figures for comparative methods are from literatureexcept for those with *, which come from our own implementation. The best-performing architecturesare highlighted in bold.
