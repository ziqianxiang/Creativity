Table 1: The result of CIFAR-10. The test error at the last epoch is used and the reported results areaveraged out of 5 runs.
Table 2: The result of CIFAR-10. The test errorat the last epoch is used and the reported resultsare averaged out of 5 runs.
Table 3: Top-1 error on ImageNet-1k validationdataset. The top-1 error at the last epoch is usedand the reported results are averaged out of 3runs.
Table 4: The inference speed per image is shown. We evaluate models on single GeForce GTX1080 Ti cards with CUDA 10.0 environment. The implementation is based on PyTorch (Paszkeet al., 2017) ver 1.0.1.post2. The results are averaged out of 1000 runs. The batch size is 256 andthe size of input is 224 × 224 × 3. α of ss convolution is 0.04 that is same α reported in Table 3.
