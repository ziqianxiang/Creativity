Table 1: Stochastic first- and second-order oracle complexities, SFO and SSO for short respectively,of the proposed STR approaches and other state-of-the-art methods. When SSO is prioritized, ourSTR1 has strictly better complexity than both SCR and Lite-SVRC. When SFO and SSO are treatedequally, STR2 improves the existing result in SVRC.
