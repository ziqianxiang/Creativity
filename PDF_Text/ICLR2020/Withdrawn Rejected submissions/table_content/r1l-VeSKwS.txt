Table 1: Transferability of SemanticAdv: cell (i, j) shows attack success rate of adversarial examplesgenerated against j-th model and evaluate on i-th model. Results of CW are listed in brackets. Left:Results generated with G-FPR = 10-3 and T-FPR = 10-3; Right: Results generated with G-FPR =10-4 and T-FPR = 10-3.
Table 2: Quantitative analysis on query-free black-box attack. We use ResNet-101 optimized withsoftmax loss for evaluation and report the attack success rate(%) on two online face verificationplatforms. Note that for PGD-based attacks, we adopt MI-FGSM ( = 8) in Dong et al. (2018) andM-DI2-FGSM( = 8)inXieetal. (2019), respectively.
Table A: The performnace of ResNet models on several benchmark datasets.
Table B: The threshold values for face identity verification.
Table C: Quantitative result of identity verification (%). It shows accuracy of face verification modeland attack success rate of SemanticAdv and CW. x0, G(x0, c) and G(x0, cnew) are the intermediateresults of our method before adversarial perturbation.
Table D: Quantitative results on face landmark detection (%) The two row shows the measured ratios(lower is better) for “Rotating Eyes” and “Out Of Region” task, respectively.
Table E: Attack success rate by selecting different layer’s feature-map for interpolation on R-101-S(%).
Table F: Attack success rate by selecting different layer’s feature-map for interpolation on R-101-S(%). f-2 indicates the feature-map after the last down-sampling operation and f-2 indicates thefeature-map after f-2.
Table G: Transferability of SemanticAdv: cell (i, j) shows attack success rate of adversarial examplesgenerated against j-th model and evaluate on i-th model. Results generated with G-FPR = 10-4,T-FPR = 10-4.
Table H: Transferability of StrawMan: cell (i, j) shows attack success rate of adversarial examplesgenerated against j -th model and evaluate on i-th model. Results of SemanticAdv are listed inbrackets.
Table I: Quantitative analysis on query-free black-box attack. We use ResNet-101 optimized withsoftmax loss for evaluation and report the attack success rate(%).
