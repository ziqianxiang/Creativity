Table 1: Comparison of successfully completing the binning task by using a single feature over 500 attempts.		Table 2: Accuracy of detecting valid actions in random environments based on ambiguity. Low: Separation based on a single feature High: Only combinations of features separate the targets.	Required Feature None (Single Object) Color Size Shape	Binning Success 96.4% 97.6% 96.0% 79.0%	Ambiguity	Correctly: Accepted Rejected		Low High	99.3%	96.6% 70%	66.6%In our binning scenario, the robot needs to stop its movement above the bowl outlined in the experi-ment within a radius of the bowlâ€™s center such that the dropped object from the gripper is successfullyplaced inside the bowl. We utilized two different bowl sizes in these experiments, large and small,with a 17.5 cm and 12.5 cm diameter respectively. The object that is to be delivered, a cube, hasan edge length of 5 cm. All experiments were conducted by generating new random scenarios withnew environments, images, and sentences corresponding to the generated task.
Table 3: Average success rate for placing the object in 250 randomly generated environments.
Table 4: Ablation over network structure. Average success rate for placing 250 objects using n-grams of size 2, 3, 4 and 5. The last demonstrates the influence of using residual layers in the imageprocessing pipeline.
