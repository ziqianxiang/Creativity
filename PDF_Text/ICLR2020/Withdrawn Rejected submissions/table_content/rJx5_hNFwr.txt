Table 1: Ablation study (%) on Cityscapes to FoggyCityscapes (we use 150m visibility, the densestone) adaptation. Please refer to Section 3.2 for more details.
Table 2: Adaptation results between KITTI andCityscapes. We report AP of Car on both di-rections, including: K→C and C→K. We re-implemented DA (Chen et al., 2018) and Weak-Strong (Saito et al., 2019) based on the sameFaster RCNN framework (Ren et al., 2015).
