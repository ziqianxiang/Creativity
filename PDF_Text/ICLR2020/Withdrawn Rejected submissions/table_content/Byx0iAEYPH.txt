Table 1: Percent of time FCP beat all perturbations	n= 100 p= 500	n = 100 P = 1000	n= 100 P= 1500	n= 100 P=2000% Best FCP	100%	100%	100%	100%Table 1	contains the numbers from optimality analysis. This technique did not yield a single per-turbed solution that could beat the FCP classifier obtained from the FPRAS in any of our thousandsof iterations.
