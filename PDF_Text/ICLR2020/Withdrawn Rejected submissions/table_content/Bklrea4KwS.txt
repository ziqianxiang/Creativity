Table 1: Bag classification performance using average error rate on MNIST-bags dataset [10] byvarying the training bas size.
Table 2: Instance detection performance in average precision using MNIST-bags dataset [10] fortraining size of 100 bags and tested on 1000 bags.
Table 3: Average classification accuracy (± standard deviation) on MUSK 1, MUSK 2, Fox, Tigerand Elephant datasets. We directly compare with Deep learning methods as they are the most rele-vant for us. Results from traditional methods are shown as a reference. We bold results only for bestperforming deep learning methods.
