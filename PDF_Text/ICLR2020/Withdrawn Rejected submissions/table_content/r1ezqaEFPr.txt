Table 1: Comparison with state-of-the-art methods on COCO test-dev dataset. Note that Our mainresearch is about single-stage methods. Note that ”Res101” means ResNet-101.
Table 2: Effects of each component in our design. Results are reported on COCO 2017val. Notethat ”Res50” means ResNet-50, ”Res101” means ResNet-101.
Table 3: Ablation study of FPN designs on COCO 2017val. BU-FPN (shown in Figure 2 (b)) meansusing the fusion operation in Bottom-Up style FPN to compensate shallow feature by fusing onlyshallower neighboring feature. While BUF-FPN (shown in Figure 2 (c)) fuse both higher and lowerlevel neighboring feature. APS, APM, APL means AP at small, middle and large scales. Note thatin the following discussion, we treat BUF-FPN as the default Buttom-Up style FPN.
Table 4: Ablation study of EJ-Head on COCO 2017val. The original Mask R-CNN uses none ofthree operations as shown in the first row in the table. Note that ”Int” means ”Interleaving”, ”EF”means ”Enriched Feature”, ”BR” means ”Boundary Refinement”.
Table 5: Ablation study of the design of “Boundary Refinement” on COCO-2017val. “SimpleConv” means using common 3 x 3 stacked convolutions. “2 x Simple Conv + Shortcut” is shown inFigure 3.
