Table 1: Comparison of generated distributions on test set against ground truth distribution on testset. Smaller values indicate a better match between distributions. Results indicate that while softconstraining can encourage the network to adhere to constraints, its residue is nonzero, implyingthat the imposed constraint is not strictly satisfied. Spectral based projection method can effectivelyeliminate residue. Training with the PDE layer in-the-loop eliminates residue and achieves greateraccuracy on key statistical quantities, as compared to unconstrained and soft constrained cases, evenwhen hard constraints are enforced at test time.
Table 2: Description of module notations in Fig. 1B Model and training detailsWe use the GauGAN architecture (with schematics as shown in Fig. 1) for the conditional flow fieldgeneration task. The abbreviated names for the various modules are given in Tab. 2. Our model differsfrom the original GauGAN model in two distinct aspects. First, our architecture utilizes 3 dimensionalconvolutions instead of the 2 dimensional counterparts in the original GauGAN architecture. Second,for our hard constrained case, we append the spectral projection layer to the end of the architecturefor enforcing hard constraints.
