Table 7: Test accuracy numbers for different experiments on all learning rate schedules tried inthis paper. We report the average top-5 accuracy for ImageNet, average top-1 accuracy for Cifar-10, average BLEU score for IWSLT and the best EM score for SQuAD. The ImageNet results forone-cycle, cosine-decay, linear-decay are still running and will be updated in an updated draft.
