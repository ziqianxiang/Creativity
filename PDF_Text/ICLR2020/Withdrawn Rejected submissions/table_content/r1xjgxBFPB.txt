Table 1: Train accuracy of FROMP and batch-trained Adam (upper bound on performance) onvariations of a toy 2D binary classification dataset, with mean and standard deviations over 10 runs(3 runs for Adam). FROMP performs well across variations. See Appendix D.2 for visualisations.
Table 2: The average validation accuracy on Permuted-MNIST (10 tasks) and Split-MNIST.
Table 3: Train accuracy of FROMP, VCL (no coresets), VCL+coresets and batch-trained Adam(an upper bound on performance) on a toy 2D binary classification dataset, with mean and standarddeviations over 5 runs for VCL and batch Adam, and 10 runs for FROMP. ‘VCL’ is without coresets.
