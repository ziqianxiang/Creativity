Table 1: Test accuracies (in %) computed on the class-balanced test sets of the test tasks of Mini-ImageNet (1), Omniglot (2), MT-MNIST with Ttest = T0 (3) and STS-Sawtooth (4). One-classadaptation sets (C = 0%) are used, unless otherwise specified.
Table 2: Test accuracies (in %) computed on the class-balanced test sets of the test tasks of MiniIm-ageNet (1), Omniglot (2), MT-MNIST with Ttest = T0 (3) and STS-Sawtooth (4). The results areshown for models without BN (top) and with BN (bottom). One-class adaptation sets (c = 0%) areused, unless otherwise specified.
Table 3: Test F1-scores of OC-MAML on finishing (Fi) and roughing (Rj) operations of the CNC-MMD dataset, when only K = 10 normal examples are available (c = 0%). The ± shows 95%confidence intervals over 150 tasks sampled from the test operations (not used for meta-training).
