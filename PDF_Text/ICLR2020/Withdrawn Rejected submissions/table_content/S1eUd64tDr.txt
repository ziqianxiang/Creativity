Table 1: Parameter size (texture bits, non-texture bits, total bits) in kilobytes (KB) and top-1 test ac-curacy of depth-wise convolution kernels after 8 bit quantization and Huffman coding, in MobileNettrained on CIFAR-10. We compared the performance of the three variations of ILWP: ILWP-FSS,ILWP-LSS, and ILWP-ILL.
