Table 1: Standard accuracy and adversarial robustness of models of different capacity trained by(Zhang et al., 2019). We set the maximum allowed L∞ norm of attack noise = 8/255. The learningrate is 0.01 for all VGG13 models and 0.1 for all resnet models. All models are trained with SGD for160 epochs with a decay of 10× in learning rate at 80th and 120th epochs. The SGD’s momentumis 0.9. For adversarial training settings, the coefficient for the regularization term in (Zhang et al.,2019) is 1 = 5.0, the step size for projected gradient descent is 2/255 and the number of step is 10.

The results are shown in Figure 7 and Figure 8. The experiments are conducted on aresnet20 model. The same conclusion could be drawn according to our statistics.
