Table 1: Mean accuracy and standard deviation are shown for nine pooling schemes on three fine-grained datasets using two backbone models: ResNet-50 and Inception-v3. The best accuracy oneach dataset is in bold and the second best is underlined. The best performers are: k-max, mixed,and max pooling. Interestingly, stochastic pooling is the worst performer with ResNet backbone,but ranked the first on Inception-v3.
Table 2: Heterogeneous pooling integration results. The offline training method (MLP) generallyperforms best. Freeze-and-train works best among the end-to-end learnable models.
