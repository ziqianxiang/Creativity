Table 1: FID/IS for DVD-GAN on Kinetics-600 Video Synthesis. Wepresent the scores of the model taken at the point in training whenthe best FID was attained. The "No Truncation" columns contain thescores obtained without the truncation trick. The "With Truncation"columns contain the scores obtained at the truncation level whichresults in the best Inception Score.
