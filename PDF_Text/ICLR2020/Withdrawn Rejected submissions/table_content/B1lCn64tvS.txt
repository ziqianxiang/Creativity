Table 1: Number of iterations (no restarts)it takes MiniSat to solve random 3-SAT in-stances.
Table 2: MRIR for GQSAT trained on SAT-50-218. Evaluation for SAT-50-218 is on aseparate test data not seen during training.
Table 3: SAT-50 models performance on SATLIB flat graph coloring benchmark. Median RelativeIteration Reduction (MRIR) is w.r.t. MiniSat with restarts, since MiniSat performs better in thismode for this benchmark.
Table 4: GQSAT Median Relative Iteration Reduction (MRIR) for the model trained on flat-75-80,evaluated on flat-100-239. flat-75-80 and flat-100-239 are separated, because the model was trainedusing the former and validated on the second. The results are for five training runs.
