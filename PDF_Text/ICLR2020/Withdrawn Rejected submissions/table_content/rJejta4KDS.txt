Table 1: The success rate of D-MIFGSM in single model attack. The cell (i, j) indicates the accuracyof the adversarial examples generated for model i (row) evaluated over model j (column).
Table 2:  The success rate of D-MIFGSM in ensemble based method.  Cell (i, j) indicates that theaccuracy of the targeted adversarial examples generated for the ensemble of the four models exceptmodel i (row) is predicted as the target label by model j  (column).   In each line ,      means thenetwork behind is not used in ensemble attack.
Table 3:  The success rate of MIFGSM and our D-MIFGSM. The single model attack use V GG16to generate adverarial examples. Ensemble based method use all four models to generate adverarialexamples in 5.1.
