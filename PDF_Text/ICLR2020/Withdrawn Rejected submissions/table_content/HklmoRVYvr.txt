Table 1: Comparison of using input vs state his-tory with LH-STM Single and Double on the KTHhuman actions dataset (resolution 128 × 128).
Table 2: Evaluation of multi-frame prediction on the KTH human actions dataset (resolution 128 ×128). All models are trained for 10 frame prediction given 10 input frames. They are then tested torecursively predict 40 future frames. The reported metrics are averages across the predicted frames.
Table 3: Evaluation of multi-frame prediction on the BAIR robot pushing dataset. All models aretrained for 10 frame prediction given 5 input frames. They are then tested to predict 25 future frames.
Table 4: An ablation study on KTH human actions dataset. The frame resolution is 64 × 64 pixels.
