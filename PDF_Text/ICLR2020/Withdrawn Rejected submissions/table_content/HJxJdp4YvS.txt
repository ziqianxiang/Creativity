Table 1: Clustering performance of VarPSOM using 64 clusters arranged in a 8 × 8 SOM map,compared with baselines. The methods are grouped into approaches with no topological structure inthe discrete latent space and interpretable methods using a SOM-based structure in the latent space,as well as an extension of our method using convolutional filters. Means and standard errors across10 runs with different random model initializations are displayed.
Table 2: Mean NMI and standard error of cluster enrichment vs. current/future APACHE physiologyscores, using a 2D (8 × 8) SOM map, across 10 runs with different random model initializations.
Table 3: MSE for predicting the time series of the last 6 hours before ICU dispatch, given the priortime series.
Table S1: Mean/Standard error of NMI and purity of DEC model on MNIST test set, across 10 runswith different random model initializations. We use 64 clusters and different latent space dimen-sions.
