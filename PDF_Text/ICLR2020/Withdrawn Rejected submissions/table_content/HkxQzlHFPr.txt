Table 1: NLI labels and FOL relations.
Table 2: Performance over single domain NLI and single domain PI (MRPC). For MRPC, we reportthe accuracy and f1-score. For MNLI, we report the accuracy on both matched and mismatched testsets. For the rest datasets, we report the accuracy.
Table 3: Ablation over single domains.
Table 4: Results over pre-training models.
Table 5: Performance in unseen domains. “Gold” denotes the gold-standard test set of DNLI.
Table 6: The syntax of FOL, specified in Backus-Naur form (Russell and Norvig, 1995).
Table 7: Statistics of datasets. Avg.L denotes the average length of each review. Vocab. denotes thevocabulary size. We show the size of the matched/mismatched test sets for MNLI.
Table 8: Ablations over unseen domains. For MNLI, we report the accuracy on both matched andmismatched test sets. “Gold” denotes the gold-standard test set of DNLI.
