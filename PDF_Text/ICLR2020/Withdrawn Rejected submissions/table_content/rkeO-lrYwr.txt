Table 1: Our networks and hyperparameters. Accuracies are the averages and standard deviationsacross three initializations. Hyperparameters for Resnet-20 (standard) are from He et al. (2016). Hy-perparameters for VGG-16 (standard) are from Liu et al. (2019). Hyperparameters for low, warmup,and Lenet are adapted from Frankle & Carbin (2019). Hyperparameters for ImageNet networks arefrom Googleâ€™s reference TPU code (Google, 2018).
