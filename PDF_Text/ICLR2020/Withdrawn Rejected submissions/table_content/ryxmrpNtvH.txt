Table 1: Instability of multiple runs (i.e., instances)measured with S-Tau. Max Tau means the maximumvalue of the N(NT) Taus. Similarly, Min TaU is theminimum value. The numbers are obtained at the 200-thepoch.
Table 2: Comparison with ground truth with GT-Tau and TnR. Each number is an average of 10numbers, either from 10 instances or from 10 epochs of one instance. The subscript shows thestandard variance of these 10 numbers.
Table 3: GT-Tau-Mean-64 and GT-Tau-Std-64, averaged over 10 instances. The subscript is thestandard variance corresponding to the average.
Table 4: Supplementary to Table 3. GT-Tau-Mean-64 and GT-Tau-Std-64 follow the same scheme.
Table 5: Accuracies of child models when they are trained independently. The three digits of childmodel labels correspond to O(0,1), O(0,2) and O(1,2) respectively. Evaluations are repeated 10 timeswith different seeds of weight initialization, and averages and standard variances are calculated.
