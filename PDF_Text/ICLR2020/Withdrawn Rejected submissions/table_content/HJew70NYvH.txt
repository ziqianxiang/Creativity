Table 1: The benchmark suite (six OpenAI Gym [4] environments) with their corresponding observation/action spaces.
Table 2: TPO hyperparameters.
Table 3: Performance comparison between TPO and PPO after 4M time-steps. ∆ values show the difference between TPO andPPO for each category. A positive ∆ value indicates that TPO outperforms PPO.
