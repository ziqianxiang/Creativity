Table 1: Description of edge types present in the directed graph created to represent the schema. Anedge exists from source node x ∈ S to target node y ∈ S if the pair fulfills one of the descriptionslisted in the table, with the corresponding label. Otherwise, no edge exists from x to y .
Table 2: Our main results (all numbers are exact match %).
Table 3: Accuracy (exact match %) on development set with an oracle providing correct columns andtables (Oractle cols) and/or the AST sketch structure (Oracle sketch).
