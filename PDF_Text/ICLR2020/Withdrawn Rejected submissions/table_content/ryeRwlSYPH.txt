Table 1: Success rate(%) for practical tasks, where our method is compared with the baselineswith or without hierarchical framework. Our transitional skills outperforms the baselines in allcases, demonstrating the effectiveness of the learning transitional skills for down-stream tasks. Herewe adopt spectral clustering to cluster the trajectories. When the label of ending segment of thetrajectory keeps the same label with that generated the target skills solely, the transition is regardedas a success; otherwise a failure transition. The target skills are regard as the goal of our tasks, whichare generated by sample primitive skills or weighting the actions of different primitives.
