Table 1: Results of classification experiments. Accuracy and ECE are evaluated on in-domaindistribution (MNIST and CIFAR10) whereas entropy is evaluated on out-of-distribution (notMNISTand SHVN). Lower the better for ECE. Higher the better for entropy and accuracy.
Table 2: Reduction in complexity. Reduced di-mensions from N to the chosen rank L per layerare reported for both MNIST and CIFAR experi-ments. CNN stand for convolution while FC is forfully connected layers. The complexity of sam-pling computations O(N3) are reduced to O(L3).
