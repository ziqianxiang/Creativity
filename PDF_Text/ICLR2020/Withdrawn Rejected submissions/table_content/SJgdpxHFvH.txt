Table 1: EfficientLab architecture ablations. Each network is meta-trained in the same way follow-ing 5 and tested on the set of test tasks from FSS-1000 (Wei et al., 2019). The 3rd row containsresults of removing the short-range residual connection from our proposed RSD module. The finalrow is the best network we find for few-shot performance via model agnostic meta-learning. Wecall this network EfficientLab in reference to the encoder of EfficientNet (Tan & Le, 2019) and thedecoder of Auto-DeepLab (Chen et al., 2018), which it is inspired by.
Table 2: Mean IoU scores of the EfficientLab network evaluated on FSS-1000 test set of tasks for1-shot and 5-shot learning. We report the FSS-1000 baseline from (Wei et al., 2019). Our best foundmodel combined FOMAML, EfficientLab, regularization, and the UHO algorithm.
