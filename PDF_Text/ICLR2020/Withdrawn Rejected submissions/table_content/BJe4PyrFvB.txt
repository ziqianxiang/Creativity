Table 1: The measurement for different β values. Variance is the variance among images generatedby same latent representations. Absolute accuracy is the rate that classifier classifies reconstructionimages right. Relative accuracy is the rate that classifier classifies reconstruction images the sameas raw images.
Table 2: The measurement for different λ values. Variance is the variance among the images gen-erated by same latent representations. Absolute accuracy is the rate that classifier classifies recon-struction images right. Relative accuracy is the rate that classifier classifies reconstruction imagesthe same as raw images.

These are shown in Figure 9 for an LSR-GAN trained on CIFAR-10 and Ima-geNet. Although the images superficially look reasonable on close inspection it is clear that mostsamples for the LSR-GAN trained on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet are not real world objects. This re-flects the fact that the images for these two dataset are very variable leaving most of the latent spacerepresenting rather surreal objects.
