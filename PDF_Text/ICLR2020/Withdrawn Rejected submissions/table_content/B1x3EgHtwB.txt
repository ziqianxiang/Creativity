Table 8: Small networks vs ExpandNets on CIFAR-10 (Top) and CIFAR-100 (Bottom). Wereport the top-1 accuracy for the original compact networks and for different versions of our ap-proach. Note that our ExpandNets yield higher accuracy than the compact network in almost allcases involving expanding convolutions cases. By contrast expanding FC layers does often not help.
