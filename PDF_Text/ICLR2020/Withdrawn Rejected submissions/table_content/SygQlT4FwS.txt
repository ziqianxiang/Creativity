Inspectionof set 2 reveals a greater proportion of repetitive characters as junk code insertions, which serve toconfuse de-obfuscators, but also dilute the similarity (conversely inflate the Levenstein distance) sincethe proportion of overlapping characters to the total number of characters would be lower. While thetotal collection indicates a general improvement in dissimilarity, removing set 2 would indicate anaverage magnitude improvement of 1.5287 and a standard deviation of 0.5352. This aids in justifyingthat the proposed obfuscation method performs well in the aspect of stealth.
