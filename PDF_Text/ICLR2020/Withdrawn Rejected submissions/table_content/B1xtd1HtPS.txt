Table 1: Classification accuracy on ModelNet40 dataset (Wu et al., 2015) for different methods aswell as ours. We also report the number of parameters optimized for each method. X/Y means thatWe train With X and test With Y.
Table 2: Error of rotation estimation in different categories of ModelNet10. Right side of the tabledenotes the objects with rotational symmetry, which we include for completeness. PCA-S refers torunning PCA only on a resampled instance, while PCA-SR applies both rotations and resampling.
