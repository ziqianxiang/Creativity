Table 1: Expected excess empirical risk bounds under (, δ)-DP, where n and p are thenumber of samples and the number of parameters, respectively, and β, μ and V are thesmooth coefficient, the strongly convex coefficient and the expected curvature, respectively,and v ≥ μ (see Section 3.1). We note that μ = 0 denotes the convex but not strongly convexobjective. The Lipschitz constant L is assumed to be 1. We omit log (1∕δ) for simplicity.
