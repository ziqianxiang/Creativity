Table 1: Accuracy(x100) of clustering/classifying male and female words. Lower accuracy meansless gender cues can be captured. Double-Hard Debias reaches the lowest accuracy on both tasks.
Table 2: WEAT test of embeddings before/after Debias. The bias is significant when p-value, p <0.05. Lower effective size (d) indicates less gender bias.
