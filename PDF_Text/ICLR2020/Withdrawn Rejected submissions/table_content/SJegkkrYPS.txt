Table 2: Main results, top-1 accuracy on ResNet50 v1 after 90 and 100 epochs. Comparison withrelated work. PruneTrain sparsity is not explicitly stated, so we estimate their sparsity level fromtheir inference FLOPs saved (1-FLOPs). Also, our experiments were run with batch size 64.
Table 3: Adversarial Robustness of Resnet50 v1.5 on Imagenet4.3 DiscussionOverall, we notice that there is a tolerance for sparsity (up to 70%), which yields around 1%accuracy loss compared to the dense baseline. However, this loss can be compensated by droppingthe learning rate and performing another 10 epochs of training, which provides a 0.7-0.9% accuracyincrease. With high levels of sparsity this extension is computationally cheap.
Table 4: Comparison of Training Methods that yield sparse networksoperations. The granularity of the sparsity mechanism indicates how easy it is to adapt themechanism to an existing hardware. The coarser the granularity, the more adaptable it is toexisting hardware (Mao et al., 2017). Regularization, although useful in forcing the network tolearn prunable weights, adds more irregularity to computation flow. The pruning era starting atthe beginning of the training enables us to train with a compressed network.
Table 5: Best accuracy for different sparsity levels for Resnet50 on Tiny-Imagenet with Windowand CK Pruning. Both methods see high accuracy close to, or even above the baseline in the casesof Window at 60%, CK at 20%, 60% and 80%. CK converges to the final epoch at the same epoch asthe baseline while window converges at the same epoch or earlier in the cases of 40% and 60%.

Table 7: Gain in top-1 accuracy on Resnet50 v1.5 from epoch 90 to epoch 100. This table showsmore explicitly that the benefit of the additional 10 epochs of training from epoch 90 to 100 isabout 0.8-1.1%.
Table 8: Results when we changed final learning rate drop from epoch 90 to 80, top-1 accuracy onResnet50 v1.5 at epoch 100. This change does provide 0.1-0.2% improvement is some cases, butthe benefit is relatively small.
