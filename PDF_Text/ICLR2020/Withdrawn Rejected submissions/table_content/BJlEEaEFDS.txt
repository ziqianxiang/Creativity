Table 2: Comparison of adversarial robustness of BatchNorm with BatchNorm without tracking and nonormalization for CIFAR10 and Resnet20. The results are shown with 95% confidence interval calculatedwith 5 random restarts. Highlighted values show the best accuracy for that particular adversarial noise.
Table 3: Comparison of clean accuracy of BatchNorm with RobustNorm for both adversarial and naturaltraining scenarios. RobustNormâ€™s accuracy is better than BatchNorm when tracking is not used while itsaccuracy is same when tracking is used.
Table 4: Comparison of clean and adversarial accuracy of different network architectures. We present twodepths of Resnet, 38 and 50 and two for VGG, 11 and 16. We trained all these networks with both naturalas well as adversarial training and use noise as well as different attacks methods to find their robustness. Allof these results are for CIFAR10 dataset.
