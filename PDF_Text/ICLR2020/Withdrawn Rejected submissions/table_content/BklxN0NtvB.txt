Table 1: ResNet-32 on CIFAR10 with analog non-idealities: our method of combining distillationand noise injection consistently achieves the best accuracy under different analog non-ideal effects.
Table 2: ResNet-50 on ImageNet at different noise levels, showing the Top-1 accuracy on the testdataset, with no quantization applied. Uncertainty is the standard deviation of different training andinference runs.
