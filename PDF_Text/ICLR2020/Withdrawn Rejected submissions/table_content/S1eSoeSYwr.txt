Table 1: Benchmark regression tests. We evaluate RMSE and negative log-likelihood (NLL) for modelensembling (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017), Bayes-By-Backprop (BBB) (Blundell et al., 2015) and evidentialregression. Evidential achieves top scores (bolded, within statistical significance) on 8 of the 9 datasets.
Table 2: Benchmark performance comparison on depth prediction. For fair performance comparison,sampling methods were all parallelized and sampled 5 times as RMSE and NLL did not significantly improvewith greater samples. For an extended analysis with larger number of samples please refer to Table 3.
Table 3: Depth estimation performance. Comparison of different epistemic uncertainty estimation algorithmsand predictive performance on an unseen test set. Dropout, ensembles, and Bayes-by-Backprop were sampled Ntimes on parallel threads. The evidential method outperforms all other algorithms in terms of space (#Parameters)and inference speed while maintaining competetive RMSE and NLL.
