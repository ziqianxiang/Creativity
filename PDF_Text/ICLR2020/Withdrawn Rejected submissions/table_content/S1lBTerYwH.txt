Discussion of the modification is de-tailed in Section 3.2. With ZAGRNN, almost all metrics slightly increased from ZAGCNN exceptfor micro precision. With LLDAM loss, our final feature extractor can improve more significantly fromZAGCNN especially for macro metrics and achieve better precision recall trade-off. These modifi-cations are not enough to get reasonable performance zero-shot codes as shown in Table 2, mainlydue to the lack of positive example for zero-shot codes during training.
