Table 1: Final human-normalized return averaged across all 30 DMLab levels for baselines andGTrXL variants. We also include the 100-capped score where the per-level mean score is clipped at100, providing a metric that is proportional to the percentage of levels that the agent is superhuman.
Table 2: Parameter-controlled ablation. Wereport standard error of the means of 6-8 runsper model.
Table 3: Percentage of the 25 parametersettings where the training loss divergedwithin 2 billion env. steps. We do notreport numbers for GTrXL gating typesthat were unstable in DMLab-30. Fordiverged runs we plot the returns in Fig-ure 5 as 0 afterwards.

Table 6: Simplified action set for DMLab Arbitrary Visuomotor Mapping (AVM). This action set isthe same as the one used for AVM in Wayne et al. (2018) but with an additional no-op, which mayalso be replaced with the Fire action.
Table 7: Hybrid action set for Memory Maze, consisting of 8 continuous actions and a single discreteaction.
Table 8: V-MPO hyperparameters per environment.
Table 9: DMLab-30 Ablation Architecture Details. We report the number of runs per model that ranto completion (i.e. 10 billion environment steps). We follow the standard convention that the hid-den/embedding dimension of transformers is equal to the head dimension multiplied by the numberof heads. (Sec. 4.1 & Sec. 4.3).
