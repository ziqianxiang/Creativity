Table 1: Knowledge hypergraph completion results on JF17K, FB -auto and m-FB 15K for base-lines and the proposed method. The prefixes ‘r’ and ‘m’ in the model names stand for reificationand multi-arity respectively. Both our methods outperform the baselines on all datasets.
Table 2: Knowledge graph completion results on WN18 and FB15K for baselines and HypE. Notethat we do not include results for HSimplE because for knowledge graphs, HSimplE is equivalentto SimplE. The table shows that HypE performs similar to the best baselines for knowledge graphswith binary relations.
