Table 1: An overview of tasks used to evaluate the benefit of using world graphs. Visualizations canbe found in Appendix D.
Table 2: On a variety of tasks and environment setups, we evaluate RL models trained with GCP πginitialization, with Gw world graph travresal, and with both. All models on the right are equippedwith WN. Left are baselines for additional comparison. We report final rewards for MultiGoal tasksand success rates for Door-Key are reported. If no result reported, the agent failed to solve the task.
Table 3: Comparing learned Vp versus random Vrand as wide subgoals on large mazes, all trained with πginitialization and graph traversal. Vp generally is superior in terms of performance and consistency. We reportfinal rewards for MultiGoal tasks and success rates for Door-Key are reported.
