Table 1: Baseline network details and the complexity of hidden linear classifiers used for our tech-nique.
Table 2: Detecting incorrect classifications and making early decisions for image classification task.
Table 3: Performance of our technique on detecting adversarial and out-of-distribution data forimage classification task. The reported TNR for adversarial and OOD detection is computed at FNRmentioned in Table. 2. All the values are percentages.
