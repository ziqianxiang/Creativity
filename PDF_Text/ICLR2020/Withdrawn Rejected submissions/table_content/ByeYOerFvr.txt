Table 1: Evaluations of models trained for 50 epochs. MDNX, indicates MDN with X components,”w/o CX” indicates average precision when predictions by component X are ignored.
Table 2: AP and AR on different subsets of coco-val for MDN2 trained on LargeHG.
Table 3: Statistics for coco-val subsets and MDN max component. For face visibility, instances withmore than 5 annotated keypoints (in parentheses for minimum of 10) are used. For components,predictions with score at least .5 are considered (in parentheses for minimum of .7).
Table 4: Fine grained evaluation on coco-val in terms of average precision.
Table 5: Performance on COCO test-dev. Unless stated otherwise, all results correspond to single-scale inference with left-right flip augmentation. The top rows belong to top-down models, and themiddle rows to bottom-up models.
