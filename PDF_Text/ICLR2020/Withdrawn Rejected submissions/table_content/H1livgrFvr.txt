Table 1:  Performance of different Mahalanobis setting for DenseNet.  ‘R’ is the abbreviation for‘resized’. The best and worst results are highlighted in boldface and underline for each setting.
Table  2:  Ablation  results  on  analyzing  the  effect  of  each  component:  the  concatenation  of  fea-ture maps from all layers (denoted by layer aggregation), global average pooling, and compressive-complexity pooling.  AUROC is used as an evaluation metric.  The best results are marked in bold-face.
Table 3: Performance of different out-of-distribution detection methods using pretrained DenseNetand ResNet.  For out-of-distribution datasets, ‘C’ and ‘R’ are the abbreviations for ‘cropped’ and‘resized’, respectively. The best result is highlighted by boldface.
Table  4:    Performance  of  different  out-of-distribution  detection  methods  that  utilize  out-of-distribution  samples  for  the  validation.   For  out-of-distribution  datasets,  ‘C’  and  ‘R’  are  the  ab-breviations for ‘cropped’ and ‘resized’, respectively. The best result is highlighted in boldface.
Table  5:   Performance  of  different  out-of-distribution  detection  methods  that  utilize  adversarialsamples for the validation.  For out-of-distribution datasets, ‘C’ and ‘R’ are the abbreviations for‘cropped’ and ‘resized’, respectively. The best result is highlighted in boldface.
Table 6: Ablation results on analyzing the effect of each component: the weighted sum of the scoresobtained  from  all  layers  (denoted  by  weighted  sum),  global  average  pooling,  and  compressive-complexity pooling.  AUROC is used as an evaluation metric.  The best results are marked in bold-face.
