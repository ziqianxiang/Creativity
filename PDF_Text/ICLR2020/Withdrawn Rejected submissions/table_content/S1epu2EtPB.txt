Table 1: We report the mean FVD for both the full model and two baselines, averaged over all10 training runs with 100 stochastic generations each run, and the corresponding 95% confidenceintervals. A lower value of the FVD corresponds to higher quality of the generated videos.
Table 2: Diversity measured by the average pairwise cosine distance in the FVD embedding space,over 100 stochastic generations. A higher value corresponds to more diverse videos. The mean ofthe 10 training runs is reported, together with its 95%-confidence interval.
Table 3: Average SSIM of our model using direct 3D convolution and alternative methods basedon RNN, such as SDVI (Xu et al., 2018), or optical flow, such as SepConv (Niklaus et al., 2017)and SuperSloMo (Jiang et al., 2018). Higher is better. Note the difference in setup: our modelspans a time base twice as long as the others. The SSIM for each test example is computed onthe best sequence out of 100 stochastic generations, as per standard practice (Babaeizadeh et al.,2018; Denton & Fergus, 2018; Lee et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2018). We report the mean and the95%-confidence interval for our model over 10 training runs.
