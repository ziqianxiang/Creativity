Table 3: Detailed perplexity and accuracy results for Figure 5.
Table 4: Final test accuracy and average accuracy STD of training ResNet34 on CIFAR-10 over5 runs (including the detailed data of the curves in Figure 1 and Figure 2a). For all the methods,η0 = 0.1, β = 0.9. Multiple runs start with the same x0.
