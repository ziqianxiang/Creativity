Table 1: Test accuracy on CIFAR100. SGD refers to models trained with standard StochasticGradient Descent optimizer. LS are models improved by using Label Smoothing technique. SDare the models trained with SnapShot Distillation method. Finally, DUPS and DUPS+ are ourmethods proposed in this paper. The difference between DUPS and DUPS+ is that DUPS+ usescyclic learning rate while DUPS does not.
