Table 1: Mean-Squared Error results for the Sinusoidal Regression task as compared against othermethods. Lower is better.
Table 2: Mean-Squared Error results for the alternativeSinusoidal Regression Task. Lower is better.

Table 4: Comparison of Models With and WithoutSelf-Attention on 10-shot Sinusoidal Regression10-shotWithout Attention	0.163 ± 0.003With Attention	0.062 ± 0.003With residual connections and layer normalization. We compare the simpler model performance onthe sinusoidal regression task as specified in Table 1 With our original model and shoW the resultsin Table 4. The results shoW that adding the self-attention operations do improve our methodsperformance on the 1D sinusoidal regression task.
