Table 1: Quantitative Comparison. Average test log-likelihood (higher is better) in nats per pixelper channel for Moving MNIST, BAIR Robot Pushing, and KTH Actions. For flow-based models(1-AF and 2-AF), we report the average log-likelihood. For sequential latent variable models (SLVMand SLVM w/ 1-AF), we report the average lower bound on the log-likelihood.
Table 2: Number of parameters for each model on each dataset. Flow-based models containrelatively few parameters as compared with the SLVM, as our flows consist primarily of 3 Ã— 3convolutions with limited channels. In the SLVM, we use 2 LSTM layers for modelling the priorand posterior distribution of latent variable while in the combined model we use 1 LSTM layer foreach.
Table 3: Training Quantitative Comparison. Average training log-likelihood (higher is better) innats per pixel per channel for Moving MNIST, BAIR Robot Pushing, and KTH Actions. For flow-based models (1-AF and 2-AF), we report the average log-likelihood. For sequential latent variablemodels (SLVM and SLVM w/ 1-AF), we report the average lower bound on the log-likelihood.
