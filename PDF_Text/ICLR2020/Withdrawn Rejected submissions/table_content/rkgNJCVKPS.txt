Table 1: Performance metrics for the different model setsModel Set	Validation Accuracy	Cohenâ€™s Kappa StatisticsAll Extremity Types (pre-trained)	0.830	0.658Wrist-Only (pre-trained)	0.862	0.717Wrist-Only (random initialised)	0.778	0.539Finger-Only (pre-trained)	0.766	0.622In order to investigate the contributing factors for the model performance, layer-wise and class acti-vations were applied on selected images to understand the feature extraction mechanism performedby the DenseNet architecture. Figure 4 presents an example of activation visualisations that will beused throughout this work for analysis and comparison. All other selected cases can be found in Ap-pendix A.2. It should be noted that the presented cases in this work may not capture all scenarios inthe dataset. However, the authors believe these cases are representative and sufficient to demonstratethe effectiveness of the proposed framework for the model interpretation purpose.
