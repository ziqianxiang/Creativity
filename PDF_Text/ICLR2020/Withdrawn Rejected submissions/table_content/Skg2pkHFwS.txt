Table 1: Comparison between training the policy inside real environment and inside an agent’sinternal simulation. ± is followed by one standard error.
Table 2: Results of the collective policy learning. When multiple agents’ internal models providecomplementary evidences from their biased representations, the collective policy achieves higherreal-environment scores than that of the best performing individual internal model.
