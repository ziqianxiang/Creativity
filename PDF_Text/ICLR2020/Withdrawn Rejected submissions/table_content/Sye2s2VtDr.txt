Table 1: The values of interpretation inconsistency of features, where α ∈ {0, 1} and β ∈ {0, 1}, onfour toy datasets, characterizing logical operations AND, OR, XNOR and XOR respectively. Largeinterpretation inconsistency values give hints about cross features.
Table 2: Statistics of the benchmark datasets.
Table 3: Summary of results in terms of AUC (in percent) on narrow datasets.
Table 4: Summary of results in terms of AUC (in percent) on wide datasets.
Table 5: Comparison of cross feature generation time (in seconds) on each dataset.
Table 6: The number of second/high-order cross feature fields generated on each dataset.
