Table 1: Results on synthetic 2D MOG. We report log-likelihood (LL), clustering accuracies (adjustedRand index (ARI) (Hubert & Arabie, 1985) and normalized mutual information (NMI), the meanabsolute error between true k and estimated k, and processing time per dataset. The numbers below(nmₐₓ, kmₐₓ) are oracle LL values computed by the true parameters. We report the average on 5 runs.
Table 2: Results for 1,000 test datasets sampled from Embedded ImageNet.
Table 3: Unsupervised cross-task transfer learning on Omniglot.  Normalized mutual information(higher is better) is averaged across 20 alphabets (datasets), each of which have between 20 and 47letters (classes). All values beside DAC were reported in Hsu et al. (2019). "k given" means that thetrue number of clusters was given to the model.
Table 4: Mean absolute error of cluster number (k) estimate and processing time per dataset on theOmniglot benchmark.
Table 5:  Comparison of iterative filtering and NCP on 100 random datasets with (nmₐₓ, kmₐₓ)  =(3000, 12). The oracle log-likelihood is    1.5309, and DAC recorded    1.5640. S is the number ofsamples per dataset used for NCP.
Table 6: Results on warped Gaussian datasets.
Table 7: The results on EMNIST.
Table  8:  Absolute  error  of  cluster  number  (k)  estimate  and  time  per  dataset  on  the  Omniglotbenchmark. We show averages on the bottom row. Lower is better for both metrics.
