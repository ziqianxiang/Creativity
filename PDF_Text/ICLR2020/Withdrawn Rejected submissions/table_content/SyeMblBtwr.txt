Table 1: List of hyperparameters of algorithms used in the Paper. The remaining hyperparameterswere the same as in Fujimoto et al. (2018). TD3 with CrossNorm 2048 used a forward pass of batchsize 2048 only to get the mean and variance of the batch for normalization, while the training wasconducted with batch size 256.
