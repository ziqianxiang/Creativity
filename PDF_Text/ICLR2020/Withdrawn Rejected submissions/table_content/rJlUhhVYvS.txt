Table 1: Example of graph data sets. N is the number of graphs, C is the number of different classes.
Table 2: Isomorphic metrics for Top-10 data sets based on the proportion of isomorphic graphs I%.
Table 3: Isomorphic metrics with node labels for Top-10 data sets based on the proportion of iso-morphic graphs I%. IP% is the proportion of isomorphic pairs of graphs, Mismatched % is theproportion of mismatched labels.
Table 4: Mean classification accuracy for test sets Ytest and Yiso (in brackets) in 10-fold cross-validation. Top-1 result in bold.
Table 5: All original graph data sets. N is the number of graphs, C is the number of different classes.
Table 6: Isomorphic metrics for all data sets. Sorting is based on the proportion of isomorphicgraphs I%. Num. orbits is the number of non-trivial orbits. IP % is the proportion of isomorphicpairs of graphs, Mismatched % is the proportion of mismatched labels.
Table 7: Isomorphic metrics for data sets with node labels. Sorting is based on the proportion ofisomorphic graphs I%. Num. orbits is the number of non-trivial orbits. IP % is the proportion ofisomorphic pairs of graphs, Mismatched % is the proportion of mismatched labels. Table does notinclude data sets with no node labels.
Table 8: Statistics for new clean data sets. Retention is the proportion of graphs remaining aftercleaning procedure. Min. Class and Max. Class are minimum and maximum number of graphs in aclass. Sorted by retention.
