Table 1: Classification accuracy for different methods of predicting Basal genomic subtype from images orgrade from gene expression. Linear SVM and DNN were trained on a single view, while all other methods weretrained with both views. By regularizing with the second view during training, all TOCCA variants improvedclassification accuracy. The standard error is in parentheses.
