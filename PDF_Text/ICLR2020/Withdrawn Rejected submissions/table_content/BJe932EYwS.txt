Table 1: Performance on the newstest-2014 for WMT14 EN-DE and test2013 for IWSLT EN-DE. ‘-’denotes same numbers as above. ‘*’ indicates our implementation. The decoding speed is measuredsentence-by-sentence and the speedup is computed by comparing with Transformer.
Table 2: Results on validation set and test set of Quora.
Table 3: Results on validation set of WMT14 DE-EN with different position strategy. “HSP” meansthe reference position sequence derived from the heuristic position searching.
Table 4: Results on test set of Quora.
Table 5: Examples of translation outputs from PNAT with different setting on WMT14 DE-EN. It isshould be noted that the length is different between the position sequence and the output sequencebecause we keep the origin position output and combine the BPE sequence to word sequence.
