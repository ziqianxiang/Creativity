Table 1: The test result on natural examples and '∞-attacks for CIFAR10 (E = 8/255). The PGDattacks are generated with 20 random restarts and counted the worst case only.
Table 2: The transfer attack results between the TRADE and SENSE model on CIFAR10. The'∞ PGD40 and MIFGSM attacks are generated. The subscripts of the column names denote thegenerating model. The denominator and numerator in each cell are the number of adversarial attacksand correct predictions respectively (E = 8/255).
