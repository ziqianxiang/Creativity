Table 1: Search and Learning parameters in AlphaGo Zero and AlphaZero. In AlphaGo Zero,nmcts = 1600 while in AlphaZero nmcts = 800. PUCT coefficient in AlphaGo Zero were notexplicitly specified, studies by Tian et al. (2019) suggests cpuct = 1.5. α = 0.03 in Go; ditherselection threshold η of MCTS was 30 with temperature 1.0; weight for dirichlet noise = 0.25.
Table 2: Detailed match results against MoHex 2.0. Each set of games were played by iteratingall opening moves; each opening is tried twice with the competitor starts first and second, thereforeeach match consists of 162 games. We use the final iteration-80 models for 2HNN and 3HNN fromFigure 4. The overall results are calculated with 95% confidence. MCTS-2HNN and MCTS-3HNNused 800 simulations per move with expand threshold of 0. MoHex 2.0 used default setting with10,000 simulations per move.
