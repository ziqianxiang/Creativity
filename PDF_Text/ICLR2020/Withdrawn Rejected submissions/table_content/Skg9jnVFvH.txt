Table 1: The number of parameters among the compared architectures, different configurations andby output resolution (WaveGAN, PUGAN with one BWE, PUGAN with two BWEs and PUGANwith four BWEs for two sampling rates, 16 kHz and 44.1 kHz). Note that all varied configurationshave significantly less number of parameters than the comparable WaveGAN. Within the PUGAN,also note that most of the parameters are subsumed in the lightweight WaveGAN module. WaveGANwas made to generate the 1.48 second long 44.1 kHz audio as 4-second long 16 kHz audio.
Table 2: Result of qualitative and quantitative evaluation. We compared the IS and other subjectivequality metrics among the original WaveGAN, an improved WaveGAN (which contains spectralnormalization and sinc convolution in the discriminator) and the varied configurations of PUGAN. ISwas measured using the pretrained WaveGAN model from the official repository. Human evaluationincludes the accuracy of identifying the correct label and subjective rating of the sound quality inthe scale of 1 to 5.
