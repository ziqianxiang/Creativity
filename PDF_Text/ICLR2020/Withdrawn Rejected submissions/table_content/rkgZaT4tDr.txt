Table 1: Improved Scores of Different Noise Compared to RNN Gaussian Noise. Ranking Scoreand Seek Count are scaled to match Overall = RankingScore - SeekCount for easy comparison.
Table 2: Improved Scores of Different Model Compared to MLPsince it is hard to explore good documents at first. We also punish the agent to avoid unsupportedrewrites, since the production system uses designed rules for each class of the queries and simplyomits a rewrite without any useful feedback. We test punishing repeated rewrites, however, it helpsseek count (more efficient) but may harm ranking scores.
Table 3: Average evaluation results (the average of all training rewards and final evaluation reward)on benchmarks Platform-v0 and Goal-v0 with PA-DDPG (Hausknecht & Stone (2015)), MP-DQN(Bester et al. (2019)) and P-DQN (Xiong et al. (2018)). We use reported number from the papers,while last two methods report another metric on Goal-v0.
