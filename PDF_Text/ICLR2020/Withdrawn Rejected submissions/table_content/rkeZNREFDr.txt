This test is conducted by comparing model metrics such as root mean squareerror (RMSE) for regression tasks, classification accuracy for multi-class datasets. 2) Because ourmodel can separately account for each layer’s contribution, we can apply the gradient with respectto each layer and get the level of features our model recognize for each part of the input.

We test our model’s ability to extract abstract concepts. For comparison, we follow theexperiments in the NIT paper and choose the class cat and deer to perform binary classification.
