Table 1: Comparison of generalization and robustness for MNIST on Lenet-5-Caffe, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100on VGG-16 architecture under l∞-PGD attack. All the values are measured by computing mean and standarddeviation across 3 trials upon randomly chosen seeds, respectively. The best results are highlighted in bold andthe gain is shown over the base adversarial trained model.
