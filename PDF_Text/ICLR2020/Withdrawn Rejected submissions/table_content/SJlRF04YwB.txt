Table 1: Performance of SqueezeDet on SAEs generated using single parameter modifications. Themodel had (a) recall = 100, and (b) mAP = 99.4 on benign/non-adversarial inputs. We observed thatsingle parameter modifications are ineffective.
Table 2: Performance of SqueezeDet on SAEs generated using multi-parameter modifications. Themodel had (a) recall = 100, and (b) mAP = 99.4 on benign/non-adversarial inputs. We observed thatcertain combinations of multiple parameters are effective towards launching an attack.
Table 3: Performance of SqueezeDet on SAEs when (b) the model is retrained (on a combinationof SAEs + benign inputs), and (c) the model is tuned (on just SAEs), compared to (a) the baselinemodel (trained on benign images) on SAEs. Both retraining and tuning improve mAP.
Table 4: Performance of SqueezeDet on SAEs when the model is (a) retrained (on pixel perturbations+ benign inputs), and (b) tuned (on just pixel perturbations). Retraining and tuning (with pixelperturbations) is ineffective against SAEs.
Table 5: Performance of dual tuning (i.e. tuning a model robust to SAEs with pixel perturbations,and tuning a model robust to pixel perturbations with SAEs). The generality of pixel perturbationsis masked by the specificity of SAEs (Table 5b - column 1).
