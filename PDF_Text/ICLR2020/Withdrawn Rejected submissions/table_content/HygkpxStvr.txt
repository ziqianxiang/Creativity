Table 1: This environment serves as only aproof of concept. Since the environment isa simple 2D grid with skill primitive indica-tor cell at the bottom, an efficient approachshould be able to achieve almost full accu-racy. Our method is able to perfectly segmentthe data into ground truths, while other base-lines can not despite easily separable skills.
Table 2: We show the segmentation performance across different methods on train, validation, and test datasetsfor Dial Jaco and RoboSuite Object Manipulation. (a) Dial Jaco: we train our segmentation model ontrajectories with three to four subtasks and test with five subtask trajectories. Our approach beats all baselinesby significant margin except for FCN-MIL which performs similar to ours on training and validation, but isoutperformed on the test set. (b) Robosuite: we train our segmentation model on trajectories with three subtasksand test with four subtask trajectories. Our approach outperforms all baselines by significant margin.
Table 4: Quantitative Zero-Shot results on Dial Jaco Manipulation: This table shows the comparison ofperformance across different methods. The first two columns reports the segmentation accuracy on validation setwithout and with minimum of5 time-step segment rejection. The last column shows the zero-shot subtask successrate on 5 subtask tasks. Our method has significantly better post 5 time-step segment rejection segmentationaccuracy and zero-shot subtask performance.
