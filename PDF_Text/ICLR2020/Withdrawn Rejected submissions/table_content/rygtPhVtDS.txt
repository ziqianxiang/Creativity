Table 1: Comparison of various regularization methods for three neural network based CDE modelsacross 5 data sets. We report the test log-likelihood and its respective standard deviation (higherlog-likelihood values are better).
Table 2: Comparison of conditional density estimators across 5 data sets. Reported is the test log-likelihood and its respective standard deviation (higher log-likelihood values are better).
