Table  1:   Top-1  classification  error  (%)  on  CIFAR-10  dataset.    The  first  7  columns  are  frommanuscript of Kim et al. (2018).
Table  2:   Top-1  classification  error  (%)  on  CIFAR-100  dataset.    The  first  7  columns  are  frommanuscript of Kim et al. (2018).
Table 3:  Top-1 and Top-5 classification error (%) on ImageNet ILSVRC2012 dataset.  Pretrainedstudent and teacher network are from PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2017) model zoo.  Other statistics aregathered from our implementations.
Table 4:  Mean average precision (%) on PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset.  Both student and teachernetwork follow the Faster-RCNN pipeline. The backbone of student and teacher networks are VGG-16 and ResNet-101 respectively.
