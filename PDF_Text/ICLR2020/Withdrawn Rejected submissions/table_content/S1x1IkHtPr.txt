Table 1: Assessment of the accuracy of the distributions over conformations generated by threemodels compared to the ground-truth. We compare the distributions with respect to the marginalsp(dk|G), p(dk, dl|G), and the distribution over all edges between C and O atoms p({dk}|G). Twodifferent metrics are used: median MMD between ground-truth conformations and generated ones,and mean ranking (1 to 3) based on the MMD. Reported are the results for molecular graphs in atest set from three train-test splits. Standard errors are given in brackets.
Table 2: Median difference in average properties between ground-truth and RDKit and GraphDG:total electronic energy Eelec (in kJ/mol), the energy of the HOMO and the LUMO LUMO and LUMO,respectively (in eV), and the dipole moment Î¼ (in debye). Reported are the results for moleculargraphs from the test set, averaged over three train-test splits. Standard errors are given in brackets.
