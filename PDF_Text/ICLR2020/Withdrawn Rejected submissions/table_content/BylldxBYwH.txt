Table 1: Ablation study configurations.
Table 2: Structure of the encoder part in the velocity branch.
Table 3: Structure of the DenseBlock in the velocity branch.
Table 4: Structure of the DenseBlock in the stream function prediction network.
Table 5: Loss functions weights. The losses Lvel and Ljacobian are weighted differently on emptyregions (emtpy) and known regions (valid).
