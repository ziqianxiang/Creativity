Table 1: Classification accuracy and privacy of the students. LNMax refers to the method fromPapernot et al. (2017). The number of teachers is set to 250 unless otherwise mentioned. We setδ = 10-5 to compute values ofε (to the exception of SVHN where δ = 10-6). The baselines refersto student that are trained from the noiseless votes from all teachers. Ground truth refers to studentthat are trained with ground truth query labels.
Table 2: Label accuracy of teacher ensembles when compared to the ground truth labels from variousmethods using 250 teachers. Clean denotes the aggregation without adding any noise perturbation.
