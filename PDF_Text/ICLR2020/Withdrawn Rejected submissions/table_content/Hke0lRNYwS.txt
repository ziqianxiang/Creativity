Table 1: Quantitative benchmark presenting average PSNR/SSIMs for scale factor Ã—2 on four test sets.
Table 2: Quantitative comparison of variation over convergence thresholds. Higher values forPSNR and SSIM are better, whereas lower values for L1 are better. Bold font indicates superiorperformance.
Table 3: Quantitative comparison of odd-even versus up-down update rules. Higher values forPSNR and SSIM are better, whereas lower values for L1 are better. Bold font indicates superiorperformance.
