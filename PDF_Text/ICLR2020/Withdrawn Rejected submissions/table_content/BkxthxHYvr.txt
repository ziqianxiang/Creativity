Table 1: Reconstruction performance and generation quality (Valid, Unique, Novel).
Table 2: Correlation between the desiredinput property and the obtained property .
Table 3: Sup-VAE-1-GRU /Sup-VAE-3-GRU: supervised version of SD-VAE model where Y is beenfeed to only the first layer/all layer decoder. CGD-VAE: our model, conditional generation withdisentangling. The result for CVAE and GVAE are taken from the literature, ”-” refers that thosemeasures are not reported. The rest of baseline result is obtained by rerunning (SD-VAE) and editingthe original code (Sup-VAE).
Table 4: Correlation between the desired input property and the obtained property when z is sampledfrom the approximate learned prior, Z 〜^σ (z), (conditional generation), and when Z is sampled fromthe learned posterior given some x, Z 〜q(z∣x), (property transfer).
Table 5: Baseline model performance on ZINC6.7 Molecule property optimizationFigure 11 is the visualization of the generated molecules from property optimization task, given infigure 6 section 4. The molecules are generated by increasing the logP of a given molecule, i.e. wehold z fixed and increase the y value. Among the all generated molecules, 19 of them are unique.
