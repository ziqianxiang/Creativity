Table 1: True and Tight Bounds on Real Networks. Table shows that our bounds are a super set to truebounds computed with an exact MIP solver. Moreover, they are much tighter than bounds estimated by IBP.
Table 2: Shows the interval bounds obtained by propagating ∈ {0.05, 0.1, 0.25} with n = 2 anddenoted as lD1 M, u1DM for the first output function of the 2-dimensional output network (shown alongthe x-axis in the previous figure) while lD2M and u2DM is for the other function (shown along the y-axisin the previous figure).
Table 3: Shows the interval bounds obtained by propagating ∈ {0.05, 0.1, 0.25} with n = 10 anddenoted as lD1 M, u1DM for the first output function of the 2-dimensional output network (shown alongthe x-axis in the previous figure) while lD2M and u2DM is for the other function (shown along the y-axisin the previous figure).
Table 4: Shows the interval bounds obtained by propagating ∈ {0.05, 0.1, 0.25} with n = 20 anddenoted as lD1 M, u1DM for the first output function of the 2-dimensional output network (shown alongthe x-axis in the previous figure) while lD2M and u2DM is for the other function (shown along the y-axisin the previous figure).
Table 5: Architectures for the three models trained on MNIST and CIFAR10. "CONV p × w × h+ s",correspond to p 2D convolutional filters with size (w × h) and strides of s. While "FC d" is a fullyconnected layer with d outputs. Note that the last fully connected layer is omitted.
