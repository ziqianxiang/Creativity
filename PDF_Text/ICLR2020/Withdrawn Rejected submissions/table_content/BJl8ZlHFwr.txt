Table 1: Comparison with shared representation learning models in a GZSL setting. We include theresults of combining each model with a domain discriminator (denoted as x-D). AUROC shows theevaluation of domain prediction by the domain discriminator using the area under the curve of thereceiver operating characteristic.
Table 2: Comparison with GZSL state-of-the-art models. Bold typeface denotes the best perfor-mance among the relation-based models.
