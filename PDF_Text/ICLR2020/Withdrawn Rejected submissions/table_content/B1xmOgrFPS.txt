Table 1: Two few-shot object detection benchmark testbeds for performance evaluationBenchmark Datasets: We construct two benchmark testbeds to facilitate the performance evalua-tion for few-shot object detection in meta-learning settings. The first is on Pascal VOC2007, andthe second is on the animal subset of ImageNet-LOC dataset. Table 1 gives details of these datasets.
Table 2: mAP Performance Evaluation on the VOC-FS OD benchmarkRCNN learns a general feature map for all Kway-N shot detection problem and optimize RPN bymeta learning scheme, which proves more effective in few-shot settings. Notably, the results aresurprising since the recall of RPN in few-shot scenario is significantly lower (> 90% with enoughtraining data on VOC dataset).
