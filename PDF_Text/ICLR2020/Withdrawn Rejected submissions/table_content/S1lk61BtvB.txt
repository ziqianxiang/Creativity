Table 3: Effect of our novel objective in the latent space. Top Row: The standard WAE and α-GANobjectives leads to mismatch to the prior in the latent space. We show samples z (in red) whichare highly likely under the standard Gaussian prior (blue) but have low probability under the learntmarginal posterior qφ (z). Bottom Row: We show that such points z lead to low quality data samples(in red), which do correspond to any of the modes.
