Table 1: Average 5-way k′-shot novel class accuracy on CUB. We use ResNet-18 either pre-trainedon Places or we train it from scratch on k base class examples.  ProtoNet (Snell et al., 2017) is asreported by Chen et al. (2019). For ensemble (Dvornik et al., 2019), we report the distilled modelfrom an ensemble of 20. Baselines to be compared only to randomly initialized with k = ALL.
Table 2: Average 5-way k′-shot novel class accuracy on modified miniImageNet. We use ResNet-18either pre-trained on Places or we train it from scratch on k base class examples.  Baselines onlyshown in Appendix B on the original miniImageNet.
Table 3: Classes removed from miniImageNet to form the modified miniImageNet dataset and thecorresponding overlapping Places classes.
Table 4: Average 5-way k′-shot novel class accuracy on miniImageNet. We use ResNet-18 eitherpre-trained on Places or we train it from scratch on k base class examples.  ProtoNet (Snell et al.,2017)   is as reported by Chen et al. (2019).  CTM refers to the data-augmented version of Li et al.
