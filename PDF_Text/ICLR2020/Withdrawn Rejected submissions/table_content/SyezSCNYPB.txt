Table 1: Summary of the proposed two datasets, compared with currently commonly-used datasets (Gondalet al., 2019). We can see that the proposed two datasets - Faclor3D and Isaac3D both have much largerresolutions than previous datasets, together with the maximum number of factors. Furthermore, in terms ofphotorealism, both datasets are rendered based on a complex 3D scene, in particular with texturing in Isaac3D.
Table 2: Comparison of unsupervised AC-StyleGAN and state-of-the-art VAE-based models: β-VAE, Fac-torVAE and β-TCVAE on the dSprites and downscaled Isaac3D datasets. Note that the scores of VAE-basedmodels are obtained based on the implementation in Locatello et al. (2019a), where we set β = 6 for β-VAE,γ = 30 for FactorVAE and β = 8 for β-TCVAE after a grid search over different hyperparameters.
Table 3: Comparison of semi-supervised AC-StyleGAN with the supervised baseline, where we use γ = 10and consider two cases of using 5% and 1% of labelled data. In the supervised baseline, we remove theunsupervised disentanglement term in the discriminator loss function of Eq. (2).
