Table 1: Mean opinion score (MOS) comparison on one hundred random samples from VQA 2.0test-std split.
Table 2: MOS score categorization by answer types.
Table 3: Test-dev scores of models on VQA 2.0 dataset. We use two-glimpse BAN (Kim et al.,2018a) for the experiment. Note that the proposed methods use more data in training (i.e., SNLIdataset (Bowman et al., 2015), etc), and are not fairly compared with the BAN.
Table 4: Mean opinion score (MOS) comparison on one hundred random samples from VQA 2.0test-std split. Note that we used two different explanation generators: the Up-Down (Anderson et al.,2018b), and the MUlti-VQAE (Li et al., 2018).
