Table 1: Accuracy metrics on the USPTO-50K dataset without reaction labels. The variations wetest are data augmentation, pre-training and number of latent classes. The highest accuracy modelfor each different latent model is bolded, and the highest accuracy model overall is parenthesized.
Table 2: Prediction accuracies when tested on our template split of the USPTO dataset, for whichany template-based model would get 0% accuracy on the test set. We see that our template-freemethods can still generalize to this test set.
Table 3: The left table shows the comparison of number of unique reactions predicted by the basemodel vs. the mixture model (holding other factors constant). The right table shows human eval-uation metrics, in which a human was asked to rate whether the outputs of the base model or themixture model was more diverse, or neither.
