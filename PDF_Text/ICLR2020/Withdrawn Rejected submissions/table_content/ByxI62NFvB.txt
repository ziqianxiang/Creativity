Table 1: The multi-class classification performance on the four electronic health records datasets and one fitnessdataset. The reported numbers are mean-AUROC for EHR and mean-Accuracy for squat. In the realestate priceforecast, the number indicates mean-percentage error, meaning a lower error indicates better performance.
Table 2: Accuracy and percentage error on NPA-Selective and NPA-Random-order, in which veriables arerandomly ordered. Only top 30% of variables were selected to the annotators.
Table 3: Type 1 Error over three iterations, which shows percentage of features selected from the model that donot match the features selected by the clinicians.
