Table 1: Quantitative evaluation: LPIPS yields single-image (spatial) perceptual similarity to GT, tLP mea-sures differences in perceptual temporal coherence to GT, while T-diff computes the absolute difference ofwarped subsequent frames (not accurate, only shown for completeness). Dθt and D*,t are models using nor-mal ResBloCks instead of DRRs, while Dθt uses a smaller discriminator. The best two scores for LPIPS andtLP rows are highlighted in bold.
