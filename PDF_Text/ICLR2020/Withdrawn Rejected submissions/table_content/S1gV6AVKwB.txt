Table 1: Quantitative evaluation of learned state maps. GAMA reliably finds MDP permutations whilebaselines incur 10Ã— larger deviation loss from the ground truth permutation map. Error bars/regions showthe standard deviation over 5 runs.
Table 2: Comparison of baselines by attributes demonstrated in the paper. The "No Act" column denoteswhether or not the demonstrations need to contain actions.
