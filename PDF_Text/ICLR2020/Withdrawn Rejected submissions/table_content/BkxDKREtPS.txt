Thesignature of each model is visualized in Fig. 5 for class ”tench”. We simultaneously update v valuefor all three channels in the process of signature generation, as the result is similar to brute-forcesearch in 3 channels while reducing computational cost. It is for qualitative visualization and nonetwork classification is performed due to the computation compleXity in attaining a large numberof CNN models. Different characteristics of these classical CNNs can be observed.

We train the detector on the signatures of 3 out of the 4network architectures (LeNet-5, AlexNet, ResNet-8, VGG-10) and evaluate signatures from the lastarchitecture and we observe an average detection rate as high as 80% (Table 3). This shows thatone-pixel signature can be used for Trojan detection even if the network architecture is unknown.

We extract 6000 images of three classes (person,car, and mobile phone) with 2000 images each from the Open Image Dataset V4 (Kuznetsova et al.,2018). We insert a small harpoon of size 10x10 pixels (resized to be 1/3 of the shorter side of theground truth box) at a location near middle right of the object within the ground-true bounding box7Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2020one-pixelsignatureinputFaster RCNNTFigure 7: Illustration for a backdoored object detector with the corresponding signature images.

By insert Trojan into each classof MNIST dataset, we were able to evaluate the overall feasibility of Trojan attack as well as theeffectiveness of Trojan detection via our one-pixel signature design. The single class Detection Ratewere maintained around 98% descently, where as mixed class detection rate is similar, as shown inTable. 6.
