Table 1: Forecasting performance on the test set of data-driven models for Lorenz-63 dynamicswhere only the first variable is observed: first two columns : mean RMSE for different forecastingtime steps, third column : largest Lyapunov exponent of a predicted series of length of 10000 time-steps (The true largest Lyapunov exponent of the Lorenz 63 model is 0.91 (Sprott, 2003)).
