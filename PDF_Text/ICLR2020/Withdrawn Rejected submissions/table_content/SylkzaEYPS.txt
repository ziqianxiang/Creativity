Table 1: ROUGE F1 scores for 1-gram, 2-gram, and longest common subsequence on CNN/DailyMail testset. The scores shown for Pgen and Pgenqov differ slightly from that listed in See et al. (2017), e.g. 39.47vs 39.53 for ROUGE-1. The pretrained models provided with their published code resulted in lower scores(differences may be due to changes in the underlying software libraries over time), but we were able to achievethese comparable scores by further training with a lower learning rate.

Table 3: Human rater preference versus Pgen-Cov on 300 random examples from the CNN/DailyMail testset. 95% confidence intervals for Pgen_cov+recoder (λ = 0.1) preference are (54.6%, 65.9%) overall,(48.8%, 60.4%) readability, and (56.9%, 68.2%) relevance, and (49.2%, 60.7%), (47.5%, 69.1%), (49.5%,61.1%) respectively for pgen_cov+recoder (λ = 0.2).
