We can find differenttrends in the distributions of the latent variable hn and rn of MDRA. The distribution of rn spreadswider than that of hn .

We adopt 10 folds cross variation to calculate the performance. The neuralnetwork for the classification is composed of4 layers and illustrated in Fig. 11 in Appendix D. Fromthis result, we consider that the features extracted by MDRA are quite effective for the classificationof time series data.

We found that each frequency data formed several spreadingclusters without overlapping.
