Table 1: Result for toy Montezumaâ€™s Revenge. We report the number of successful runs andthe number of seeds of network initialization. We also show the average number of visitedrooms, which is a proxy for the learning progress.
Table 2: Results of transfer experiments. We test transfers from one value function (Trans1) and transfer from ensembles of 2 and 3 value functions (Trans 2 and Trans 3). In thelater two cases the aggregation of values is learned. The results are averaged over 20 seeds.
Table 3: Default values of hyperparameters used in our experiments.
