Table 1: Top-1 unseen attribute-object recognition accuracies of baseline methods and our methodon the MIT-States dataset and UT-ZaPPos50k dataset.
Table 2: Top-1 unseen attribute-object recognition accuracies of the “Base” model and “Base +Attractor” model on the MIT-States dataset and UT-ZaPPos50K dataset. “Base” denotes the modelwithout attractor networks, and “Base + Attractor" denotes the model With attractor networks.
Table 3: ToP-1 accuracies of different loss function comPositions on the MIT-States dataset andUT-ZaPPos50k dataset. “at”, “fus”, “de”, “dis”, and “cd” rePresent the attractor loss Lat, fusion lossLfus, decoding loss Lde, discriminative loss Ldis, and conditional loss Lcd, resPectively.
Table 4: Top-1 accuracies of three parameter sharing settings and our setting on the MIT-Statesdataset and UT-Zappos50k dataset. faV = foV represents the parameter sharing in the visual en-coding module, faL = foL represents the parameter sharing in the linguistic encoding module, andAttV = AttL represents the parameter sharing in the visual attractor network and linguistic attractornetwork.
