Table 1: LDR networks compared with DCNNs on a flattend version of CIFAR-10. DCNNs outperform all LDR configurations with fewer weights.2			Table 2: Two depths scattering on CIFAR-10 followed by LDR or DC layer. Networks with DC layers outper- form all LDR configurations with fewer weights.		Architectures	#Params	Acc.	Architectures	#Params	Acc.
