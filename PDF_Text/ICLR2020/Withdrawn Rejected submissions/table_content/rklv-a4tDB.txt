The impedance values associated with the backgroundelliPses and circle were 1, 5 and 2 resPectively. The original Piecewise constant function σ wasslightly smoothed by a Gaussian kernel.

The algorithm was im-plemented by TensorFlow Ten (2015) using the ADAM optimizer which is a variant of the SGDalgorithm. We used almost the same hyper parameters set in our experiments. Batch size=1000,decaying learning rate starting at 5e - 3. The learning rate was factored by 0.8 every 200 epochs,Ns = 80000, Nb = 1200, λ = 0.01, α = 1e - 8, K = 40, μ = 0.01, and β = 0.01. In the diffusionand wave equation case we set λ = 1, β = 1e - 4, μ = 1e - 4 and α = 1e - 5. Running time, forthe EIT, on Intel i7-8650u CPU was about 15 minutes for the forward problem and 13 minutes forthe generalized inverse problem. For the diffusion and wave equation the running time was about 5
