Table 1: Position prediction error on different test datasets. “Test” has the same data distribution with trainingset. Other datasets change one or more environmental parameters, e.g. color, size, type, and light, which areunseen in the training set. “Avg” is the average error of “Color”, “Light”, “Size”, and “Type”. “Steps”indicatesthe number of negative sampling steps used to train the EBM. EBMs are able to generalize better. Larger numberof negative sampling steps significantly decrease overall EBM error.
