Table 2: Performance of trained In-Domain and ImageNet representations (rows) when using 1000training examples for downstream tasks (columns). Emphasized (bold font) are the best accuraciesper downstream task (column).
Table 3: Accuracy over different training methods and number of used training samples.
Table 4: Results on selected remote sensing datasets. All results use Top-1 accuracy, except forBigEarthNet which uses precision/recall and mean average precision. Our best results were obtainedby fine-tuning in-domain representations except for BigEarthNet which was obtained by fine-tuningImageNet.
