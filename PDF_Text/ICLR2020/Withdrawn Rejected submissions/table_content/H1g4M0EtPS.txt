In particular, dueto the streamlined gradient estimation scheme, we could alleviate the issue of random directionalderivative searches which plagues every zeroth order optimization scheme due to biased gradientestimates. The gradient estimation scheme can be used in any gradient based black-box adversarialattack method to attain higher attack accuracies with lower query counts. Our method facilitatessingle iteration based query efficient black-box attacks which we demonstrated to be as potent asmulti-step attacks on multiple architectures and datasets in terms of attack success rate. We also em-ployed techniques from matrix analysis and FFT to make our attack computationally efficient. Ourresults open avenues for more effective covariance modeling techniques so as to further streamlinegradient estimation schemes so as to facilitate more query efficient black-box adversarial attacks.
