Table 1: Summary of the constraints, soft regularizers, and projection functions for the three types ofannotations we use for VQA. The figures are conceptual representations in a 2D embedding space.
Table 2: Ablative evaluation on GQA (answer accuracy in percents). Every experiment was repeatedwith four different random seeds. We report the mean and standard deviation of single models, theperformance of the ensemble of these four models as in Teney et al. (2018).
Table 3: Additional results: extended metrics on the GQA test set (Hudson & Manning, 2019).
