Table 1: Relevance Between Generated and Golden Responses. The PPL results* of GPT-2 is notdirectly comparable because of the different vocabulary. More results can be found in Appendix A.1.
Table 2: Diversity and Novelty of Generated Response. Diversity is calculated within generatedresponses; Novelty is ComPared to the input post. More results are in APPendix A.1._______________	Diversity(â†‘)			Novelty w.r.t.

Table 3: Human Evaluation on Appropriate (Appro.) and Informativeness (Infor.). The AverageScore calculates the average of human judgment score. Best@1 Ratio indicates the fraction ofjudges consider the case as the best. The parameter number is also presented.
Table 4: More Metrics on Automatic Relevance Between Generated Response and Golden Re-sponse. Concept-PPL is the method used for calculating Perplexity in CCM (Zhou et al., 2018a),which combines the distribution of both words and concepts together. The Concept-PPL is meaning-less when utilizing different numbers of concepts (more concepts included, better Perplexity shows).
Table 5: More Metrics on Repetitiveness of Generated Response. The coverage is calculated be-tween generated response and user post, where lower means better.
Table 6: Bleu and Nist for Relevance of Ablation Study. The metrics are calculated between gener-ated responses and golden responses.
Table 7: Rouge and Meteor for Relevance and Dist for Diversity of Ablation Study. Rouge andMeteor are calculated between generated responses and golden responses, while Dist indicates thediversity of generated responses.
