Table 1: Comparison of conditional generative models for diverse colorization (VAE-MDN: Desh-pande et al. (2017); cGAN: Isola et al. (2017)). We additionally compare to a state-of-the-artregression model (‘CNN’, no diversity, Iizuka et al. (2016)), and the grayscale images alone (‘BW’).
Table 2: Quantitative comparison between smaller cINN and colorGAN on LSUN bedrooms. Themetrics used are explained in Table 1.
