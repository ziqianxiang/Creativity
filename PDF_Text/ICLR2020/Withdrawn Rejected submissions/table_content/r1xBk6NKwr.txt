Table 1: Encoder architecture. Size of activations, number of parameters and FLOPs.
Table 2: Accuracy on downstream tasks (and fraction of accuracy recovered wrt. baselines). Down-stream tasks: SPC: (Speech Commands), LSP: (LibriSpeech), TUT: TUT Urban Acoustic Scenes2018, MUS: MUSAN, BSD: Bird Audio Detection, LID: Spoken Language Identification. In bold thehighest accuracy attained by self-supervised models for each task.
Table 3: Accuracy obtained when training self-supervised models on LibriSpeech (and the relativedifference with respect to training on AudioSet). Red indicates a decrease in the level of accuracy.
Table 4: Accuracy obtained when using a larger encoder architecture (relative change wrt. Table 2).
Table 5: Accuracy using a head with two fully connected layers (relative change wrt. Table 2).
