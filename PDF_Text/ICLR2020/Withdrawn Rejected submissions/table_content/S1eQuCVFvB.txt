Table 1: Overall accuracy and the number of increased correct predictions in the “high disagreement”cases of Uniformly-weighted Majority Voting, HMTS, and DMTS on the 6 binary classificationdatasets. The “high disagreement” means that the difference between the number of predicting 0 and1 is small. We have 15 classifiers and the instance will be considered as having “high disagreement” ifthe vote number of majority class is 8 or 9. In HMTS, the numbers of “high disagreement” instanceswe consider in 6 datasets are 51, 52, 37, 149, 43, 45. As for DMTS, the numbers are 30, 64, 37, 76,13, 38. The results having the highest accuracy for each dataset are highlighted.
Table 2: Overall accuracy and the number of increased correct predictions in the “high disagreement”cases of Uniformly-weighted Majority voting, HMTS, and DMTS on the 6 multi-class classificationdatasets. We have 15 classifiers and the instance will be considered as having “high disagreement”if the vote number of majority class is less or equals to 6 for the 3-class and 4-class datasets. Thethreshold number is 5 for 6-class and 3 for 10-class datasets. In HMTS, the numbers of “highdisagreement” instances we consider in 6 datasets are 61, 54, 27, 65, 15, 157. As for DMTS, thenumbers are 48, 45, 25, 81, 25, 40. The results having the highest accuracy for each dataset arehighlighted.
