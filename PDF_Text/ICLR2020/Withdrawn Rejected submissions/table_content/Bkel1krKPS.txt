Table 1: Modules and their corresponding parameters of ARNe.
Table 2: PGM accuracy by previous methods and our model (ARNe). Accuracy of WReN as re-ported in (Santoro et al., 2017) and our implementation. MAC model included for comparison.
Table 3: Meta-target prediction performance.
Table 4: Generalisation results. No training results for WReN were available (Santoro et al., 2018).
Table 5: Comparison of different model configurations. The highlighted lines refer to the bestperforming model of the given dataset ratio. Values in the training, validation and test columnscharacterize the modelâ€™s accuracy. (lr = learning rate).
