Table 1: The results on MNIST and Boeing. The left column is what the CNN was trained on, andthe top row what it was tested on.
Table 2: The results on balanced EMNIST letters and full.
Table 3: The results on IAM. The left column is the results of word level classification accuracy,while the right character level accuracy (which we calculated as 100-character error rate, but pre-sented that way to keep the numbers consistent). We don’t run the RNN against IAM, as it is trainedon online IAM, and we can’t do word level recognition training on IAM and testing on Boeing doto a mismatch in vocabulary.
