Table 1: Progressive compression time to accuracy for ResNet-18 (top) and ShuffleNetv2 (bottom)compared to the baseline. Using less scans can reduce training times while still hitting the goalaccuracy.
Table 2: PCR image rates for ResNet-18 (top) and ShuffleNetv2 (bottom). With data in memory, the10 worker cluster can support training with 4050 images per second for ResNet-18 and 7075 imagesper second for ShuffleNetv2. Using less scans approaches this maximum training rate.
Table 3: PCR dataset size and record count information. Datasets vary in terms of number of imagesand the size of images. Some datasets, such as HAM10000, have image sizes larger than average.
