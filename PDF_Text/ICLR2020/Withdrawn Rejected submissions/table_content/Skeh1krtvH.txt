Table 1: The test log-likelihoods (LLs) of WaveFlow with different dilation cycles on the heightdimension. Both models are stacked with 8 flows and each flow has 8 convolutional layers.
Table 2: The heights and corresponding dilations used in our experiments. Note that, the receptivefields are only slightly larger than height h.
Table 3: The test LLs of WaveFlow with different permutation strategies. All models consist of 8flows and each flow has 8 convolutional layers with filter sizes 3.
Table 4: The test log-likelihoods (LLs) of all models conditioned on mel-spectrograms. For a × b = cin the flows×layers column, a is number of flows, b is number of layers in each flow, and c is thetotal number of layers. In WaveFlow, h is the squeezed height. Models with bolded test LLs arementioned in the text.
Table 5: The synthesis speed over real-time and the 5-scale Mean Opinion Score (MOS) ratings with95% confidence intervals. We use 30-layer WaveNet, 96-layer WaveGlow, and 64-layer WaveFlow.
