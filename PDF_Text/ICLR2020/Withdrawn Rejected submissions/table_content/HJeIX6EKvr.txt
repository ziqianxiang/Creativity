Table  1:    Model  accuracy  (in  percent)  on  the  CIFAR-10.1  test  set  when  trained  on  the  originalCIFAR-10 training set and our noisy training set. Number of parameters is the total trainable numberof parameters of the model and gap is the difference between the corresponding accuracies of thetwo training sets.
