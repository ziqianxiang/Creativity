Table 1: Adversarial robustness statistics, measured in the '∞ norm. Topl error is reported onCIFAR-10; Top5 error on ImageNet-1k. On CIFAR-10 gradient regularization is reported using eitherdouble backpropagation (DBP) or finite differences (FD).
Table 2: Adversarial robustness statistics, measured in '2. Topl error is reported on CIFAR-10; Top5error on ImageNet-1k. On CIFAR-10 gradient regularization is reported using either both doublebackpropagation (DBP) or finite differences (FD).
