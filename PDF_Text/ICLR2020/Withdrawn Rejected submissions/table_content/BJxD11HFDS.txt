Table 1: FMT achieves superior performance over baseline models for CMU-MOSI dataset (mul-timodal sentiment analysis). We report BA (binary accuracy) and F1 (both higher is better), MAE(Mean-absolute Error, lower is better), and Corr (Pearson Correlation Coefficient, higher is better).
Table 2: FMT achieves superior performance over baseline models (with the exception of Happyemotion) for discrete emotions in IEMOCAP (multimodal emotion recognition). We report BA(binary accuracy) and F1 (both higher is better).
Table 3: FMT achieves superior performance over baseline models in POM dataset (multimodalpersonality traits recognition). For label abbreviations please refer to Section 4.3. MA(5,7) denotesmulti-class accuracy for (5,7)-class personality labels (higher is better).
Table 4: FMT ablation studies on CMU-MOSI dataset. UNI, BI, TRI denote removing all unimodal,bimodal and trimodal factors respectively. L, A, V denote using only language, audio, and visualfactors respectively. S denotes the model with summarization networks replaced by simple addition.
Table 5: Multimodal sentiment analysis experiments with different number of FMS units insideMTL. The number in the square bracket indicates the number of FMS. The total number of attentionis 7 times the number in bracket.
Table 6: Multimodal sentiment analysis experiments with different number of MTL layers. Thenumber in the square bracket indicates the number of MTL layers.
Table 7: Results of experiments with different number of heads for OTF. The number in the squarebracket indicates the number of heads.
