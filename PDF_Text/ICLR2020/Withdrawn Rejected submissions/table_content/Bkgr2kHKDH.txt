Table 1: Comparisons of architecture search approaches for efficient models (ProxylessNAS (Caiet al., 2019b), SPOS: Single Path One-Shot (Guo et al., 2019), ChamNet (Dai et al., 2019), AMC (Heet al., 2018), HAQ(Wang et al., 2019) and EMS (Ours). EMS distinguishes from other works bydirectly searching mixed-precision architecture without extra interaction with target dataset.
Table 2: Comparison with state-of-the-art efficient models for hardware with fixed quantization ormixed precision. Our method cuts down the marginal search time by two-order of magnitudes whileachieving better performance than others. The marginal CO2 emission (lbs) and cloud compute cost($) (Strubell et al., 2019) is negligible for search in a new scenario.
