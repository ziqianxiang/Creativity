Table 1: Results on MVS, SUN3D, RGBD and Scenes11, the best results are noted by Bold.
Table 2: Results on ETH3D (Bold: best; α = 1.25). abs_rel, abs_diff, sq_rel, rms, and log_rms, areabsolute relative error, absolute difference, square relative difference, root mean square and log rootmean square, respectively.
Table 3: Results on ScanNet. (sc_inv: scale invariant log rms; Bold: best.)3D convolutional layers The detail architecture of 3D convolutional layers after D-CV is almostthe same as DPSNet (Im et al., 2019), except for the fist convolution layer. In order to compati-ble with the newly introduced depth consistent components in D-CV, We adjust the input channelnumber to 66 instead of 64. As shown in Figure 6, for 3D convolutional layers after P-CV, the ar-chitecture is similar to D-CV 3D convolution layers with three extra 3D average pooling layers andfinally there is one global average pooling in the dimensions of image width and height, after whichwe get a P × 1 × 1 tensor.
