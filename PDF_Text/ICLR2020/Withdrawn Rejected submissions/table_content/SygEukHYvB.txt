Table 1: Baseline and cross-validated CEB values for the ImageNet experiments. The middlecolumns show a ResNet-50 model trained with AutoAug (“50”) versus the corresponding CEBnetwork (“CEB”). The right columns (“-aa”) remove AutoAug from the data processing pipeline,and the left columns (“x2”) are models that are twice as wide. The CEB values reported here aredenoted with the dots in Figure 4. Lower values are better in all cases, and the lowest value in pairsof columns is shown in bold. Table 2 gives the same results for the ResNet- 1 52 models.
Table 2: Same as Table 1 above but for a deeper ResNet-152 model. Note that for the baseline152x2 and 152 models, the smaller model (152) actually has better mCE and equally good top-1accuracy, indicating that the wider model may be overfitting, but the CEB-152x2 model substantiallyoutperforms both of them across the board.
