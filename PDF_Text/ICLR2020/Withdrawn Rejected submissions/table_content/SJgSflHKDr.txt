Table 1: Classification accuracy and FD scores on the CIFAR10 (C10), SVHN, and Fashion MNIST(FM) data sets. Compared are various data augmentation techniques and their effect on classificationaccuracy and distribution distances.
Table 2: Detailed specifications of the speaker embedding network trained with the GE2E Loss (Wanet al., 2017) applied to calculate FD scores in section 5.3. The network is based on the densely con-nected network (Huang et al., 2016), fully-connected layers (FC), LSTMs (Hochreiter & Schmid-huber, 1997), and Statistical Pooling (Snyder et al., 2017). As an optimizer, we use Adam (Kingma& Ba, 2014) with a learning rate of 0.0001.
Table 3: Detailed accuracy and FD on the Amazon review categories. Models are trained by using different categories as train and test pairs. The FD is obtainedwith the GloVelOO embedding.
