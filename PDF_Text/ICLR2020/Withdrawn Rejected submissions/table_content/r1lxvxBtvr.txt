TransINTextends such line of thought to semantic relatedness between groups of objects, with angles betweenrelation spaces. In Fig. 5b, one can observe that the closer the angle between two embedded regions,the larger the overlap in area. For entities h and t to be tied by both relations r1, r2, t - h has tobelong to the intersection of their relation spaces. Thus, we hypothesize the following over any tworelations r1 , r2 that are n»ot explicitly tied by the pre-determined rules:Let V1 be the set of t - h’s in r1’s relation space (denoted as Rel1) and V2 that of r2’s. Then,(1)	Angle between Rel1 and Rel2 represents semantic "disjointness" of r1, r2; the more disjoint tworelations, the closer their angle to 90°.
