Table 1: Results of Human-Designed Programming Challenges. Details for tasks designed in each difficultylevel is explained at A.1The similar performance between the model learned from imitation learning and REINFORCE re-flects the limitations of only using a policy network for code generation, and thus suggests thatimprovement can come from the use of a value function.
