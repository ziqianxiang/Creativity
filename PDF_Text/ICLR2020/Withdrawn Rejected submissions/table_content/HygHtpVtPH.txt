Table 1: Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet and Places classification with a linear classifier. The resultsare reported based on the ImageNet / Places validation set and all the listed methods except ImageNet/Places labels, Domain Adapt are pre-trained on ImageNet without ground truth labels.
Table 2: Comparison with state-of-the-art representation learning methods on Pascal VOC visiontasks of classification, detection on 2007, and semantic segmentation on 2012. For classification wealso compare a setup that fixes the layers before conv5 and only train the fc6-8. The learned weightsfrom unlabeled ImageNet are transferred for the new tasks except the ImageNet labels.
