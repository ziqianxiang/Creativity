Table 1: Results on open-domain question answering datasets.
Table 2: Ablations of our model. On the left, we show how each sparse representation contributeto the performance, and on the right, we show how much gain we obtain from CoSPR in differentsearch strategies. Exact match scores are reported.
Table 3: Analysis of CoSPR compared to static tf-idf vectors. Given a context or a question (left),we list top n-grams weighted by tf-idf or CoSPR (right).
Table 4: Prediction samples from DrQA, DenSPI, and DenSPI+CoSPR. Each sample shows[document title], context, and predicted answer.
