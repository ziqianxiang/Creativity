Table 1: Ablation comparing average return over training, interpolated and extrapolated environ-ments (100 each). Results reflect mean and standard deviation of average return over 5 seeds.
Table 2: Model architecture. FC() represents a (multi-layered) fully connected network with thenumber of nodes per layer stated as argument. Conv() represents a (multi-layered) convolutionalnetwork whose arguments take the form [channels, square kernel size, stride] for each hidden layer.
