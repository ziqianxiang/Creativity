Table 1: Ablation Study: the diagnostic experiment to compare with random but fixed β . We sample10 values of β in advance, and then train the networks with the same setting as in hybrid gradient.
Table 2: Our approach compared to previous work, on the test set of MIT-Berkeley images (Barron& Malik, 2015). The results show that our approach is better than the state of the art as reported inYang&Deng (2018).
Table 3: The performance of the finetuned networks on the test set of NYU Depth V2 Silbermanet al. (2012), compared to the original network in Zhang et al. (2017). The networks are only trainedon the synthetic images. Without optimizing the parameters (random β), the augmentation hurts thegeneralization performance. With proper search of β using hybrid gradient, we are able to achievebetter performance than the original model.
Table 4: The results on the scanned faces of the Basel Face Model. Our method is able to search forthe synthetic face parameters such that the trained network can generalize better.
