Table 4: Details of the citation networks datasetsDataset	Nodes	Edges	Node features	Node classesCora	2708	5429	1433	7Citeseer	3327	9228	3703	6Pubmed	19717	88651	500	3B.2	Graph classificationWe train the GNN architectures with Adam, an L2 penalty loss with weight 1e-4, and 16 hiddenunits (H) both in the MLP of minCUTpool and in the internal MP of Diffpool. Mutagenicity,Proteins, DD, COLLAB, and Reddit-2k are datasets representing real-world graphs and are takenfrom the repository of benchmark datasets for graph kernels4. Bench-easy and Bench-hard5 aredatasets where the node features X and the adjacency matrix A are completely uninformative ifconsidered alone. Hence, algorithms that account only for the node features or the graph structurewill fail to classify the graphs. Since Bench-easy and Bench-hard come with a train/validation/testsplit, the 10-fold split is not necessary to evaluate the performance. The statistics of all the datasetsare reported in Tab. 5.
