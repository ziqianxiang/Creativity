Table 1: Robust learning with noisy labels. Test accuracy for ResNet-32 and WideResNet-28-10 onCIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets with 40% of Uniform and Background noise on labels.
Table 2: Domain adaptation setting showing target accuracy. Baseline represents the predictor modelwhich is naively trained on the training set with equal treatment of all training samples.
Table 3: Performance of Baseline and DVRL in 3 different settings with 2 different predictor modelson the Rossmann Store Sales dataset. Metric is Root Mean Squared Percentage Error (RMSPE,lower the better). We use 79% of the data as training, 1% as validation, and 20% as testing. DVRLoutperforms Baseline in all settings.
Table 4: Robust learning results with various noise levels on CIFAR-10, Flower, and HAM 10000datasets. Clean is the performance of the predictor model when it is only trained with the sam-ples with clean labels (e.g. at 20% noise level, it uses only 80% clean samples). Baseline is theperformance of the predictor model when it is trained with both noisy and clean labels.
Table 5: Testing accuracy when trained with noisy features. Ïƒ is the standard deviation of the addedGaussian noise, quantifying the level of perturbation on the features.
Table 6: Performance of Baseline, DVRL, ADDA, and DANN in train-on-all and train-on-rest set-tings with neural networks as the predictor model on the Rossmann Store Sales dataset. Metricis Root Mean Squared Percentage Error (RMSPE, lower the better). We use 79% of the data astraining, 1% as validation, and 20% as testing.
Table 7: Discovering corrupted samples in three datasets with 20% noisy label ratio. We report thefraction of discovered corrupted samples after inspecting 20% of the samples with multiple variantsof DVRL (the higher the better).
