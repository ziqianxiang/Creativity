Table 1: Performance of generative models with respect to quality metrics and numbers of their parameters forQM9 dataset. Results of GraphNVP are recomputed following the hyperparameter setting in the original paper.
Table 2: Performance of generative models with respect to quality metrics and numbers of their parameters forZINC-250K dataset. Results of GraphNVP and JT-VAE are recomputed following the hyperparameter setting inthe original paper. Other baseline scores are borrowed from the original papers. Scores of GRF are averagesover 5 runs. Standard deviations are presented below the averaged scores. We use TX = 0.15 and TA = 0.17for ZINC-250k.
Table 3: Model hyperparameters for QM9 and ZINC250k. BS and LR stand for batch size and learning rate,respectively.
