Table 1: The few-shot 5-way classification accuracy results (in percentage, with 95% confidenceinterval) of SImBa averaged over 600 mini-ImageNet tasks are competitive to the state-of-the-artmethods. SImBa outperforms other prior methods in 1-shot setting when using the standard 4-layerCNN, and 5-shot setting when using non-standard network architectures.
