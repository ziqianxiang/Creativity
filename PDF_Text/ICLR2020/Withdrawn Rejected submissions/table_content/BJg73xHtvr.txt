Table 1: Minimum achieved average distortion of the different models. H and S denote hyperbolicand spherical models respectively.
Table 2: Node classification: Average accuracy across 10 splits with estimated uncertainties at 95percent confidence level via bootstrapping on our datasplits. H and S denote hyperbolic (Poincareball model) and spherical (stereographic projection) models respectively.
Table 3: Summary statistics for the four datasets, where sp denotes shortest path.
