The resulting ATA and UAR values forCIFAR10 are shown in Table 3 and Figure 15. We omitted calibration for the L2-JPEG attackbecause we chose too small a range of ε for our initial training experiments, and we plan to addressthis issue in the future.
Table 4: Train and val accuracies for joint adversarial training at large distortion are dependent onseed. For train and val, ε0 is chosen uniformly at random between 0 and ε, and we used 10 steps forL∞ and L1 and 30 steps for elastic. Single adversarial training baselines are also shown.
