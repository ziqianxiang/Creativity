Table 1: ✓ indicates neighbor sampling approximates the network in constant time. X indicates anyalgorithm cannot approximate the network in constant time. ✓ in the Gradient column indicates theerror between the gradient of the approximated embedding and that of the exact embedding is alsotheoretically bounded. ✓* needs an additional condition to approximate it in constant time.
Table 2: Time complexity of embedding algorithms. ∆ denotes the maximum degree. It should benoted that that in the dense graph, O(m) = O(n2) by definition.
