Table 1: Results on COCO validation set.
Table 2: Evaluation on OCHuman Zhang et al. (2019a) validation and test sets. SS/MS indicatessingle/multi scale, respectively, and * indicates a top-down approach.
Table 3: AP with several ordering variants on the input to LSTM2.
Table 4: Results with different configurations in calculating the heatmap loss.
Table 5: Examining the influence of the number of iterations in the feedback loop. 0 indicates noloop is present.
Table 6: AP when varying the within-image batch size T.
