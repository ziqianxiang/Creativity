Table 1: Given iid samples from marginals Xi 〜Px and yi 〜Py and samples from thejoint (χi,yi)〜Pxy, welist some MI estimators, corresponding variational bounds, associated losses, and constraints on the functionspace. MI estimators include biased and unbiased DV-MINE from DV (Belghazi et al., 2018), f-MINE fromf -div (Nguyen et al., 2008; Nowozin et al., 2016), InfoNCE (van den Oord et al., 2018a), a-MINE from DV(Poole et al., 2019) and η-MINE, η-MINE-convex from η-DV(ours).
Table 2: Classification accuracy (topi) results on CI-FAR10 (C10) and STL10 (S10) for unsupervised pre-training task with DV-MINE and η-MINE using encoderin Fig. 4.b. For reference we also list results for su-pervised (CE) training using full encoder in Fig. 4.a.
Table 3: ImageNet (10% subset) classification ac-curacy results (in %). DV-MINE and η-MINE areusing fixed Encoder from MI training. CE is forusing a CE Jigsaw Encoder. Numbers reportedare average and standard deviations over 8 modelsfrom different initialization seeds.
