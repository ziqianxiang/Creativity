Table 1: Predicting one moving object. Obst. is the obstacle type (R2, R4, C). The test board sizecan be either 64 × 64 (same as in training) or 128 × 128 and we consider using either no supervisionor obstacle supervision. We test the average prediction error at Ttest = 20, 60, 100 well above theduration Ttrain = 20 observed during training. Position errors were normalized by the board sizediagonal. Video errors were normalized to board size 642 where larger. L2 loss on positions is usedfor (14)-(15).
Table 2: Importance of experience. For the unsupervised model, we report the trajectory predictionerror at T = 40 (rows 1-3) and the obstacle mask L2 prediction error (rows 4-6) for different obstacletypes. The number of runs N in the experiences is varied from 0 to 50. For the obstacle maskprediction error, we also report the trivial baseline kmgt - mall-on k2 as ‘All-ON’ (see text). Positionerrors were normalized by the board size (642) diagonal. Ttrain = 20.
Table 3: Predicting the obstacles: supervision vs no supervision. The table reports the obstaclemask prediction error (L2) for a network trained with or without supervision for the obstacles (seetext). The last column shows a multi-ball predictor operated with 3 balls in each run. Train = 20.

Table A3: Predicting multiple moving object. Obstacle type is R2, all network were trained onthe fully unsupervised with perceptual loss. Num. is the maxmium number of balls per run duringtraining. For instance Num=3 means that every runs sampled contained one to three balls.
