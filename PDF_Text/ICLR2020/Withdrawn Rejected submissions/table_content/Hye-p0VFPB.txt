Table 2: Latency, area and energy consumption of a systolic array of MACs	Latency (ns)	Area(μm2)	Energy(pJ)Non-decomposable	2.00 二	311679.56	54.144Straightforward decomposable	2.72	601602.42	110.989Our decomposable	1716	516512.40	37.764To evaluate the latency, area and energy consumption of a non-decomposable MAC, a straight-forward decomposable MAC and our decomposable MAC, we implement these systolic arrays inVerilog. Three different size of systolic arrays are implemented, including a 16×16 grid of MACs, a32×32 grid of MACs and 64×64 grid of MACs. To align the capability of performing matrix mul-tiplication in each cycle as the systolic array of straightforward decomposable MACs does, the sizeof our systolic array is adjusted to be 16×64, 32×128, and 64×256. Within these systolic arrays,the width of accumulators/adders of MACs have been adjusted by considering the correspondingmaximum length of accumulation in the systolic array. In addition, all of these three systolic arraysof MACs have ability to compute correct result of multiplication with its input bit-width being 4-bit× 4-bit, 8-bit × 4-bit, and 8-bit × 8-bit.
