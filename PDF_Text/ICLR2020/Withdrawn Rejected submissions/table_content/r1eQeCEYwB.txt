Table 1: Classification accuracy while nodes and edges are not labeled/attributed. Both the GNNand the GNN-ESR are composed of three spatial convolution layers and a global max pooling layer.
Table 2: Classification accuracy when the node labels are included.
Table 3: Classification accuracy of the GNN-ESR with different pooling methods.
Table 4: Classification accuracy of the neural networks with and without the pooling layer.
