Specifically, high-quality HR images of GMSR dataset and DIV2Kare downsampled with bicubic interpolation, Gaussian blurred with random intensity to simulateout-of-focus, converted into Bayer data, added with Gaussian noise, and finally debayer-filtered togenerate the LR images. We used this baseline dataset to train the proposed SR model and named thenew super resolution model SRbl . Quantitative results are shown in Table 4. Our model trained onGMSR outperforms SRbl in all cases, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed H2L networkand the GMSR dataset.
