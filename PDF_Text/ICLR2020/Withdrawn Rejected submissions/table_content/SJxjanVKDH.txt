Table 1: 3D Semantic Instance Completion on ScanNet (Dai et al., 2017a) scans withScan2CAD (Avetisyan et al., 2019) targets at mAP@0.5. Our end-to-end formulation achievessignificantly better performance than alternative, decoupled approaches that first use state-of-the-artscan completion (Dai et al., 2018) and then instance segmentation (Hou et al., 2019) method or firstinstance segmentation (Hou et al., 2019) and then shape completion (Dai et al., 2017b).

Our semantiC instanCe Completion approaCh aChieves signifiCantly better performanCethan alternative approaChes with deCoupled state-of-the-art sCan Completion (SC) (Dai et al., 2018)followed by instanCe segmentation (IS) (Hou et al., 2019), as well as instanCe segmentation followedby shape Completion (Dai et al., 2017b). We additionally evaluate our approaCh without Color input(no Color) and without a Completion proxy loss on the network baCkbone (no proxy).

We Compare to 3D-SIS (HoU et al., 2019), a state-of-the-art approaCh for 3D semantiCinstanCe segmentation on volUmetriC inpUt, and additionally evalUate oUr approaCh WithoUt Comple-tion (no Cmpl), WithoUt Color inpUt (no Color), and WithoUt a Completion proxy loss on the netWorkbaCkbone (no proxy). PrediCting instanCe Completion notably benefits instanCe segmentation.
