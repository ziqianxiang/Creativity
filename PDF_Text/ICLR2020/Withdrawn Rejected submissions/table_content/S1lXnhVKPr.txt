Table 1: Comparisons of the communication complexity for different algorithms. The second col-umn and the third column show communication complexity for identical and non-identical datasetsrespectively. Here, we regard the following assumptions as extra assumptions: (1) an upper boundfor gradients; (2) the bounded gradient variance among workers.
Table 2: Parameters used in experiments and a summary of datasets. N denotes the number ofworkers, b denotes batch size on each worker, Î³ is the learning rate, k is the communication period,n represents the number of data samples and m represents the number of data categories.
