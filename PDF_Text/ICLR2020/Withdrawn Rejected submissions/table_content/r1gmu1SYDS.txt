It is the only simulated dataset we used in our ex-periments. Data is generated using a pure pursuit lane following algorithm, that returns the desiredangular velocity. Longitudinal velocity is assumed to be constant. The learned model has to predictthe angular velocity returned by the expert based on the image of the lane. Both train and test setsinclude domain randomization. To reduce the cost of training we downsampled each of the imagesto a third of their original size.
