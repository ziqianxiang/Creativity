Table 1: Comparison of test accuracy on the two long-tailed CIFAR-10 datasets. The number ofmajority and minority classes are reported in parentheses. All the values and error bars are meanand standard deviation across 3 trials upon randomly chosen seeds, respectively.
Table 2: Comparison of test accuracy on the two long-tailed CIFAR-100 datasets. The number ofmajority and minority classes are reported in parentheses. All the values and error bars are meanand standard deviation across 3 trials upon randomly chosen seeds, respectively.
Table 3: Comparison of test accuracy on the two naturally imbalanced NLP datasets: Twitter andReuters. The number of majority and minority classes are reported in parentheses. All the values anderror bars are mean and standard deviation across 3 trials upon randomly chosen seeds, respectively.
Table 4: Comparison of test accuracy across vari-ous types of ablation methods. All the values anderror bars are mean and standard deviation across3 trials upon randomly chosen seeds, respectively.
