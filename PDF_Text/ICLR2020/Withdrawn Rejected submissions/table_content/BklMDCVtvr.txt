Table 1: ROLE mean substitution accuracy and and role scheme v-measure along with one standarddeviation across three random initializations on models that are fully compositional by design (TPEs).
Table 2: Mean substitution accuracy for learned (bold) and pre-defined role schemes on SCAN acrossthree random initializations. Standard deviation was below 1% for all schemes except for snapped.
