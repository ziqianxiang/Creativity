Table 1: Quantitative analysis on the Cityscapes validation set.
Table 2: Quantitative analysis on the tiny Taskonomy test set. The results for edge (E) and keypoints(K) detection were multiplied by a factor of 100 for better readability. The FA models refer togenerating the task groupings with the task affinity technique proposed by Lu et al. (2017).
