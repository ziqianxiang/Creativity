Table 1: Percentage of instances solved for 3-SAT (m/n = 4.3 and m/n = 3.0) and standard 9x9Sudoku (24 to 32 known cells). We show the ”test time + training time” for supervised baselines andthe ”solving time” for our unsupervised DRNets. The units min, hr, day denote minute(s), hour(s)and day(s). m, n denote the number of literals and clauses, respectively. NA, not applicable. DRNets,without supervision, outperform the supervised state of the art.
