Table 1: Summary of NotationB Multiset RelationsBecause we allow a relation R to contain the same entities multiple times, we formally define amultiset as a tuple R = hR, κi, where R is a set, and κ : R → N maps elements of R to their multisetcounts. We will call R the elements of the multiset R = hR, κi, and κ(d) the count of element d.
