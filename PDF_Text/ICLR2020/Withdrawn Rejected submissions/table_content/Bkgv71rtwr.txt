Table 1: Performance comparison with the state of arts on Office for open-set domain adaptation. ♦ indicatesa different open-set setting without unknown source examples.
Table 2: Performance comparison with the state of arts on VisDA for open-set domain adaptation (Known-to-Unknown Ratio = 1:10). ♦ indicates a different open-set setting without unknown source examples. t indicatesthe results are referred from the official leaderboard ViSDA (2018) (ViSda-SE and ViSda_AODA).
