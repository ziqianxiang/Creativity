Table 1: BPD values for VAEs trained on FashionMNIST with capacity ×1 as κ is varied from 16to 512. When κ increases, the BPD saturates while robustly differentiating inliers and outliers.
Table 2: BPD values for VAEs trained on CIFAR-10 using κ = 32 as capacity is varied. When thecapacity is small, the outlier data has lower BPD as NaIisnick et al. (2019) has shown. However,as capacity increases, BPD for both training and testing sets decreases while that of the outlier dataincreases consistent with Section 3. Additionally, Y becomes significantly smaller with increasedcapacity as expected.
Table 1: Reconstruction error and MMD between qφ(z) and N (0, I) on CelebA. We firsttrain a VAE with learnable Y and obtain the optimal value Y* . Then we fiX Y = Y*and re-train the same network from scratch. Though the final reconstructionerrors are almost the same, the MMDs between qφ(z) and the standard N (0, I)are significantly different.
