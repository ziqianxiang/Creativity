Table 1: Supernode-based models validated in the Experiment 4.4. Note that the “simple supernode”ablation model and the model used in (Pham et al., 2017) allow bi-directional message passingsbetween original nodes and the supernode while the one used in (Li et al., 2017) only allowsdirectional messages from the original nodes to the supernode.
Table 2: MAEs on the LIPO dataset and QM9 dataset. Smaller values are better. Scores on QM9 arethe average MAEs over 12 sub-tasks. The score of select models are presented in the appendix.
Table 3: ROC-AUCs on the HIV dataset and Tox21 dataset. Larger values are better. Scores on Tox21are the average MAEs over 12 sub-tasks. Scores of select models are presented in the appendix.
Table 4: Hyperparameters L and D for the experiment in Section 4.4. The format of the table cells is:(L,D).
Table 5: MAEs on the LIPO dataset and QM9 dataset. The number of layers and the dimension of the feature vectors are defined via Bayesian Optimization for eachmethod and each dataset. Averages (standard deviations) over 10 random runs. Smaller values are better.
Table 6: ROC-AUCs on the HIV dataset and Tox21 dataset. The number of layers and the dimension of feature vectors are defined via Bayesian Optimization foreach method and each dataset. Averages (standard deviations) over 10 random runs. Larger values are better.
Table 7: Relative reduction of MAE (%) GWM, 12 tasks in QM9. Larger values are better.
Table 8: Improvements of binary classification accuracy (%) by GWM, 12 tasks in Tox21. Largervalues are better.
