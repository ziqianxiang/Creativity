Table 1: Comparison of sentence representations on downstream tasks. For the SICK-R task, thepearson coefficient is indicated. For the MRPC task, this is the F1 score. The baseline is reportedfrom (Logeswaran & Lee, 2018) and is obtained using a bag-of-words representation. LSTM,BidirLSTM and Tree LSTM are reported from Tai et al. (2015). Fastsent is reported from (Lo-geswaran & Lee, 2018), Dissent and Infersent from (Nie et al., 2019), Skip-thoughts from (Kiroset al., 2015) and Quick-thoughts from (Logeswaran & Lee, 2018). The table is divided into differentsections. The bold-face numbers indicate the best performance values among models in the currentand all previous sections. Best overall values in each column are underlined.
Table 2: Probing task scores for the Contrastive Tree LSTM (CTL) and the Contrastive LSTM (CL).
Table 3: Nearest neighbors retrieved by the Contrastive Tree LSTM (CTL) and the ContrastiveLSTM (CL). For each sentence, the 5 closest neighbors from the test split of the SICK dataset areretrieved using the cosine similarity from their representations. Results are presented in decreasingorder of cosine distance.
