Table 1:  Since this paper involves the interplay of many coordinate-independent and coordinate-dependent mathematical objects, we summarize these notations here.  Note that these notations areprimarily  for  the  setting  of  MLPs,  the  focus  of  the  main  body  of  the  paper.   The  notations  forconvolutional networks and recurrent networks in Appendix F and G will be self-contained.   Asa     general rule of thumb, we use boldface to symbolize coordinate-dependent objects and standardmath font for coordinate-independent ones.
