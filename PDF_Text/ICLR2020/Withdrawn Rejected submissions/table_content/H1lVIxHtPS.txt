Table 1:   Partially observable cooperative navigation.  For N  =  L  =  3, the agents can observethe nearest 1 agent and 2 landmarks, and for N  = L = 6, the agents can observe, 2 agents and 3landmarks. Number of collisions between agents, and average distance at the end of the episode aremeasured.
Table 2:  In 2a, N  =  L  =  3, M  =  1, the agents can observe the nearest 1 predator, 1 prey and2 landmarks,  and for N  =  L  =  6,  M  =  2,  the agents can observe,  3 predators,  1 prey and 3landmarks.  Number of prey captures by the predators per episode is measured.  For Table 2b, wemeasure the avg. success rate of the communicating agents N , to reach the target landmark, and thesame for the adversary M . Larger values for N are desired, and lower for M .
Table 3: Performance metrics when a Gaussian Noise of mean 0 and variance 1 is introduced in thememory (MC-SARNet) during execution of the tasks for predator-prey and cooperative navigation.
