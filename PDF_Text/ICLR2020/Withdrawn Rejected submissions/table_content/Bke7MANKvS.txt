Table 1: Comparison of the inference accuracy of the encoded model with that of prior methods onthe CIFAR-10-C dataset corrupted by Gaussian noise, shot noise, and impulse noise with a severitylevel of 5.
Table 2: Comparison of the encoded model with prior defense models under white-box PGD attackswith 20 iterations, a step size of 0.003, and an epsilon of 0.031 ('âˆž) on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
