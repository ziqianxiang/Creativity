Table 1: Final returns for different algorithms on the OpenAI Gym tasks, with Â± corresponding toone standard deviation of the average return across 5 random seeds. In terms of final performance,AWR generally performs comparably or better than prior methods.
Table 2: Performance statistics of algorithms onthe motion imitation tasks. Returns are normal-ized between the minimum and maximum possi-ble returns per episode.
