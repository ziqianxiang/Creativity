Table 1: Success rates of achieving a goal with anAnt agent in a simple maze environment. All al-gorithms except for HiDe have been trained withrandomly sampled goal positions. The results areaveraged over 5 seeds.
Table 2: Success rates in the complexmaze. We train an ant and a ball on For-ward maze and test on unseen Random,Backward, and Flipped environments.
Table 3: Success rates of achieving a goalin complex maze environment with transferredagents. We train with a different agent on For-ward maze.
Table 4: Success rates in the simple maze.
Table 5: Success rates of achieving a goal in thecomplex maze environment. HiDe-A and HiDe-AR as in Table 4. HiDe-NI is our method withoutthe inferface layer.
