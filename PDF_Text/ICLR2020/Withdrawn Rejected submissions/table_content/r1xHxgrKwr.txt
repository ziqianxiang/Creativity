Table 1: Performance of AnoDM in comparison with other methods in terms of auROC on image data. Theresults for AnoDM were obtained by either the "-based or z-based algorithm. In the column for β-VAE, onlyreconstruction error is used as anomaly score. The results for AnoGAN and ADGAN were obtained from(Deecke et al., 2019). The results for CapsNet were obtained from (Li et al., 2019).
