Table 1: Performance of X-regularization instantiated as robust self-training (RST) applied to differentperturbations and adversarial training algorithms. (Left) CIFAR- 1 0 standard test accuracy and robusttest accuracy against 'âˆž perturbations of size e = 8/255. All methods use e = 8/255 while training.
Table 2:	Accuracies for the standard, vanilla adversarial training (AT), and AT with X-regularization(RST) for = 1/255 on the full CIFAR- 1 0 dataset. Accuracies are averaged over two trials. The robusttest accuracy of the standard model is near 0%.
Table 3:	Accuracies for the standard, vanilla adversarial training (AT), and AT with X-regularization(X-reg) for = 2/255 on the full CIFAR- 1 0 dataset. Accuracies are averaged over two trials. Therobust test accuracy of the standard model is near 0%.
