Table 1: We estimate some of the parameters of the VoxForge (Voxforge.org) dataset. The averages for the matrix Vare taken over 34 samples, while for Σ is over 170 samples. The accuracy reported in the experiments is measuredon 170 samples in the test set, after the threshold on the eigenvalues of Σ. Each model is the result of the best of 3different initializations of the EM algorithm. The first and the second column are the maximum singular values of allthe covariance matrices, and the absolute value of the log-determinant. The column K (Σ) consist in the thresholdedcondition number for the covariance matrices.
