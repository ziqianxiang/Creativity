Table 3 presents the run-time measurements of the PuLP, Submodular-ity, Restart-SUMM and ILS-SUMM methods in OSTD dataset. Our experiments demonstrate thatfor obtaining a reasonable solution, submodularity is the fastest approach. These results may beexpected since Submodularity runs only two iterations of greedily adding shots, without any fur-ther exploration. However, as we presented above, ILS-SUMM obtains significantly better resultsthan submodular optimization, while enjoying a substantially better run-time scalability than PuLP.
