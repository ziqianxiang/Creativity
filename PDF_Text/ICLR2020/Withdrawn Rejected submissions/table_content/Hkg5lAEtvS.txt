Table 1: The number of parameters, the best number of input frames, the best number of accumulatederrors for backpropogation and training time for one epoch on 8 v-100 GPUs for each model.
Table 2: Hyper-parameters tuning rangesFigure 9 shows the ground truth and the predicted v velocity fields over 60 time steps. Similar to theu velocity predictions, we observe that the predictions from TF-Net are the closest to the target.
