Table 1: Quantitative results on graph generation. MMD measures between test set and gener-ated graphs (lower is better). The second set shows GraphRNN evaluation with node distributionmatching (averaged over 5 different models with 3 trials). The third set shows evaluation for the testset for all 1024 generated graphs (averaged over 5 models). (max(|V |),max(|E|)) is also shown.
Table 2: Quantitative results on image puzzle generation. Comparison of our CGF model withstandard VAE and state-of-the-art VAE based models in bits/dimension (lower is better). Theseresults are for unconditional generation using multi-scale version of continuous graph flow.
