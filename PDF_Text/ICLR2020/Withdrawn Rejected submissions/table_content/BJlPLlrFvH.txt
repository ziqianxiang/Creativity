Table 1: Mean AUC rates of various baselines on different one dimensional cause-effect pairsdatasets. Our simple AEQ algorithm achieves competitive results on most datasets.
Table 2: Accuracy rates of various baselines on the CE-Tub dataset. Our simple algorithm AEQachieves almost SOTA accuracy.
Table 3: Mean AUC rates of various baselines on different multidimensional dimensional cause-effect pairs datasets. The datasets are designed and balanced, such that an autoencoder methodwould fail. Our method achieves SOTA results.
Table 4: Results of various methods on different variations of the MOUS-MEG dataset.
Table 5: Emergence of independence. Ind C (Ind E) is the mean of |creal + cfake - 1| over all pairsof random variables, epochs and samples, when training the method from X to Y (vice versa). w/obackprop means without backpropagating gradients from D to R.
