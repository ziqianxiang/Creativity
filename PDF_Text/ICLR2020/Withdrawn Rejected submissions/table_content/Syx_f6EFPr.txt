Table 1: Test accuracy: columns 3rd through 10th show the results with incomplete training data andincomplete/complete test data. The baseline results were obtained by training the model on complete data.
Table 2: Test Accuracy obtained on MNIST and CIFAR10 dataset using standard sequential methods andcompared to our simultaneous algorithm.
Table 3: Hyper-parameter tuning: crossvalidated hyperparameters λ1 and λ2 obtained for MNIST andCIFAR10 datasets with the classifiers used in our experiments.
