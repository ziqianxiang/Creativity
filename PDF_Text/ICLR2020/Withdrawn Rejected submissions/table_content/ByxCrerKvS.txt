Table 1: Performance comparison of methods on benchmarking datasets. Performance metrics havebeen rescaled to 100 for readability reasons. “AUC” denotes the area under the Receiver OperatingCharacteristic (ROC) curve; “PR AUC” denotes the area under the precision recall curve. “Micro”refers to evaluating the metric globally by treating each entry of the label indicator matrix as a label.

For the M3-Phenotyping patients withmore than 2000 distinct time points were discarded from training. For M3-Mortality patientswith more than 1000 time points were discarded as they contained dramatically different measuringfrequencies compared to the rest of the dataset.
