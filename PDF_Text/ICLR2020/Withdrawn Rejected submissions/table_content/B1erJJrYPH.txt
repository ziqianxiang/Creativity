Bezier curvesare popular in computer graphics as they can be defined by their control points. In the current study,we refer to endpoint models as θ1 and θ2 as well as the control point, θc . Then r is defined inequation 7rφ(t) = (1 - t)2θ1 + 2(1 - t)tθc + t2θ2.	(7)Then θc is the learnable parameter in φ. Of course one could consider more complicated curveparameterizations. In practice, we find a simple curve to be enough for our experiments, and considerthe learning of a planar curve along which loss is nearly constant to be significant in itself.
Table 2: The average accuracy along the curve with standard deviation is reported for each com-bination of dataset, network architecture, and curve class. This shows that aligned curves not onlyoutperform the unaligned curves which do not consider the permutation ambiguity, they perform aswell as the PAM curves which learn a locally optimal permutation 1. Note that aligned accuraciesare typically as high as the trained model accuracies in Table 1.
Table 3: Accuracy of model ensembles constructed from the curve connecting trained models on theCIFAR100 dataset. Standard deviation is reported as well. All ensembles function by averaging thepredictions of their component models. The curve ensembles are constructed by sampling the curveat the values of t listed. The independent ensemble consists of three independently trained models.
