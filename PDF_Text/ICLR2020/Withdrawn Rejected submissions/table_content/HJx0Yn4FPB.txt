Table 1: Defense against gray-box and black-box attacks . The adversarial perturbation wereproduced using PGD with step size α=1.0∕256=0.0039 and 200 attack iterations. As shown in thistable, ATLPA got the highest Top-1 Accuracy on all these database. ATLPA(w/o ATT): ATLPAwithout Attention.
Table 2: Comparing average activations on discriminate parts of 17 Flower Category Databasefor different defense methods. ATLPA got the highest average activations on those key regions,demonstrating that ATLPA focused on more discriminate features for flowers recognition.
