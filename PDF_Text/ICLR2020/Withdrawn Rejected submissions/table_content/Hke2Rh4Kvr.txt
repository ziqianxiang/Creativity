Table 1: Samples generated from boosted models consisting of k VAEs (1 ≤ k ≤ 4). The lower bounds(Equation 5) of these boosted models are also given. ck (Theorem 4) is an indicator to help judge whether aboosted model has converged, where a small one supports convergence. For both mnist and celebA, the qualityof generated samples has a non-decreasing property. Besides, ck is the smallest when k = 3, which indicatesthat the boosted model is likely to converge after incorporating 3 VAEs and the last VAE is redundant.
Table 2: Test set performance on mnist. The density log p(x) is estimated using Equation 5. LVAE has 2stochastic hidden layers. The number of importance weighted samples (k) for IWAE is 5 and 10. The numberof components in GMM is set to 10. The extra time cost is the time cost for incorporating an extra GMM.
Table 3: Comparison between different boosting methods on mnist. The ‘+’ represents the cascaded connectionand the ‘k’ represents the multiplicative connection. The density log p(x) is estimated on the test set, usingEquation 5 for cascaded connection and importance sampling for multiplicative connection respectively. Thesampling time is the time cost for sampling 10000 samples.
