Table 1: Ablation experiments for FoveaBox. All models are trained on trainval35k, test onminival. If not specified, default values are η = 2.0 and σ = 0.4. (a) Our anchor-free FoveaBoxget 0.9 AP gains compared with the best model of anchor-based RetinaNet; (b) FoveaBox is morerobust to bounding box distributions; (c) FoveaBox could also generate high-quality region propos-als; (d) Accuracy of FoveaBox for various network depths and image scales; (e) and (f): FoveaBoxgets best performance with η = 2.0 and σ = 0.4. See Section 3.1 for details.
