For n = 4, we chose the same initial value [5, 4, 5, 5] and set L from 0.9 to0.1 for the quasi-newton with the homotopy setup. It takes 8 steps and 14 steps for the quasi-newtonmethod and the quasi-newton with the homotopy setup to converge, respectively. However, thequasi-newton method does not find the global minimum while the HTA does. We also compared twoalgorithms with different initial values and count the times when converging to global minimums.
