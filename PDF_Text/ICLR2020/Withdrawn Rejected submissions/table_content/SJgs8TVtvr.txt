Table 1: Performance comparison of our method MoE-Sim-VAE with several published methods.
Table 2: Comparison of MoE-Sim-VAE performance to competitor methods in defining cell typecomposition in CyTOF measurements. The results in the table are extracted from the review paperof Weber & Robinson (2016), where 18 methods are compared on four different datasets. Our modeloutperforms the baselines on four out of five data sets.
Table A1: Results of MoE-Sim-VAE on data published in Bodenmiller et al. (2012). CyTOF mea-surements from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were taken and the goal is to definethe different cell types present in the data. The ground truth was definied using the SPADE algo-rithm (Qiu et al., 2011), which can visualize the high dimensional data in such a way to be able tomanual gate the cells. We compare to other fully unsupervised methods as FlowSOM, X-shift andPhenoGraph and achieve in most cases the best F-measure, which is defined as in Equation 12.
