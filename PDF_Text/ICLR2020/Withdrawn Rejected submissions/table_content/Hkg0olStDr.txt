Table 1: Target accuracy under different techniques of selecting a collaborator using ADDA. Idealrefers to the best achievable performance if the most optimal collaborator is picked for each target.
Table 2: Mean target accuracy for a random or-der of domainS for different adaptation methodS.
Table 3: Target Domain Accuracy and Training Time (averaged across two adaptation tasks) foreach dataset. As expected, the Non-Distributed approach is the fastest as it does not require anycommunication during training, at the expense of user privacy. Our Lazy-Synchronized approach(p=4) provides the best trade-off between accuracy and training time, without requiring the exchangeof raw domain data.
Table 4: Ordering of source and target used in our experiments. Domains in bold correspond to thelabeled source domain, which is introduced first in the system.
