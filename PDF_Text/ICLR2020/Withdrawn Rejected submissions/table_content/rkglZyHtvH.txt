Table 1: Results on the UCI regression benchmarks with a single hidden layer containing 50 units.
Table 2: Results on image classification benchmarks with the LeNet-5 architecture, without dataaugmentation. Metrics: marginal log-likelihood (MLL, higher is better), accuracy (Acc, higheris better), and the evidence lower bound (ELBO higher is better). The mean values and standarddeviations are shown in the table.
Table 3: Results on CIFAR10 with the ResNet architecture, without data augmentation. Metrics:marginal log-likelihood (MLL, higher is better), accuracy (Acc, higher is better), and the evidencelower bound (ELBO higher is better). Note that the non-hybrid and the hybrid models are equivalentwhen trained deterministically.
Table 4: The training time of each method (LeNet-5/CIFAR10) on a P100 using Tensorflow.
