Table 1: Like-for-like comparison of imagination processes with FroMON and TasMON, when artificiallywarmstarting from the same (infeasibile or feasible) tool in both cases. TI-Infeasible are the imaginationresults warmstarted with infeasible tools and TI-Feasible are the imagination results initialised with feasibletools.
Table 2: Results table, comparing TasMON with a frozen MONet+Task ablation, i.e. FroMON, across alltasks. Other abbreviations: TU = tool utility, aggregated as the average-precision score over all ground truthtools; TD = toolkit decomposition, measured by the Adjusted Rand Index (Rand, 1971; Hubert & Arabie,1985); TS = tool-selection success in feasible scenarios, % of times pixel-wise IOU of most-likely tooland the ground-truth feasible tool was 0.8 or more; TI = unconditional tool-imagination success for eachmodel, % of all test scenarios; The best model for a task and metric are shown in bold, except for TD whereARI scores were similar for different models. All metric scores are shown as percentages for consistency.
Table 3: Number of instances by scenario type.
