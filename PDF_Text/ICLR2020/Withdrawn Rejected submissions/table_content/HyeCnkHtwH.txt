Table 1: Results of using the semantic loss instead of post-processing with CMA-ES. Levels mario-1-3 and mario-3-3 has been chosen due to their higher complexity in being solved. The table showsthe validity, uniqueness and novelty of samples after a testing session with A*. A valid sample isone that can be completely solved by the A* agent. The semantic loss has been activated from epoch3000. Each run has lasted 5000 epochs with all the default hyper parameters defined in Volz et al.
Table 2: Results of using the semantic loss on the MolGAN architecture. The diversity score isobtained by comparing sub-structures of generated samples against a random subset of the dataset. Alower score indicates a higher amount of repetitions between the generated samples and the dataset.
