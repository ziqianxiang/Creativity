Table 1: Quantitative evaluation of BSDS; * - V1Net model trained with data augmentation andlarger batch sizeAs suggested by the Optimal Dataset Scale F-1 scores (ODS-F1) in Table.1, horizontal connec-tions in general are helpful to increase the precision and accuracy of boundary detection. While wehave not included quantitative results for a parameter-matched feedforward baseline, we noticed itsperformance to be qualitatively worse than ConvLSTM-MedRF, our parameter-matched recurrentbaseline. These two observations together suggest the importance of recurrent processing for de-tecting object boundaries, and further the advantage of employing horizontal connections to pushforward the prediction performance. Comparing our results from a full V1Net and one with hori-zontal nonlinear connections lesioned (V1Net-Linear) reveals the pivotal role played by nonlinearhorizontal connections in the process of boundary detection. In addition, progressively decreasingboundary prediction performance of two variants of V1Net-Linear with shorter amounts of recur-rent processing (t=4 & t=2, 4 & 2 timesteps respectively) reveals a speed-accuracy tradeoff that isreminiscent of similar previously reported observations in primate behavioral studies.
