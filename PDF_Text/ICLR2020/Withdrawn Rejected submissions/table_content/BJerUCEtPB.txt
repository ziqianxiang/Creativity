Table 1: Prediction accuracy over adversarial examples. For MNIST and FashionMNIST, we do notlimit the of adversrial examples. For CIFAR10 and Restricted ImageNet, we limit the to be 0.1and 0.05 respectively ('âˆž difference, the maximum is 1.0). Best performance for each data set foreach attack method is highlighted (except when the best performance is below random guess).
