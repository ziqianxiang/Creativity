Table 1: Comparison of fooling rates (in percentage) obtained for our approach with that of otherworks. We achieve higher fooling rate than the existing data-free method GDUAP (Mopuri et al.,2018). Note that UAP (Moosavi-Dezfooli et al., 2017) is data dependent (shown for completeness).
Table 2: Various ablative experiments regarding our approach. It is evident that the proposed se-quential dilation algorithm has higher performance than any of its variants.
Table 3: Black-box testing of data-free sequential dilation approach. Rows indicate the networksused to craft the adversary and the columns specify the one for which the fooling rate is computed.
Table 4: Comparison of fooling rates obtained by our method and GDUAP (Mopuri et al., 2018) inless data setting with varied number of images available for crafting the perturbation.
Table 5: Benchmarking our approach in less data scenario with Singular Fool (Khrulkov & Os-eledets, 2018) where the adversaries are crafted withjust 64 images.
