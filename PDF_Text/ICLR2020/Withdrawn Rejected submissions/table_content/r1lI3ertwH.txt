Table 1: Transfer learning results on classification, object detection, and instance segmentation. Each rowcorresponds to data selection method, and we indicate the size of the subset (e.g., either 20% or 40% of theentire source dataset). Each column corresponds to a target dataset.
Table 2: Transfer to object detection and instance segmentation with Mask R-CNN on Cityscapes. Each rowcorresponds to a selection method and the percentage of MS-COCO images used for pre-training.
Table 3: Ablation experiments on gating and expert training. SP stands for Superclass Partition, UP for Unsu-pervised Partition, TS for Task-Specific experts (experts trained on classif. labels), and SS for Self-Supervisedexperts (experts trained to predict image rotation). Results reported are top-1 accuracy for all datasets.
