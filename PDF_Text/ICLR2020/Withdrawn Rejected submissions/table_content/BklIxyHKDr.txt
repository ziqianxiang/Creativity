Table 1: Area under the test error vs noise rate curve. Each row corresponds to a dataset andsize of clean dataset Dclean pair, where the size is a percentage of the total training set (5%, 10%,20%). Each column shows the area under the error curve across noise rates for a particular methodand noise type (Uniform, Flip, Hard Flip). We see that the k-NN method consistently outperformsthe other methods for Uniform and Flip and outperforms the other methods on Hard Flip on thesmaller datasets.
