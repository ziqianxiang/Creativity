Table 1: Test performance of SGD and popular adaptive methods in benchmark tasks. Red indicatesresults with the recommended optimizer, following the paper that proposed each model, and anyimproved performance is given in blue. The best result for each task is in bold, and numbers inparentheses present standard deviations of 3 runs for CIFAR.
