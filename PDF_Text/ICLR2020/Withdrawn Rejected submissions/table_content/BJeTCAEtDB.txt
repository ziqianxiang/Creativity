Table 1: Comparison with EBPC (Cavigelli & Benini, 2019). While EBPC does not affect perfor-mance of the network, our method allows better compression by exploiting rate-distortion tradeoff.
Table A.1: Comparison of our method against three known post-training quantization methods ((i)ACIQ (Banner et al., 2018); (ii) GEMMLOWP (Jacob & Warden, 2017); (iii) KLD (Migacz, 2017); .
