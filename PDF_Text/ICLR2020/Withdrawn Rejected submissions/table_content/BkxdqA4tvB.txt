Table 1: Quantitative comparisons (in % ±σ) for segmentation on bouncing ball and reacher task. Wereport the F1 scores in percentage with mean and standard deviation over 5 runs. (S.P. for switchingpoint, F.W. for frame-wise, the best mean is in bold.) The F1 score for CompILE is adapted from Kipfet al. (2019), where only switching point F1 score is provided. The F1 score for KVAE is computedbased on taking ‘argmax’ on the ‘dynamics parameter network’ as described in Fraccaro et al. (2017).
Table 2: Quantitative comparisons (in %) for S(N)LDS on Dubins path. For SLDS, F1 scoreswith both greedy 1-to-1 matching (Greedy) and optimal merging (Merging) are provided. Theswitching point F1 scores are estimated with both precise matching (Tol 0) or allowing at most 5-stepdisplacement (Tol 5).
Table 3: CoordConv encoder Architecture. Before passing into the following network, the image ispadded from [28, 28, 1] to [28, 28, 3] with the pixel coordinates.
Table 4: CoordConv decoder Architecture. Before passing into the following network, the input zt istiled from [8] to [28, 28, 8], where 8 is the hidden dimension, and is then padded to [28, 28, 10] withthe pixel coordinates.
