Table 1: Ablation experimental results on instances showing the number of parameters and Top-1 er-rors for CIFAR-10/100 datasets. All ablation experiments utilize ResNet-56 as backbone architecture.
Table 2: Image classification results on CIFAR-10/100 dataset(left), ImageNet-1K dataset(top-right).
Table 3: Comparison on model performance with different size of LSTM hidden units (M) andreduction ratios (r). All parametric experiments exploit a ResNet-56 as backbone architecture, andthe context of "GAP" on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets.
Table 4: The structure of ResNet50 + RLA, where M denotes the size of LSTM hidden units.
