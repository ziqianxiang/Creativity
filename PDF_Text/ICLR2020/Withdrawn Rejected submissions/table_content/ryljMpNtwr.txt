Table 1: Object detection performance of various models. Backbones indicated with r are ResNetand x ResNeXt. All model names except for RetinaNet and HTC indicate the corresponding modelfrom the R-CNN family. All COCO models were downloaded from the mmdetection modelzoo.
Table 2: Object detection performance of Faster R-CNN trained on standard images, stylized imagesand the combination of both evaluated on standard test sets (test 2007 for PASCAL VOC; val 2017for MS COCO, val for Cityscapes); higher is better.
Table 3: Object detection performance of Faster R-CNN pre-trained on ImageNet (IN), StylizedImageNet (SIN) and the combination of both evaluated on standard test sets (test 2007 for PASCALVOC; val 2017 for MS COCO); higher is better.
Table 4: Performance of Faster R-CNN across different weather conditions and time changes whentrained on standard images, stylized images and the combination of both evaluated on BDD100k (seeAppendix C for dataset details); higher is better.
Table 5: Object detection performance of Faster R-CNN on Foggy Cityscapes when trained onCityscapes with standard images, stylized images and the combination of both evaluated on thevalidation set; higher is better; Î² is the attenuation coefficient in m-1correlation between rPC and SSIM (r = 0.48). This analysis shows that SSIM better captures theeffect of the corruptions on model performance.
Table 6: Instance segmentation performance of various models. Backbones indicated with r:ResNet. All model names indicate the corresponding model from the R-CNN family. All modelswere downloaded from the mmdetection modelzoo.
Table 7: Instance segmentation performance of Mask R-CNN trained on standard images, stylizedimages and the combination of both evaluated on standard test sets (test 2007 for PASCAL VOC; val2017 for MS COCO, val for Cityscapes).
Table 8: Object detection performance of models with deformable convolutions Dai et al. (2017).
Table 9: Instance segmentation performance of Mask R-CNN with deformable convolutions (Daiet al., 2017). The backbone indicated with r is a ResNet 50, the addition dcn signifies deformableconvolutions in stages c3-c5. The model was downloaded from the mmdetection modelzoo.
