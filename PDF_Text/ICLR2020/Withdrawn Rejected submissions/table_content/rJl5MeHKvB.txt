Table 1: The performance of particular combinations of auxiliary tasks. All methods include thedataset-specific target task. AE and Forecast refers to Autoencoding and Forecasting respectively,the auxiliary tasks explored in (Dai & Le, 2015). PLAE and PSAE refer to Piecewise-Linear Au-toencoder and Partial-Signal Autoencoder, our novel forms of self-supervision. We see that ournewly proposed forms of self-supervision outperform the other approaches on all datasets.
