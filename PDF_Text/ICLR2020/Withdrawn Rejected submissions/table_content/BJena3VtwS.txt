Table 1: Top-1 accuracy of the top performing models and Resnet50 from-scratch.
Table 2: Description of the datasets used for the tasks in VTAB.
Table 3: Human evaluation scores, measured using mean-per-class accuracy.
Table 4: Kendall rank correlation coefficient (Kendall, 1945) (with standard deviation) measuringthe agreement of the ranking of models according to the mean accuracy across tasks with differenttypes of weighted means, the geometric mean, and different types of average ranks. Agreement ofranking according to mean accuracy with alternative ranking schemes is high.
Table 5: Task subsets of size 5 that lead to the largest rank correlation with the mean accuracyacross all tasks. There are many different subsets that lead to an high rank correlation with the fullmean.
Table 6: Top-1 aCCuraCy of all the models evaluated on VTAB in lightweight mode. EaCh entryrepresents the median sCore of three runs with different random seeds evaluated on the test set.
Table 7: Top-1 accuracy of all the models evaluated on VTAB in heavyweight mode.
Table 8: Comparison of the best method on the full datasets using heavyweight sweep (Sup-Exemplar- 1 00%) to results published in the literature (where available). For some datasets priorwork does not use top-1 accuracy, therefore, we present our the performance of Sup-Exemplar-100 % using the same metric.
