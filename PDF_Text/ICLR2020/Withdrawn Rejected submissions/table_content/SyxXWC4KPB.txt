Table 1: Comparison of Per-class mIoU results of recent methods on Cityscapes with our state-of-the-art method. Both published and unpublished methods are included. Our results exhibit thebest overall performance. Note that the results for ”Ours” is obtained from training data only, and”Ours+” is obtained from training and validation data.
