Table 1: CIFAR-10 image classification test accuracies for cross-entropy compression with variousteacher and student neural net architectures. GAN-TSC outperforms standard TSC on training dataalone and training without compression (‘Student Only’) in all cases. See Sec. 4 for more details.
Table 2: Inception and TSC Scores for CIFAR-10 images; larger scores should signify higher quality.
