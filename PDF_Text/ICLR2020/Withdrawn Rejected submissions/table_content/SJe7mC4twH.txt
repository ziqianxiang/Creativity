Table 4: Neural network architectures used for target models and substitute models.
Table 5: Comparison of classification accuracy for clean-selected CNN and mix-selected CNN onthe MNIST under black-box attack with source model CNNA.
Table 6: Comparison of Q-path classification accuracy and E-path classification accuracy on theMNIST under black-box attack and white-box attack. The two scores separated by “/” representthe accuracy obtained by following the Q-path and E-path, respectively. We use “+adv” to referadversarial-trained models.
