Table 1: Few-shot classification accuracy of varying number of sources on seen target domains.
Table 2: Few-shot classification accuracy of varying number of sources on unseen target domains.
Table A1: The details of datasets used in our experiments.
Table A2: The comparison of the number of parameters for convolution 1 Ã— 1 and channel-wisetransform modulators. This is the case when the number of source domains is 8.
Table A3: 5-way 5-shot classification accuracy on seen domains without further adaptation.
Table A4: 5-way 5-shot classification accuracy on unseen domains without further adaptation.
Table A5: FeW-shot classification accuracy on seen domains. All eight domains Were used for train-ing.
Table A6: Few-shot classification accuracy on unseen domains. Seven domains other than the targetdomain were used for training.
