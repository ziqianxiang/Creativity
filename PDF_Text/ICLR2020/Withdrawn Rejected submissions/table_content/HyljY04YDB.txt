In previous work, GANs and VAEs were used to generate either string orgraph representations of molecules. Here, we use the GAN-based Wasserstein Auto-Encoder recentlyproposed in (Tolstikhin et al., 2017) to model the data distribution of molecules (see Figure 1 inSupplemental Material). For the encoder, we use a similar network architecture as in our supervisedexperiments. The decoder and discriminator are simple MLPs, with complete architectural detailsprovided in Supplemental Section A.4. Although the encoder is permutation invariant, the decodingprocess may not be. To force the decoder to learn a single graph ordering, we use a canonicalizationalgorithm (Schneider et al., 2015) that reorders atoms to ensure a unique graph for each molecule.

PR-AUC	0.876	0.799	0.879	0.9065 ConclusionIn this work, we have proposed LaPool, a differentiable and robust pooling operator for molecularand sparse graphs that considers both node information and graph structure. In doing so, we haveproposed a method which is able to identify important substructures of a graph by leveraging thegraph Laplacian. In contrast with previous work, this method retains the connectivity structure and9Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2020feature information of the graph during the coarsening procedure, while encouraging nodes belongingto the same substructure to be mapped together in the coarsened graph.
