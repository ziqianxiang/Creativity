We perform full exponential map updates using gyrovector arithmetic forthe gradients with respect to the hyperbolic parameters similar to (9) instead of using a retractionapproximation as in (24). In order to avoid numerical problems at the origin and far away from theorigin of the POincare ball, We perturb the operands if the norm is close to0 or1 respectively. TheEuclidean parameters are updated in parallel using the Adam optimization procedure (15).

The underlying geometry of the hyperbolic space allows for animproved performance on tasks which exhibit a partially hierarchical structure. We have discoveredcertain issues related to the use of the MMD metric in hyperbolic space. Future work will aim tocircumvent these issues as well as extend the current results. In particular, we hope to demonstratethe capabilities of our model on more tasks hypothesized to have a latent hyperbolic manifold andexplore this technique for mixed curvature settings.
