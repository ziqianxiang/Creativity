Table 1: Results for the object detection task on the test-dev split of the COCO dataset. Our approachsignificantly outperforms the baseline Faster-RCNN and the confidence-based IoU-Net.
Table 2:	Results for the age estimation experiments. Refinement using DCTD consistently improvesMAE (lower is better) for the age predictions outputted by a number of baselines.
Table 3:	Results for the head-Pose estimation exPeriments. Refinement using DCTD consistentlyimProves the average MAE for Yaw, Pitch and Roll for the Predicted Pose outPutted by our baselines.
Table 4: Results on the two tracking datasets TrackingNet and UAV123. The asterisk * indicate anapproximate value (Â±1), taken from the plot in the corresponding paper, due to the unavailability ofthe raw results. Our approach outperforms the baseline ATOM and other state-of-the-art trackers.
