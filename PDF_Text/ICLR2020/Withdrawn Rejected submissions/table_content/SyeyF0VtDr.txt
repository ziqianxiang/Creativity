Table 1: Performance comparison on temporal link prediction (average metrics in % over 5 runs) onthree event-based TKG datasets with filtered setting. RE-Net achieves the best results. Results withraw setting are in the supplementary material.
Table 2: Performance comparison on temporal link prediction (average metrics in % over 5 runs) ontwo public temporal knowledge graphs, i.e., WIKI and YAGO.
Table 3: Dataset Statistics.
Table 4: Performance comparison on ICEWS and GDELT datasets with raw metrics. We observe ourmethod outperforms all other methods.
