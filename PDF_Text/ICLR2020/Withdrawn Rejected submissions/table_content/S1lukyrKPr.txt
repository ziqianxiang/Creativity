Table 1: Macro-f1 and accuracy comparison between LEX-GAN and baselines on the rumor detec-tion task. BOTH represents the models are trained on PHEME+PHEME’. * indicates the best resultfrom the work that proposed the corresponding model. L represents the model is evaluated underleave-one-out principle.
Table 2: Examples of Dexplain predicting suspicious words in rumors (marked in bold). Dclassifyoutputs probabilities in range [0,1], where 0 and 1 represents rumor and non-rumor, respectively.
Table 3: Comparison between LEX-GAN and baselines on the gene classification and mutationdetection task. * indicates the best result from the corresponding paper. 2-class refers to AP , ANfor acceptor, and DP, DN for donor. 4-class refers to AP, AN, AP0, AN0 for acceptor, and DP,DN, DP0, DN0 for donor. A and D indicate acceptor and donor.
Table 4: Examples of Dexplain failing to predict suspicious words in some short rumors. Dclassifyoutputs probabilities in range [0,1], where 0 and 1 represents rumor and non-rumor, respectively.

Table 8: Comparison between LEX-GAN and baselines on the gene classification and mutationdetection task. * indicates the best result from the corresponding paper. Note that DNAC does binaryclassification between EI and IE, hence its result is relatively higher than 3-class classification. 3-dass refers to EI, IE, N. 6-dass refers to EI, IE, N, EI0,IE0, N：___________________________________GENE (3-class)	GENE+GENE'(3-class)	GENE+GENE'(6-class)	Precision	Recall	Macro-f1	Precision	Recall	Macro-f1	Precision	Recall	Macro-f1LSTM	0.7894	0.7930	0.7911	0.7971-	0.7978	0.7972	0.7931	0.7990	0.7953CNN	0.7233	0.7306	0.7265	0.7270	0.7301	0.7280	0.7146	0.7207	0.7165VAE-LSTM	0.4733	0.3835	0.3494	0.5184	0.4899	0.4806	0.2851	0.3583	0.3086VAE-CNN	0.8360	0.8583	0.8441	0.8210	0.8321	0.8236	0.3571	0.4605	0.3870DNAC	-	-	0.9390*	-	-	-	-	-	-LEX-GAN	0.9510	0.9642	0.9571	0.9391	0.9418	0.9403	0.9266	0.9336	0.9297Table 9: Examples of the generative model modifies gene sequences and the discriminative modeldetects the modifications (marked in bold).
