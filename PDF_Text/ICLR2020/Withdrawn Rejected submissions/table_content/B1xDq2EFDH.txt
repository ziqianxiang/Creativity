Table 1: Gaussian robustness improves overall robustness. We report the robustness metrics correspondingto various attacks (PGD, LBFGS, FGSM, and DF2), our proposed GNR metric, and the test accuracy ACCfor LeNet and AlexNet networks trained on MNIST and CIFAR100 using our proposed regularizer with noisevariance σ in training. Note that σ = 0 corresponds to baseline models trained without our regularizer. Weobserve that training networks with our proposed regularizer (designed for additive Gaussian attacks) not onlyimproves the robustness against Gaussian attacks but also against 6 other types of attacks which 4 of them listedhere and the others are left for appendix.
Table 2: Lists the training optimization hyper-parameters.
Table 3: The table lists all the attacks performed.
Table 4: Gaussian robustness improves overall robustness. We report the robustness metrics corresponding to various attacks (PGD, LBFGS, FGSM, AGA, AUA and DF2), ourproposed GNR metric, and the test accuracy ACC for LeNet and AlexNet networks trained on MNIST, CIFAR10 and CIFARl 00 using our proposed regularizer with noise varianceσ in training. Note that σ = 0 corresponds to baseline models trained without our regularizer. We observe that training networks with our proposed regularizer (designed for additiveGaussian attacks) not only improves the robustness against Gaussian attacks but also against 6 other types of attacks.
