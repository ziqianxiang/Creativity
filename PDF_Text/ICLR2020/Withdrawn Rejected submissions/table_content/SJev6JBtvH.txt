Table 1: Percentages of samples lying in the Typical Set of each of the learned and ground-truthdistributions. Here, we take to be such that approximately 95% of samples from a distributionlie in its own typical set, and we set n = 1. Note that each of the learned densities include mostof the ground-truth samples from p(x) in their typical sets, but the typical set of the ground-truthdistribution excludes most samples from the learned densities. Furthermore, most of the samplesfrom the learned densities are excluded from the typical sets of other learned densities.
