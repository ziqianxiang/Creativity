Table 1: Sample table titlePART	DESCRIPTION	Dendrite Axon Soma	Input terminal Output terminal Cell body (contains cell nucleus)Deceptive Opponent: We use the following equation to model an adversarial agent’s policy πo :πo(aθ∣st,λ = 1; α,β) =argmin∏∈∆{KL(π∣πMDP) + βKL(π∣πo(∙∣st,λ = 0))},	(5)∏MDP(aθ∣st, λ =1) = eαQ(st,a°)∕Z(St),	(6)where KL(∙∣∙) denotes the KUllback-Leibler divergence between two distributions, The goal-achieving policy παMDP is associated with the optimal Q function Q(St, ato), of a goal-achievingadversary MDP defined later. The temperature parameter α in (6) represents the level of rational-ity of the adversary. The other parameter β indicates the level of deception. Z(St) is the partitionfunction that normalizes παMDP.
