Table 1: Area under ROC curve for entropy as the OOD detection score.
Table 2: Out-of-distribution performance on CIFAR10, for ensembles of5 models trained on SVHN.
Table 3: Classification accuracy of individual networks (averaged over 5 instances) and ensemblesof 5 models on SVHN.
Table 4: Comparison between an ensemble of one-layer ReLU networks, an ensemble of one-layerFourier networks and just using the distance to the nearest neighbor in feature space (which in thiscase coincides with the pixel space) as a score for OOD detection. The in-distribution dataset isMNIST while the out-of-distribution data is coming from FashionMNIST.
Table 5: As in table 4, but for the ”4 digits” data set.
Table 6: AUROC on MNIST 0-4 vs MNIST 5-9.
