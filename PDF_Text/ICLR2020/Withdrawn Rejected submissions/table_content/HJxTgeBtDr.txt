Table 3: Neural NER systems with different architectures and pre-trained knowledge studied in thispaper. Overall F1 shows the performances of corresponding systems on different datasets. Forthe model name, “C” refers to “Character” and “W” refers to “Word”. Intuitively, the models arenamed based on their constituents. For example, CnonWrandlstmCrf is a model without characterfeature. Its word embedding is randomly initialized, and sentence encoder, as well as the decoder, areLSTM and CRF, respectively.
Table 4: Model-wise measures Siρ,j and Siσ,j on CoNNL-2003. Pink attributes are used to characterizeCategOry ambiguity of entities wh,ile blue attributes can measure the degree to which test entities havebeen seen in training set.
Table 5: Illustration of the bucket-wise measure β . Each histogram is obtained based on subtractingthe performance of Model1 (M1) from Model2 (M2) on a bucket. For ease of presentation, weroughly classify some attribute values into three categories: small(S), middle(M) and large(L). Forexample, the first column of the top left histogram represents M2 outperforms M1 when the attributeR-eDen takes the small (S) values.

Table 12:	A supplement bucket-wise analysis results to Tab. 5. Each histogram is obtained based onsubtracting the performance of Model1 (M1) from Model2 (M2) on a bucket. For ease of presentation,we roughly classify some attribute values into three categories: small(S), middle(M) and large(L). Forexample, the first column of the top left histogram represents M2 outperforms M1 when the attributeR-eDen takes the small (S) values.
