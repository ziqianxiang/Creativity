Figure 1: Testing results in the noiseless case by single-step methods. Left: Prediction errorof each method over time, measured by the L2 distance between the true and predictedpositions of the 20 masses. Right: Each curve represents the position of one of the masses(number 5) as a function of time predicted by the three single-step-trained H-NET models.
Figure 2: Prediction error of all methods in the noisy case measured by L2 distance, pre-sented in two plots due to the large number of methods. Included in the left plot are thesingle-step-trained methods, recurrently trained methods, vanilla RNN and LSTM. Includedin the right plot are the (same) recurrently trained methods, the recurrently trained methodswith initial state optimization (ISO), as well as vanilla RNN and LSTM with ISO.
Figure 3: Predictions made by three methods in the noisy case. The Y-axis corresponds tothe position of one of the masses (number 5) on the chain.
Figure 4: Actual versus predicted trajectories of the heavy billiard with perfect rebound.
