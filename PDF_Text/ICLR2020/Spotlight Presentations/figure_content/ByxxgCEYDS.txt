Figure 1: We extract a local enclosing subgraph around each rating (dark green), and train a GNN tomap subgraphs to ratings. Each enclosing subgraph is induced by the user and item associated withthe target rating as well as their h-hop neighbors (here h= 1). From the subgraphs, a GNN can learnmixed graph patterns (such as average ratings, paths, etc.) useful for rating prediction. We illustratesome possible patterns in the GNN box. We use the trained GNN to complete the missing entries.

Figure 3: TeSting enCloSing SubgraphS for FliXSter, Douban, YahooMuSiC, and ML-100K. Top 5 andbottom 5 are SubgraphS with the higheSt and loweSt prediCted ratingS, reSpeCtively. In eaCh Subgraph,red nodeS in the left are uSerS, blue nodeS in the right are itemS; the bottom red and blue nodeS arethe target uSer and item; the prediCted rating and true rating (in parentheSiS) are Shown underneath.
