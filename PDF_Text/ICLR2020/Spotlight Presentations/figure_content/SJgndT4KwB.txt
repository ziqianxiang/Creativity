Figure 1: Cartoon of the four paths γ1, γ2, γ3, γ4 between layers `1 and `2 in the case where there isno interaction. Paths stay with there original partners γ1 with γ2 and γ3 with γ4 at all intermediatelayers.
Figure 2: Cartoon of the four paths γ1, γ2, γ3, γ4 between layers `1 and `2 in the case where there isexactly one “loop” interaction between the marked layers. Paths swap away from their original part-ners exactly once at some intermediate layer after `1, and then swap back to their original partnersbefore '2.
