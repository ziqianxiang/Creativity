Figure 1: The average optimality gap on a quadratic objective function that is strongly convex andsmooth objective (top); and its monotone transformation (bottom). Further experiments on non-convex BBOB functions show similar behavior and are in the appendix.
Figure 2: The average optimality gap by the condition number of the objective function.
Figure 3:	The average optimality gap by the accuracy of the condition number estimate, whereapproximation factor is the ratio of estimated to true condition number. The dimension n = 20.
