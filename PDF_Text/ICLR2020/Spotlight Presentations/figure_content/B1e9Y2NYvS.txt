Figure 1: The architectureof an ODENet. The neu-ral ODE block serves as adimension-preserving nonlin-ear mapping.
Figure 2: No integral curves intersect.
Figure 3: An illustration of the time-invariant property of ODEs. We can seethat the curve z1 (t) is exactly the hori-zontal translation of z1 (t) on the inter-val [T', âˆž).
