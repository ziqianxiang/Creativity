Figure 1: Module Criticality: Loss values in the valleys that connect the initial weights θ0 to thefinal weights θF of a non-critical (left) and a critical (right) module in the ResNet18 architecture.
Figure 2: Analysis of rewinding modules to initialization for the ResNet-18 architecture. Each rowrepresents a module in ResNet18-v1 and each column represents a particular training epoch to whichthis module is rewound to. The difference from analysis of Zhang et al. (2019a) is that we rewindeach module, whereas Zhang et al. (2019a) rewind the entire ResNet blocks.

Figure 4: Performance degradation as we move on convex combination path from final to initialvalue of modules. We find that along this path the training error (as well as test error and train loss)increases monotonically from the final weights to initial weights. The blue (solid) curve is when wereplace all the parameters in the network by the convex combination between their initial and finalvalue simultaneously, the red (dashed) curve corresponds to moving on the convex path for a single(non-critical) layer and the yellow (dashdot) curve corresponds to moving on the convex path for acritical layer in ResNet-18 architecture.
