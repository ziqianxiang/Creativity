Figure 1: The challenge of joint modeling distributions with very different characteristics. (a)(b) The POIlocations (red dots) in Las Vegas and Space2Vec predicted conditional likelihood of Women’s Clothing (witha clustered distribution) and Education (with an even distribution). The dark area in (b) indicates that thedowntown area has more POIs of other types than education. (c) Ripley’s K curves of POI types for whichSpace2Vec has the largest and smallest improvement over wrap (Mac Aodha et al., 2019). Each curve representsthe number of POIs of a certain type inside certain radios centered at every POI of that type; (d) Ripley’s Kcurves renormalized by POI densities and shown in log-scale. To efficiently achieve multi-scale representationSpace2Vec concatenates the grid cell encoding of 64 scales (with wave lengths ranging from 50 meters to 40kmeters) as the first layer of a deep model, and trains with POI data in an unsupervised fashion.
