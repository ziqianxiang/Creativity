Figure 1: Illustration of InfoGraph. N.A. denotes neighborhood aggregation. An input graph isencoded into a feature map by graph convolutions and jumping concatenation. The discriminatortakes a (global representation, patch representation) pair as input and decides whether they are fromthe same graph. InfoGraph uses a batch-wise fashion to generate all possible positive and negativesamples. For example, consider the toy example with 2 input graphs in the batch and 7 nodes (orpatch representations) in total. For the global representation of the blue graph, there will be 7 inputpairs to the discriminator and same for the red graph. Thus, the discriminator will take 14 (globalrepresentation, patch representation) pairs as input in this case.
Figure 2: Illustration of the semi-supervised version of InfoGraph (InfoGraph*). There are twoseparate encoders with the same architecture, one for the supervised task and the other trained usingboth labeled and unlabeled data with an unsupervised objective (eq. equation 4). We encourage themutual information of the two representations learned by the two encoders to be high by deploying adiscriminator that takes a pair of representation as input and determines whether they are from thesame input graph.
