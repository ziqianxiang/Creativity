Figure 3: (a) (Left) Schematic describing Permutation learning aPProach. The inPuts are multiPliedby a K-matrix and then fed into a CNN, from which the classification loss is comPuted. SeParately,the inPut is Permuted by a Permutation matrix samPled from the distribution described by the K-matrix, and a “smoothness” loss (Rudin et al., 1992) is comPuted from the result, as described inAPPendix B.3. (b) (Right) Left Panel: original (unPermuted) examPle images. Center Panel: thePermuted versions. Right Panel: these images after then aPPlying the Permutation recovered by theK-matrix. The K-matrix is able to nearly unscramble the images into their unPermuted versions.
Figure 4: Loss and top-1 accuracy of 1.0 ShuffleNet g8 with either a fixed permutation (Shuffle) or aK-matrix for channel shuffling. The K-matrix model takes about the same number of training steps toconverge as does the baseline model.
Figure 5: Tradeoff between translation quality (measured by BLEU score) and inference speed(sentences per second). K-matrices have the second fastest inference speed, only 7% slower thanlow-rank matrices.
Figure 6: Speedup of FFT and Kaleidoscope against dense matrix-matrix multiply (GEMM) fortraining, and against dense matrix-vector multiply (GEMV) for inference.
Figure 7: First step of decomposition of modular-balanced matrix L. Here, the red entries must bepermuted into the main diagonal blocks.
Figure 8: First step of balancing 8 × 8 bit reversal permutation (a component of the 8 × 8 DFT). Redsignifies edges that must be flipped.
Figure 9: Decomposition of 4 × 4 sparse matrix S into P1HP2VP3Now, we use step matrices to prove Lemma I.1.
Figure 10: Block diagonalization of H8We argue that each of these 2 × 2 blocks can be decomposed into a diagonal matrix times an orthogonalmatrix. Note that the butterfly factor matrices constructed in the proof of Lemma I.2 each have atmost one non-zero entry per column. Hence, there are 4 cases to consider. Note that matrices with atmost one non-zero entry are exhausted by Cases 1 and 2.
