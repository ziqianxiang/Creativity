Figure 1: We train a model for performing CoUnterfactUallearning of physical dynamics. Given anobserved frame A = X。and a sequence OffUtUre frames B = Xi：T, We ask how the outcome Bwould have changed if we changed X。to X。by performing a do-intervention (e.g. changing theinitial positions of objects in the scene).
Figure 2: The difference between conventional video prediction (a) and counterfactual video predic-tion (b). The causal graph of the latter includes a confounder variable, which passes information fromthe original outcome to the outcome after do-intervention. The initially observed sequence (A, B)(on the left) and the counterfactual sequence after the do-intervention (on the right).
Figure 3: Stability distribution for each Confounder variable for heights K=3 and K=4 of theBlockTowerCF task. Masses, friction CooeffiCients: 2 configurations per block, 2K total; gravity:3 configurations for each axis ∈{x, y}, 9 total.
Figure 4: Our model learns CoUnterfactUal reasoning in a weakly supervised way: while Wesupervise the do-operator, we do not supervise the confounder variables (masses, frictions, gravity).
Figure 5: Visual examples of human performance on the ill-posed task of feedforward, i.e. non-counterfactual, dynamic prediction from a single image (in the BlockTower scenario). Theimage shows the initial state C. Small dots correspond to human estimates of the objects’ finalpositions. Larger circles indicate ground truth final positions of each block. We note that this task isill-posed by construction, as the dynamics of each experiment is defined by physical properties ofeach block (e.g. masses) which cannot be observed from a single image.
Figure 6: Visual examples of human performance on the task of Counterfactual dynamicprediction (in the BlOckTOwerCF scenario). Each participant has been shown both (A, B)and C. Small dots correspond to human estimates of the objects, resting positions (outcome afterdo-intervention). Larger circles indicate the ground truth final positions. The images show state C.
Figure 7: Visual examples of the CounterfaCtual predictions produced by CoPhyNet (in theBlOcktOwerCF scenario). Circles denote GT position and crosses correspond to predictions.
