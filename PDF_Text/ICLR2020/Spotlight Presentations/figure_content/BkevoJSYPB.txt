Figure 2: Continuous interpolation of a piecewise constant function. (a) fλ for a small value ofλ; the set Weλq is still substantial and only two interpolators g1 and g2 are incomplete. Also, allinterpolators are 0-interpolators. (b) fλ for a high value of λ; most interpolators are incomplete andwe also encounter a δ-interpolator g3 (between y1 and y2) which attains the value f(y1) δ-away fromthe set P1 . Despite losing some local structure for high λ, the gradient of fλ is still informative.
Figure 3: Example fλ for w ∈ R2 and λ = 3, 10, 20 (left to right). As λ changes, the interpolationfλ is less faithful to the piecewise constant f(y(w)) but provides reasonable gradient on a larger set.
Figure 4: The SP(k) dataset. (a) Each input is a k × k grid of tiles corresponding to a Warcraft IIterrain map, the respective label is a the matrix indicating the shortest path from top left to bottomright. (b) is a different map with correctly predicted shortest path.
Figure 5: The TSP(k) problem. (a) illustrates the dataset. Each input is a sequence of k flags andthe corresponding label is the adjacency matrix of the optimal TSP tour around the correspondingcapitals. (b) displays the learned locations of 10 country capitals in southeast Asia and Australia,accurately recovering their true position.
Figure 6:	Visualization of the PM dataset. (a) shows the case of PM(4). Each input is a 4 × 4 gridof MNIST digits and the corresponding label is the indicator vector for the edges in the min-costperfect matching. (b) shows the correct min-cost perfect matching output from the network. Thecost of the matching is 348 (46 + 12 horizontally and 27 + 45 + 40 + 67 + 78 + 33 vertically).
