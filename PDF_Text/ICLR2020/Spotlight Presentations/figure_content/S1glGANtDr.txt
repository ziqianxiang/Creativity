Figure 1: Off Policy Evaluation Results on Taxi. Default parameter, discounted factor γ = 0.99,mixed ratio α = β = 1, horizon length H = 600. For (a)-(c) the x-axis is the number of trajectoriesand y-axis corresponds to MSE, Bias Square and Variance, respectively. For (d) we fix the totalnumber of samples (number of trajectories times horizon length) and change the horizon length asx-axis and observe the MSE. (e) and (f) show the change the mixed ratio of α, β with the change ofbias. We repeat each experiment for 1000 runs.
Figure 2: Off Policy Evaluation Results on Puck-Mountain. We set discounted factor γ = 0.995 asdefault. For (a)-(c) we set the horizon H = 1000 and the x-axis is the number of trajectories for usedfor evaluation. For (d) we fix the total number of samples and change the horizon length.
Figure 3: Off Policy Evaluation Results on InvertedPendulum-v2. We set discounted factor γ = 0.995as default. For (a)-(c) we set the horizon H = 1000 and the x-axis is the number of trajectories forused for evaluation. For (d) we fix the total number of samples and change the horizon length.
