Figure 1: 3-dimensional complex embedding fora single word in different positions. The threewave functions (setting the initial phases as zero)show the real part of the embedding; the imagi-nary part has a 2 phase difference and shows thesame curves with its real-valued counterpart. Thex-axis denotes the absolute position of a word andthe y-axis denotes the value of each element in itsword vector. Colours mark different dimensionsof the embedding. The three cross points betweenthe functions and each vertical line (correspond-ing to a specific position Pos) represent the em-bedding for this word in the pos-th position.

Figure 3: The distribution of the Î´j . Higher values mean that the word representations are moresensitive to the word positions.
