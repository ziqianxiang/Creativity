Figure 1: Illustration of the ‘memory length’ environmentMemory length is a good bsuite experiment because it is targeted, simple, challenging,scalable and fast. By construction, an agent that performs well on this task has masteredsome use of memory over multiple timesteps. Our summary ‘score’ provides a quick anddirty way to compare agent performance at a high level. Our sweep over different lengths Nprovides empirical evidence about the scaling properties of the algorithm beyond a simplepass/fail. Figure 2a gives a quick snapshot of the performance of baseline algorithms.
