We present a deep generative model for unsupervised text style transfer that unifies
previously proposed non-generative techniques. Our probabilistic approach models
non-parallel data from two domains as a partially observed parallel corpus. By
hypothesizing a parallel latent sequence that generates each observed sequence, our
model learns to transform sequences from one domain to another in a completely
unsupervised fashion. In contrast with traditional generative sequence models (e.g.
the HMM), our model makes few assumptions about the data it generates: it uses
a recurrent language model as a prior and an encoder-decoder as a transduction
distribution. While computation of marginal data likelihood is intractable in this
model class, we show that amortized variational inference admits a practical surro-
gate. Further, by drawing connections between our variational objective and other
recent unsupervised style transfer and machine translation techniques, we show
how our probabilistic view can unify some known non-generative objectives such
as backtranslation and adversarial loss. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness
of our method on a wide range of unsupervised style transfer tasks, including senti-
ment transfer, formality transfer, word decipherment, author imitation, and related
language translation. Across all style transfer tasks, our approach yields substantial
gains over state-of-the-art non-generative baselines, including the state-of-the-art
unsupervised machine translation techniques that our approach generalizes. Further,
we conduct experiments on a standard unsupervised machine translation task and
find that our unified approach matches the current state-of-the-art.* 1
1 Introduction
Text sequence transduction systems convert a given text sequence from one domain to another.
These techniques can be applied to a wide range of natural language processing applications such
as machine translation (Bahdanau et al., 2015), summarization (Rush et al., 2015), and dialogue
response generation (Zhao et al., 2017). In many cases, however, parallel corpora for the task at hand
are scarce. Therefore, unsupervised sequence transduction methods that require only non-parallel
data are appealing and have been receiving growing attention (Bannard & Callison-Burch, 2005;
Ravi & Knight, 2011; Mizukami et al., 2015; Shen et al., 2017; Lample et al., 2018; 2019). This
trend is most pronounced in the space of text style transfer tasks where parallel data is particularly
challenging to obtain (Hu et al., 2017; Shen et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2018). Style transfer has
historically referred to sequence transduction problems that modify superficial properties of text -
i.e. style rather than content.2 We focus on a standard suite of style transfer tasks, including formality
transfer (Rao & Tetreault, 2018), author imitation (Xu et al., 2012), word decipherment (Shen et al.,
2017), sentiment transfer (Shen et al., 2017), and related language translation (Pourdamghani &
Knight, 2017). General unsupervised translation has not typically been considered style transfer, but
for the purpose of comparison we also conduct evaluation on this task (Lample et al., 2017).

conciseness we use the term “style transfer” nonetheless.

Recent work on unsupervised text style transfer mostly employs non-generative or non-probabilistic
modeling approaches. For example, Shen et al. (2017) and Yang et al. (2018) design adversarial
discriminators to shape their unsupervised objective - an approach that can be effective, but often
introduces training instability. Other work focuses on directly designing unsupervised training
objectives by incorporating intuitive loss terms (e.g. backtranslation loss), and demonstrates state-of-
the-art performance on unsupervised machine translation (Lample et al., 2018; Artetxe et al., 2019)
and style transfer (Lample et al., 2019). However, the space of possible unsupervised objectives is
extremely large and the underlying modeling assumptions defined by each objective can only be
reasoned about indirectly. As a result, the process of designing such systems is often heuristic.
In contrast, probabilistic models (e.g. the noisy channel model (Shannon, 1948)) define assumptions
about data more explicitly and allow us to reason about these assumptions during system design.
Further, the corresponding objectives are determined naturally by principles of probabilistic inference,
reducing the need for empirical search directly in the space of possible objectives. That said, classical
probabilistic models for unsupervised sequence transduction (e.g. the HMM or semi-HMM) typically
enforce overly strong independence assumptions about data to make exact inference tractable (Knight
et al., 2006; Ravi & Knight, 2011; Pourdamghani & Knight, 2017). This has restricted their develop-
ment and caused their performance to lag behind unsupervised neural objectives on complex tasks.
Luckily, in recent years, powerful variational approximation techniques have made it more practical
to train probabilistic models without strong independence assumptions (Miao & Blunsom, 2016; Yin
et al., 2018). Inspired by this, we take a new approach to unsupervised style transfer.
We directly define a generative probabilistic model that treats a non-parallel corpus in two domains
as a partially observed parallel corpus. Our model makes few independence assumptions and its true
posterior is intractable. However, we show that by using amortized variational inference (Kingma &
Welling, 2013), a principled probabilistic technique, a natural unsupervised objective falls out of our
modeling approach that has many connections with past work, yet is different from all past work in
specific ways. In experiments across a suite of unsupervised text style transfer tasks, we find that the
natural objective of our model actually outperforms all manually defined unsupervised objectives
from past work, supporting the notion that probabilistic principles can be a useful guide even in deep
neural systems. Further, in the case of unsupervised machine translation, our model matches the
current state-of-the-art non-generative approach.
2 Unsupervised Text Style Transfer
We first overview text style transfer, which aims to transfer a text (typically a single sentence or a short
paragraph - for simplicity we refer to simply “sentences” below) from one domain to another while
preserving underlying content. For example, formality transfer (Rao & Tetreault, 2018) is the task of
transforming the tone of text from informal to formal without changing its content. Other examples
include sentiment transfer (Shen et al., 2017), word decipherment (Knight et al., 2006), and author
imitation (Xu et al., 2012). If parallel examples were available from each domain (i.e. the training data
is a bitext consisting of pairs of sentences from each domain), supervised techniques could be used to
perform style transfer (e.g. attentional Seq2Seq (Bahdanau et al., 2015) and Transformer (Vaswani
et al., 2017)). However, for most style transfer problems, only non-parallel corpora (one corpus from
each domain) can be easily collected. Thus, work on style transfer typically focuses on the more
difficult unsupervised setting where systems must learn from non-parallel data alone.
The model we propose treats an observed non-parallel text corpus as a partially observed parallel
corpus. Thus, we introduce notation for both observed text inputs and those that we will treat
as latent variables. Specifically, We let X = {χ(1),χ(2),…，χ(m)} represent observed data from
domain Di, while we let Y = {y(m+1),y(m+2),…，y(n)} represent observed data from domain
D2 . Corresponding indices represent parallel sentences. Thus, none of the observed sentences
share indices. In our model, we introduce latent sentences to complete the parallel corpus. Specifi-
cally, X = {x(m+1),X(m+2),…，x(n)} represents the set of latent parallel sentences in Di, while
Y = {y(1),y⑵，…，y(m)} represents the set of latent parallel sentences in D?. Then the goal of
unsupervised text transduction is to infer these latent variables conditioned the observed non-parallel
corpora; that is, to learn p(y∣x) andp(x∣y).

the observed variables and unshaded circles denote the latents. The generator is parameterized as an
encoder-decoder architecture and the prior on the latent variable is a pretrained language model.
3 The Deep Latent Sequence Model
First we present our generative model of bitext, which we refer to as a deep latent sequence model.
We then describe unsupervised learning and inference techniques for this model class.
3.1 Model Structure
Directly modeling p(y∣x) and p(x∣y) in the unsupervised setting is difficult because We never directly
observe parallel data. Instead, we propose a generative model of the complete data that defines a
joint likelihood, p(X, X, Y, Y). In order to perform text transduction, the unobserved halves can be
treated as latent variables: they will be marginalized out during learning and inferred via posterior
inference at test time.
Our model assumes that each observed sentence is generated from an unobserved parallel sentence
in the opposite domain, as depicted in Figure 1. Specifically, each sentence x(i) in domain D1 is
generated as follows: First, a latent sentence y(i) in domain D2 is sampled from a prior, pD2 (y(i)).
Then, x(i) is sampled conditioned on y(i) from a transduction model, p(x(i) |y(i)). Similarly, each
observed sentence y(j) in domain D2 is generated conditioned on a latent sentence, x(j), in domain
D1 via the opposite transduction model, p(y(j) ∣x(j)), and prior, pD1 (Xj)). We let θx∣y and θy∣x
represent the parameters of the two transduction distributions respectively. We assume the prior
distributions are pretrained on the observed data in their respective domains and therefore omit their
parameters for simplicity of notation. Together, this gives the following joint likelihood:
P(X,X ,y,Y； θχ∣y ,θy∣x) = (Y P(x⑴忸⑶；θχ∣y)pD2 ®⑴))(Y P(y (j) Ixej) ； θy∣x )pdi (Xej)))
i=1	j=m+1
(1)
The log marginal likelihood of the data, which we will approximate during training, is:
logP(X,Y; θx∣y,θy∣x) = logXX Xγp(X,X,Y,Y; θχ∣y,θy∣X)	(2)
Note that if the two transduction models share no parameters, the training problems for each observed
domain are independent. Critically, we introduce parameter sharing through our variational inference
procedure, which we describe in more detail in Section 3.2.
Architecture: Since we would like to be able to model a variety of transfer tasks, we choose a
parameterization for our transduction distributions that makes no independence assumptions. Specifi-
cally, we employ an encoder-decoder architecture based on the standard attentional Seq2Seq model
which has been shown to be successful across various tasks (Bahdanau et al., 2015; Rush et al., 2015).
Similarly, our prior distributions for each domain are parameterized as recurrent language models
which, again, make no independence assumptions. In contrast, traditional unsupervised generative
sequence models typically make strong independence assumptions to enable exact inference (e.g. the
HMM makes a Markov assumption on the latent sequence and emissions are one-to-one). Our model
is more flexible, but exact inference via dynamic programming will be intractable. We address this
problem in the next section.

Figure 2: Depiction of amortized variational approximation. Distributions q(y∣x) and q (x|y) represent
inference networks that approximate the model’s true posterior. Critically, parameters are shared
between the generative model and inference networks to tie the learning problems for both domains.
3.2 Learning
Ideally, learning should directly optimize the log data likelihood, which is the marginal of our model
shown in Eq. 2. However, due to our model’s neural parameterization which does not factorize,
computing the data likelihood cannot be accomplished using dynamic programming as can be done
with simpler models like the HMM. To overcome the intractability of computing the true data
likelihood, we adopt amortized variational inference (Kingma & Welling, 2013) in order to derive a
surrogate objective for learning, the evidence lower bound (ELBO) on log marginal likelihood3 :
lθg p(X,Y; θχ∣y,θy∣χ )
≥ LELBO (X, Y; θχ∣y, θy |x , φx |y , φy |x )

{z} X{z}
Reconstruction likelihood	KL regularizer
The surrogate objective introduces q(y∣x(i); φy∣x) and q(x|y(j); φx∣y), which represent two separate
inference network distributions that approximate the model,s true posteriors, p(y∣x(i); θx∣y) and
p(x∣y(j); θy∣x), respectively. Learning operates by jointly optimizing the lower bound over both
variational and model parameters. Once trained, the variational posterior distributions can be used
directly for style transfer. The KL terms in Eq. 3, that appear naturally in the ELBO objective, can be
intuitively viewed as regularizers that use the language model priors to bias the induced sentences
towards the desired domains. Amortized variational techniques have been most commonly applied to
continuous latent variables, as in the case of the variational autoencoder (VAE) (Kingma & Welling,
2013). Here, we use this approach for inference over discrete sequences, which has been shown to be
effective in related work on a semi-supervised task (Miao & Blunsom, 2016).
Inference Network and Parameter Sharing: Note that the approximate posterior on one domain
aims to learn the reverse style transfer distribution, which is exactly the goal of the generative
distribution in the opposite domain. For example, the inference network q(y∣x(i); φy∣x) and the
generative distribution p(y|x(i); θy∣x) both aim to transform D1 to D2. Therefore, We use the same
architecture for each inference network as used in the transduction models, and tie their parameters:
φx∣y = θx∣y, φy∣x = θy∣x. ThiS means We learn only two encoder-decoders overall - which are
parameterized by θx∣y and θy∣x respectively — to represent two directions of transfer. In addition to
reducing the number of learnable parameters, this parameter tying couples the learning problems for
both domains and allows us to jointly learn from the full data. Moreover, inspired by recent work that
3Note that in practice, we add a weight λ (the same to both domains) to the KL term in ELBO since the
regularization strength from the pretrained language model varies depending on the datasets, training data size,
or language model structures. Such reweighting has proven necessary in previous work that is trained with
ELBO (Bowman et al., 2016; Miao & Blunsom, 2016; Yin et al., 2018).

builds a universal Seq2Seq model to translate between different language pairs (Johnson et al., 2017),
we introduce further parameter tying between the two directions of transduction: the same encoder is
employed for both x and y, and a domain embedding c is provided to the same decoder to specify
the transfer direction, as shown in Figure 2. Ablation analysis in Section 5.3 suggests that parameter
sharing is important to achieve good performance.
Approximating Gradients of ELBO: The reconstruction and KL terms in Eq. 3 still involve
intractable expectations due to the marginalization over the latent sequence, thus we need to approxi-
mate their gradients. Gumbel-softmax (Jang et al., 2017) and REINFORCE (Sutton et al., 2000) are
often used as stochastic gradient estimators in the discrete case. Since the latent text variables have an
extremely large domain, we find that REINFORCE-based gradient estimates result in high variance.
Thus, we use the Gumbel-softmax straight-through estimator to backpropagate gradients from the
KL terms.4 However, we find that approximating gradients of the reconstruction loss is much more
challenging - both the GUmbel-Softmax estimator and REINFORCE are unable to outperform a
simple stop-gradient method that does not back-propagate the gradient of the latent sequence to the
inference network. This confirms a similar observation in previous work on unsupervised machine
translation (Lample et al., 2018). Therefore, we use greedy decoding without recording gradients to
approximate the reconstruction term.5 Note that the inference networks still receive gradients from
the prior through the KL term, and their parameters are shared with the decoders which do receive
gradients from reconstruction. We consider this to be the best empirical compromise at the moment.
Initialization. Good initialization is often necessary for successful optimization of unsupervised
learning objectives. In preliminary experiments, we find that the encoder-decoder structure has
difficulty generating realistic sentences during the initial stages of training, which usually results in a
disastrous local optimum. This is mainly because the encoder-decoder is initialized randomly and
there is no direct training signal to specify the desired latent sequence in the unsupervised setting.
Therefore, we apply a self-reconstruction loss Lrec at the initial epochs of training. We denote the
output the encoder as e(∙) and the decoder distribution as pdec, then
Lrec = -α ∙ X : i [pdec(e(x' ), Cx)] - α ∙ X : j [pdec(e(y(j ), cy)],	(4)
α decays from 1.0 to 0.0 linearly in the first k epochs. k is a tunable parameter and usually less than
3 in all our experiments.
4	Connection to Related Work
Our probabilistic formulation can be connected with recent advances in unsupervised text transduction
methods. For example, back translation loss (Sennrich et al., 2016) plays an important role in recent
unsupervised machine translation (Artetxe et al., 2018; Lample et al., 2018; Artetxe et al., 2019) and
unsupervised style transfer systems (Lample et al., 2019). In order to incorporate back translation
loss the source language x is translated to the target language y to form a pseudo-parallel corpus,
then a translation model from y to x can be learned on this pseudo bitext just as in supervised setting.
While back translation was often explained as a data augmentation technique, in our probabilistic
formulation it appears naturally with the ELBO objective as the reconstruction loss term.
Some previous work has incorporated a pretrained language models into neural semi-supervised or
unsupervised objectives. He et al. (2016) uses the log likelihood of a pretrained language model as
the reward to update a supervised machine translation system with policy gradient. Artetxe et al.
(2019) utilize a similar idea for unsupervised machine translation. Yang et al. (2018) employed a
similar approach, but interpret the LM as an adversary, training the generator to fool the LM. We
show how our ELBO objective is connected with these more heuristic LM regularizers by expanding
the KL loss term (assume x is observed):
DKL (q(y|x)||PD2(y)) = -Hq - Eq [log PD2 (y)],	⑸
Note that the loss used in previous work does not include the negative entropy term, -Hq . Our
objective results in this additional “regularizer”, the negative entropy of the transduction distribution,
-Hq . Intuitively, -Hq helps avoid a peaked transduction distribution, preventing the transduction

from constantly generating similar sentences to satisfy the language model. In experiments we will
show that this additional regularization is important and helps bypass bad local optima and improve
performance. These important differences with past work suggest that a probabilistic view of the
unsupervised sequence transduction may provide helpful guidance in determining effective training
objectives.
5	Experiments
We test our model on five style transfer tasks: sentiment transfer, word substitution decipherment,
formality transfer, author imitation, and related language translation. For completeness, we also
evaluate on the task of general unsupervised machine translation using standard benchmarks.
We compare with the unsupervised machine translation model (UNMT) which recently demonstrated
state-of-the-art performance on transfer tasks such as sentiment and gender transfer (Lample et al.,
2019).6 To validate the effect of the negative entropy term in the KL loss term Eq. 5, we remove
it and train the model with a back-translation loss plus a language model negative log likelihood
loss (which we denote as BT+NLL) as an ablation baseline. For each task, we also include strong
baseline numbers from related work if available. For our method we select the model with the best
validation ELBO, and for UNMT or BT+NLL we select the model with the best back-translation loss.
Complete model configurations and hyperparameters can be found in Appendix A.1.
5.1	Datasets and Experiment Setup
Word Substitution Decipherment. Word decipherment aims to uncover the plain text behind a
corpus that was enciphered via word substitution where word in the vocabulary is mapped to a
unique type in a cipher dictionary (Dou & Knight, 2012; Shen et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2018). In our
formulation, the model is presented with a non-parallel corpus of English plaintext and the ciphertext.
We use the data in (Yang et al., 2018) which provides 200K sentences from each domain. While
previous work (Shen et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2018) controls the difficulty of this task by varying the
percentage of words that are ciphered, we directly evaluate on the most difficult version of this task
-100% of the words are enciphered (i.e. no vocabulary sharing in the two domains). We select the
model with the best unsupervised reconstruction loss, and evaluate with BLEU score on the test set
which contains 100K parallel sentences. Results are shown in Table 2.
Sentiment Transfer. Sentiment transfer is a task of paraphrasing a sentence with a different sentiment
while preserving the original content. Evaluation of sentiment transfer is difficult and is still an open
research problem (Mir et al., 2019). Evaluation focuses on three aspects: attribute control, content
preservation, and fluency. A successful system needs to perform well with respect to all three aspects.
We follow prior work by using three automatic metrics (Yang et al., 2018; Lample et al., 2019):
classification accuracy, self-BLEU (BLEU of the output with the original sentence as the reference),
and the perplexity (PPL) of each system’s output under an external language model. We pretrain a
convolutional classifier (Kim, 2014) to assess classification accuracy, and use an LSTM language
model pretrained on each domain to compute the PPL of system outputs.
We use the Yelp reviews dataset collected by Shen et al. (2017) which contains 250K negative
sentences and 380K positive sentences. We also use a small test set that has 1000 human-annotated
parallel sentences introduced in Li et al. (2018). We denote the positive sentiment as domain D1 and
the negative sentiment as domain D2 . We use Self-BLEU and BLEU to represent the BLEU score of
the output against the original sentence and the reference respectively. Results are shown in Table 1.
Formality Transfer. Next, we consider a harder task of modifying the formality of a sequence. We
use the GYAFC dataset (Rao & Tetreault, 2018), which contains formal and informal sentences from
two different domains. In this paper, we use the Entertainment and Music domain, which has about
52K training sentences, 5K development sentences, and 2.5K test sentences. This dataset actually
contains parallel data between formal and informal sentences, which we use only for evaluation. We
follow the evaluation of sentiment transfer task and test models on three axes. Since the test set is
6The model they used is slightly different from the original model of Lample et al. (2018) in certain details
- e.g. the addition of a pooling layer after attention. We re-implement their model in our codebase for fair
comparison and verify that our re-implementation achieves performance competitive with the original paper.

a parallel corpus, we only compute reference BLEU and ignore self-BLEU. We use D1 to denote
formal text, and D2 to denote informal text. Results are shown in Table 1.
Author Imitation. Author imitation is the task of paraphrasing a sentence to match another author’s
style. The dataset we use is a collection of Shakespeare’s plays translated line by line into modern
English. It was collected by Xu et al. (2012)7 and used in prior work on supervised style trans-
fer (Jhamtani et al., 2017). This is a parallel corpus and thus we follow the setting in the formality
transfer task. We use D1 to denote modern English, and D2 to denote Shakespeare-style English.
Results are shown in Table 1.
Related Language Translation. Next, we test our method on a challenging related language
translation task (Pourdamghani & Knight, 2017; Yang et al., 2018). This task is a natural test bed
for unsupervised sequence transduction since the goal is to preserve the meaning of the source
sentence while rewriting it into the target language. For our experiments, we choose Bosnian (bs) and
Serbian (sr) as the related language pairs. We follow Yang et al. (2018) to report BLEU-1 score on
this task since BLEU-4 score is close to zero. Results are shown in Table 2.
Unsupervised MT. In order to draw connections with a related work on general unsupervised
machine translation, we also evaluate on the WMT’16 German English translation task. This task
is substantially more difficult than the style transfer tasks considered so far. We compare with the
state-of-the-art UNMT system using the existing implementation from the XLM codebase,8 and
implement our approach in the same framework with XLM initialization for fair comparison. We
train both systems on 5M non-parallel sentences from each language. Results are shown in Table 2.
In Tables 1 we also list the PPL of the Table 2: BLEU for decipherment, related language
test set under the external LM for both the translation (Sr-Bs), and general unsupervised transla-

Tables 1 and 2 demonstrate some general
trends. First, UNMT is able to outperform
other prior methods in unsupervised text style transfer, such as (Yang et al., 2018; Hu et al., 2017;
Shen et al., 2017). The performance improvements of UNMT indicate that flexible and powerful

architectures are crucial (prior methods generally do not have an attention mechanism). Second, our
model achieves comparable classification accuracy to UNMT but outperforms it in all style transfer
tasks in terms of the reference-BLEU, which is the most important metric since it directly measures
the quality of the final generations against gold parallel data. This indicates that our method is both
effective and consistent across many different tasks. Finally, the BT+NLL baseline is sometimes quite
competitive, which indicates that the addition of a language model alone can be beneficial. However,
our method consistently outperforms the simple BT+NLL method, which indicates the effectiveness
of the additional entropy regularizer in Eq. 5 that is the byproduct of our probabilistic formulation.
Next, we examine the PPL of the system outputs under pretrained domain LMs, which should be
evaluated in comparison with the PPL of the test set itself. For both the sentiment transfer and the
formality transfer tasks in Table 1, BT+NLL achieves extremely low PPL, lower than the PPL of the
test corpus in the target domain. After a close examination of the output, we find that it contains
many repeated and overly simple outputs. For example, the system generates many examples of “I
love this place” when transferring negative to positive sentiment (see Appendix A.3 for examples). It
is not surprising that such a trivial output has low perplexity, high accuracy, and low BLEU score.
On the other hand, our system obtains reasonably competitive PPL, and our approach achieves the
highest accuracy and higher BLEU score than the UNMT baseline.
5.3 Further Ablations and Analysis
Parameter Sharing. We also conducted an experiment on the
word substitution decipherment task, where we remove parame-
ter sharing (as explained in Section 3.2) between two directions
of transduction distributions, and optimize two encoder-decoder
instead. We found that the model only obtained an extremely

different vocabularies and thus are easily distinguished, our method yields a smaller gain over UNMT.
This likely indicates that the (discrimination) regularization effect of the LM priors is less important
or necessary when the two domains are very different.
Why does the proposed model outperform UNMT? Finally, we examine in detail the output of our
model and UNMT for the author imitation task. We pick this task because the reference outputs for
the test set are provided, aiding analysis. Examples shown in Table 3 demonstrate that UNMT tends
to make overly large changes to the source so that the original meaning is lost, while our method is
better at preserving the content of the source sentence. Next, we quantitatively examine the outputs
from UNMT and our method by comparing the F1 measure of words bucketed by their syntactic tags.
We use the open-sourced compare-mt tool (Neubig et al., 2019), and the results are shown in Figure
4. Our system has outperforms UNMT in all word categories. In particular, our system is much better
at generating nouns, which likely leads to better content preservation.

Greedy vs. Sample-based Gradient Approximation. In our experiments, we use greedy decoding
from the inference network to approximate the expectation required by ELBO, which is a biased
estimator. The main purpose of this approach is to reduce the variance of the gradient estimator during
training, especially in the early stages when the variance of sample-based approaches is quite high. As
an ablation experiment on the sentiment transfer task we compare greedy and sample-based gradient
approximations in terms of both train and test ELBO, as well as task performance corresponding
to best test ELBO. After the model is fully trained, we find that the sample-based approximation
has low variance. With a single sample, the standard deviation of the EBLO is less than 0.3 across
10 different test repetitions. All final reported ELBO values are all computed with this approach,
regardless of whether the greedy approximation was used during training. The reported ELBO values
are the evidence lower bound per word. Results are shown in Table 4, where the sampling-based
training underperforms on both ELBO and task evaluations.
5.4 Comparison of gradient propagation methods
As noted above, to stabilize the training process, we stop gradients from propagating to the inference
network from the reconstruction loss. Does this approach indeed better optimize the actual proba-
bilistic objective (i.e. ELBO) or only indirectly lead to improved task evaluations? In this section we
use sentiment transfer as an example task to compare different methods for propagating gradients and
evaluate both ELBO and task evaluations.
Specifically, we compare three different methods:
•	Stop Gradient: The gradients from reconstruction loss are not propagated to the inference
network. This is the method we use in all previous experiments.
•	Gumbel Softmax (Jang et al., 2017): Gradients from the reconstruction loss are propagated
to the inference network with the straight-through Gumbel estimator.
•	REINFORCE (Sutton et al., 2000): Gradients from reconstruction loss are propagated
to the inference network with ELBO as a reward function. This method has been used in
previous work for semi-supervised sequence generation (Miao & Blunsom, 2016; Yin et al.,
2018), but often suffers from instability issues.
We report the train and test ELBO along with task evaluations in Table 5, and plot the learning
curves on validation set in Figure 5.9 While being much simpler, we show that the stop-gradient
trick produces superior ELBO over Gumbel Softmax and REINFORCE. This result suggests that
stopping gradient helps better optimize the likelihood objective under our probabilistic formulation in
comparison with other optimization techniques that propagate gradients, which is counter-intuitive. A
likely explanation is that as a gradient estimator, while clearly biased, stop-gradient has substantially
reduced variance. In comparison with other techniques that offer reduced bias but extremely high
variance when applied to our model class (which involves discrete sequences as latent variables),
stop-gradient actually leads to better optimization of our objective because it achieves better balance
of bias and variance overall.
9We remove REINFORCE from this figure since it is very difficult to stabilize training and obtain reasonable
results (e.g. the ELBO value is much worse than others in Table 5)

6 Conclusion
We propose a probabilistic generative forumalation that unites past work on unsupervised text style
transfer. We show that this probabilistic formulation provides a different way to reason about
unsupervised objectives in this domain. Our model leads to substantial improvements on five text
style transfer tasks, yielding bigger gains when the styles considered are more difficult to distinguish.

A	Appendix
A. 1	Model Configurations.
We adopt the following attentional encoder-decoder architecture for UNMT, BT+NLL, and our
method across all the experiments:
•	We use word embeddings of size 128.
•	We use 1 layer LSTM with hidden size of 512 as both the encoder and decoder.
•	We apply dropout to the readout states before softmax with a rate of 0.3.
•	Following Lample et al. (2019), we add a max pooling operation over the encoder hidden
states before feeding it to the decoder. Intuitively the pooling window size would control
how much information is preserved during transduction. A window size of 1 is equivalent to
standard attention mechanism, and a large window size corresponds to no attention. See
Appendix A.2 for how to select the window size.
•	There is a noise function for UNMT baseline in its denoising autoencoder loss (Lample
et al., 2017; 2019), which is critical for its success. We use the default noise function
and noise hyperparameters in Lample et al. (2017) when running the UNMT model. For
BT+NLL and our method we found that adding the extra noise into the self-reconstruction
loss (Eq. 4) is only helpful when the two domains are relatively divergent (decipherment
and related language translation tasks) where the language models play a less important
role. Therefore, we add the default noise from UNMT to Eq. 4 for decipherment and related
language translation tasks only, and do not use any noise for sentiment, author imitation,
and formality tasks.
A.2	Hyperparameter Tuning.
We vary pooling windows size as {1, 5}, the decaying patience hyperparameter k for self-
reconstruction loss (Eq. 4) as {1, 2, 3}. For the baseliens UNMT and BT+NLL, we also try the
option of not annealing the self-reconstruction loss at all as in the unsupervised machine translation
task (Lample et al., 2018). We vary the weight λ for the NLL term (BT+NLL) or the KL term (our
method) as {0.001, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.1}.
A.3	Sentiment Transfer Example Outputs
We list some examples of the sentiment transfer task in Table 6. Notably, the BT+NLL method tends
to produce extremely short and simple sentences.
A.4	Repetitive Examples of BT+NLL
In Section 5 we mentioned that the baseline BT+NLL has a low perplexity for some tasks because it
tends to generate overly simple and repetitive sentences. From Table 1 we see that two representative
tasks are sentiment transfer and formatliy transfer. In Appendix A.3 we have demonstrated some
examples for sentiment transfer, next we show some repetitive samples of BT+NLL in Table 7.
