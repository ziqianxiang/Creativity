Table 1: Homogeneous reconstruction pose accuracyquantified by median rotation/translation error to theground truth image poses. Rotation/translation error isdefined as the Frobenius/L2 norm after alignment.
Table 2: Reconstruction accuracy quantified by an FSC=0.5 resolution metric between the reconstructed volumescorresponding to each image and its ground truth volume. We report the average and standard deviation across100 images in the dataset (lower is better; best possible is 2 pixels).
Table S3:	Relationship between number of classes in cryoSPARC and reconstruction accuracy quantified by anFSC=0.5 resolution metric between the reconstructed volumes corresponding to each image and its ground truthvolume. We report the average and standard deviation across 100 images in the dataset (lower is better; bestpossible is 2 pixels).
Table S4:	Relationship between z dimension in cryoDRGN and reconstruction accuracy quantified by anFSC=0.5 resolution metric between the reconstructed volumes corresponding to each image and its ground truthvolume. We report the average and standard deviation across 100 images in the dataset (lower is better; bestpossible is 2 pixels).
