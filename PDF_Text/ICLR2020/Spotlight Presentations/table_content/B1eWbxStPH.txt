Table 1: MAE on QM9. DimeNet sets the state of the art on 11 targets, outperforming the second-bestmodel on average by 31 % (mean std. MAE).
Table 2: MAE on MD17 using 1000 training samples(energies in kcal, forces in Jkca å). DimeNet outper-forms SchNet by a large margin and performs roughlyon par with sGDML.
Table 3: Ablation studies using multi-tasklearning on QM9. All of our contributionshave a significant impact on performance.
Table 4: MAE on QM9 with multi-target learning. Single-target learning significantly improvesperformance on all targets. Using a separate output block per target slightly reduces this differencewith little impact on training time.
