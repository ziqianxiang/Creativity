The features of all virtual nodes e(vi,,lr+)1 arefurther aggregated in the high-level aggregation. The aggregation function q is a concatenation ||for all layers except the final layer, which uses mean for its aggregation function. Then, the overall

To study which combination of embedding spaces is desirable, we construct newGeom-GCN variants by adopting neighborhoods built by different embedding space. For the vari-ants adopted Isomap and poincare embedding space to build neighborhood in graph and in latentspace respectively, we use Geom-GCN-IP to denote it. The naming rule is the same for other com-
