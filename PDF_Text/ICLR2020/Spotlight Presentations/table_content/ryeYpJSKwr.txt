Table 1: The MetaBO setting in the RL framework.
Table 2: Optimal parameters of GMM-UCB and EPS-GREEDY (determined on the test set).
Table 3: Comparison of evaluation runtimes per BO episode with budget T = 30 in s for various AFs,averaged over 10 BO runs. We show MetaBOâ€™s runtime for M = 50 source tasks as well as for thefull version (where a new function is sampled from the training distribution in each BO run). For TAF,we indicate M and the number N of data points per source task by TAF-ME-M -N and TAF-R-M -N.
Table 4: Parameters of the MetaBO framework used in our experiments.
