Table 1: Local minima for MLPs generated via various initializations. We show loss, euclideannorm of the gradient vector, and minimum eigenvalue of the Hessian before and after training. Weuse 500 iterations of the power method on a shifted Hessian matrix computed on the full dataset tofind the minimum eigenvalue. The experiment in the last row is trained with no momentum (NM).
Table 2: ResNet-18, DenseNet-40, and MobileNetV2 models trained on non-normalized CIFAR-10 data with various regularizers. Numerical entries are given by m(±s), where m is the averageaccuracy over 10 runs, and s represents standard error.
