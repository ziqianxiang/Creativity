Table 1: Adversarial robustness on CIFAR-10 and SVHN datasets. Arob in the last column denotesthe empirical worst-case robustness among different attacks (columns) for each network optimizedby different training methods (row). The bold numbers indicate the best Arob robustness achieved onReLU and k-WTA networks by each training method.
