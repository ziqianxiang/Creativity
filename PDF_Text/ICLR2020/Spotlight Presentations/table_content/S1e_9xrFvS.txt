Table 1: Rotamer recovery of energy functions under the discrete rotamer sampling method detailed in Section4.2.1. Parentheses denote value reported by Leaver-Fay et al. (2013).
Table 2: Rotamer recovery of energy functions under continuous optimization schemes. Rosetta continuousoptimization is performed with the rtmin protocol. Parentheses denote value reported by Leaver-Fay et al.
Table 3: Comparison of rotamer recovery rates by amino acid between Rosetta and the ensembled energy-based model under discrete rotamer sampling. The model appears to perform well on polar amino acidsglutamine, serine, asparagine, and threonine, while Rosetta performs better on larger amino acids phenylala-nine, tyrosine, and tryptophan and the common amino acid, leucine. The numbers reported for Rosetta arefrom Leaver-Fay et al. (2013).
