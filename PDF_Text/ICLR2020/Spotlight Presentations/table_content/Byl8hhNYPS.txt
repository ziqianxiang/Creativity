Table 1: Results on EN-RO, EN-DE, and EN-FR for the NMT tasks. Trans. is short for transformer.
Table 2: Results from the test2016 and test2017 for the MMT task. Del denotes the deliberationnetwork in (Ive et al., 2019). Elliott et al. (2017) is the official baseline (text-only NMT) on WMT17-Multi30K 2017 test data. Trans. is short for transformer and MMT is the multimodal baselinedescribed in Section 5.2. Because we used the same model for test2016 and test2017 evaluation, thenumbers of parameters are the same.
