Table 1: Success rate results. The higher the better. NEXT-KS performs the best.
Table 2: Average number of collision checks results. The lower the better. The score is normalizedbased on the solution of RRT*. NEXT-KS performs the best in 3 benchmarks.
Table 3: Average cost of paths. The lower the better. The score is normalized based on the solution ofRRT* . The NEXT-KS achieves the best solutions.
Table 4: Success rates of different planners under varying time limits, the higher the better.
Table 5: Average path costs of different planners under varying time limits, the lower the better.
