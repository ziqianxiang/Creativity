Table 1: Comparison of zeroth order optimization for well-conditioned convex functions whereR = ∣∣χo - x*k and F = f(xo) - f(x*). ’Monotone' column indicates the invariance undermonotone transformations (Definition 4). ‘k-Sparse’ and ‘k-Affine’ columns indicate that iterationcomplexity is poly(k, log(n)) when f(x) depends only on a k-sparse subset of coordinates or on arank-k affine subspace.
Table 2: Final rewards by GLD with linear (L) and deep (H41) policies on Mujoco Benchmarks showthat GLD is competitive. We apply an affine projection on HalfCheetah to test affine invariance. Weuse the reward threshold found from (Mania et al., 2018) with Reacher’s threshold (Schulman et al.,2017) for a reasonable baseline.
