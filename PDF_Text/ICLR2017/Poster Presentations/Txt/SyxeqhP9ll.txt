Ab stract
In this paper we propose equipping GeneratiVe AdVersarial Networks with the
ability to produce direct energy estimates for samples. Specifically, we deVelop
a flexible adVersarial training framework, and proVe this framework not only en-
sures the generator conVerges to the true data distribution, but also enables the
discriminator to retain the density information at the global optimum. We deriVe
the analytic form of the induced solution, and analyze its properties. In order to
make the proposed framework trainable in practice, we introduce two effectiVe
approximation techniques. Empirically, the experiment results closely match our
theoretical analysis, Verifying that the discriminator is able to recoVer the energy
of data distribution.
1	Introduction
GeneratiVe AdVersarial Networks (GANs) (Goodfellow et al., 2014) represent an important mile-
stone on the path towards more effectiVe generatiVe models. GANs cast generatiVe model training
as a minimax game between a generatiVe network (generator), which maps a random Vector into the
data space, and a discriminatiVe network (discriminator), whose objectiVe is to distinguish gener-
ated samples from real samples. Multiple researchers Radford et al. (2015); Salimans et al. (2016);
Zhao et al. (2016) haVe shown that the adVersarial interaction with the discriminator can result in a
generator that produces compelling samples. The empirical successes of the GAN framework were
also supported by the theoretical analysis of Goodfellow et al., who showed that, under certain con-
ditions, the distribution produced by the generator conVerges to the true data distribution, while the
discriminator conVerges to a degenerate uniform solution.
While GANs haVe excelled as compelling sample generators, their use as general purpose probabilis-
tic generatiVe models has been limited by the difficulty in using them to proVide density estimates
or eVen unnormalized energy Values for sample eValuation.
It is tempting to consider the GAN discriminator as a candidate for proViding this sort of scoring
function. Conceptually, it is a trainable sample evaluation mechanism that - owing to GAN train-
ing paradigm - could be closely calibrated to the distribution modeled by the generator. If the
discriminator could retain fine-grained information of the relative quality of samples, measured for
instance by probability density or unnormalized energy, it could be used as an evaluation metric.
Such data-driven evaluators would be highly desirable for problems where it is difficult to define
evaluation criteria that correlate well with human judgment. Indeed, the real-valued discriminator
of the recently introduced energy-based GANs Zhao et al. (2016) might seem like an ideal candidate
energy function. Unfortunately, as we will show, the degenerate fate of the GAN discriminator at
the optimum equally afflicts the energy-based GAN of Zhao et al..
In this paper we consider the questions: (i) does there exists an adversarial framework that induces
a non-degenerate discriminator, and (ii) if so, what form will the resulting discriminator take? We
introduce a novel adversarial learning formulation, which leads to a non-degenerate discriminator
while ensuring the generator distribution matches the data distribution at the global optimum. We
derive a general analytic form of the optimal discriminator, and discuss its properties and their

relationship to the specific form of the training objective. We also discuss the connection between
the proposed formulation and existing alternatives such as the approach of Kim & Bengio (2016).
Finally, for a specific instantiation of the general formulation, we investigate two approximation
techniques to optimize the training objective, and verify our results empirically.
2	Related Work
Following a similar motivation, the field of Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) (Ng & Russell,
2000) has been exploring ways to recover the “intrinsic” reward function (analogous to the discrim-
inator) from observed expert trajectories (real samples). Taking this idea one step further, appren-
ticeship learning or imitation learning (Abbeel & Ng, 2004; Ziebart et al., 2008) aims at learning a
policy (analogous to the generator) using the reward signals recovered by IRL. Notably, Ho & Er-
mon draw a connection between imitation learning and GAN by showing that the GAN formulation
can be derived by imposing a specific regularization on the reward function. Also, under a special
case of their formulation, Ho & Ermon provide a duality-based interpretation of the problem, which
inspires our theoretical analysis. However, as the focus of (Ho & Ermon, 2016) is only on the policy,
the authors explicitly propose to bypass the intermediate IRL step, and thus provide no analysis of
the learned reward function.
The GAN models most closely related to our proposed framework are energy-based GAN models of
Zhao et al. (2016) and Kim & Bengio (2016). In the next section, We show how one can derive both
of these approaches from different assumptions regarding regularization of the generative model.
3	Alternative Formulation of Adversarial Training
3.1	Background
Before presenting the proposed formulation, we first state some basic assumptions required by the
analysis, and introduce notations used throughout the paper.
Following the original work on GANs (Goodfellow et al., 2014), our analysis focuses on the non-
parametric case, where all models are assumed to have infinite capacities. While many of the non-
parametric intuitions can directly transfer to the parametric case, we will point out cases where this
transfer fails. We assume a finite data space throughout the analysis, to avoid technical machinery
out of the scope of this paper. Our results, however, can be extended to continuous data spaces, and
our experiments are indeed performed on continuous data.
Let X be the data space under consideration, and P = {p | p(x) ≥ 0, ∀x ∈ X , Px∈X p(x) = 1}
be the set of all proper distributions defined on X . Then, pdata ∈ P : X 7→ R and pgen ∈ P :
X → R will denote the true data distribution and the generator distribution. Ex〜P f (x) denotes the
expectation of the quantity f(x) w.r.t. x drawn from p. Finally, the term “discriminator” will refer
to any structure that provides training signals to the generator based on some measure of difference
between the generator distribution and the real data distribution, which which includes but is not
limited to f -divergence.
3.2	Proposed Formulation
In order to understand the motivation of the proposed approach, it is helpful to analyze the optimiza-
tion dynamics near convergence in GANs first.
When the generator distribution matches the data distribution, the training signal (gradient) w.r.t.
the discriminator vanishes. At this point, assume the discriminator still retains density information,
and views some samples as more real and others as less. This discriminator will produce a training
signal (gradient) w.r.t. the generator, pushing the generator to generate samples that appear more
real to the discriminator. Critically, this training signal is the sole driver of the generator’s training.
Hence, the generator distribution will diverge from the data distribution. In other words, as long as
the discriminator retains relative density information, the generator distribution cannot stably match
the data distribution. Thus, in order to keep the generator stationary as the data distribution, the
discriminator must assign flat (exactly the same) density to all samples at the optimal.
2
Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2017
From the analysis above, the fundamental difficulty is that the generator only receives a single train-
ing signal (gradient) from the discriminator, which it has to follow. To keep the generator stationary,
this single training signal (gradient) must vanish, which requires a degenerate discriminator. In this
work, we propose to tackle this single training signal constraint directly. Specifically, we intro-
duce a novel adversarial learning formulation which incorporates an additional training signal to the
generator, such that this additional signal can
•	balance (cancel out) the discriminator signal at the optimum, so that the generator can stay
stationary even if the discriminator assigns non-flat density to samples
•	cooperate with the discriminator signal to make sure the generator converges to the data
distribution, and the discriminator retains the correct relative density information
The proposed formulation can be written as the following minimax training objective,
max min E	c(x) - E	c(x) + K (pgen),	(1)
c pgen ∈P	X 〜Pgen	x~pdata
where c(x) : X 7→ R is the discriminator that assigns each data point an unbounded scalar cost, and
K(pgen) : P 7→ R is some (functionally) differentiable, convex function of pgen. Compared to the
original GAN, despite the similar minimax surface form, the proposed fomulation has two crucial
distinctions.
Firstly, while the GAN discriminator tries to distinguish “fake” samples from real ones using binary
classification, the proposed discriminator achieves that by assigning lower cost to real samples and
higher cost to “fake” one. This distinction can be seen from the first two terms of Eqn. (1), where
the discriminator c(x) is trained to widen the expected cost gap between “fake” and real samples,
while the generator is adversarially trained to minimize it. In addition to the different adversarial
mechanism, a calibrating term K (pgen) is introduced to provide a countervailing source of training
signal for pgen as we motivated above. For now, the form of K(pgen) has not been specified. But as
We will see later, its choice will directly decide the form of the optimal discriminator C (x).
With the specific optimization objective, we next provide theoretical characterization of both the
generator and the discriminator at the global optimum.
Define L(pgen, c)
=Ex 〜Pgen [c(x)] — Ex〜PdataIc(x) + K(Pgen), then L(Pgen, c) is theLagrange dual
function of the following optimization problem
min	K(Pgen)
Pgen∈P	(2)
s	.t. Pgen(x) - Pdata (x) = 0, ∀x ∈ X
where c(x), ∀x appears in L(Pgen, c) as the dual variables introduced for the equality constraints.
This duality relationship has been observed previously in (Ho & Ermon, 2016, equation (7)) under
the adversarial imitation learning setting. However, in their case, the focus was fully on the generator
side (induced policy), and no analysis was provided for the discriminator (reward function).
In order to characterize c*, we first expand the set constraint on Pgen into explicit equality and
inequality constraints:
min K(Pgen)
Pgen
s	.t. Pgen (x) - Pdata(x) = 0, ∀x
- Pgen(x) ≤ 0, ∀x	(3)
Pgen(x) - 1 = 0.
x∈X
Notice that K(Pgen) is a convex function ofPgen(x) by definition, and both the equality and inequality
constraints are affine functions of Pgen(x). Thus, problem (2) is a convex optimization problem.
What’s more, since (i) domK is open, and (ii) there exists a feasible solution Pgen = Pdata to (3), by
the refined Slater’s condition (Boyd & Vandenberghe, 2004, page 226), we can further verify that
strong duality holds for (3). With strong duality, a typical approach to characterizing the optimal
solution is to apply the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, which gives rise to this theorem:
3
Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2017
Proposition 3.1. By the KKT conditions of the convex problem (3), at the global optimum, the
optimal generator distribution Pɪen matches the true data distribution Pdata, and the optimal discrim-
inator c*(x) has thefollowing form:
c*(x) = - dK (P gen)	- λ* + μ*(χ), Vx ∈X,
∂Pgen(x) pgen=pdata
where
0,	Pdata(x) > 0
ux ,	Pdata (x) = 0
(4)
λ* ∈ R, is an under-determined real number independent of x,
ux ∈ R+, is an under-determined non-negative real number.
The detailed proof of proposition 3.1 is provided in appendix A.1. From (4), we can see the exact
form of the optimal discriminator depends on the term K(Pgen), or more specifically its gradient.
But, before We instantiate K(Pgen) With specific choices and show the corresponding forms of C (x),
We first discuss some general properties of C (x) that do not depend on the choice of K.
Weak Support Discriminator. As part of the optimal discriminator function, the term μ*(x)
plays the role of support discriminator. That is, it tries to distinguish the support of the data
distribution, i.e. S UPP(Pdata) = {x ∈ X | Pdata(x) > 0}, from its complement set With zero-
probability, i.e. SUPP(Pdata){ = {x ∈ X | Pdata(x) = 0}. Specifically, for any x ∈ S UPP(Pdata)
and x0 ∈ SUPP(Pdata){, it is guaranteed that μ*(x) ≤ μ*(x0). However, because μ*(∙) is under-
determined, there is nothing preventing the inequality from degenerating into an equality. Therefore,
we name it the weak support discriminator. But, in all cases, μ*(∙) assigns zero cost to all data points
Within the support. As a result, it does not possess any fine-grained density information inside of the
data support. It is worth pointing out that, in the parametric case, because of the smoothness and the
generalization properties of the parametric model, the learned discriminator may generalize beyond
the data support.
Global Bias. In (4), the term λ* is a scalar value shared for all x. As a result, it does not affect the
relative cost among data points, and only serves as a global bias for the discriminator function.
Having discussed general properties, we now consider some specific cases of the convex function
K, and analyze the resulting optimal discriminator C (x) in detail.
1. First, let us consider the case where K is the negative entropy of the generator distribution, i.e.
K (Pgen) = -H(Pgen). Taking the derivative of the negative entropy w.r.t. Pgen(x), we have
Ce∏t(x) = — logPdata(x) — 1 一 λ* + μ*(x),∀x ∈ X,	(5)
where μ* (x) and λ* have the same definitions as in (4).
Up to a constant, this form of c*∏1(x) is exactly the energy function of the data distribution
Pdata(x). This elegant result has deep connections to several existing formulations, which include
max-entropy imitation learning (Ziebart et al., 2008) and the directed-generator-trained energy-
based model (Kim & Bengio, 2016). The core difference is that these previous formulations
are originally derived from maximum-likelihood estimation, and thus the minimax optimization
is only implicit. In contrast, with an explicit minimax formulation we can develop a better
understanding of the induced solution. For example, the global bias λ* suggests that there exists
more than one stable equilibrium the optimal discriminator can actually reach. Further, μ*(x)
can be understood as a support discriminator that poses extra cost on generator samples which
fall in zero-probability regions of data space.
2. When K(Pgen) = 2 Pχ∈χ Pgen(X)1 2 = 2 IlPgen∣H, which Can be understood as posing '2 regular-
ization on Pgen, we have IKg⅛)) Ln=Pdata = Pdata(X), and it follows
c；2 (x) = -Pdata(x) - λ* + μ*(x), Vx ∈ X,	(6)
with μ* (x), λ* similarly defined as in (4).
Surprisingly, the result suggests that the optimal discriminator % (x) directly recovers the neg-
ative probability -Pdata(x), shifted by a constant. Thus, similar to the entropy solution (5), it
fully retains the relative density information of data points within the support.
4
Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2017
However, because of the under-determined term μ* (x), We cannot recover the distribution den-
sity Pdata exactly from either % or c*nt if the data support is finite. Whether this ambiguity can
be resolved is beyond the scope of this paper, but poses an interesting research problem.
3	. Finally, let’s consider consider a degenerate case, where K(pgen) is a constant. That is, we dont
provide any additional training signal for pgen at all. With K(pgen) = const, we simply have
4St(X) = λ* + μ*(x),∀x ∈ X,	(7)
whose discriminative power is fully controlled by the weak support discriminator μ* (x). Thus,
it follows that CIt(X) won,t be able to discriminate data points within the support of pdata, and
its power to distinguish data from S UPP(pdata) and SUPP(pdata){ is weak. This closely matches
the intuitive argument in the beginning of this section.
Note that when K (pgen) is a constant, the objective function (1) simplifies to:
max min E	c(X) - E	c(X),	(8)
c pgen∈P	X 〜Pgen	X ~pdata
which is very similar to the EBGAN objective (Zhao et al., 2016, equation (2) and (4)). As
we show in appendix A.2, compared to the objective in (8), the EBGAN objective puts extra
constraints on the allowed discriminator function. In spite of that, the EBGAN objective suf-
fers from the single-training-signal problem and does not guarantee that the discriminator will
recover the real energy function (see appendix A.2 for detailed analysis).
As we finish the theoretical analysis of the proposed formulation, we want to point out that simply
adding the same term K(pgen) to the original GAN formulation will not lead to both a generator that
matches the data distribution, and a discriminator that retains the density information (see appendix
A.3 for detailed analysis).
4	Parametric Instantiation with Entropy Approximation
While the discussion in previous sections focused on the non-parametric case, in practice we are lim-
ited to a finite amount of data, and the actual problem involves high dimensional continuous spaces.
Thus, we resort to parametric representations for both the generator and the discriminator. In order
to train the generator using standard back-propagation, we do not parametrize the generator distri-
bution directly. Instead, we parametrize a directed generator network that transforms random noise
Z 〜pz(z) to samples from a continuous data space Rn. Consequently, we don,t have analytical ac-
cess to the generator distribution, which is defined implicitly by the generator network’s noise→data
mapping. However, the regularization term K (pgen) in the training objective (1) requires the gen-
erator distribution. Faced with this problem, we focus on the max-entropy formulation, and exploit
two different approximations of the regularization term K(pgen) = -H(pgen).
4.1	Nearest-Neighbor Entropy Gradient Approximation
The first proposed solution is built upon an intuitive interpretation of the entropy gradient. Firstly,
since we construct pgen by applying a deterministic, differentiable transform gθ to samples z from a
fixed distribution pz, we can write the gradient of H(pgen) with respect to the generator parameters
θ as follows:
∂gθ(z) ∂logpgen(gθ(z))
一 VθH(Pgen) = Ez~pz [▽6 logpgen(gθ(z))] = Ez~pz -∂θ	jg (Z)	,	(9)
where the first equality relies on the “reparametrization trick”. Equation 9 implies that, if we can
compute the gradient of the generator log-density log Pgen (X) w.r.t. any X = gθ(Z), then we can
directly construct the Monte-Carlo estimation of the entropy gradient VθH(Pgen) using samples
from the generator.
Intuitively, for any generated data X = gθ(z), the term d log∂Xen(x) essentially describes the direction
of local change in the sample space that will increase the log-density. Motivated by this intuition,
we propose to form a local Gaussian approximation Pigen of Pgen around each point Xi in a batch of
samples {χι,...,Xn} from the generator, and then compute the gradient dlog∂gen(Xi) based on the
5

Gaussian approximation. Specifically, each local Gaussian approximation pigen is formed by finding
the k nearest neighbors ofxi in the batch {x1, ..., xn}, and then placing an isotropic Gaussian distri-
bution at their mean (i.e. maximimum likelihood). Based on the isotropic Gaussian approximation,
the resulting gradient has the following form
∂ log Pgen(Xi)
∂Xi
≈ μi - Xi,
where μi
X0 is the mean of the Gaussian
(10)
x0∈KNN(xi)

Σ
Finally, note the scale of this gradient approximation may not be reliable. To fix this problem, we
normalize the approximated gradient into unit norm, and use a single hyper-parameter to model the
scale for all X, leading to the following entropy gradient approximation
1 L	μi - xi
-vθH(Pgen) ≈ αk 2 ∖kμτ-XΓ2
xi=gθ(zi)
(11)
where α is the hyper-parameter and μ% is defined as in equation (10).
An obvious weakness of this approximation is that it relies on Euclidean distance to find the k nearest
neighbors. However, Euclidean distance is usually not the proper metric to use when the effective
dimension is very high. As the problem is highly challenging, we leave it for future work.
4.2 Variational Lower bound on the Entropy
Another approach we consider relies on defining and maximizing a variational lower bound on the
entropy H(Pgen(X)) of the generator distribution. We can define the joint distribution over observed
data and the noise variables as Pgen(X, z) = Pgen(X | z)Pgen(z), where simply Pgen(z) = Pz(z) is a
fixed prior. Using the joint, we can also define the marginal Pgen(X) and the posterior Pgen(z | X).
We can also write the mutual information between the observed data and noise variables as:
I (Pgen (X); Pgen(z)) = H (Pgen (X)) - H (Pgen (X | z))
= H (Pgen (z)) - H (Pgen (z | X)),
(12)
where H(Pgen(. | .)) denotes the conditional entropy. By reorganizing terms in this definition, we
can write the entropy H(Pgen(X)) as:
H (Pgen (X)) = H (Pgen (z)) - H (Pgen (z | X)) + H (Pgen (X | z))	(13)
We can think of Pgen(X | z) as a peaked Gaussian with a fixed, diagonal covariance, and hence its
conditional entropy is constant and can be dropped. Furthermore, H(Pgen(z)) is also assumed to be
fixed a priori. Hence, we can maximize H(Pgen(X)) by minimizing the conditional entropy:
H(Pgen(Z | x)) = Ex〜Pgen(X) [Ez〜Pgen(Z|x) [- logPgen(Z | x)]]	(14)
Optimizing this term is still problematic, because (i) we do not have access to the posterior
Pgen(Z | X), and (ii) we cannot sample from it. Therefore, we instead minimize a variational up-
per bound defined by an approximate posterior qgen(Z | X):
H(Pgen(Z | X)) = Ex〜Pgen(x) [Ez〜Pgen(Z|x) [- log 9gen(Z | X)] — KL(Pgen(Z | X)IIqgen(Z | X))]
≤ Ex~Pgen(x) [EZ~Pgen(z| x) [- log qgen(Z । x)]]	(15)
= U (qgen).
We can also rewrite the variational upper bound as:
U(qgen) = Ex,z~pgen(x,z) [- log qgen(Z | x)] = Ez~pgen(z) [Ex-Pgen(x∣z) [- log qgen(Z | x)]] ,	(16)
which can be optimized efficiently with standard back-propagation and Monte Carlo integration of
the relevant expectations based on independent samples drawn from the joint Pgen(X, Z). By mini-
mizing this upper bound on the conditional entropy H(Pgen(Z | X)), we are effectively maximizing
a variational lower bound on the entropy H(Pgen(X)).

5	Experiments
In this section, we verify our theoretical results empirically on several synthetic and real datasets. In
particular, we evaluate whether the discriminator obtained from the entropy-regularized adversarial
training can capture the density information (in the form of energy), while making sure the generator
distribution matches the data distribution. For convenience, we refer to the obtained models as
EGAN-Ent. Our experimental setting follows closely recommendations from Radford et al. (2015),
except in Sec. 5.1 where we use fully-connected models (see appendix B.1 for details). 1
5.1	Synthetic low-dimensional data
First, we consider three synthetic datasets in 2-dimensional space, which are drawn from the fol-
lowing distributions: (i) Mixture of 4 Gaussians with equal mixture weights, (ii) Mixture of 200
Gaussians arranged as two spirals (100 components each spiral), and (iii) Mixture of 2 Gaussians
with highly biased mixture weights, P (c1) = 0.9, P (c2) = 0.1. We visualize the ground-truth
energy of these distributions along with 100K training samples in Figure 1. Since the data lies in
2-dimensional space, we can easily visualize both the learned generator (by drawing samples) and
the discriminator for direct comparison and evaluation. We evaluate here our EGAN-Ent model
using both approximations: the nearest-neighbor based approximation (EGAN-Ent-NN) and the
variational-inference based approximation (EGAN-Ent-VI), and compare them with two baselines:
the original GAN and the energy based GAN with no regularization (EGAN-Const).
Experiment results are summarized in Figure 2 for baseline models, and Figure 3 for the proposed
models. As we can see, all four models can generate perfect samples. However, for the discrimi-
nator, both GAN and EGAN-Const lead to degenerate solution, assigning flat energy inside the em-
pirical data support. In comparison, EGAN-Ent-VI and EGAN-Ent-NN clearly capture the density
information, though to different degrees. Specifically, on the equally weighted Gaussian mixture
and the two-spiral mixture datasets, EGAN-Ent-NN tends to give more accurate and fine-grained
solutions compared to EGAN-Ent-VI. However, on the biased weighted Gaussian mixture dataset,
EGAN-Ent-VI actually fails to captures the correct mixture weights of the two modes, incorrectly
assigning lower energy to the mode with lower probability (smaller weight). In contrast, EGAN-
Ent-NN perfectly captures the bias in mixture weight, and obtains a contour very close to the ground
truth.
To better quantify these differences, we present detailed comparison based on KL divergence in
appendix B.2. What’s more, the performance difference between EGAN-Ent-VI and EGAN-Ent-NN
on biased Gaussian mixture reveals the limitations of the variational inference based approximation,
i.e. providing inaccurate gradients. Due to space consideratiosn, we refer interested readers to the
appendix B.3 for a detailed discussion.
5.2	Ranking NIST digits
In this experiment, we verify that the results in synthetic datasets can translate into data with higher
dimensions. While visualizing the learned energy function is not feasible in high-dimensional space,
we can verify whether the learned energy function learns relative densities by inspecting the ranking
of samples according to their assigned energies. We train on 28 × 28 images of a single handwritten

digit from the NIST dataset. 2 We compare the ability of EGAN-Ent-NN with both EGAN-Const
and GAN on ranking a set of 1,000 images, half of which are generated samples and the rest are real
test images. Figures 4 and 5 show the top-100 and bottom-100 ranked images respectively for each
model, after training them on digit 1. We also show in Figure 7 the mean of all training samples,
so we can get a sense of what is the most common style (highest density) of digit 1 in NIST. We
can notice that all of the top-ranked images by EGAN-Ent-NN look similar to the mean sample.
In addition, the lowest-ranked images are clearly different from the mean image, with either high
(clockwise or counter-clockwise) rotation degrees from the mean, or an extreme thickness level. We
do not see such clear distinction in other models. We provide in the appendix B.4 the ranking of the
full set of images.
5.3 Sample quality on natural image datasets
In this last set of experiments, we evaluate the visual quality of samples generated by our model
in two datasets of natural images, namely CIFAR-10 and CelebA. We employ here the variational-
based approximation for entropy regularization, which can scale well to high-dimensional data.
Figure 6 shows samples generated by EGAN-Ent-VI. We can see that despite the noisy gradients
provided by the variational approximation, our model is able to generate high-quality samples.

We futher validate the quality of our model’s samples on CIFAR-10 using the Inception score pro-
posed by (Salimans et al., 2016) 3. Table 1 shows the scores of our EGAN-Ent-VI, the best GAN
model from Salimans et al. (2016) which uses only unlabeled data, and an EGAN-Const model
which has the same architecture as our model. We notice that even without employing suggested
techniques in Salimans et al. (2016), energy-based models perform quite similarly to the GAN
model. Furthermore, the fact that our model scores higher than EGAN-Const highlights the im-
portance of entropy regularization in obtaining good quality samples.
6	Conclusion
In this paper we have addressed a fundamental limitation in adversarial learning approaches, which
is their inability of providing sensible energy estimates for samples. We proposed a novel adversarial
learning formulation which results in a discriminator function that recovers the true data energy. We
provided a rigorous characterization of the learned discriminator in the non-parametric setting, and
proposed two methods for instantiating it in the typical parametric setting. Our experimental results
verify our theoretical analysis about the discriminator properties, and show that we can also obtain
samples of state-of-the-art quality.

A.1 Optimal discriminator form under the proposed formulation
Proof of proposition 3.1. Refining the Lagrange L(pgen, c) by introducing additional dual variables
for the probability constraints (the second and third), the new Lagrange function has the form
L(Pgen, c, μ, λ) = K(Pgen)+ X C(X) (Pgen(X)-Pdata(X)) - X μ(X)Pgen(X) + λ( X Pgen(X)- I)
x∈X	x∈X	x∈X
(17)
where C(X) ∈ R, ∀x, n(x) ∈ R+, ∀x, and λ ∈ R are the dual variables. The KKT conditions for the
optimal primal and dual variables are as follows
∂K (Pgen)
∂Pgen(X)
+ c*(x) — μ*(∕) + λ* = 0,
pgen =pdata
∀X
〃*(X)P(en (X)= 0,	∀x
M*(x) ≥ 0,	∀x
Pgen(X) ≥ 0,	Pgen(X)= Pdata(X),	∀x
Pgen(X) = 1
x∈X
(stationarity)
(complement slackness)
(dual feasibility)
(primal feasibility)
(primal feasibility)
(18)
Rearranging the conditions above, We getPgen(X) = Pdata(x), ∀x ∈ X as well as equation (4), which
concludes the proof.	□
A.2 Optimal conditions of EBGAN
In (Zhao et al., 2016), the training objectives of the generator and the discriminator cannot be written
as a single minimax optimization problem since the margin structure is only applied to the objective
of the discriminator. In addition, the discriminator is designed to produce the mean squared recon-
struction error of an auto-encoder structure. This restricted the range of the discriminator output
to be non-negative, which is equivalent to posing a set constraint on the discriminator under the
non-parametric setting.
Thus, to characterize the optimal generator and discriminator, we adapt the same analyzing logic
used in the proof sketch of the original GAN (Goodfellow et al., 2014). Specifically, given a spe-
cific generator distribution Pgen, the optimal discriminator function given the generator distribution
c*(x; Pgen) can be derived by examining the objective of the discriminator. Then, the conditional
optimal discriminator function is substituted into the training objective of Pgen, simplifying the “ad-
versarial” training as a minimizing problem only w.r.t. Pgen, which can be well analyzed.
Firstly, given any generator distribution Pgen, the EBGAN training objective for the discriminator
can be written as the following form
c*(x; Pgen) = arg max
c∈C
= arg max
c∈C
- E max(0, m - C(X)) - E C(X)
pgen	pdata
E min(0, C(X) - m) - E C(X)
pgen	pdata
(19)
where C = {C : C(X) ≥ 0, ∀X ∈ X} is the set of allowed non-negative discriminator functions. Note
this set constraint comes from the fact the mean squared reconstruction error as discussed above.
Since the problem (19) is independent w.r.t. each X, the optimal solution can be easily derived as
c*(x; Pgen)
0,	Pgen(X) < Pdata(X)
m,	Pgen (X) > Pdata (X)
αx ,	Pgen (X) = Pdata (X) > 0
βx,	Pgen (X) = Pdata (X) = 0
(20)
where αx ∈ [0, m] is an under-determined number, a βx ∈ [0, ∞) is another under-determined non-
negative real number, and the subscripts in m, αx , βx reflect that fact that these under-determined
values can be distinct for different X.
11
Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2017
This way, the overall training objective can be cast into a minimization problem w.r.t. pgen,
Poen = arg min E c*(x; Pgen) - E	c*(x; Pgen)
Pgen∈P X 〜Pgen	X 〜Pdata
= arg min X Pgen (x) - Pdata (x) c (x; Pgen )
Pgen∈P X∈X
(21)
where the second term of the first line is implicitly defined as the problem is an adversarial game
between Pgen and c.
Proposition A.1. The global optimal of the EBGAN training objective is achieved if and only if
Pgen = Pdata. At that point, co (x) is fully under-determined.
Proof. The proof is established by showing contradiction.
Firstly, assume the optimal Pgoen 6= Pdata. Thus, there must exist a non-equal set X6= = {x | Pdata(x) 6=
Pgoen(x)}, which can be further splitted into two subsets, the greater-than set X> = {x | Pgoen(x) >
Pdata(x)}, and the less-than set X< = {x | Pgoen(x) < Pdata(x)}. Similarly, we define the equal set
X= = {x : Pgoen(x) = Pdata(x)}. Obviously, X> S X< S X= = X .
Let L(Pgen) = PX∈X Pg
en(x) - Pdata(x) co (x; Pgen), substituting the results from equation (20)
into (21), the L(Pgen)o can be written as
L(Pgoen) =	X	Pgoen(x) - Pdata(x)co (x; Pgoen)
X∈X< SX< SX=
=	Pgoen(x) -Pdata(x) co(x;Pgoen) +	Pgoen(x) -Pdata(x) co (x; Pgoen)
X∈X<	X∈X>	(22)
= m	Pgoen(x) - Pdata(x)
X∈X>
>0
However, when P0gen = Pdata, we have
L(P0gen) = 0 < L(Pgoen)	(23)
which contradicts the optimal (miminum) assumption of Pgoen. Hence, the contradiction concludes
that at the global optimal, Pgoen = Pdata. By equation (20), it directly follows that co (x; Pgoen) = αX,
which completes the proof.	□
A.3 Analysis of adding additional training signal to GAN formulation
To show that simply adding the same training signal to GAN will not lead to the same result, it is
more convenient to directly work with the formulation of f -GAN (Nowozin et al., 2016, equation
(6)) family, which include the original GAN formulation as a special case.
Specifically, the general f -GAN formulation takes the following form
max min E	f? (c(x)) - E	c(x),	(24)
C Pgen ∈P	X 〜Pgen	X 〜PdataI
where the f?(∙) denotes the convex conjugate (Boyd & Vandenberghe, 2004) of the f-divergence
function. The optimal condition of the discriminator can be found by taking the variation w.r.t. c,
which gives the optimal discriminator
o	0 Pdata(x)
C(X) = f (------F)
Pgen(x)
(25)
where f0(∙) is the first-order derivative of f (∙). Note that, even when We add an extra term L(Pgen)
to equation (24), since the term K (Pgen) is a constant w.r.t. the discriminator, it does not change the
result given by equation (25) about the optimal discriminator. As a consequence, for the optimal
12
Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2017
discriminator to retain the density information, it effectively means pgen 6= pdata. Hence, there will
be a contradiction if both c*(x) retains the density information, and the generator matches the data
distribution.
Intuitively, this problem roots in the fact that f -divergence is quite “rigid” in the sense that given the
pgen(x) it only allows one fixed point for the discriminator. In comparison, the divergence used in our
proposed formulation, which is the expected cost gap, is much more flexible. By the expected cost
gap itself, i.e. without the K(pgen) term, the optimal discriminator is actually under-determined.
B S upplementary Materials for section 5
B.1 Experiment setting
Here, we specify the neural architectures used for experiements presented in Section 5.
Firstly, for the Egan-Ent-VI model, we parameterize the approximate posterior distribution qgen(z |
x) with a diagonal Gaussian distribution, whose mean and covariance matrix are the output of a
trainable inference network, i.e.
qgen(z | X)= N(μ,Iσ? )
μ, log σ = f infer(x)
(26)
where f infer denotes the inference network, and I is the identity matrix. Note that the Inference
Network only appears in the Egan-Ent-VI model.
For experiments with the synthetic datasets, the following fully-connected feed forward neural net-
works are employed
• Generator: FC(4,128)-BN-ReLU-FC(128,128)-BN-ReLU-FC(128,2)
• Discriminator: FC(2,128)-ReLU-FC(128,128)-ReLU-FC(128,1)
•	Inference Net: FC(2,128)-ReLU-FC(128,128)-ReLU-FC(128,4*2)
where FC and BN denote fully-connected layer and batch normalization layer respectively. Note that
since the input noise to the generator has dimension 4, the Inference Net output has dimension 4*2,
where the first 4 elements correspond the inferred mean, and the last 4 elements correspond to the
inferred diagonal covariance matrix in log scale.
For the handwritten digit experiment, we closely follow the DCGAN (Radford et al., 2015) archi-
tecture with the following configuration
•	Generator: FC(10,512*7*7)-BN-ReLU-DC(512,256;4c2s)-BN-ReLU
-DC(256,128;4c2s)-BN-ReLU-DC(128,1;3c1s)-Sigmoid
•	Discriminator: CV(1,64;3c1s)-BN-LRec-CV(64,128;4c2s)-BN-LRec
-CV(128,256;4c2s)-BN-LRec-FC(256*7*7,1)
•	Inference Net: CV(1,64;3c1s)-BN-LRec-CV(64,128;4c2s)-BN-LRec
-CV(128,256;4c2s)-BN-LRec-FC(256*7*7,10*2)
Here, LRec is the leaky rectified non-linearity recommended by Radford et al. (2015). In addition,
CV(128,256,4c2s) denotes a convolutional layer with 128 input channels, 256 output channels,
and kernel size 4 with stride 2. Similarly, DC(256,128,4c2s) denotes a corresponding trans-
posed convolutional operation. Compared to the original DCGAN architecture, the discriminator
under our formulation does not have the last sigmoid layer which squashes a scalar value into a
probability in [0, 1].
For celebA experiment with 64 × 64 color images, we use the following architecture
•	Generator: FC(10,512*4*4)-BN-ReLU-DC(512,256;4c2s)-BN-ReLU-DC(256,128;4c2s)
-BN-ReLU-DC(256,128;4c2s)-BN-ReLU-DC(128,3;4c2s)-Tanh
•	Discriminator: CV(3,64;4c2s)-BN-LRec-CV(64,128;4c2s)-BN-LRec-CV(128,256;4c2s)
-BN-LRec-CV(256,256;4c2s)-BN-LRec-FC(256*4*4,1)
•	Inference Net: CV(3,64;4c2s)-BN-LRec-CV(64,128;4c2s)-BN-LRec-CV(128,256;4c2s)
-BN-LRec-CV(256,256;4c2s)-BN-LRec-FC(256*4*4,10*2)

For Cifar10 experiment, where the image size is 32 × 32, similar architecture is used
• Generator: FC(10,512*4*4)-BN-ReLU-DC(512,256;4c2s)-BN-ReLU-DC(256,128;3c1s)
-BN-ReLU-DC(256,128;4c2s)-BN-ReLU-DC(128,3;4c2s)-Tanh
• Discriminator: CV(3,64;3c1s)-BN-LRec-CV(64,128;4c2s)-BN-LRec-CV(128,256;4c2s)
-BN-LRec-CV(256,256;4c2s)-BN-LRec-FC(256*4*4,1)
• Inference Net: CV(3,64;3c1s)-BN-LRec-CV(64,128;4c2s)-BN-LRec-CV(128,256;4c2s)
-BN-LRec-CV(256,256;4c2s)-BN-LRec-FC(256*4*4,10*2)
Given the chosen architectures, we follow Radford et al. (2015) and use Adam as the optimization
algorithm. For more detailed hyper-parameters, please refer to the code.

Table 2: Pairwise KL divergence between distributions. Bold face indicate the lowest divergence
within group.
In order to quantify the quality of recovered distributions, we compute the pairwise KL divergence
of the following four distributions:
•	The real data distribution with analytic form, denoted as pdata
•	The empirical data distribution approximated from the 100K training data, denoted as pemp
•	The generator distribution approximated from 100K generated data, denoted as pgen
•	The discriminator distribution re-normalized from the learned energy, denoted as pdisc
Since the synthetic datasets are two dimensional, we approximate both the empirical data distribu-
tion and the generator distribution using the simple histogram estimation. Specifically, we divide the
canvas into a 100-by-100 grid, and assign each sample into its nearest grid cell based on euclidean
distance. Then, we normalize the number of samples in each cell into a proper distribution. When
recovering the discriminator distribution from the learned energy, We assume that μ*(χ) = 0 (i.e.
infinite data support), and discretize the distribution into the same grid cells
pdisc(x)
exp(-c*(x))
Pχ0∈Grid exP(-c* (XO)) ,
∀x ∈ Grid
Based on these approximation, Table 2 summarizes the results. For all measures related to the
discriminator distribution, EGAN-Ent-VI and EGAN-Ent-NN significantly outperform the other tWo
baseline models, Which matches our visual assessment in Figure 2 and 3. MeanWhile, the generator
distributions learned from our proposed frameWork also achieve relatively loWer divergence to both
the empirical data distribution and the true data distribution.

B.3	Comparison of the entropy (gradient) approximation methods
In order to understand the performance difference between EGAN-Ent-VI and EGAN-Ent-NN, we
analyze the quality of the entropy gradient approximation during training. To do that, we visualize
some detailed training information in Figure 8.
(a) Training details under variational inference entropy approximation
(b) Training details under nearest neighbor entropy approximation
Figure 8: For convenience, we will use Fig. (i,j) to refer to the subplot in row i, column j. Fig. (1,1):
current energy plot. Fig. (1,2): frequency map of generated samples in the current batch. Fig. (1,3):
frequency map of real samples in the current batch. Fig-(1,4): frequency difference between real
and generated samples. Fig. (2,1) comparison between more generated from current model and real
sample. Fig. (2,2): the discriminator gradient w.r.t. each training sample. Fig. (2,3): the entropy
gradient w.r.t. each training samples. Fig. (2,4): all gradient (discriminator + entropy) w.r.t. each
training sample.
As we can see in figure 8a, the viarational entropy gradient approximation w.r.t. samples is not
accurate:
• It is inaccurate in terms of gradient direction. Ideally, the direction of the entropy gradi-
ent should be pointing from the center of its closest mode towards the surroundings, with
15
Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2017
the direction orthogonal to the implicit contour in Fig. (1,2). However, the direction of
gradients in the Fig. (2,3) does not match this.
• It is inaccurate in magnitude. As we can see, the entropy approximation gradient (Fig.
(2,3)) has much larger norm than the discriminator gradient (Fig. (2,2)). As a result, the
total gradient (Fig. (2,4)) is fully dominated by the entropy approximation gradient. Thus,
it usually takes much longer for the generator to learn to generate rare samples, and the
training also proceeds much slower compared to the nearest neighbor based approximation.
In comparison, the nearest neighbor based gradient approximation is much more accurate as shown
in 8b. As a result, it leads to more accurate energy contour, as well as faster training. What’s more,
from Figure 8b Fig. (2,4), we can see the entropy gradient does have the cancel-out effect on the
discriminator gradient, which again matches our theory.
B.4	Ranking NIST Digits
Figure 9 shows the ranking of all 1000 generated and real images (from the test set) for three models:
EGAN-Ent-NN, EGAN-Const, and GAN. We can clearly notice that in EGAN-Ent-NN the top-
ranked digits look very similar to the mean digit. From the upper-left corner to the lower-right
corner, the transition trend is: the rotation degree increases, and the digits become increasingly thick
or thin compared to the mean. In addition, samples in the last few rows do diverge away from the
mean image: either highly diagonal to the right or left, or have different shape: very thin or thick, or
typewriter script. Other models are not able to achieve a similar clear distinction for high versus low
probability images. Finally, we consistently observe the same trend in modeling other digits, which
are not shown in this paper due to space constraint.
B.5	Classifier performance as a proxy measure
As mentioned in Section 5, evaluating the proposed formulation quantitatively on high-dimensional
data is extremely challenging. Here, in order to provide more quantitative intuitions on the learned
discriminator at convergence, we adopt a proxy measure. Specifically, we take the last-layer activa-
tion of the converged discriminator network as fixed pretrained feature, and build a linear classifier
upon it. Hypothetically, if the discriminator does not degenerate, the extracted last-layer feature
should maintain more information about the data points, especially compared to features from de-
generated discriminators. Following this idea, we first train EGAN-Ent-NN, EGAN-Const, and
GAN on the MNIST till convergence, and then extract the last-layer activation from their discrimi-
nator networks as fixed feature input. Based on fixed feature, a randomly initialized linear classifier
is trained to do classification on MNIST. Based on 10 runs (with different initialization) of each of
the three models, the test classification performance is summarized in Table 3. For comparison pur-
pose, we also include a baseline where the input features are extracted from a discriminator network
with random weights.
Test error (%)	EGAN-Ent-NN	EGAN-Const	GAN I Random	
Min	1.160	1.280	1.220	3.260
Mean	1.190	1.338	1.259	3.409
Std.	0.024	0.044	0.032	0.124
Table 3: Test performance of linear classifiers based on last-layer discriminator features.
Based on the proxy measure, EGAN-Ent-NN seems to maintain more information of data, which
suggests that the discriminator from our proposed formulation is more informative. Despite the
positive result, it is important to point out that maintaining information about categories does not
necessarily mean maintaining information about the energy (density). Thus, this proxy measure
should be understood cautiously.
