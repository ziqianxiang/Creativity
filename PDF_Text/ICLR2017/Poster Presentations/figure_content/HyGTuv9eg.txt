Figure 1: Reference image (left) and generated texture (right) using the procedure described in Gatyset al. (2015a).
Figure 2: Summary of the texture synthesis procedure described in Gatys et al. (2015a). We use aVGG-19 network Simonyan & Zisserman (2014) as the pre-trained CNN.
Figure 3: Exploiting Gram matrices of feature maps as in Gatys et al. (2015a) (1st row) or only thesquared Frobenius norm of feature maps (2nd row) for increasingly deep layers (from left to right).

Figure 5: P ool2 reconstruction using different values for δ in Lcpco,oδl2. (1st column): Without cross-correlation terms. (Other columns): Using a single cross-correlation term with a fixed δ value (1strow) or using multiple cross-correlation terms with distinct δ values (2nd row).
Figure 6: Some results of our approach compared with Gatys et al. (2015a). Only the initializationdiffers in the last two columns. Further results are shown in the supplementary material.
