Figure 1:	Synthetic experiment results. Different background colors represent the segmentationswith different labels. In the top row, the black curve shows the raw signal. (a) The Sine data set isgenerated by a HSMM with 3 hidden states, where each one has a corresponding sine function; (b)Similar to 1a, but the segments are generated from Gaussian processes with different kernel functions.
Figure 2:	Graphical models of HSMM and R-HSMM. Different from classical HSMM, the R-HSMMhas two-leVel emission structure with recurrent dependency.
Figure 3:	Segmentation results on Human activity and Drosophila datasets. Different backgroundcolors represent the segmentations with different labels. In the top row, the black cure shows thesignal sequence projected to the first principle component. The following two rows are our algorithmswhich almost exact locate every segment. (a) The Human activity data set contains 12 hidden states,each of which corresponds to a human action; (b) The Drosophila data set contains 11 hidden states,each of which corresponds to a drosophila action.
Figure 4:	Reconstruction illustration. The generative RNNs (decoders) are asked to reconstruct thesignals from only the discrete labels and durations (which are generated from encoder).
