Figure 1: An illustration of the noisy-label neural network architecture for the training phase (above)and test phase (below).
Figure 2: Test classification accuracy results on the MNIST dataset as a function of the noise level.
Figure 3: Test classification accuracy results on the CIFAR-100 dataset as a function of the noiselevel. The results are shown for several training data sizes (20%,50%,100%) of the training subsetfor a CNN network architecture).
Figure 4: Test classification accuracy results on the CIFAR-100 dataset as a function of the noiselevel. The results of regular and sparse second softmax layers are shown for several training datasizes (20%,50%,100%) of the training subset .
