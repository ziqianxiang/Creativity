Figure 1: Text classification models with clean embeddings (a) and with perturbed embeddings (b).
Figure 2: Learning curves of (a) negative log likelihood, (b) adversarial loss (defined in Eq.(6))and (c) virtual adversarial loss (defined in Eq.(8)) on IMDB. All values were evaluated on the test set.
