Figure 1: The static data-flow graph created by dynamic batching for a binary TreeRNN over parsetrees (left), and input graph corresponding to the parse tree ((word1, word3), word5) (right).
Figure 2: Block architectures for a pipeline (Section 3.3), feed-forward attention (Section 3.4),binary Tree-LSTMs (Section 3.5), and the weave module for molecule graphs (Section 3.6).
