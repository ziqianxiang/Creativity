Figure 1: The Neural Photo Editor. The original image is center. The red and blue tiles arevisualizations of the latent space, and can be directly manipulated as well.
Figure 2: Visualizing the interpolation mask. Top, left to right: Reconstruction, reconstruction error,original image. Bottom: Modified reconstruction, ∆, output.

Figure 4: (a) Multiscale Dilated Convolution Block. (b) Visualizing a 3d3 MDC filter composition.
Figure 5: CelebA and SVHN samples.
Figure 6: CelebA and SVHN Reconstructions and Interpolations. The outermost images are originals,the adjacent images are reconstructions.
Figure 7: Comparing samples from different models. From top: VAE(Kingma & Welling, 2014),DCGAN (Goodfellow et al., 2014), VAE/GAN from (Larsen et al., 2015), ALI from(Dumoulin et al.,2016), IAN (ours).
Figure 8: Samples, reconstructions, and interpolations on CIFAR-10. Top three rows: samples,bottom three rows: reconstructions and interpolations. Our model achieves an Inception score of6.88(±0.08), on par with the 6.86(±0.06) achieved by Improved-GAN with historical averaging.
Figure 9: Samples, reconstructions, and interpolations on Imagenet. Top three rows: samples,bottom three rows: reconstructions and interpolations. Our model achieves an Inception score of8.56(±0.09).
