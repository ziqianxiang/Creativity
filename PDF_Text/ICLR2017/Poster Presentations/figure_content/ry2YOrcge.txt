Figure 1: Neural Programmer is a neural network augmented with a set of discrete operations. Themodel runs for a fixed number of time steps, selecting an operation and a column from the table atevery time step. The induced program transfers information across timesteps using the row selectorvariable while the output of the model is stored in the scalar answer and lookup answer variables.
