Figure 1: Feature maps, fibers, and the transformation law π0 of F0 .
Figure 2: Diagram showing the structural consistency that follows from equivariance of the networkΦ and the group representation structure of π0 . The result of following any path in this diagramdepends only on the beginning and endpoint but is independent of the path itself, c.f. eq. 2That is, π0(gh) = π0(g)π0(h) (at least in the span of the image of Φ). Figure 2 gives an illustration.
Figure 3: A filter bank Ψ that isH -equivariant. In this example,ρ1 represents the 90-degree rota-tion r by a permutation matrix thatcyclicly shifts the 4 channels.
Figure 4: The representation π1 in-duced from the permutation repre-sentation ρ1 shown in fig. 3. A singlefiber is highlighted. It is transportedto a new location, and acted on by ρ1 .
