Figure 1: Example results from the ME problem with known DirichIet ground truth. Left panel:The normal density p0 (purple) and iid samples from p0 (red points). Middle panel: The MEFNtransforms p0 to the desired maximum entropy distribution pφ* on the simplex (calculated densitypφ* in purple). Truly iid samples are easily drawn from pφ* (red points) by drawing from p0 andmapping those points through fφ* . Shown in the middle panel are the same points in the top leftpanel mapped through fφ* . Samples corresponding to training the same network as MEFN to simplymatch the specified moments (ignoring entropy) are also shown (dark green points; see text). Rightpanel: The ground truth (in this example, known to be Dirichlet) distribution in purple, and iidsamples from it in red.
