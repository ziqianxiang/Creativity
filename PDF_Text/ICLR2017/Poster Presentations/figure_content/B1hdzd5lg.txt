Figure 1: Word-character fine-grained gating. The two lookup tables are shared. “NER”, “POS”, “frequencyrefer to named entity tags, part-of-speech tags, document frequency features.
Figure 2: Paragraph-question fine-grained gating.
Figure 3: Visualization of the weight matrix Wg. Weights for each features are averaged. Red means high andyellow means low. High weight values favor character-level representations, and low weight values favor word-level representations. “Organization”, “‘Person”, “Location”, and “O” are named entity tags; “DOCLEN-n”are document frequency features (larger n means higher frequency, n from 0 to 4); others are POS tags.
Figure 4: Visualization of gate values in the text. Red means high and yellow means low. High gate valuesfavor character-level representations, and low gate values favor word-level representations.
