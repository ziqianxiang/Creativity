Figure 1: A synthetic experiment to study the performances of K-Grassmeans: (a) monosemouswords: “monastery” and “phd”; (b) K = 5 monosemous words: “employers”, “exiled”, “grossed”,“incredible” and “unreleased”; (c) accuracy versus K.
Figure 2: Precision and recall curve in the sense identification task where we let m = 20 and k varyfrom 1 to 6.
Figure 3: A synthetic experiment to study the linear algebraic structure of Word senses.
Figure 4: An experiment to study the low rank structure of context word embeddings. Histogramsof the variance ratio are plotted for rank-N PCAs of the context embeddings.
Figure 5: The geometry of contexts for monosemy.
Figure 6: Geometry of contexts for a polysemous word “crane": (a) all contexts where “crane”means a machine roughly intersect at one direction; (b) all contexts where “crane" means a birdroughly intersect at another direction; (c) two directions representing “crane" as a machine and as abird.
Figure 7: A histogram of the cosine similarities between word representations and intersection Vec-tors for monosemous words.
Figure 8: Cosine similarities between intersection directions and word representations respectively.
