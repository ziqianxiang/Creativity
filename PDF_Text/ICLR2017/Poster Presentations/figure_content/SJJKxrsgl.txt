Figure 1: Receptive field size (dendritic field diameter) as a function of eccentricity of RetinalGanglion Cells from a macaque monkey (taken from Perry et al. (1984)).
Figure 2: Diagram of single kernel filter parameterized by a mean μ and variance σ.
Figure 3: A: Starting from an initial lattice configuration of a uniform grid of kernels, we learn anoptmized configuration from data. B: Attentional fixations generated during inference in the model,shown unrolled in time (after training).
Figure 4: Top Row: Examples from our variant of the cluttered MNIST dataset (a.k.a Dataset 1).
Figure 5: The sampling lattice shown at four different stages during training for a Translation Onlymodel, from the initial condition (left) to final solution (right). The radius of each dot correspondsto the standard deviation σi of the kernel.
Figure 6: Top: Learned sampling lattices for four different model configurations. Middle: Resolution(sampling interval) and Bottom: kernel standard deviation as a function of eccentricity for eachmodel configuration.
Figure 7: Temporal rollouts of the retinal sampling lattice attending over a test image from ClutteredMNIST (Dataset 2) after training.
