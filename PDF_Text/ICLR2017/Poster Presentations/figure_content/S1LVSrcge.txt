Figure 1: Two time steps of a VCU. At each step t, the scheduler takes in the current hidden vectorht-1 and input vector xt and decides on a number of dimensions to use d. The unit then uses thefirst d dimensions of ht-1 and xt to compute the first d elements of the new hidden state ht, andcarries the remaining D - d dimensions over from ht-1.
Figure 2: Top: Per-bit computation by VCRNN, higher dimensions (950 to 1000). Middle: adding8 bits of buffer between every character. Bottom: adding 24 bits of buffer between each character.

Figure 4: Bits per character for different computational loads on the Europarl Czech (left) andGerman (right) datasets. The VCRNN, whether guided to use boundaries or fully unsupervised,achieves better held-out log-likelihood more efficiently than the standard RNN.
Figure 5: Per-character computation by VCRNN. The model appears to make use of morphology,separating sub-word units.
