Figure 1: The basic framework of actor-critic model.
Figure 2:	Two maps We USed in the paper. FlatMap is a simple square containing four pillars .
Figure 3:	The network structure of the proposed model. It takes 4 recent game frames plus 4 recentattention frames as the input state s, and outputs a probability distribution Ï€(a|s) of the 6 discreteactions. The policy and value network share parameters.
Figure 5: Performance comparison on Class 7 (hardest) of FlatMap between A3C [Mnih et al.
Figure 4: Average Frags over 300 episodes evaluation, on FlatMap(left) and CIGTrack1(right)with different levels of enemies (See Tbl. 3 for curriculum design). Models from later stages per-forms better especially on the difficult map, yet still keeps a good performance on the easier map.
Figure 6: Visualization of the convolutional filters in the first layer of our network. The filters aregrouped by the frame index they corresponds to. Each group consists of two rows of 32 RGB filtersfor the regular and attention frames, respectively. The filters corresponding to the current frame (lastrow) is less noisy than those of others, showing that the bot is more focused on the current frame.
