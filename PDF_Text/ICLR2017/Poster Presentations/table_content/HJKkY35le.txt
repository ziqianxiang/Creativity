Table 1: Grid Search for Hyperparameters.
Table 2: Results for Compositional MNIST with 1000 modes. The proposed regularization (Reg-DCGAN) allows to substantially reduce the number of missed modes as well as the KL divergencethat measures the plausibility of the generated samples (like in the Inception score).
Table 3: Number of images on the missing modes on CelebA estimated by a third-party discrimina-tor. The numbers in the brackets indicate the dimension of prior z . σ denotes the standard deviationof the added Gaussian noise applied at the input of the discriminator to regularize it. MDGANachieves a very high reduction in the number of missing modes, in comparison to other methods .
