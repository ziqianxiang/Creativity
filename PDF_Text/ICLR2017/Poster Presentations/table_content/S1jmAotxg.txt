Table 1: Marginal likelihood results (estimated) for Gaussian VAE and the three parametrizations ofthe Stick-Breaking VAE.
Table 2: Percent error on three semi-supervised classification tasks with 10%, 5%, and 1% of labelspresent for training. Our DGM with stick-breaking latent variables (SB-DGM) is compared with aDGM with Gaussian latent variables (Gauss-DGM), and a k-Nearest Neighbors classifier (k=5).
