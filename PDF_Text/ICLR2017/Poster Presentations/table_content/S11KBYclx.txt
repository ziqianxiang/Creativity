Table 1: In each column we report the mean squared error (MSE) and the average log-likelihood(ALL) of the 16 fold CV learning curve prediction for a neural network without learning curveprediction layer (SGLD and SGHMC) and with our new layer (SGLD-LC and SGHMC-LC).
Table 2: Hyperparameter configuration space of the four different iterative methods. For the FCNetWe decayed the learning rate by a αdecay = (1 + Y * t)-κ and also sampled different values for Yand κ.
Table 3: The formulas of our 5 basis functions.
