Table 1: Descriptive statistics of datasets used in our experiments.
Table 2: Classification accuracy on Stanford Sentiment Treebank dataset. The number of parametersincludes word embedding parameters and is our approximation when not reported in previous work.
Table 3: Mean squared error on SICK dataset.
Table 4: Classification accuracy on SNLI dataset.
Table 5: Word perplexity on the sentence generation task. We also show perplexity of the modelthat does not condition on the previous sentence (unconditional) when generating bags of words forcomparison.
