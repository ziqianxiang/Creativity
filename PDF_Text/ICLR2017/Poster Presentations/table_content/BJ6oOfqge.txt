Table 1: CIFAR-10 results with 4000 labels, averages of 10 runs (4 runs for all labels).
Table 2: SVHN results for 500 and 1000 labels, averages of 10 runs (4 runs for all labels).
Table 3: CIFAR-100 results with 10000 labels, averages of 10 runs (4 runs for all labels).
Table 4: CIFAR-100 + Tiny Images results, averages of 10 runs.
Table 5: The network architecture used in all of our tests.
Table 6: The Tiny Images (Torralba et al., 2008) labels and image counts used in the CIFAR-100plus restricted extra data tests (rightmost column of Table 4).
