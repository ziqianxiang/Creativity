Table 1: (top) bAbI QA dataset (Weston et al., 2016): number of failed tasks and average error rates (%).
Table 2: bAbI QA dataset (Weston et al., 2016) error rates (%) of QRN and previous work: LSTM (Westonet al., 2016), End-to-end Memory Networks (N2N) (Sukhbaatar et al., 2015), Dynamic Memory Networks(DMN+) (Xiong et al., 2016), Gated End-to-end Memory Networks(GMemN2N) (Perez and Liu, 2016). Resultswithin each task of Differentiable Neural Computer(DNC) were not provided in its paper Graves et al. (2016)).
Table 3: bAbI dialog and DSTC2 dialog dataset (Bordes and Weston, 2016) average error rates (%) of QRNand previous work: End-to-end Memory Networks(N2N (Bordes and Weston, 2016)) and Gated End-to-endMemory Networks(GMemN2N (Perez and Liu, 2016)). For QRN, a number in the front (1, 2, 3, 6) indicates thenumber of layers and a number in the back (100) indicates the dimension of hidden vector, while the defaultvalue is 50. ‘r’ indicates that the reset gate is used, ‘v’ indicates that the gates were vectorized, and ‘+’ indicatesthat ‘match’ was used.
