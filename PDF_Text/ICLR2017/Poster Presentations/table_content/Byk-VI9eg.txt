Table 1: Pairwise GMAM metric means with stdev for select models on MNIST. For each column, apositive GMAM indicates better performance relative to the row opponent; negative implies worse.
Table 2: Pairwise GMAM metric means for select models on MNIST. For each column, a positiveGMAM indicates better performance relative to the row opponent; negative implies worse. Scoresare obtained by summing each column.
Table 3: Pairwise GMAM metric means for select models on CIFAR-10. For each column, a positiveGMAM indicates better performance relative to the row opponent; negative implies worse. Scoresare obtained by summing each column. GMAN variants were trained with two discriminators.
Table 4: Inception score means with standard deviations for select models on CIFAR-10. Higherscores are better. GMAN variants were trained with two discriminators.
Table 5: Pairwise GMAM metric means for select models on CIFAR-10. For each column, a positiveGMAM indicates better performance relative to the row opponent; negative implies worse. Scoresare obtained by summing each column. GMAN variants were trained with five discriminators.
Table 6: Inception score means with standard deviations for select models on CIFAR-10. Higherscores are better. GMAN variants were trained with five discriminators.
