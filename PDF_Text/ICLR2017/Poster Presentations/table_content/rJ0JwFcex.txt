Table 1: The effect of different input/output encoders on accuracy. Each result used 100 samples.
Table 2:	Testing the I/O-vector-to-sequence model. Each result used 100 samples.
Table 3:	The effect of sampling multiple programs on accuracy. 1-best is deterministically choosingthe expansion with highest probability at each step.
