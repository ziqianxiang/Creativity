Table 1: Classification error of a linear classifier trained on various document representations on theImdb dataset.
Table 2: Learning time and representation generation time required by different representation learn-ing algorithms.
Table 3: Words with embeddings closest to 0 learned by different algorithms.

Table 6: Test set results on the SICK semantic relatedness task. The first group of results are from thesubmission to the 2014 SemEval competition; the second group includes several baseline methodsreported in (Tai et al., 2015); the third group are methods based on LSTM reported in (Tai et al.,2015) as well as the skip-thought vectors (Kiros et al., 2015).
