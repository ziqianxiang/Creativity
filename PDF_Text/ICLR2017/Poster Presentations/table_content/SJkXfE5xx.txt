Table 1: Type-I errors (first row) and powers (rest of rows) in distinguishing NIPS papers categories.
Table 2: Type-I errors (first row) and powers (second row) in distinguishing facial expressions.
Table 3: Results on GAN evaluation. Lower test statistics are best. Full results in Appendix A.
Table 4: Results on cause-effect discovery on the Tubingen pairs experiment.
Table 5: GAN evaluation results on the LSUN dataset, for all epochs (ep), filters in discriminator (df), filters in generator (gf), and test statistics (for MMD, C2ST-KNN, C2ST-NN). A lower test statistic						estimates that the GAN produces better samples. Best viewed with zoom.
Table 6: GAN evaluation results on the LFW dataset, for all epochs (ep), filters in discriminator (df),filters in generator (gf), and test statistics (for MMD, C2ST-KNN, C2ST-NN). A lower test statisticestimates that the GAN produces better samples. Best viewed with zoom.
