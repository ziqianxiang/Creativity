Table 1: Music modeling, test set perplexity on a corpus of traditional Irish tunes. Our modelmanages to achieve better perplexity with less computation than the Elman RNN.
Table 2: Average amount of computation (mt) for various note lengths. More effort is required forthe faster passages with 16th notes and triplets.

We first compare the VCRNN to the regular Elman RNN, as well as tothe Conditional RNN of (Bojanowski et al., 2015), which combines two layers running at bit andcharacter level for bit level modeling, or character and word level for character level modeling.
