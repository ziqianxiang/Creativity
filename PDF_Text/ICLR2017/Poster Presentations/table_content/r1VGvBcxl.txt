Table 1: Systems used for profiling and testing.
Table 2: PPS on different systems (Table 1), for small andlarge DNNs, with CPU and GPU utilization for GA3C.
Table 3: Average scores on a subset of Atari games achieved by: a random player (Mnih et al.,2015); a human player (Mnih et al., 2015); A3C after four days of training on a CPU (Mnih et al.,2016); and GA3C after one day of training. For GA3C, we measured the average score on 30 games,each initialized with a random seed.
