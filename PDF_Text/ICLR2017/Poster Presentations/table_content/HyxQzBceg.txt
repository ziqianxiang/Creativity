Table 1: Test set misclassification rate on permutation-invariant MNIST using K = 256. We com-pare our method (VIB) to an equivalent deterministic model using various forms of regularization.
Table 2: Quantitative results showing how the different Inception Resnet V2-based architectures(described in Section 4.2.5) respond to targeted L2 adversarial examples. Determ is the deterministicarchitecture, IRv2 is the unmodified Inception Resnet V2 architecture, and VIB(0.01) is the VIBarchitecture with β = 0.01. Successful target is the fraction of adversarial examples that causedthe architecture to classify as the target class (soccer ball). Lower is better. L2 and L∞ are theaverage L distances between the original images and the adversarial examples. Larger values meanthe adversary had to make a larger perturbation to change the class.
