Table 1:	Test error for the models reaching the best valida-tion error for various values of T on the covertype dataset.
Table 2:	Test error for the models reaching the best valida-tion error for various values of T on the alpha dataset. Wecan see that overfitting occurs very quickly and, as a result,all values of T lead to the same result as the standard log-loss.
Table 3:	Test error for the models reaching the best valida-tion error for various values of T on the MNist dataset. Theresults for all values of T strictly greater than 1 are compa-rable and significantly better than for T = 1.
Table 4:	Test error for the models reaching the best vali-dation error for various values of T on the IJCNN dataset.
