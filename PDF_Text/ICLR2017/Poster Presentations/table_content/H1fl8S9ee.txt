B MethodsIn the experiments we compare to the following methods:Standard MLP. The standard multi-layer preceptron (MLP) is equivalent to our BNNs, but doesnot have uncertainty over the weight W and does not include any stochastic inputs. We train thismethod using early stopping on a subset of the training data. When we perform roll-outs usingalgorithm 1, the predictions of the MLP are made stochastic by adding Gaussian noise to its output.
