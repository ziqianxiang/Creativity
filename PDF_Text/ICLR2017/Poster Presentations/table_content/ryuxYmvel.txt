Table 1: HolStep dataset statistics3	Machine Learning Tasks3.1	Tasks descriptionThis dataset makes possible several tasks well-suited for machine learning most of which are highlyrelevant for theorem proving:•	Predicting whether a statement is useful in the proof of a given conjecture;•	Predicting the dependencies of a proof statement (premise selection);•	Predicting whether a statement is an important one (human named);•	Predicting which conjecture a particular intermediate statement originates from;•	Predicting the name given to a statement;•	Generating intermediate statements useful in the proof of a given conjecture;•	Generating the conjecture the current proof will lead to.
