Figure 1: An example of argument structure with four ACs. The left side shows raw text that hasbeen annotated for the presence of ACs. Squiggly and straight underlining means an AC is a claimor premise, respectively. The ACs in the text have also been annotated for links to other ACs, whichis show in the right figure. ACs 3 and 4 are premises that link to another premise, AC2. Finally, AC2links to a claim, AC1. AC1 therefore acts as the central argumentative component.
