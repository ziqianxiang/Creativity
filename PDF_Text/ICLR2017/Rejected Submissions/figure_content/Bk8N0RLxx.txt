Figure 1: Left: Decoding time vs. vocabulary size on newstest2013 for WMT15 English to Germantranslation. Right: BLEU vs. vocabulary size for different selection strategies.
Figure 2: Impact of adding common words to word alignment selection for various vocabulary sizes.
Figure 3: Left: Coverage of the reference by the word alignment selection for different vocabularysizes and by the full 100k model. Right: Coverage of the full vocabulary model prediction by theword alignment selection method. Coverage does not count unknown words, therefore the full modelhas non-perfect coverage on itself. Vocabulary selection never fully covers the reference (left) but italmost entirely covers the prediction of the full vocabulary model, even when very few candidatesare selected.
Figure 4: BLEU accuracy versus decoding speed for a beam size of 5 on CPU. Significant speed upscan be achieved with no decrease in BLEU accuracy, e.g., word alignment selection achieves 20.2BLEU at 137 msec/sentence (156 words per sec) while the full vocabulary model requires 1, 581msec/sentence (13.5 words per sec) at the same accuracy level, this is equivalent to an 11-fold speedup.
