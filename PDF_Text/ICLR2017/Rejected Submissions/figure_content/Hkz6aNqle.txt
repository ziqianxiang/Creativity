Figure 1: Two coding matrices encoded with the one-versus-all (binary case) and one-versus-one(ternary case) coding strategies.
Figure 2: (a) Classification accuracy obtained on the USPS data set. Here, DeePECOC(1)ã€œDeeP-ECOC(3) are 3 variant of DeepECOC with the ECOCONE coding design initialized by one-versus-one, one-versus-all and DECOC resPectively. (b) Classification accuracy with different numbers ofhidden layers on the USPS data set.
