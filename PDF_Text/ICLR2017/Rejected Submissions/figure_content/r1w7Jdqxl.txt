Figure 1: This figure shows three different designs of the dual networks. Here, Θ indicates dot product and ㊉indicates summation. (a) The basic design adopts the MLP structure for each network. (b) The multi-level designintegrates the dot products of embeddings at different levels to produce the prediction. (c) In the branchingdesign, the embeddings (except those of the top level) used in the dot products are produced by transformbranches. In this way, the main abstraction paths won’t be directly twisted.
