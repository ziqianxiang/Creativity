Figure 1: First row: Sampling grids that define the warps associated with different spatial transfor-mations. Second row: An example image (a) after warping with each grid (b-d). Third row: A smalltranslation is applied to each warped image, which is then mapped back to the original space (by aninverse warp). Translation in one axis of the appropriate warped space is equivalent to (b) horizontalscaling; (c) planar rotation; (d) 3D rotation around the vertical axis.
Figure 2: Equivariant pose estimation strategy used in the experiments (section 6). With an appro-priate warp and a standard CNN, the shaded block becomes equivalent to a generalized CNN (bytheorem 1), which performs exhaustive searches across pose-space instead of image-space.
