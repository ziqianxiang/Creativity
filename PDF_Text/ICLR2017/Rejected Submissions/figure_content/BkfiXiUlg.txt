Figure 1: The LSTM+HAM model consists ofan LSTM controller and a HAM module. Theexecution of the model starts with the initializa-tion of HAM using the whole input sequencex1 , x2 , . . . , xm . At each timestep, the HAM mod-ule produces an input for the LSTM, which thenproduces an output symbol yt . Afterwards, thehidden states of the LSTM and HAM are updated.
Figure 2: The model. One timestep consists of three phases presented in Figures (b)-(d).
