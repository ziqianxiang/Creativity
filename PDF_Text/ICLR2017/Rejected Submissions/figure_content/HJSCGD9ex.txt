Figure 1:	Benefit of Multilingual Information (beyond bilingual): Two different senses of the word “interest”and their translations to French and Chinese (word translation shown in [bold]). While the surface form of bothsenses are same in French, they are different in Chinese.
Figure 2:	The aligned pair (interest,interet) is used to predict monolingual and crosslingual context in bothlanguages (see factors in eqn. (3)). We PiCk each sense (here 2nd) vector for interest, to perform weightedupdate. We only model polysemy in English.
Figure 3: Qualitative: PCA plots for the vectors for {apple, bank, interest, itunes, potato, west, monetary,desire} with multiple sense vectors for apple,interest and bank obtained using monolingual (3a), bilingual (3b)and multilingual (3c) training. Window Tuning: Figure 3d shows tuning window size for En-Zh and En-Fr.
