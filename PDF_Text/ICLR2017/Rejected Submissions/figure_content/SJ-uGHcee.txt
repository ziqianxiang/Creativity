Figure 1: Reward as a function of the number of rollouts for the Cartpole problem, for variousvalues of iterations of Power and various values of the control variate. The light areas represent 3standard deviations. The performance greatly increases with higher values of T , especially with aproper control variate. Except at the very beginning, there is no major difference between T = 5 andT = 20, leading us to think that we might suffer from variance issues despite the control variates.
Figure 2: Reward as a function of the number of rollouts for the Cartpole problem, for various valuesof iterations of Power and various values of the control variate. The light areas represent 3 standarddeviations. Using a control variate drastically improves the performance when using large values ofT while it has very little impact for T = 1 and T = 2. This demonstrates the importance of beingable to deal with negative rewards.
Figure 3: Dashed blue: improvement in expected mer-chant value as a function of the number of iterations (ar-bitrary linear scale). The optimization is very slow at thebeginning and the improvement is close to linear for thefirst 50 iterations.
