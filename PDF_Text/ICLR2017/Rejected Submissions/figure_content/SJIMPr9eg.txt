Figure 1: A Residual Network of N blocks can be unfolded into an ensemble of 2N - 1 smallernetworks.
Figure 2: Illusration of subsequent rounds of DIB3 Creating the B oosted Residual NetworkIn this section we propose a method for generating Boosted Residual Networks. This works byincreasing the size of an original residual network by one residual block at each round of boosting.
Figure 3: Illusration of subsequent rounds of BRNWe identified a number of optional variations to the algorithm that may be implemented in practice,which we have empirically established as not having an impact on the overall performance of thenetwork. We report them here for completeness.
