Figure 1: The vanilla seq2seq with attention on the left, and our proposed target-glimpse model on theright. The symbol “>” and “<” are start-of-sequence and end-of-sequence, respectively.
Figure 2: (a) N-choose-1 evaluation on the baseline model. (d) Training progress of different models onthe full combined data set. Length-1 and Length-10 are the target-glimpse models we propose, and PlainSeq2seq is the baseline model we described. (b)(c)(e)(f): Human evaluation results on the conversationdata. (b) The histogram of 5 ratings per method. (c) The length thresholds (horizontal axis) and thenumber of responses generated that are above the length threshold (vertical axis); (e) The proportion ofresponses above the length-threshold that are judged at least Acceptable; (f) The proportion of responsesabove the length-threshold that are judged as Excellent. The length thresholds are all measured in numberof characters.
