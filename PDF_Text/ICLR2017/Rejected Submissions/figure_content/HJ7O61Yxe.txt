Figure 1: Quantitative comparison between baselines and our proposed model (RDG) on the predic-tion task. RDGk,l corresponds to the variant with losses (∆Dek,∆Dy ).
Figure 2: Forecasts on GFT (two different time series of the dataset) with the RDG2,2 model showingits range of confidence: E Pf (Z Ptqqq± Varpf (Z Ptqq). Prediction at 25'n corresponds to f PhnpZ p25q).
