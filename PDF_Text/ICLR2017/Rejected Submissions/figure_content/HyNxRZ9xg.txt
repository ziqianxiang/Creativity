Figure 1: The proposed sample encoding module. At first, each category pair will be fed into agate to get the interaction between two categories. Next, using K-max pooling to capture importantinteractions. Repeat above two steps, which could capture higher level category interactions. Finally,we use a full connection layer to transform final interaction vectors into the prediction.
Figure 2: The discriminant Cat2Vec model which learns the category embedding by training a dis-criminator to distinguish the true samples from the fake ones.
