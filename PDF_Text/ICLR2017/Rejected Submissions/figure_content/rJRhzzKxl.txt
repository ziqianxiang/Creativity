Figure 1: Training procedures for a) the teacher model, b) the student model, and c) the studentmodel with multiple teachers. The teacher is trained on examples xS and their true labels yS inthe source domain DS, while the student is trained on the softened predictions of one or multipleteachers of examples xT in the target domain DT .
