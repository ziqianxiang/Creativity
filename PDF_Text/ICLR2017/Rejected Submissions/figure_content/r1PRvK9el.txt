Figure 2: An example of the shortest path synthesis dataset, given an input “215 S 493”(AnsWer: 215 →101 → 493). Note that we only show the nodes that are related to this example here. The correspondingtermination probability and prediction results are shown in the table. The model terminates at step 5.
