Figure 1: Variation of test loss with number of epochs, on the MNIST dataset, with and withoutbatch normalization. Note that the scales on the y-axes are different.
Figure 2: Variation of test loss with number of epochs, on the CIFAR10 dataset, with and withoutbatch normalization. Note that the scales on the y-axes are different.
Figure 3:	Variation of test loss with number of epochs, on the MNIST dataset, with batch normal-ization, for varying minibatch sizes. Note that the scales on the x and y-axes across figures aredifferent.
Figure 4:	Variation of test loss with number of epochs, on the CIFAR10 dataset, with batch nor-malization, for varying minibatch sizes. Note that the scales on the x and y-axes across figures aredifferent.
Figure 5: LSR1 vs SGD vs Adam, on the CIFAR10 dataset, using a residual network. The x-axis onthe left shows number of epochs, while the x-axis on the right shows time in seconds.
Figure 6: Variation of trust region radius increase and decrease factors, mini-batch size and memorysize with number of epochs, on the CIFAR10 dataset, using a residual network. Note that the scaleson the y-axes are different.
