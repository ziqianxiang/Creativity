Figure 1: An example tree for 1 + 2 - 3. The binary operators are represented with non-terminalnodes, with two required children “left” and “right”. The numbers are terminal nodes.
Figure 2: Metrics of the same model trained with different KL-related hyperparameters. The x axisis the step count. (1): We annealed the KL cost weight from step 5000 to 25000. (2): We set the KLcost minimum (λ) to 150. (3): We annealed the KL cost weight from step 20000 to 40000. (4): Weannealed the KL cost weight from 5000 to 25000 and also set the minimum to 150.
