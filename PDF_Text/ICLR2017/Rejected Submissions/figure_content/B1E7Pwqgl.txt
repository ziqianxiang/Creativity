Figure 1: (a) Algorithm D involves sampling from the current model by Langevin dynamics. (b)Algorithm G involves sampling from the posterior distribution of the latent factors by Langevindynamics. (c) CoopNets algorithm. The part of the flowchart for training the descriptor is similarto Algorithm D, except that the D1 Langevin sampling is initialized from the initial synthesizedexamples supplied by the generator. The part of the flowchart for training the generator can also bemapped to Algorithm G, except that the revised synthesized examples play the role of the observeddata, and the known generated latent factors can be used as inferred latent factors (or be used toinitialize the G1 Langevin sampling of the latent factors).
