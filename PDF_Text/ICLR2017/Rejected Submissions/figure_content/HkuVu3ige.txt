Figure 1: Accuracy curves on the copy task for sequence lengths of (from left to right) T=200,T=500, T=1000, T=10000 given different spectral margins. Convergence speed increases with mar-gin size; however, large margin sizes are ineffective at longer sequence lengths (T=10000, right).
Figure 2: The norm of the gradient of the loss from the last time step with respect to the hiddenunits at a given time step for a length 220 RNN over 1000 update iterations for different margins.
Figure 3: Singular value evolution on the permuted sequential MNIST task for factorized RNNswith different margin sizes. Margins are, from left to right: top row: 0.001, 0.01, 0.1; bottom row: 1,no margin, no margin. The singular value distributions are summarized with the mean (green line,center) and standard deviation (green shading about mean), minimum (red, bottom) and maximum(blue, top) values. All models are initialized with orthogonal hidden to hidden transition matricesexcept for the model on the bottom right where Glorot normal initialization is used.
Figure 4: Accuracy curves on the copy task for different strengths of soft orthogonality constraints.
Figure 5: Mean squared error (MSE) curves on the adding task for different spectral margins m.
Figure 6: Loss curves for different factorized RNN parameterizations on the sequential MNISTtask (left) and the permuted sequential MNIST task (right). The spectral margin is denoted by m;models with no margin have singular values that are directly optimized with no constraints; Glorotrefers to a factorized RNN with no margin that is initialized with Glorot normal initialization.
