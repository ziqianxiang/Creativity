Figure 1:	MAC algorithm for binary autoencoders. “parfor” indicates a for loop whose iterationsare carried out in parallel. The steps over h and f can be run in parallel as well.
Figure 2:	ParMAC model with P = 4 machines, M = 12 submodels “wh” and N = 40 data points.
Figure 3: Precision in CIFAR dataset.
Figure 4: Speedup S(P) as a function of the number of machines P (top: experiment, bottom:theory). The dataset size and number of submodels (N, M) is (50 000, 32) for CIFAR, (106, 32) forSIFT-1M and (108, 128) for SIFT-1B.
