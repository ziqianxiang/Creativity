Figure 1: Deep Latent Gaussian Model: The Bayesian network depicted here comprises asingle latent variable with the conditional probability p(x|z) defined by a deep neural network withparameter θ . The dotted line represents the inference network parameterized by φ, which is usedfor posterior inference at train and test time.
Figure 2: Mechanics of Learning: Validation Perplexity and Log-singular Values of Jmloegan : Best viewedin color. For the RCV2 and Wikipedia (large) datasets, we visualize the validation perplexity as a function ofepochs. The solid lines indicate the validation perplexity for M = 1 and the dotted lines indicate M = 100.
