Figure 1: Left: Generic state passthrough hidden layer, optional non-passthrough state X(t) and per-timestep input u(t) are not shown. Right: a) Full matrix parametrization. b) Low-rank parametrization.
Figure 2: Top row and middle left: Low-rank plus diagonal GRU and uRNN on the sequence copytasks, cross-entropy on validation set. Middle right: Low-rank GRU on the addition task, meansquared error on validation set. Bottom row: Low-rank GRU (left) and Low-rank plus diagonal GRU(right) on the permuted sequential MNIST task, accuracy on validation set, horizontal line indicates90% accuracy.
