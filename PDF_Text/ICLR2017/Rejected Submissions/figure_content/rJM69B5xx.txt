Figure 1: Structure of the AS Reader model.
Figure 2: Sub-figure (a) shows the average across the11 bAbI tasks of the best-validation model'stest accuracy. (b) shows the test accuracy on SQUAD of each model we trained (the points) and thelines join the accuracies of the best-validation models for each training size.
Figure 3: Example of 3 bAbI tasks where pre-training seems to help. Note that the task may be easierfor the CNN/DM models due to answer anonymization which restricts the choice of possible answers.
Figure 4:	The test accuracies of all models that We trained in the target-adjustment experiments. Theline joins the test accuracies of the best-validation models of each model type.
Figure 5: The average of the mean test accuracies across the 11 bAbI tasks. For the average of thebest validation results see Figure 2a.
