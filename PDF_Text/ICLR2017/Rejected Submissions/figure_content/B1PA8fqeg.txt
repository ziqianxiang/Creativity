Figure 1: Comparison of network structures with adjacency indications. Left: standard feedforwardneural network with layer structure. The two solid rectangles represent the weight matrices. Theconnection is restricted by layer structure. Center: layer-free version of standard feedforwardnetwork. We need a whole n Ã— n matrix indicated by the outer solid square to store parameterseven when most of them become almost zero as a result of learning. Right: an example of networkwhich is a subset of our proposed multiagent system. Matrices (solid rectangle) are no longerused. The network is free from the layer restriction while requiring fewer number of parameters.
Figure 3: Mean calculation time for connectivityrate averaged over 3 experiments for each connec-tivity. The horizontal axis indicates connectivityrate of each model and the vertical shows timespent in training.
Figure 4: Mean error rate for connectivity rateaveraged over 3 experiments for each connectivity.
Figure 2: Mean classification error rate (left: stan-dard SDAE, right: multiagent SDAE). The ver-tical coordinate indicates their error rate and thehorizontal for epoch count. Both SDAE result inalmost the same shape.
