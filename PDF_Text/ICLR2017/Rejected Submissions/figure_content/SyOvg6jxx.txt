Figure 1: The autoencoder (AE) architecture; the solid block represents the dense sigmoidal binarycode layer, after which noise U (-a, a) is injected.
Figure 2:	Illustrations of the rllab tasks used in the continuous control experiments, namelyMountainCar, CartPoleSwingup, SimmerGather, and HalfCheetah; taken from (Duan et al., 2016).
Figure 3:	Mean average return of different algorithms on rllab tasks with sparse rewards; the solidline represents the mean average return, while the shaded area represents one standard deviation, over5 seeds for the baseline and SimHash.
Figure 4: Atari 2600 games: the solid line is the mean average undiscounted return per iteration,while the shaded areas represent the one standard deviation, over 5 seeds for the baseline, TRPO-pixel-SimHash, and TRPO-BASS-SimHash, while over 3 seeds for TRPO-AE-SimHash.
Figure 5: SmartHash results on Montezuma’s Revenge (RAM observations): the solid line is themean average undiscounted return per iteration, While the shaded areas represent the one standarddeviation, over 5 seeds.
Figure 6: Frostbite, Freeway, and Montezuma’s Revenge: subsequent frames (left) and correspondingcode (right); the frames are ordered from left (starting with frame number 0) to right, top to bottom;the vertical axis in the right images correspond to the frame number.
Figure 7: Freeway: subsequent frames and corresponding code (top); the frames are ordered from left(starting with frame number 0) to right, top to bottom; the vertical axis in the right images correspondto the frame number. Within each image, the left picture is the input frame, the middle picture thereconstruction, and the right picture, the reconstruction error.
Figure 8: Statistics of TRPO-pixel-SimHash (k = 256) on Frostbite. Solid lines are the mean, whilethe shaded areas represent the one standard deviation. Results are derived from 10 random seeds.
