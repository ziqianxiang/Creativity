Figure 1:	Demonstrations of informative missingness on MIMIC-III dataset. Left figure showsvariable missing rate (x-axis, missing rate; y-axis, input variable). Middle/right figures respectivelyshows the correlations between missing rate and mortality/ICD-9 diagnosis categories (x-axis, targetlabel; y-axis, input variable; color, correlation value). Please refer to Appendix A.1 for more details.
Figure 2:	An example of measurement vectors xt, time stamps st, masking mt, and time interval δt.
Figure 3:	Graphical illustrations of the original GRU (left) and the proposed GRU-D (right) models.
Figure 4: Plots of input decay Yxt (top) and histrograms of hidden state decay Y型(bottom) of all33 variables in GRU-D model for predicting mortality on PhysioNet dataset. Variables in green arelab measurements; variables in red are vital signs; mr refers to missing rate.
