Figure 1: The architecture of our proposed pedestrian detection model, where the batch normaliza-tion layer is placed between any one convolutional layer and the succedent activation function layer(such as ReLU layer, and details can be seen in Figure 2).
Figure 2: The first five convolutional layers of our proposed model. The batch normalization (BN)layer is placed between each convolutional layer (Conv) and the succedent ReLU layer. In the firsttwo convolutional layers, the max-pooling layer is placed to follow the ReLU layer.

Figure 4:	Comparison of miss rate versus false positives per image between different methods onthe INRIA dataset. Our model is denoted as FRCNN+BN. We obtain the miss rate of 12% at 0.1FPPI.
Figure 5:	Comparison of miss rate versus false positives per image between different methods onthe ETH dataset. Our method is denoted as FRCNN+BN. We obtain the miss rate of 44% at 0.1FPPI.
