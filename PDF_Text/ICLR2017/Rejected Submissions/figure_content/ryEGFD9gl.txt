Figure 1: A partial (submodular) sum-product network for parsing an image with respect to the grammarshown. There is a sum node for each nonterminal symbol with a child sum node for each production of thatsymbol. Each sum node for a production has a child product nodefor each possible segmentation of its region.
Figure 2: The two main components of INFERSSPN: (a) Parsing a region P as X → YZ by fusing twoparses of P as Y → AB and as Z → CD, and (b) Improving the parse of P as X → YZ by (re)parsing eachof its subregions, taking the union of the new Y and Z parses of P, and then fusing these new parses.
Figure 3: The mean average pixel accuracy of the returned solution and total running time for each of beliefpropagation, α-expansion, and INFERS S PN when varying (a) boundary strength, (b) grammar height, and (c)number of productions. Each data point is the average value over (the same) 10 images. Missing data pointsindicate out of memory errors. Figures 4, 5, and 6 in the appendix show all results for each experiment.
Figure 4: The (a) best energy, (b) total running time, and (c) resulting semantic segmentation accuracy (meanaverage pixel accuracy) for belief propagation, α-expansion, and INFERSS PN when varying boundary strength.
Figure 5: The (a) best energy, (b) total running time, and (c) resulting semantic segmentation accuracy (meanaverage pixel accuracy) for belief propagation, α-expansion, and INFERSS PN when varying grammar height.
Figure 6: The (a) best energy, (b) total running time, and (c) resulting semantic segmentation accuracy (meanaverage pixel accuracy) for belief propagation, α-expansion, and INFERSS PN when varying grammar height.
