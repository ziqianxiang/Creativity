Figure 1:	Accuracy as a function of the memory per vector/embedding on 3 datasets from Zhanget al. (2015). Note, an extra byte is required when we encode the norm explicitly (”norm”).
Figure 2:	Loss of accuracy as a function of the model size. We compare the compressed model withdifferent level of pruning with NPQ and the full fastText model. We also compare with Zhanget al. (2015) and Xiao & Cho (2016). Note that the size is in log scale.
