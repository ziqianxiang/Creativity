In Neural Combinatorial Optimization, the model architecture is tied to the given combi-natorial optimization problem. Examples of useful networks include the pointer network, when theoutput is a permutation or a truncated permutation or a subset of the input, and the classical seq2seqmodel for other kinds of structured outputs. For combinatorial problems that require to assign labelsto elements of the input, such as graph coloring, it is also possible to combine a pointer module anda softmax module to simultaneously point and assign at decoding time. Given a model that encodesan instance of a given combinatorial optimization task and repeatedly branches into subtrees to con-struct a solution, the training procedures described in Section 4 can then be applied by adapting thereward function depending on the optimization problem being considered.
