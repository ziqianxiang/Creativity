Figure 3: ROC curves from the ADFA-LD. Left shows the result from our three system-call languagemodels with different parameters and two baseline classifiers. Right illustrates the results fromdifferent ensemble methods.
Figure 4: ROC curves from the KDD dataset and UNM dataset. Left is the evaluation about theKDD dataset. Right is the evaluation about UNM dataset using the model trained with the KDD98dataset and the UNM dataset.
Figure 5: 2-D embedding of learned call representations. (a) shows the full representation space ofsystem calls that appeared in training data. (b) and (c) show the zoomed-in view of specific regions.
