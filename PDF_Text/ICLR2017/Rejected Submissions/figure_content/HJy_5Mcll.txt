Figure 1: (a) ENet initial block. MaxPooling is performed with non-overlapping 2 × 2 windows, andthe convolution has 13 filters, which sums up to 16 feature maps after concatenation. This is heavilyinspired by Szegedy et al. (2015b). (b) ENet bottleneck module. conv is either a regular, dilated, orfull convolution (also known as deconvolution) with 3 × 3 filters, or a 5 × 5 convolution decomposedinto two asymmetric ones.
Figure 2: PReLU weight distribution vs network depth. Blue line is the weights mean, while an areabetween maximum and minimum weight is grayed out. Each vertical dotted line corresponds to aPReLU in the main branch and marks the boundary between each of bottleneck blocks. The grayvertical line at 67th module is placed at encoder-decoder border.
