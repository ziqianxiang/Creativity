Figure 1: Illustration of the proposed model. qã€‚is the character-level embedding vector for the word,and qw is the word embedding generated according to (MikoloV et al., 2013). Column of Q is theconcatenation of qc and qw . The row length is sentence length. The grey box for sentence vectorconstructor is illustrated in Figure 2 and the grey box for Residual network iteration is illustrated inFigure 3(b).
Figure 2: Illustration of sentence representation. The input Q is from Figure 1. The weightssi, s2, s3, s4 and Svi, Sv2, Sv3 are generated from attention mechanism, which is illustrated in Fig-ure 3(a). Type 1 feature and type 2 feature are detailed in 3.2.
