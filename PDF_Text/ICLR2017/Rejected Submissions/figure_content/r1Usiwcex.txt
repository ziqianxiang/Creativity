Figure 1: Ancestral inpainting of a ∞rrupted Bach chorale by Coconet. Colors are used todistinguish the four voices. Grayscale heatmaps show predictions P(Xi ∣ x(；). The pitch sampledin the CUrrent step is indicated by a rectangular outline. The original Bach chorale is shown in thebottom right. Step O shows the ∞rrupted Bach chorale. Step 64 shows the result.
Figure 2: Likelihood under the model of Gibbs samples obtained with various context distributionsp(C). NADE (equivalent to Bernoulli(0.00)) is included for reference.
Figure 3: Human evaluations from MTurkon comparing sampling schemes.
Figure 3: Pairwise human evaluation results. Each element of Table 3(a) shows the number of timesthe source corresponding to the row was preferred over the source corresponding to the column.
