Figure 1: Score ratios Si/S0 as a function of dimensionality ratio m/d using k = 4. Qualitativelysimilar plots are observed for other values of k.
Figure 2: Score ratios Si/S0 as a function of the number of hash functions k: using m/d = 0.3(left) and m/d = 1 (right).
Figure 3: Time ratios Ti /T0 as a function of dimensionality ratios m/d with k = 4: training time(left) and evaluation time (right). Qualitatively similar plots are observed for other values of k .
Figure 4: Comparison of score ratios Si/S0 as a function of dimensionality ratio m/d for BE(dashed lines) and CBE (solid lines) using k = 4. Qualitatively similar plots are observed forother values of k.
