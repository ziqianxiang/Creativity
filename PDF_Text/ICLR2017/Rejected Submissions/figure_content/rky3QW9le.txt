Figure 1: Normalized reconstruction error for individual vs. batch 8 × 8 natural image patches.
Figure 2: Example of a tree learned from natural image patches. The leaves correspond to rigidtransformations of the root.
Figure 3: Reconstruction example. The root features are transformed and combined with differentweights to reconstruct (bottom right) the 8 × 8 natural image patch in the top right corner.
Figure 4: Learned features for 8 trees with a branching factor of 8. (a) Features corresponding to theroots. (b) Features/Leaves: Each row corresponds to leaves/transformations of the same root.
Figure 5: Effects of each individual transformation on the template (a): (b) horizontal translation,(c) vertical translation, (d) rotation, (e) scaling, (f) parallel hyperbolic deformation along the X/Yaxis, (g) hyperbolic deformation along the diagonals. To compute the generators, we used the sincinterpolation function.
Figure 6: Features learned for the double-line example: (a) Input, (b) features learned by a forestof two flat trees of size eight, (c) features learned by two binary trees of the same size. For (c)the leaves have been reordered with subtree permutations to reveal the order. Each subtree learnsfeatures corresponding to an area of the input.
Figure 7: Learned features for 16 trees with branching factor 16. Each row corresponds toleaves/transformations of the same root.
Figure 8: Learned features for 8 trees with branching factor 32. Each row corresponds toleaves/transformations of the same root.
Figure 9: Learned features for 4 trees with branching factor 16. Each row corresponds toleaves/transformations of the same root.
Figure 10: Learned features for 1 tree with branching factor 64. All features are transformations ofthe same root.
