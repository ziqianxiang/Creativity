Figure 1: Architecture of a typical CNN, selected sparsity blocks at convolutional and fully con-nected layers are shown in blue.
Figure 2: Variation of accuracy measure against: (odd rows) values of Î¼o parameters and (evenrows) normalized number of zero elements for different models and datasets.
