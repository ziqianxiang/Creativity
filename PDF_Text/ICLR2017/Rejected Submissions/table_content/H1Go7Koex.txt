Table 2: Kernel size for convolutional layersConvolutional layer	Kernel sizeConv:character embedding	(dc,4)Conv:ngram	(dc + dw, 1), (dc + dw, 2), (dc + dw, 3)4.3	Baseline ModelWe select both traditional models and deep learning models on classification as baselines.
Table 3: Comparison results on accuracy. “CAR” is the proposed model which indicates Character-aware Attention Residual network. “WAR” is the proposed model with only word embedding fromWord2Vec. “CA” is “CAR” removing residual network. “CAR-1” is “CAR” removing type 1feature. “CAR-2” is “CAR” removing type 2 feature. “CAR-1w” is “CAR” removing attentionweight assigned to type 1 feature.
