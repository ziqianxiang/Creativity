Table 1: Corpus Statistics (in millions). Horizontal lines demarcate corpora from the same domain.
Table 2: Results on word sense induction (left four columns) in ARI and contextual word similarity (lastcolumn) in percent correlation. Language pairs are separated by horizontal lines. Best results shown in bold.
Table 3: Effect (in ARI) of language family distance on WSI task. Best results for each column is shown inbold. The improvement from MONO to FULL is also shown as (3) - (1). Note that this is not comparable toresults in Table 2, as we use a different training corpus to control for the domain.
