Table 1: Information retrieval results. The best results with binary models are highlighted.
Table 2: Information retrieval results for 32-bit binary codes constructed by first inferring 32d real-valued paragraph vectors and then employing another unsupervised model or hashing algorithm forbinarization. Paragraph vectors were inferred using PV-DBOW with bigrams.
Table 3: Information retrieval results for the Binary PV-DBOW model trained on an unrelated textcorpus. Results are reported for 128-bit codes.
Table 4: Information retrieval results for the Real-Binary PV-DBOW model. All real valued repre-sentations have 300 dimensions and are use for ranking documents according to the cosine similarityto the query. (A) Real-valued representations learned by Real-Binary PV-DBOW are used for rank-ing all test documents. (B) Binary codes are used for selecting documents within a given Hammingdistance to the query and real-valued representations are used for ranking. (C) For comparison,variant B was repeated with binary codes inferred using plain Binary PV-DBOW and real-valuedrepresentation inferred using original PV-DBOW model.
