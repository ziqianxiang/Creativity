Table 1: RMSE at T ` 1 on the four datasets5	Conclusion and future workWe have proposed a model for relational time series forecasting. Our model (RDG) is based onlatent Gaussian embeddings, and has shown competitive performance on four different datasetscompared to state-of-the-art models. Moreover, RDG allows us to model the uncertainty of predic-tions, providing for example confidence intervals for each prediction. Future work will investigatemore complex dynamic and prediction functions, as well as observing the behavior of the model forimputation tasks.
