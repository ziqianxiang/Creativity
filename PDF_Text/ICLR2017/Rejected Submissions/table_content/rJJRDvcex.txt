Table 1: Network architectures for CIFAR-10 experimentsIn Network A, a variety of selections are tested (coded as blue). In Feature Fusion, we may chooseForward, Sum, Concatenation; in the LRNN module, GRU and vanilla RNNs are tested; max pool-ing or average pooling can be used for global pooling.
Table 2: Comparison with previous published methods on CIFAR-10The networks are named by the chosen operation at every step; for instance, A-Forward-GRU-Max,refers to the architecture A with Forward feature fusion, GRU in L-RNN Module, and max poolingas the final global pooling.
