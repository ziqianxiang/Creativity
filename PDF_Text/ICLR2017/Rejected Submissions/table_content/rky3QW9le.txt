Table 1: Comparison of transformational sparse coding (TSC) with sparse coding (SC) for 10 × 10natural image patches. We compare the error (MSE) and the degrees of freedom (df) over 40000data points. “Sparsity” is the average number of non-zero weights. λw is the penalty coefficient forthe weights and controls the sparseness of the solution.
