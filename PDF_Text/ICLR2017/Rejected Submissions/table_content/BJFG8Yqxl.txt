Table 1: Summary of dataset statistics. Ct represent the number of top categories, and Cs representsthe number of sub-category. Note we only do top level classification on TREC. Ndata is dataset size.
Table 2: Experiments with four datasets. Baseline is from sequential CNNs. WR means the pro-jection matrix is random initialized. WQ represents the projection matrix is initialized by clusteringthe question sentences. WA represents the performance of the model whose projection matrix isinitialized by answer set. There are three different settings for Yahoo dataset: classification onsubcategory, classification on top level category and classification on unseen sub-labels.
