Table 1: Exact match (EM) and span F1 on SQuAD. We are currently unable to evaluate on the blindS QuAD test set due to copyright restrictions. We confirm that we did not overfit the development set via5-fold cross validation of the hyper-parameters, resulting in 66.0 ± 1.0 exact match and 74.5 ± 0.9 F1.
Table 2: Results for variations of the model architecture presented in Section 3.
Table 3: Example questions and their most attended words in the passage-independent question representation(Equation 11). These examples have the greatest attention (normalized by the question length) in the develop-ment set. The attention mechanism typically seeks words in the question that indicate the answer type.
