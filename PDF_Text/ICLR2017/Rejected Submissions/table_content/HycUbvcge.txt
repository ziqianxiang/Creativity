In particular, we observe large improvements in theclassification of D, F, K, SH, V and Y . GCCA outperforms DGCCA for UH and DH. Thesematrices also highlight the common misclassifications that DGCCA improves upon. For instance,4For 2-view experiments, correlation is a common metric to compare performance. Since that metric isunavailable in a multiview setting, reconstruction error is the analogue.
