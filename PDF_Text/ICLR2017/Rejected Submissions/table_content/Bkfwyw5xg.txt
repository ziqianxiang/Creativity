Table 1: Generalized Skip-Gram, Bag-Of-Words and GloVe with different context types and contextrepresentations. For linear context, bound word indicates word associated with positional infor-mation. For dependency-based context, bound word indicates word associated with dependencyrelation.
Table 2: Illustration of bound and unbound context representations under linear and dependency-based context types. This example is based on Figure 1 and the target word is “discovers”.
Table 3: Illustration of collection P, M and M for sentence “australian scientist discovers star withtelescope”. Unbound context representation is used in this example. Words in the collections areBold and contexts in the collections are Normal.
