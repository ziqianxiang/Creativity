Table 1: Each CNN is trained with one of these types of transformations over parameter rangesthat differ in magnitude. Each sampled input to the CNN is stochastically perturbed by samplingtransform parameters from the range and applying the transformation to the image.
Table 2: Equivariance measurements for several CNNs on RVL-CDIP before and after finetuningusing Eq. 7. The first row of each transform type shows performance over untransformed images. Inmost cases finetuning improves equivariance on the finetuning transforms and on the untransformedimages.
