Table 1: Experimental results. The upper tablepresents the error rates on inputs of the samelengths as the ones used during training. The lowertable shows the error rates on input sequences 2to 4 times longer than the ones encountered dur-ing training. LSTM+A denotes an LSTM with thestandard attention mechanism. Each error rate is apercentage of output sequences, which containedat least one incorrectly predicted bit.
Table 2: Results of experiments with the raw ver-sion of HAM (without the LSTM controller). Errorrates are measured as a percentage of operation se-quences in which at least one POP query was notanswered correctly.
