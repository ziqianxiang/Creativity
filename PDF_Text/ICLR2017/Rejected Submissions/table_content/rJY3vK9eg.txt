Table 1: Different learning configurations.
Table 2: Average tour lengths (lower is better). Results marked 什) are from (Vinyals et al., 2015b).
Table 3: Running times in seconds (s) of greedy methods compared to OR Tool’s local search and solvers thatfind the optimal solutions. Time is measured over the entire test set and averaged. LK-H was run for 50 trialsper graph (the default parameter setting). It is likely that optimal solutions were found in fewer trials, resultingin shorter running times.
Table 4: Average tour lengths of RL pretraining-Sampling and RL pretraining-Active Search as they samplemore solutions. Corresponding running times on a single Tesla K80 GPU are in parantheses.
Table 5: Results of RL pretraining-Greedy and Active Search on KnapSack (higher is better).
Table 6: Performance of OR-Tools’ metaheuristics as they consider more solutions. Corresponding runningtimes in seconds (s) on a single Intel Haswell CPU are in parantheses.
