Table 1: Decision-level fusion results. Each row presents a different policy configuration (definedby the policy input, the number of layers and the value of q), followed by the accuracy % of theimage, text, policy and oracle (optimal policy) classifiers on the test dataset. The policy accuracycolumn presents the accuracy % of the policy in making correct predictions, i.e., choosing the imagenetwork when it made a correct prediction while the text network didn't. Numbers in (+âˆ™) referto the performance gain over the text CNN. Class Probabilities (CP) refer to the number of classprobabilities used as input.
