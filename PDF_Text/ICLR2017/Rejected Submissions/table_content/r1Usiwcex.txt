Table 1: Negative log-likelihood on the test set for the Bach corpus. As discussed in the text, ournumbers are not directly comparable to those of other authors due to the use of different splits. Re-sults from Boulanger-Lewandowski et al. (2012) were based on an eighth-note temporal resolution(our resolution is sixteenth notes). Please note that our results are preliminary validation likelihoods.
Table 2: Mean (Â± SEM) negative log-likelihood under the model of unconditioned samples gener-ated from the model by various procedures.
