Table 1: Test error rates (%) on the 20 bAbI QA tasks for models using 10k training examples withthe GRU and feedforward controller. FF stands for the experiments that are conducted with feedforwardcontroller. Let us, note that LBA* refers to NTM that uses both LBA and CBA. In this table, Wecompare multi-step vs single-step addressing, original NTM with location based+content basedaddressing vs only content based addressing, and discrete vs continuous addressing on bAbI.

Table 5: Test error rates (%) on the 20 bAbI QA tasks for models using 10k training examples with thefeedforward controller. Discrete* D-NTM model bootstraps the discrete attention with the continuousattention, using the curriculum method that we have introduced in Section 4. Discretet D-NTM modelis the continuous-attention model which uses discrete-attention at the test time.
