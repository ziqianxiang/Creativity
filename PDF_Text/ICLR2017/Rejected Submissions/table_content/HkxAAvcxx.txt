Table 1: Classification accuracy on UCF-101 dataset. The classifier is trained on the actual trainingvideo sequences, but it is tested using frames generated by various generative models. Each columnshows the accuracy on the test set when taking a different number of input frames as input. Ourapproach maps 16 × 16 patches into 8 × 8 with stride 4, and it takes 4 frames at the input.
Table 2: Analysis of the robustness to the choice of hyper-parameters, shows classification scorescompared to reference model. The reference model takes 4 frames as input, predicts one frame, andmaps 12 × 12 patches onto 8 × 8 patches with stride 4.
