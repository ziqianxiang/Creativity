Table 1: Parzen log-densities in nats of VAE, mVAE and eVAE for increasing model parameters, trained onMNIST and TFD with different dimensions D of latent variable z. For mVAE and eVAE models on MNIST,the maximum over epitomes of size K = 3 and K = 4 is used, and on TFD epitomes of size K = 5 are used.
Table 2: Parzen log-densities in nats on MNIST and TFD. VAE-, mVAE-, and eVAE- refer to models trainedusing the same architecture as Adversarial Autoencoders, for comparison. VAE, mVAE, and eVAE refer to thebest performing models over all architectures from Table 1.
Table 3: Likelihood bound and log-density for VAE and eVAE as dimension D of latent variable z is increased.
