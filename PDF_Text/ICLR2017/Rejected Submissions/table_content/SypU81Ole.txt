Table 1: Breakdown of CelebA smile versus male attributes. In the total population the smile attributeis almost balanced (48% smile). But separating the data further shows that those with the maleattribute smile only 42% of the time while those without it smile 58% of the time.
Table 2: CelebA smile versus open mouth attributes shows a strong symmetric correlation (greaterthan 3 to 1).
Table 3: Average Classification Accuracy on the CelebA dataset. Models for both VAE AtDot andGAN AtDot use unsupervised training with attribute vectors computed on the training set data aftermodel training was completed. VAE AtDot from Lamb 16 with discriminative regularization disabledand GAN AtVec from Dumoulin 16. Other results are [1] Kumar 08, [2] Zhang 14, [3] Li 13, and [4]LeCun 94 as reported in Ehrlich 16.
