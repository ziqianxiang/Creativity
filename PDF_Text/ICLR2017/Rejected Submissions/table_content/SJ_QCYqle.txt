Table 1: Details of the encoder part of the architecture used in our experiments. Input (FxTxHxW) =F feature maps, T time axes, H height, and W width. For convolutions, F(T,H,W) = the filter size forthe time, height, and width axis respectively, S(T,H,W) = the stride amount for the time, height andwidth axis respectively,P(T,H,W) = the zero padding and N = the number of output feature maps.

Thus far, the climate science community has usedhand-engineered criteria to characterize patterns. Our results indicate that there is much promisein considered deep learning based approaches. In addition, this work represents our first attempt atapplying semi-supervised learning and exploratory data analysis (i.e. clustering in a learned rep-resentation) to climate data. In the future, we think it would be interesting to delve deeper intointerpreting and visualizing what the network has learned. This would not only help open the ”blackbox” of deep learning for skeptics in the climate community, but also potentially help resolve ambi-guities in the definition of extreme weather events in addition to highlighting unknown underlyingfactors in extreme weather events. On a similar note, another goal would be to be able to segment
