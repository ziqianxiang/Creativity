Table 1: Accuracy of the steganalyser S * trained on real imagesType of a test set \ Image generator	SGANS I DCGANSReal images	0.962Generated images	0.501 I 0.522container images, that can easily deceive a steganalyser. Although containers generated by on theSGAN model, which is specially designed to deceive the steganalyser, improve on the result ofDCGAN, the improvement is not significant. These results also suggest that S* may have been overfitto the data distribution of the real images, and failed to generalize to the GAN approximation of thedata distribution in the synthetic image domain.
Table 2: Training/testing on generated images according to experimental conditions C1-C3Experimental Conditions	AccuracyC1	-0.982-C2	-0.517-C3	0.499The experiment results in tab. 2 indicate that using different seed values when generating containersmost likely affects the distribution of pixel value bits in such a way as make it easier to deceive6Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2017the steganalyser, fitted to another distribution in the train sample. Additional tuning of the imagegenerator G make this effect even more pronounced.
Table 3: Training/testing on generated images according to experimental conditions C4-C6Experimental Conditions	AccuracyC4	-0.649-C5	-0.630-C6	0.581According to tab. 3 the accuracy in case C5 is loWer than in the C4 case, Which can be explainedby the test set of C5 having more variability, being generated With different randomly selected seedvalues. Similarly, the accuracy in the C4 case is higher than in C2, since in C4 the train set Wasgenerated With several different randomly selected seed values, and thus is more representative. Theseobservations confirm out initial conclusions, draWn from tab. 2.
