Table 2: Structure of the networks used in the experiments. The design of network is based onSpringenberg et al. (2014), but we also add batch normalization before the activations of each layer.
Table 1: Average variational lower-bound L on the testing dataset for a simple VAE, where the sizeof the latent variable Z is 256 ∙ k and the encoder/decoder each contain 512 ∙ k hidden units. Thelatent variable z is implemented either using a Gaussian vector or using Information Dropout. Bothmethods achieve a similar performance.
