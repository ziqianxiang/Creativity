Table 1: Actuation models and their respective actuator parameters.
Table 2: Training hyperparameters.
Table 3: The number of state, action, and actuation model parameters for different characters andactuation models.
Table 4: Performance of policies trained for the various characters and actuation models. Perfor-mance is measured using the normalized cumulative reward (NCR) and learning speed is representedby the normalized area under each learning curve (AUC). The best performing parameterizations foreach character and motion are in bold.
