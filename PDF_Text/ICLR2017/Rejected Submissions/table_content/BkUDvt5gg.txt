Table 1: CTC vs ASG. CTC is Baiduâ€™s implementation. ASG is implemented on CPU (C withOpenMP). Timings (in ms) for small sequences (input frames: 150, letter vocabulary size: 28,transcription size: 40) and long sequences (input frames: 700, letter vocabulary size: 28, transcriptionsize: 200) are reported in (a) and (b) respectively. (c) reports performance in LER. Timings includeboth forward and backward passes. CPU implementations use 8 threads.
