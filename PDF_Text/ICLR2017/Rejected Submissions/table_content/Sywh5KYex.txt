Table 1: Test error (%) on the MNIST dataset for fully-connected networks. Augmented modelsoutperform their original counterparts in all experiments. Non-augmented plain networks performworse and fail to converge for d = 50 and d = 100.
Table 2: Mean k for increasingly deep Gated PlainNets and Gated ResNets.
Table 3: Test error (%) on the CIFAR-10 dataset, for ResNets, Wide ResNets and their augmentedcounterparts. k decay is when weight decay is also applied to the k parameters in an augmentednetwork. Results for the original models are as reported in He et al. (2015b) and Zagoruyko &Komodakis (2016).
Table 4: Test error (%) on the CIFAR-10 dataset, for Wide ResNets and their augmented counter-parts. Results for non-gated Wide ResNets are from Zagoruyko & Komodakis (2016).
Table 5: Test error (%) on the CIFAR-100 dataset, for Wide ResNets and their augmented counter-parts. Results for non-gated Wide ResNets are from Zagoruyko & Komodakis (2016).
Table 6: Test error (%) on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 dataset. All results are with standard dataaugmentation (crops and flips).
