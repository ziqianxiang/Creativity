Table 1: ADVERSARIAL TRAINING ON LENET. Collected metrics of adversarial images generated onthe MNIST Test dataset using FGS, FGV, HC, and LOTS approaches on corresponding models. The tablecontains metrics for a Basic LeNet model trained regularly, and for InfiMNIST which is a LeNet model trainedwith 2M digits. Other models were obtained by generating adversarial examples for the MNIST Trainingdataset on Basic LeNet and then using those samples to fine-tune Basic LeNet with the adversarial type listedas the model name. For each adversarial type success rate, PASS, and, below, L2 and Lâˆž norms are listed.
