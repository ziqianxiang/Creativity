Table 1: SkeWness (3rd moment) and kurtosis (4th moment) for the experiments: (1) In the M =N + 2 b âˆšNC it is clear that these normalized moments nearly coincide and they are quite distinct forM = N. (2) Gumbel like distribution in spin glasses and QR. (3) Gaussian-like distribution, With aflat left tail for deep learning.
