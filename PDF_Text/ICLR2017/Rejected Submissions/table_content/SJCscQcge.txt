Table 1: The top row shows the original images and the bottom row shows the perturbed images. Themisclassification is as follows: (a) a stingray misclassified as a sea lion, (b) an ostrich misclassified asa goose, (c) a jay misclassified as a junco, and (d) a water ouzel misclassified as a redshank.
Table 2: The row contains original images followed by misclassified images where only one pixel(pointed using a black arrow) was perturbed with perturbation parameter p = 1. After perturbation,in the first case (images (a) and (b)) an automobile gets misclassified as a truck, and in the secondcase (images (c) and (d)) a cat gets misclassified as a dog.
Table 4: Results for four datasets: CIFAR10, STL10, SVHN, and MNIST. The entries denote bydenoted by "- " are the cases where the fast-gradient sign method fails to produce any adversarialimage in our experimental setup.
Table 5: Results for the ImageNet1000 dataset using a center crop of size 224 Ã— 224 for each image.
