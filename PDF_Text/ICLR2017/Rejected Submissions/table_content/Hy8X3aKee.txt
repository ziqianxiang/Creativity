Table 1: Performance comparison of fault prediction methods on Backblaze Reliability dataset.
Table 2: Performance comparison of the iRNN on raw data as well as iRNN using the proposedcharacter-level embedding methods on symbolized data for seizure prediction.
Table 3: Performance comparison of LR and LSTM on hand-designed features as well as the resultsgenerated using LSTM using the proposed embedding methods on symbolized data for fault predictionon Thermo-technology dataset.
Table 4: Number of trainable parameters for the three proposed embedding layers as well as totalparameters of the network used in the three studied application. For the WdE on heating systemdata, an approximate number is provided as the vocabulary size is dependent on the training set usedamong the three cross-validations splits.
