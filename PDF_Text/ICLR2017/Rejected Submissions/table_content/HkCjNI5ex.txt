Table 1: Test error (%) for permutation-invariant MNIST.
Table 2: Test error (%) on Cifar-10 without data augmentation.
Table 3: Validation and test perplexity for word-level Penn Treebank.
Table 4: Validation and test BLEU for WMTâ€™14 English-to-German. For the last four model con-figurations, we report the mean and standard error of the mean (SEM) over 5 random initializations.
Table 5: Validation and test phoneme error rates (PER) for TIMIT. We report the mean and SEMover 5 random initializations.
Table 6: Validation and test word error rates (WER) for WSJ. For Baseline, Uniform Label Smooth-ing and Confidence Penalty we report the average over two runs. For the best setting (UnigramLabel Smoothing), we report the average over 6 runs together with the standard deviation.
