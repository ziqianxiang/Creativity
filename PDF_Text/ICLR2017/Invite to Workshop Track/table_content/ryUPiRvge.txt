Table 1: Numeric results on pendulum dataset. Reported are the mean and standard deviation of theroot mean squares error (RMS) (√E, Eq. (1)) on different test sets for 10 random initializations.
Table 2: Extrapolation performance for kinematic of robotic arms. See Tab. 1 for details. Standarddeviations for 5 random initializations. Interpolation error for all methods is around 0.012 ± 0.02	kin-3-end	kin-4-end	kin-5-allEQL	0.017 ± 0.000	0.012 ± 0.000	0.011 ± 0.000MLP	0.389 ± 0.014	0.415 ± 0.020	0.346 ± 0.013SVR	0.235	0.590	0.260noise and the number of available training points we provide a quantification in Appendix A2. Inshort, increasing noise can be compensated by increasing amount of data to keep the performance.
Table 3: Interpolation and extrapolation performance for formula learning. See Tab. 1 for details.
Table 4: Interpolation and extrapolation performance for cart-pendulum dynamics. See Tab. 1 fordetails. Note that predicting 0 would yield an error of 0.96 on the far test set.
