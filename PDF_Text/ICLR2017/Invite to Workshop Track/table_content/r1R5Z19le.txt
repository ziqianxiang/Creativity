Table 1:	Results for MNIST. Using 100 labeled examples, no data-augmentation.
Table 2:	Results for Cifar-10. Using 4000 labeled samples, no data-augmentation.
Table 3: Convolutional models - (feature-maps, kernel, stride, padding) for each layer. Convolu-tional layers are each followed by ReLU and Batch-norm.
