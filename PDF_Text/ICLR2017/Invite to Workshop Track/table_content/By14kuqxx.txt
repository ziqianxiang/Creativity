Table 5: Performance benefit due to software guidance6.3	Improved Oneffset EncodingFigure 9 reports performance for Pragmatic when using the enhanced oneffset generator describedin Section 5.1. The considered configurations include PRA0b, PRA1b and PRA2b (with pallet syn-chronization), and PRA12bR. PRA0b degrades by 7%, but the other configurations show improvementsof 26%, 48%, and 41% respectively. A cause of degradation for PRA0b is the increased spread ofoneffset values (for example, the pair of neurons 011101, 010101 takes 4 cycles with conventionalencoding and 5 with enhanced encoding even though the total count of oneffsets is reduced from 7to 6).
