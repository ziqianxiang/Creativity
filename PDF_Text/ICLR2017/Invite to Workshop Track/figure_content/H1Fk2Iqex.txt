Figure 1: Top: Chirplet of Orca call with p=3, j=4, q=16, t=0.001, s=0.01, with usual FFT spectrogrambelow, Sampling Rate (SR) 22 kHz, 16 bits. Waves and Chirplets of Orca are: http://sabiod.
Figure 2: Some FCT displayed in the physical domain and in the time-frequency domain through aspectrogram. The first one reduces to a wavelet since the chirp rate is 0. One can see the importanceof the time duration and the chirp rate and well as the center frequency depending on what one wishesto capture.
Figure 3: FCT of 4 species of amazonian birds LifeClef 2015 challenge including BIRD10 datasetavailable online. The call patterns are the high SNR (red) regions. The species international codesare, from top to bottom, right to left: nnbhgj, aethwv, aksucy, nipfbr.
Figure 4: The Mean Average Precision on BIRD10 of the CNNs on Mel, raw audio, or FCT. Thetraining conditions are the same on the three CNNs, and they have similar size and topology (seeAnnexe). The CNN trained on FCT is slightly better than on Mel or raw audio, and is learning faster.
