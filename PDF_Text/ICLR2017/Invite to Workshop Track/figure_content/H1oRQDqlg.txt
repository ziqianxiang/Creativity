Figure 1: MNIST images generated by DCGAN and our SteinGAN. We use the joint model in (15)to allow us to generate images for each digit. We set m = 0.2.
Figure 2: Results on CIFAR-10. “500 Duplicate” denotes 500 images randomly subsampled fromthe training set, each duplicated 100 times. Upper: images simulated by DCGAN and SteinGAN(based on joint model (15)) conditional on each category. Middle: inception scores for samplesgenerated by various methods (all with 50,000 images) on inception models trained on ImageNet andCIFAR-10, respectively. Lower: testing accuracy on real testing set when using 50,000 simulatedimages to train ResNets for classification. SteinGAN achieves higher testing accuracy than DCGAN.
Figure 3: Results on CelebA. Upper: images generated by DCGAN and our SteinGAN. Lower:images generated by SteinGAN when performing a random walk ξ J ξ + 0.01 X Uniform([-1,1])on the random input ξ; we can see that a man with glasses and black hair gradually changes to awoman with blonde hair. See Figure 5 for more examples.
