Figure 1: Samples from the ConvDeconv model. First and second rows show first and last framerespectively from the test data. And the third row shows generated last frame samples.
Figure 2: Samples from the ConvLSTMDeconv model. Each row is a different sample. The leftsequence is the data and the right sequence is the generated data. Note that during generation modelonly see the first frame and for next time steps uses its own output from the last timestep.
Figure 3: Different model architectures. The first two on the left are ConvDeconv and ConvLST-MDeconv described in Section 4.1. And the two on the right are models used for the supervised fallprediction described in Section 4.2. Single frame predictor is the baseline model. And the doubleframe predictor is the model that uses the generated data.
Figure 4: Accuracy in percentage for each of the 9 models tested on test sets with a different numberof blocks. Each color represents the number of blocks that the model was tested on. 50% is chance.
