Figure 1: Depiction of how correlations between variables are introduced in the model. Left: originalproduct node with three children. Middle: combine Child1 and Child2 into a multivariate leaf node(Alg. 4). Right: create a mixture to model the correlation (Alg. 3).
Figure 2: Learning the structure from the toy dataset using univariate leaf nodes.
Figure 3: Blue dots are the data points from the toy dataset, and the red ellipses show the diagonalGaussian components learned. Left: after 200 data points. Right: after 500 data points.
