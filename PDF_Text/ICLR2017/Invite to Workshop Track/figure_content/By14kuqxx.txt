Figure 2:	An Example Illustrating How Pragmatic Skips Ineffectual Activation Bits Yet Exceedingthe Performance of a Bit-Parallel EngineThe bit-parallel unit of Figure 2a multiplies two activations with their respective weights and viaan adder reduces the two products. The unit reads all activation and weight, (n0 = 001(2) , n1 =010(2)) and (s0 = 001(2), s1 = 111(2)) respectively in a single cycle. As a result, the two sourcesof inefficiency EoP and LoE manifest here: n0 and n1 are represented using 3 bits instead of 2respectively due to EoP. Even in 2 bits, they each contain a zero bit due to LoE. As a result, fourineffectual terms are processed when using standard multipliers such as those derived from the Shiftand Add algorithm. In general, given N activation and weight pairs, this unit will take dN/2e cyclesto process them regardless of their precision and the essential bit content of the activations.

Figure 6:	Per-column synchronization example: one extra synapse register and 1x2 PIP array capa-ble of processing two windows in parallel. The two numbers per brick show: the first from the top isthe brick’s index, (0, 1, 2) and (00, 10, 20) for the bricks of the first and second window. The secondis the maximum count of oneffsets in its activations, (2, 4, 4) and (5, 2, 2) respectively. The numbersin the registers indicate the index of the corresponding bricks, i.e., a synapse register containing aK stores the weights corresponding to activation bricks with indexes K and K0 . In cycles 3 to 8,thicker lines indicate registers being loaded or wires being used.

The limit values are set to the maximum and the minimumactivation values for each layer and the quantization uses the recommended rounding mode.
