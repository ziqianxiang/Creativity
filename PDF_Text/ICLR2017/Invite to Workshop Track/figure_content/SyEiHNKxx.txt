Figure 1: Illustration of how a closed loop neural network controller would be used to actuate arobot. The neural network receives sensor signals from the sensors on the robot and uses these togenerate motor signals which are sent to the servo motors. The neural network can also generate asignal which it can use at the next timestep to control the robot.
Figure 2: (a) Illustration of the ball model used in the first task. (b) Illustration of the quadrupedrobot model with 8 actuated degrees of freedom, 1 in each shoulder, 1 in each elbow. The spine ofthe robot can collide with the ground, through 4 spheres in the inside of the cuboid. (c) Illustrationof the robot arm model with 4 actuated degrees of freedom.
