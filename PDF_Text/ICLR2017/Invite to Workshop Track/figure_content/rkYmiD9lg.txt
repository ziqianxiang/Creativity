Figure 1: An illustration of the TT-format for a 3 × 4 × 4 × 3 tensor A with the TT-rank equal 3.
Figure 2: An illustration of one stepof the Riemannian gradient descent.
Figure 3: A comparison between Riemannian optimization and SGD applied to the underlyingparameters of the TT-format (the baseline) for the rank-4 Exponential Machines. Numbers in thelegend stand for the batch size. The methods marked with ‘rand init’ in the legend (square and trianglemarkers) were initialized from a random TT-tensor from two different distributions (see Sec. 8.3),all other methods were initialized from the solution of ordinary linear logistic regression. Type-2random initialization is ommited from the Car dataset for the clarity of the figure.
Figure 4: The influence of the TT-rank onthe test AUC for the MovieLens 100Kdataset.
Figure 5: A comparison between Riemannian optimization and SGD applied to the underlyingparameters of the TT-format (the baseline) for the rank-4 Exponential Machines. Numbers in thelegend stand for the batch size. The methods marked with ‘rand init’ in the legend (square and trianglemarkers) were initialized from a random TT-tensor from two different distributions, all other methodswere initialized from the solution of ordinary linear logistic regression. See details in Sec. 8.2 and 8.3B Proof of Theorem 2Theorem 2 states that it is possible to initialize the weight tensor W of the proposed model from theweights w of the linear model.
Figure 6: A comparison between Riemannian optimization and SGD applied to the underlyingparameters of the TT-format (the baseline) for the rank-3 Exponential Machines on the syntheticdataset with high order interactions. The first number in each legend enrty stands for the batch size.
