Figure 1: Examples of activation functions learned for convolution layers on CIFAR-10. Specificallythese are of the type NPFC(4, 1). k = 53.2	Training with Learned Activation UnitsA practical difficulty is that training nonparametric deep nets often proved unstable, specifically fornetworks with convolution layers. To remedy this our two-stage procedure is given as a genericdescription in Algorithm 1.
