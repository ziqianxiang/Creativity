Figure 1: Prediction set examples on Imagenet. We show three examples of the class fox squirrel andthe 95% prediction sets generated by RAPS to illustrate how the size of the set changes as a function of thedifficulty of a test-time image.
Figure 2: Coverage and average set size on Imagenet for prediction sets from three methods. All methodsuse a ResNet-152 as the base classifier, and results are reported for 100 random splits of Imagenet-Val, each ofsize 20K. See Section 3.1 for full details.
Figure 3: Visualizations of conformal calibration and RAPS sets. In the left panel, the y-axis shows theempirical coverage on the conformal calibration set, and 1 — α0 =「(n + 1)(1 — α)~∖ /n. In the right panel, theprinted numbers indicate the cumulative probability plus penalty mass. For the indicated value TcCaɪ, the RAPSprediction set is {c, d, f, b}.
Figure 4: Set sizes produced with ReSNet-152. See Section 3.3 for details.
