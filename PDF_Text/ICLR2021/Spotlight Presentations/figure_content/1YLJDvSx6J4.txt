Figure 1: (A) Schematic of the geometric vector perceptron illustrating Algorithm 1. Given a tupleof scalar and vector input features (s, V), the perceptron computes an updated tuple (s0, V0). s0 is afunction of both s and V. (B) Illustration of the structure-based prediction tasks. In computationalprotein design (top), the goal is to predict an amino acid sequence that would fold into a givenprotein backbone structure. Individual atoms are represented as colored spheres. In model qualityassessment (bottom), the goal is to predict the quality score ofa candidate structure, which measuresthe similarity of the candidate with respect to the experimentally determined structure (in gray).
Figure 2: Four different learned vector channels of the MQA model are visualized on four separatestructures. The backbone is represented as a chain of points, and each vector is rooted at the positionof the amino acid node to which it belongs. From left to right: the vectors appear to A) point in thedirection of motion that would make the protein more compact; B) point along the central axis ofthe alpha helix; C) point outwards from the structure; and D) point inwards into the structure.
