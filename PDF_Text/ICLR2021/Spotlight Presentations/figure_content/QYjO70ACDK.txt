Figure 1: Empirical behavior of optimal measure σ, approximated by 1000 samples, on a circle for differentvalues of λc (the constant in the dual form of DSW in Definition 2) When μ and V are bivariate Gaussiandistributions sharing the same eigenvectors. When λC = 0, C = 1. When λC increases, C becomes small.
Figure 2:	(a) Comparison between DSW, SW, Max-SW, Max-GSW-NN, PRW and WD based on executiontime and performance. Here, each dot of SW and DSW corresponds to the number of projections chosen in{1, 10, 102, 5 × 102, 103, 5 × 103, 104}. Each dot of PRW corresponds to the dimension of the subspace chosenin {2, 5, 10, 50}; (b) Comparison between SW, DSW, Max-SW and Max-GSW-NN based on Wasserstein-2distance between distributions of learned model and test set over iterations; (c) Computation speed of distancesbased on the number of minibatch’s samples (log-log scale); (d) Effect of λC on the mean of absolute values ofpairwise cosine similarity between 10 random directions from the found distribution σ of DSW.
Figure 3:	Comparison between DSW, SW, Max-SW and Max-GSW-NN in terms of execution time andperformance. Here, each dot of SW and DSW corresponds to the number of projections chosen in {102 , 5 ×102, 103, 5 × 103, 104}. We set the minibatch size be 512 on CelebA and CIFAR, and be 4096 on LSUN.
