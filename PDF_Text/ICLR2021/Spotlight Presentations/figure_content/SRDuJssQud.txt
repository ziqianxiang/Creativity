Figure 1: Left. Traditional likelihood-free inference algorithm needs handcrafted design of summarystatistic, which requires expert knowledge. Right. Our method automatically mines a low dimensional,near-sufficient statistic s of x via the infomax principle, which removes the need for careful summarystatistic design. Furthermore, this statistics can be re-learned as the posterior inference proceeds.
