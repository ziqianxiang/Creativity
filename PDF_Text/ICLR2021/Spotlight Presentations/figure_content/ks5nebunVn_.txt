Figure 1: Visualization of how different methods capture the word substitutions in the vector space.
Figure 2: An illustration of the training process of the ASCC-defense. Step 1: Generate adversariesby ASCC with regularization. Step 2: Take adversaries as input to perform adversarial training.
Figure 3: Tradeoff between robustness and accuracy on IMDB under Genetic and PWWS attacks.
Figure 4: An illustration to show the effectiveness of the proposed sparsity regularization. Werandomly choose 300 adversaries of word “actually” from the test set of IMDB. Vectors are projectedinto a 2-dimensional space by SVD. Best view in color with zooming in.
