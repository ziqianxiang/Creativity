Figure 1: Comparison of GBDT classifiers without (a) and with (b) the fairness constraints introducedin this paper. The classifiers output a probability in [0, 1] - these probabilities are discretized to binarylabels to create a classification. In the figures, red points are individuals with true label 0 and bluepoints are individuals with true label 1. The darker red areas correspond to lower output probabilitiesand the darker blue areas correspond to higher output probabilities. The arrows in (b) indicate thetransport map corresponding to the fairness constraint for the previous boosting step.
Figure 2: Fairness measures at given aCCuraCy levels for the BuDRO method on the Adult data set,Considered over 10 train/test splits. The results from eaCh ChoiCe of hyperparameters are averagedover all train/test splits before being grouped into aCCuraCy bins. The plotted points are the onesfrom eaCh bin that optimize the speCified quantity ((a) average GapRMS , (b) raCe GapRMS , (C) genderGapRMS , (d) spouse ConsistenCy). Error bars represent one standard deviation. EmpiriCally, thegender gaps were harder to reduCe than the raCe gaps. The S-Cons in all of these piCtures never dropsbelow 94%.
Figure 3: The accuracy vs fairness trade-off of BuDRO when compared to other baseline boostingalgorithms on the Adult data set. All lines are chosen to minimize gender GapRMS . (a) contains acomparison of the Gender gap RMS. The BuDRO line also appears in Figure 2(c). (b) contains acomparison of the S-cons. Error bars represent one standard deviation.
