Figure 1: Training cost of the three-layer circular CNN trained with SGD (5 initialization trials)on a synthetic dataset (n = 6, d = 20, h = 3, stride = 1), where the green and red line with amarker represent the objective value obtained by the proposed convex program in equation 9 and thenon-convex objective value in equation 8 of a feasible network with the weights found by the convexprogram, respectively. We use markers to denote the total computation time of the convex solver.
Figure 2: Evaluation of the three-layer circular CNN trained with SGD (5 initialization trials) on asubset of MNIST (n = 99, d = 50, m = 20, h = 3, stride = 1) and CIFAR10 (n = 99, d = 50,m = 40, h = 3, stride = 1).
Figure 3: Training cost of a two-layer CNN (with average pooling) trained with SGD (5 initializationtrials) on a synthetic dataset (n = 6, d = 15, h = 10, stride = 5), where the green line with a markerrepresents the objective value obtained by the proposed convex program in equation 4 and the redline with a marker represents the non-convex objective value in equation 1 of a feasible network withthe weights found by the convex program. Here, we use markers to denote the total computation timeof the convex optimization solver.
Figure 4: Evaluation of two-layer CNNs trained with SGD on full CIFAR-10 (n = 10000, d = 3072,m = 50, h = 12, stride = 4).
