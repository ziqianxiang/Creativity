Figure 1: Simple to complex inputs.
Figure 2: The EEC curves. Each curve shows thefraction of test samples a model classifies using acertain fraction of its full inference cost. ‘EFCY’is short for the model’s efficacy.
Figure 3: Visualising features against attacks using UMAP. VGG-16's 3rd (left), 8th (middle), and 14th(right) hidden block features on CIFAR-10’s ’dog’ class (Best viewed in color, zoomed in).
Figure 4: Adversarial examPles from the standard and our DeePSloth attacks. The leftmostcolumn shows the clean images. In the next four columns, we show adversarial examples from PGD,PGD (avg.), PGD (max.), and UAP attacks, respectively. The last four columns include adversarialexamples from the three variants of DeepSloth. Each row corresponds to each sample, and the lastrow contains the average `inf -norm of the perturbations over the eight samples in each attack.
