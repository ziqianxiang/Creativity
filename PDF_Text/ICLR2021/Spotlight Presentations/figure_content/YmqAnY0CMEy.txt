Figure 2: The skip-tree training task for the example of the equality operator on boolean constants(original formula). In this example we assume that a part of the type was sampled to be thesubexpression to be predicted, and that subexpression C was sampled to be masked out additionally.
Figure 3: Histograms of premise usage of the conjectures generated through the assumptions task(left), the equality task (middle), and through free-form conjecturing (right). X-axes are the newtheorems, sorted by number of usages. Y-axes indicate the number of usages on a log scale.
Figure 4: Performance on the Missing Assumptions task of a model trained on the Skip-tree (weighted)task. Y-axis is the training steps and X-axis is the model performance as the ratio of correctly predictedexamples. Left: validation data. Right: test data.
