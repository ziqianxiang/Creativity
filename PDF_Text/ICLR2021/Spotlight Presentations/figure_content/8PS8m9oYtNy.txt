Figure 1: An illustration of our main theoretical results on the expressiveness power of ImpFlows and ResFlows. Panel (a) and Panel (b) correspond to results in Sec. 4.2 and Sec. 4.3 respectively.
Figure 2: A 1-D motivating example. (a) Plot of the target function. (b) Results of fitting the target function using ResFlows with different number of blocks. All functions have non-negligible approximation error due to the Lipschtiz constraint. (c) An ImpFlow that can exactly represent
the target function. (d) A visualization of compositing a ResFlow block and the inverse of another ResFlow block to construct an ImpFlow block. The detailed settings can be found in Appendix D.
Figure 3: Checkerboard data density and the results of a 8-block ResFlow and a 4-block ImpFlow.
Figure 4: 8-block ResFlow with different activation function trained on Checkerboard dataset.
Figure 5: Test NLL (in bits) by varying the network depth. Lower is better.
Figure 6: Qualitative samples on 5bit 64Ã—64 CelebA by ImpFlow, with a temperature of 0.8(Kingma& Dhariwal, 2018).
