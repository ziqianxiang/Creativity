Table 1: Impact of existing evasion attacks on efficacy. Each entry shows a model’s efficacy (left) andaccuracy (right) when subjected to the respective attack. The multi-exit models are trained on CIFAR-10 anduse RAD<5% as their early-exit strategy.
Table 2: The effectiveness of '∞ DeepSloth. 'RAD<5,15%' columns list the results in each early-exit setting.
Table 3: Evaluating adversarial training against slowdown attacks. Each entry includes themodel’s efficacy score (left) and accuracy (right). Results are on CIFAR-10, in the RAD<5% setting.
Table 4: The effectiveness of`1 DeepSloth. ‘RAD<5,15%’ columns list the results in each early-exitsetting. Each entry includes the model’s efficacy score (left) and accuracy (right). The class-universalattack’s results are an average of 10 classes. ‘TI’ is Tiny Imagenet and ‘C10’ is CIFAR-10.
Table 5: The effectiveness of'2 DeepSloth. ‘RAD<5,15%’ columns list the results in each early-exitsetting. Each entry includes the model’s efficacy score (left) and accuracy (right). The class-universalattack’s results are an average of 10 classes. ‘TI’ is Tiny Imagenet and ‘C10’ is CIFAR-10.
Table 6: The effectiveness of DeepSloth on the ResNet-based models. ‘RAD<5,15%’ columnslist the results in each early-exit setting. Each entry includes the model’s efficacy score (left) andaccuracy (right). The class-universal attack’s results are an average of 10 classes.
