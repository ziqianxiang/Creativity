Table 1: Characteristics of the grids. Nsub, Nline , Ngen , Nload is the total number of substations,lines, generators, and loads. |S | is the dimension of state, |A| is the number of unitary busassignment actions, n is the dimension of topology configuration.
Table 2: Performance measured by the scaled score on the 10 test scenarios averaged over 3 instanceswith standard error. Each the best policy is obtained from the one with the highest performance inthe validation scenarios during training.
