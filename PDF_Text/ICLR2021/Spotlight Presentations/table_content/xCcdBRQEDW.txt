Table 1: The averaged normalized incremental IoU scores and the standard deviations of eachmethod. Adam-H stands for optimizing on the hard contact model with Adam optimizer. We trainRL agent for 10000 episodes and optimizing for 200 episodes for gradient-based approaches.
Table 2: Performance on an NVIDIA GTX 1080 Ti GPU. We show the average running time for asingle forward or forward + backpropagation step for each scene.

We vary the yield stress from 10 to 1000 togenerate 6 environments and train SAC on them. Figure 5 plots the agents’ performances w.r.t.
