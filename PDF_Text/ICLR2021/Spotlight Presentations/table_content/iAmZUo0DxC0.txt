Table 1: The top-1 clean test accuracies (%) of DNNs trained on the clean training sets (Dc) or theirunlearnable ones (Du) made by sample-wise (∆s) or class-wise (∆c) error-minimizing noise.
Table 2: Effectiveness under different unlearnable percentages on CIFAR-10 with RN-18 model:lower clean accuracy indicates better effectiveness. Du + Dc : a mix of unlearnable and clean data;Dc: only the clean proportion of data. Percentage of unlearnable examples: DDuD .
Table 3: Clean test accuracy of RN-18 modelstrained on unlearnable CIFAR-10 with Cutout,Mixup, Cutmix and FA. Test accuracy of RN-18trained on the clean CIFAR-10 is 94.95%.
Table 4: Detailed class mapping from ImageNet classes to CIFAR-10 classes. This mapping is usedfor the second transfer experiment in Section 4.4.
Table 5: Clean test accuracy of RN-18 models trained on unlearnable CIFAR-10 by either small patchnoise applied at random location or a mixture of two type of noises.
