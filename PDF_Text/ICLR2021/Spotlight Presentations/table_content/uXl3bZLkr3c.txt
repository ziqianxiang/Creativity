Table 1: Adaptation settings differ by their data and therefore losses during training and testing. Ofthe source s and target t data x and labels y, our fully test-time setting only needs the target data xt .
Table 2: Corruption benchmark on CIFAR-10-Cand CIFAR-100-C for the highest severity. Tenthas least error, with less optimization than domainadaptation (RG, UDA-SS) and test-time training(TTT), and improves on test-time norm (BN).
Table 3: Digit domain adaptation from SVHN to MNIST/MNIST-M/USPS. Source-free adaptation isnot only feasible, but more efficient. Tent always improves on normalization (BN), and in 2/3 casesachieves less error than domain adaptation (RG, UDA-SS) without joint training on source & target.
Table 4: Tent adapts alternative architectures on CIFAR-100-C without tuning. Results are error (%).
