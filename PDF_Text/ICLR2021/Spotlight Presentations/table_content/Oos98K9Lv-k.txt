Specifically, in DWL and OTLDA, documents and topics locatein one space of words (i.e., both are distributions over words) and x can be approximated withthe weighted Wasserstein barycentres of all the topic-word distributions, where the weights can beinterpreted as the topic proportions of the document, i.e., z. However, in NSTM, a document locatesin both the topic space and the word space and topics and words are embedded in the embeddingspace. These differences lead to different views of topic modelling and different frameworks as well.
