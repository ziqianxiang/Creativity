Ab stract
We consider the task of enforcing individual fairness in gradient boosting. Gradient
boosting is a popular method for machine learning from tabular data, which arise
often in applications where algorithmic fairness is a concern. At a high level, our
approach is a functional gradient descent on a (distributionally) robust loss function
that encodes our intuition of algorithmic fairness for the ML task at hand. Unlike
prior approaches to individual fairness that only work with smooth ML models,
our approach also works with non-smooth models such as decision trees. We show
that our algorithm converges globally and generalizes. We also demonstrate the
efficacy of our algorithm on three ML problems susceptible to algorithmic bias.
1	Introduction
In light of the ubiquity of machine learning (ML) methods in high-stakes decision-making and support
roles, there is concern about ML models reproducing or even exacerbating the historical biases against
certain groups of users. These concerns are valid: there are recent incidents in which algorithmic
bias has led to dire consequences. For example, Amazon recently discovered its ML-based resume
screening system discriminates against women applying for technical positions (Dastin, 2018).
In response, the ML community has proposed a myriad of formal definitions of algorithmic fairness.
Broadly speaking, there are two types of fairness definitions: group fairness and individual fairness
(Chouldechova & Roth, 2018). In this paper, we focus on enforcing individual fairness. At a high-
level, the idea of individual fairness is the requirement that a fair algorithm should treat similar
individuals similarly. For a while, individual fairness was overlooked in favor of group fairness
because there is often no consensus on which users are similar for many ML tasks. Fortunately, there
is a flurry of recent work that addresses this issue (Ilvento, 2019; Wang et al., 2019; Yurochkin et al.,
2020; Mukherjee et al., 2020a). In this paper, we assume there is a fair metric for the ML task at hand
and consider the task of individually fair gradient boosting.
Gradient boosting, especially gradient boosted decision trees (GBDT), is a popular method for tabular
data problems (Chen & Guestrin, 2016). Unfortunately, existing approaches to enforcing individual
fairness are either not suitable for training non-smooth ML models (Yurochkin et al., 2020) or perform
poorly with flexible non-parametric ML models. We aim to fill this gap in the literature. Our main
contributions are:
1.	We develop a method to enforce individual fairness in gradient boosting. Unlike other methods for
enforcing individually fairness, our approach handles non-smooth ML models such as (boosted)
decision trees.
2.	We show that the method converges globally and leads to ML models that are individually fair.
We also show that it is possible to certify the individual fairness of the models a posteriori.
3.	We show empirically that our method preserves the accuracy of gradient boosting while improving
widely used group and individual fairness metrics.

2	Enforcing individual fairness in gradient boosting
Consider a supervised learning problem. Let X ⊂ Rd be the input space and Y be the output
space. To keep things simple, we assume Y = {0, 1}, but our method readily extends to multi-class
classification problems. Define Z = X × {0, 1}. We equip X with a fair metric dx that measures the
similarity between inputs. The fair metric is application specific, and we refer to the literature on fair
metric learning (Ilvento, 2019; Wang et al., 2019; Yurochkin et al., 2020) for ways of picking the
fair metric. Our goal is to learn an ML model f : X → {0, 1} that is individually fair. Formally, we
enforce distributionally robust fairness (Yurochkin et al., 2020), which asserts that an ML model has
similar accuracy/performance (measured by the loss function) on similar samples (see Definition 2.1).
One way to accomplish this is adversarial training (Yurochkin et al., 2020; Yurochkin & Sun, 2020).
Unfortunately, adversarial training relies on the smoothness of the model (with respect to the inputs),
so it cannot handle non-smooth ML models (e.g. decision trees). We address this issue by considering
a restricted adversarial cost function that only searches over the training examples (instead of the
entire input space) for similar examples that reveal violations of individual fairness. As we shall see,
this restricted adversarial cost function is amenable to functional gradient descent, which allows us to
develop a gradient boosting algorithm.
2.1	Enforcing individual fairnes s with a restricted adversarial cost function
We first review how to train individually fair ML models with adversarial training (see Yurochkin
et al. (2020) for more details) to set up notation and provide intuition on how adversarial training
leads to individual fairness. Let F be a set of ML models, let ` : Y × Y → R be a smooth loss
function (see Section 3 for concrete assumptions on `) that measures the performance of an ML
model, and let D = {(xi, yi)}in=1 be a set of training data. Define the transport cost function
c((x1,yi), (x2,y2)) , dl(x1,x2) + ∞ ∙ l{y1=y2}.	(2.1)
We see that c((x1, y1), (x2, y2)) is small iff x1 and x2 are similar (in the fair metric dx) and y1 = y2.
In other words, c is small iff two similar examples are assigned the same output. Define the optimal
transport distance W (with transport cost c) on probability distributions on Z :
W(P1,P2) , infΠ∈C(P1,P2) Z×Z c(z1,z2)dΠ(z1, z2),
where C(P1, P2) is the set of couplings between P1 and P2 (distributions on Z × Z whose marginals
are P1 and P2). This optimal transport distance lifts the fair metric on (points in) the sample space to
distributions on the sample space. Two distributions are close in this optimal transport distance iff
they assign mass to similar areas of the sample space Z . Finally, define the adversarial risk function
Lr (f )，SUPP: W (P,P*)≤e EP ['(f(X ),Y)],	QZ
where P* is the data generating distribution and e > 0 is a small tolerance parameter. The adversarial
risk function looks for distributions on the sample space that (i) are similar to the data generating
distribution and (ii) increases the risk of the ML model f. This reveals differential performance of
the ML model on similar samples. This search for differential performance is captured by the notion
of distributionally robust fairness:
Definition 2.1 (distributionally robust fairness (DRF) (Yurochkin et al., 2020)). An ML model
h : X → Y is (e, δ)-distributionally robustly fair (DRF) WRT the fair metric dx iff
supP:W (P,Pn)≤ RZ `(z, h)dP (z) ≤ δ.	(2.3)
In light of the preceding developments, a natural cost function for training individually fair ML
models is the adversarial cost function:
Le(f) , supP: W (P,Pn)≤ EP [`(f (X), Y)],	(2.4)
where Pn is the empirical distribution of the training data. This is the empirical counterpart of (2.2),
and it works well for training smooth ML models (Yurochkin et al., 2020). Unfortunately, (2.4) is
hard to evaluate for non-smooth ML models: it is defined as the optimal value of an optimization
problem, but the gradient ∂x'(f (x), y) is not available because the ML model f is non-smooth.

To circumvent this issue, we augment the support of the training set and restrict the supremum in
(2.4) to the augmented support. Define the augmented support set D0 , {(xi, yi), (xi, 1 - yi)}in=1
and the restricted optimal transport distance WD between distributions supported on D0 :
WD(P1, P2) , infΠ∈C0(P1,P2) Z×Z c(z1, z2)dΠ(z1, z2),
where C0(P1, P2) is the set of distributions supported on D0 × D0 whose marginals are P1 and P2.
We consider the restricted adversarial cost function
L(f) , supp： Wd (p,Pn)≤e Ep ['(f(X ),Y)],	(2.5)
where > 0 is a small tolerance parameter. The interpretation of (2.5) is identical to that of (2.4): it
searches for perturbations to the training examples that reveal differential performance in the ML
model. On the other hand, compared to (2.4), the supremum in (2.5) is restricted to distributions
supported on D0. This allows us to evaluate (2.5) by solving a (finite-dimensional) linear program
(LP). As We shall see, this LP depends only on the loss values '(f (xi), yj and '(f (xi), 1 - y。, so it
is possible to solve the LP efficiently even if the ML model f is non-smooth. This is the key idea in
this paper.
Before delving into the details, We note that the main draWback of restricting the search to distributions
supported on D0 is reduced poWer to detect differential performance. If the ML model exhibits
differential performance betWeen tWo (similar) areas of the input space but only one area is represented
in the training set, then (2.4) Will detect differential performance but (2.5) Will not. Augmenting the
support set With the points {(xi, 1 - yi)}in=1 partially alleviates this issue (but the poWer remains
reduced compared to (2.4)). This is the price We pay for the broader applicability of (2.5).
2.2	Functional gradient descent on the restricted adversarial cost function
Gradient boosting is functional gradient descent (Friedman, 2001), so a key step in gradient boosting
is evaluating ∂^, where the components of y ∈ Rn are r^i，f (xi). By Danskin,s theorem, we have
∂L = ∂f↑xi) [ supP ： WD (P,Pn)≤e EP['(f (Xi),yi)]] = Py∈Y ∂f fxi) ['(f (Xi), y A] P" (Xi，y)，
(2.6)
where P" is a distribution that attains the supremum in (2.5). We note that there is no need to
differentiate through the ML model f in (2.6), so it is possible to evaluate the functional gradient for
non-smooth ML models. It remains to find P" . We devise a way of finding P" by solving a linear
program.
We start with a simplifying observation: if c(zi, zj ) = ∞ for any zi ∈ D0 and zj ∈ D, then any
weight at zj cannot be transported to zi. Thus, we will only focus on the pairs (zi, zj) ∈ D0 × D with
c(zi, zj) < ∞. Let C ∈ Rn×n be the matrix with entries given by Ci,j = c((Xi, yj), (Xj, yj)) =
d2x(Xi, Xj). We also define	the class indicator vectors y1, y0	∈ {0,	1}n by
yj1 = 1 :	yj = 1 and y0	= 1n	- y1 .	(2.7)
j 0 :	yj = 0
For any distribution	P	on	D0, let Pi,k	= P({(Xi, k)}) for k ∈	{0, 1}. Then, the condition	that
WD(P, Pn) ≤ is implied by the existence of a matrix Π such that
1.	∏ ∈ Γ with Γ = {Π∣Π ∈ R+×n, hC, ∏i ≤ e, Πt ∙ 1n = n 1n}.
2.	∏ ∙ y1 = (Pι,ι,..., Pn, ι), and Π ∙ y0 = (P1,o,..., Pn,o).
Further define the matrix R ∈ Rn×n by Rij = `(f (Xi), yj) - this is the loss incurred if point j with
label yj is transported to point i. With this setup, given the current predictor f , we can obtain a
solution Π" to the optimization as the solution to the linear program (in n2 variables)
Π" ∈ arg max hR, Πi.
Π∈Γ
(2.8)
Then the optimal distribution P" on Do is given by P "({(xi, k)}) = (∏* ∙ yk)i. An outline of the
full gradient boosting procedure is provided in Algorithm 1.
It is important to note that we have made no assumptions about the class of candidate predictors F in
finding the optimal transport map Π" in (2.8). In particular, F can contain discontinuous functions
- for example, decision trees or sums of decision trees. This allows us to apply this fair gradient
boosting algorithm to any class F of base classifiers.

2.3 Related Work
Enforcing individual fairness. There is a line of work that seeks to improve fairness guarantees
for individuals by enforcing group fairness with respect to many (possibly overlapping) groups
(HCbert-Johnson et al., 2017; Kearns et al., 2017; Creager et al., 2019; Kearns et al., 2019; Kim
et al., 2019). There is another line of work on enforcing individual fairness without access to a fair
metric (Gillen et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2018; Jung et al., 2019; Kearns et al., 2019). This line of work
circumvents the need for a fair metric by assuming the learner has access to an oracle that provides
feedback on violations of individual fairness. Our work is part of a third line of work on enforcing
individual fairness that assumes access to a fair metric (Yurochkin et al., 2020; Yurochkin & Sun,
2020). The applicability of these methods has broadened thanks to recent work on the precursor task
of learning the fair metric from data (Ilvento, 2019; Lahoti et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019; Mukherjee
et al., 2020b). Unfortunately, these methods are limited to training smooth ML models.
Adversarial training and distributionally robust optimization. Our approach to fair training is
also similar to adversarial training (Goodfellow et al., 2014; Madry et al., 2017), which hardens ML
models against adversarial attacks. There are two recent papers on fitting robust non-parametric
classifiers (including decision trees) (Yang et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2019) but neither are applicable to
enforcing individual fairness in gradient boosting. Our approach is also an instance of distributionally
robust optimization (DRO) (Blanchet et al., 2016; Duchi & Namkoong, 2016; Esfahani & Kuhn,
2015; Lee & Raginsky, 2017; Sinha et al., 2017; Hashimoto et al., 2018).
Before moving on, we remark that the key idea in this paper cannot be applied to adversarial
training of non-smooth ML models. The goal of adversarial training is to make ML model robust
to adversarial examples that are not in the training set. The restriction to the augmented support
set in (2.5) precludes such adversarial examples, so training with (2.5) does not harden the model
against adversarial examples. On the other hand, as long as the training set is diverse enough (see
Assumption 3.3 for a rigorous condition to this effect), it is possible to reveal differential performance
in the ML model by searching over the augmented support set and enforce individual fairness.
3 Theoretical results
We study the convergence and generalization properties of fair gradient boosting (Algorithm 1).
The optimization properties are standard: fair gradient boosting together with a line search strategy
converges globally. This is hardly surprising in light of the global convergence properties of line
search methods (see (Nocedal & Wright, 2006, Chapter 3)), so we defer this result to Appendix A.1.
The generalization properties of fair gradient boosting are less standard. We start by stating the
assumptions on the problem. The first two assumptions are standard in the DRO literature (see Lee &
Raginsky (2017) and Yurochkin et al. (2020)).
Assumption 3.1 (boundedness of input space). diam(X ) < ∞
Assumption 3.2 (regularity of loss function). (i) ` is bounded: 0 ≤ `(f, z) ≤ B ∀ f ∈ F, z ∈ Z.
(ii) Let L，{'(f, ∙) : f ∈ F} denote the class oflosSfunctions. L is ω?-Lipschitz with respect to dx:
|'(f, (xι,y)) - '(f, (X2,y))l ≤ ω2dχ(x1,x2) forall X1,X2 ∈ X, y ∈ Y and f ∈ F.

Additionally, the support of the data generating distribution P* should cover the input space. Oth-
erwise, the training data may miss areas of the input space, which precludes detecting differential
treatment in these areas. Similar conditions appear in the non-parametric classification literature,
under the name strong density condition (Audibert & Tsybakov, 2007).
Assumption 3.3. Let Bdx (r, x*) = {x ∈ X : dx(x, x*) < r} be the dx-ball of radius r around x*
in X. There are constants δ > 0 and d such that P*(Bdx (r, x) × Y) ≥ δrd for any r < 1.
The lower bound δrd in Assumption 3.3 is motivated by the volume of the Euclidean ball of radius r
in Rd being proportional to rd. For a bounded input space X, Assumption 3.3 implies the probability
mass assigned by P* to small balls is always comparable (up to the small constant δ) to the probability
mass assigned by the uniform distribution on X. We note that this assumption is close to the goal of
Buolamwini & Gebru (2018) in their construction of the Pilot Parliaments Benchmark data.
Theorem 3.4. Under Assumptions 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3, we have
SUPf ∈F ILf) - Lr (f )| .p nι∕(2d) (ω2 + —2-√a=m(-) ) + √n	(3.1)
The first term on the right side of (3.1) is the discrepancy between L and Le, while the second term
is the discrepancy between Le and Lr (recall (2.2) and (2.4)). The second term is well-studied in
the DRO literature (Lee & Raginsky, 2017; Yurochkin et al., 2020), so we focus on the first term,
which captures the effect of restricting the search space in the supremum in (2.5) to the augmented
support set D°. We see the curse of dimensionality in the slow 小/*)convergence rate, but this
is unavoidable. For the restricted search for differential performance on D0 to emulate the search
on X , the size of D0 must grow exponentially with the dimension d. This leads to the exponential
dependence on d in the first term.
We note that it is possible for the dimension d in Assumption 3.3 to be smaller than dim(X ).
Intuitively, the fair metric dx ignores variation in the inputs due to the sensitive attributes. This
variation is usually concentrated in a low-dimensional set because there are few sensitive attributes in
most ML tasks. Thus the metric effectively restricts the search to this low-dimensional space, so the
effective dimension of the search is smaller. In such cases, the convergence rate will depend on the
(smaller) effective dimension of the search.
One practical consequence of Theorem 3.4 is it is possible to certify a posteriori that a (non-smooth)
ML model is individually fair by checking the empirical performance gap
L(f) - 1 Pn=ι '(f(xi),yi).	(3.2)
As long as the (non-adversarial) empirical risk converges to its population value, Theorem 3.4 implies
SUpf ∈F ∣L(f) - n pn=ι '(f(xi), yi) - (Lr(f) - Ep* ['(f (X), Y )])∣→→ 0.	(3.3)
In other words, the (empirical) performance gap L(f) - n P:ι '(f (xi),yi) generalizes. Thus it is
possible for practitioners to certify the worst-case performance differential of an ML model (up to an
error term that vanishes in the large sample limit) by evaluating (3.2).
4 S calable fair gradient boosting
A key step in the fair gradient boosting Algorithm 1 is finding the worst-case distribution P*. This
entails solving a linear program (LP) in n2 variables (n is the size of the training set). It is possible to
use an off-the-shelf LP solver to find P* , but solving an LP in n2 variables per iteration does not scale
to modern massive datasets. In this section, we appeal to duality to derive a stochastic optimization
approach to finding the worst-case distribution. At a high level, the approach consists of two steps:
1.	Solve the dual of (2.8). The dual is a univariate optimization problem, and it is amenable to
stochastic optimization (see (B.14)). Computational complexity is O(n).
2.	Reconstruct the primal optimum from the dual optimum. Computational complexity is O(n2).
We see that the computational complexity of this step is O(n2), which is much smaller than the
complexity of solving an LP in n2 variables. This two-step approach is similar to the dual approach
5
Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021
to solving (unrestricted) DRO problems. Due to space constraints, we summarize the two steps
in Algorithm 2 and defer derivations to Appendix B. We also include in Appendix B an entropic
regularized version of the approach that sacrifices exactness for additional computational benefits.
We remark that it is possible to achieve further speedups by exploiting the properties of the fair
metric. We start by observing that the cost of recovering the primal solution (step 10 in Algorithm 2)
dominates the computational cost of Algorithm 2. Recall the search for differential performance is
restricted by the fair metric to a small set of points. This implies the argmax in step 10 of Algorithm
2 is restricted to a few points that are similar to xj in the fair metric. This can be seen from the
corresponding argmax expression: if Cij is large, i is unlikely to be a solution to argmax. The
neighbors of each point can be computed in advance and re-used during training. This further reduces
the cost of recovering the primal solution from O(n2) to O(nm), where m is the maximum number
of neighbors of a point. With this heuristic it should be possible to train our algorithm whenever the
vanilla GBDT is feasible.
We now state the full fair gradient boosting algorithm that combines the framework presented
in Section 2.1 with the preceding stochastic optimization approach to evaluating the worst-case
distribution. We refer to the GBDT method as TreeBoost; this can be replaced with any GBDT
algorithm. In every boosting step in Algorithm 3, We find the optimal transport map Π* using
Algorithm 2. We then boost for one step using the GBDT training methods on the augmented data
set Do weighted according to the distribution given by P({xi, k}) = (Π* ∙ yk)i. There are multiple
hyperparameters that can be tWeaked in the GBDT model (e.g. the maximum depth of the trees in F);
we represent this by including a list of GBDT parameters ρ as an input to Algorithm 3.

5	Experiments
We apply BuDRO (Algorithm 3) to three data sets popular in the fairness literature. Full descriptions
of these data sets and a synthetic example are included in Appendix C. Timing information is also
found in Appendix C.6. BuDRO uses the XGBoost algorithm (Chen & Guestrin, 2016) for the GBDT
6

method, and ` is the logistic loss. These experiments reveal that BuDRO is successful in enforcing
individual fairness while achieving high accuracy (leveraging the power of GBDTs). We also observe
improvement of the group fairness metrics.
Fair metric. Recall that a practical implementation of our algorithm requires a fair metric. We
consider the procedure from Yurochkin et al. (2020) to learn the fair metric from data. They propose a
metric of the form d2x(x1, x2) = hx1 - x2, Q(x1 - x2)i, where Q is the projecting matrix orthogonal
to some sensitive subspace. This sensitive subspace is formed by taking the span of the vectors
orthogonal to decision boundaries of linear classifiers fitted to predict a (problem specific) set of
protected attributes (e.g. gender, race or age). The idea behind this procedure is that the sensitive
subspace captures variation in the data due to protected information of the individuals. A fair metric
should treat individuals that only differ in their protected information similarly, i.e. a distance between
a pair of individuals that only differ by a component in the sensitive subspace should be 0.
Comparison methods. We consider other possible implementations of fair GBDT given existing
techniques in the literature. As mentioned previously, due to the non-differentiability of trees, the
majority of other individual fairness methods are not applicable to the GBDT framework. For
this reason, we limit our analysis to fair data preprocessing techniques before applying a vanilla
GBDT method. We report the results when considering two preprocessing techniques: project that
eliminates the protected attributes and projects out the sensitive subspace used for the fair metric
construction (Yurochkin et al., 2020), and reweigh that balances the representations of protected
groups by assigning different weights to the individuals (Kamiran & Calders, 2011).
Evaluation metrics. To evaluate the individual fairness of each method without appealing to the
underlying fair metric (i.e. to avoid giving our method and project an unfair advantage at test time,
and to verify generalization properties of the fair metric used for training), we report data-specific
consistency metrics. Specifically, for each data set, we find a set of attributes that are not explicitly
protected but are correlated with the protected attribute (e.g. is_husband or is_wife when
gender is protected) and vary these attributes to create artificial counterfactual individuals. Such
counterfactual individuals are intuitively similar to the original individuals and classifier output should
be the same for all counterfactuals to satisfy individual fairness. We refer to classification consistency
as the frequency of a classifier changing its predictions on the aforementioned counterfactuals.
We also examine group fairness for completeness. We consider the group fairness metrics introduced
in De-Arteaga et al. (2019). Specifically, we compute the differences in TPR and TNR for each pro-
tected attribute, and report the maximum (GAPMax) and the root-mean-squared statistics (GAPRMS)
of these gaps. See Appendix C for a full description of all comparison metrics.
5.1	German credit
The German credit data set (Dua & Graff, 2017) contains information from 1000 individuals; the ML
task is to label the individuals as good or bad credit risks. We treat age as the protected attribute
in the German data set. The age feature is not binary; this precludes the usage of fair methods that
assume two protected classes (including the reweighing preprocessing technique). In the United
States, it is unlawful to make credit decisions based on the age of the applicant; thus, there are distinct
legal reasons to be able to create a classifier that does not discriminate based on age.
For the fair metric, we construct the sensitive subspace by fitting ridge regression on age and augment
it with an indicator vector for the age coordinate (see Appendix C.3). This subspace is also used for
data preprocessing with the project baseline. For the individual fairness consistency evaluation we
consider varying a personal status feature that encodes both gender and marital status (S-cons).

We present the results in Table 1 (see Table 5 for error bars). To compare classification performance
we report balanced accuracy due to class imbalance in the data. The baseline (GBDTs with XGBoost)
is the most accurate and significantly outperforms a baseline neural network (NN). The BuDRO
method has the highest individual fairness (S-cons) score while maintaining a high accuracy and
improved group fairness metrics. Preprocessing by projecting out the sensitive subspace is not as
effective as BuDRO in improving individual fairness and also can negatively impact the performance.
5.2	Adult
The Adult data set (Dua & Graff, 2017) is another common benchmark in the fairness literature. The
task is to predict if an individual earns above or below $50k per year. We follow the experimental
setup and comparison metrics from the prior work on individual fairness (Yurochkin et al., 2020)
studying this data. Individual fairness is quantified with two classification consistency measures: one
with respect to a relationship status feature (S-cons) and the other with respect to the gender and race
(GR-cons) features. The sensitive subspace is learned via logistic regression classifiers for gender
and race and is augmented with unit vectors for gender and race. Note that the project preprocessing
baseline is guaranteed to have a perfect GR-cons score since those features are explicitly projected
out; it is interesting to assess if it generalizes to S-cons, however.
Table 2: Adult: average results over 10 splits into 80% training and 20% test data. NN, SenSR and
Adversarial Debiasing (Zhang et al., 2018) numbers are from Yurochkin et al. (2020).

The results are in Table 2 (see Table 7 for error bars). The baseline GBDT method is again the most
accurate; it produces poor gender gaps, however. BuDRO is less accurate than the baseline, but the
gender gaps have shrunken considerably, and both the S-cons and GR-cons are very high. Project and
reweighing produce the best group fairness results; however, their S-cons values are worse than the
baseline (representing violations of individual fairness), and they also result in significant accuracy
reduction.
Comparing to the results from Yurochkin et al. (2020), BuDRO is slightly less accurate than the
baseline NN, but it improves on all fairness metrics. BuDRO matches the accuracy of adversarial
debiasing and greatly improves the individual fairness results there. Finally, BuDRO improves upon
the accuracy of SenSR while maintaining similar individual fairness results. We present additional
studies of the trade-off between accuracy and fairness in Figure 3 of Appendix C.4.1.
Overall, this and the preceding experiment provide empirical evidence that BuDRO trains individually
fair classifiers while still obtaining high accuracy due to the power of GBDT methods.
5.3	COMPAS
We study the COMPAS recidivism prediction data set (Larson et al., 2016). The task is to predict
whether a criminal defendant would recidivate within two years. We consider race (Caucasian
or not-Caucasian) and gender (binary) as protected attributes and use them to learn the sensitive
subspace similarly to previous experiments. Due to smaller data set size, instead of Algorithm 2, we
considered an entropy-regularized solution to (2.8) presented in Appendix B. The individual fairness
consistency measures are gender consistency (G-cons) and race-consistency (R-cons).
The results are collected in Table 3 (see Table 9 for error bars). COMPAS is a data set where
NNs outperform GBDT in terms of accuracy, but this results in poor group and individual fairness
measurements. A NN trained with SenSR shows similar accuracy to BuDRO, but worse performance

both in group and individual fairness. We conclude that even in problems where neural networks
outperform GBDT, BuDRO is an effective method when taking fairness into consideration.
6	Summary and discussion
We developed a gradient boosting algorithm that enforces individual fairness. The main challenge
of enforcing individual fairness is searching for differential performance in the ML model, and we
overcome the non-smoothness of the ML model by restricting the search space to a finite set. Unlike
most methods for enforcing individual fairness, our method accepts non-smooth ML models. We
note that the restricted adversarial cost function developed for fair gradient boosting may be used to
audit other non-smooth ML models (e.g. random forests) for differential performance, but we defer
such developments to future work. Theoretically, we show that the resulting fair gradient boosting
algorithm converges globally and generalizes. Empirically, we show that the method preserves the
accuracy of gradient boosting while improving group and individual fairness metrics.

A Proofs of Theoretical Results
A.1 Numerical convergence results
In this section, we focus on analyzing the numerical convergence of our boosting algorithm. To
do so, we will work in the framework similar to that found in previous boosting literature (e.g.
Mason et al. (1999)). To be concrete, we assume that Y ⊂ R. Then, we consider all base classifiers
to be of the form h : {x1 , . . . , xn} → Y and thus treat a base classifier h as a vector h ∈ Rn
(precisely, h = [h(x1), . . . , h(xn)]T). Moreover, we define the vector y = [y1, . . . , yn]T ∈ Rn. In
this framework, the loss ' takes the form ' Rn X Rn → R, defined by '(f, y) = 1 pn=1 '(fi, yi).
We abuse notation and write L(f) for the robust loss function; this is a functional on Rn since it only
depends on the values f(xi) for xi ∈ {x1, . . . , xn}.
In this context, given a functional F: Rn → R, the functional derivative VF is the gradient of F.
Additionally, k∙k denotes the standard Euclidean norm on Rn.
We require several assumptions for these results:
Assumption A.1. (i)_ Q is convex as well as first- and second-order differentiable with respect to f.
(ii) For any V ∈ Rn, Q is ωι-Lipschitz differentiable, meaning there exists a constant ωι > 0 such that
for any f, Qf ∈ Rn
IlVQ(f, V)-VQ(Q v)k≤ ωιkf-fk.
The assumption that the loss is convex is restrictive, and we only invoke it here to show global
convergence. In section 3, we also assume the loss function is bounded. This pair of assumptions
(convexity and boundedness) is not particularly restrictive because we have in mind a bounded input
space (see Assumption 3.1).
We additionally require the following assumption, which is standard in the gradient descent literature
(Nocedal & Wright, 2006). Essentially, we suppose that our boosting algorithm moves in a sufficient
descent direction at each iteration. That is, the weak learner can ensure the angle between the
searching direction and the functional gradient is bounded.
Assumption A.2. There is a value δ > 0, such that Algorithm 1 can find a function ht with
° _	hVL(ft), hti
θt := -kVL(ft)∣Hlhtk ≥ δ, forall =1,…,T.
(A.1)
The following convergence result is a consequence of general results on the convergence of functional
gradient descent algorithm for minimizing cost functionals (Mason et al., 1999). It states that, with a
specific step-size, Algorithm 1 will converge to some classifier f *.
Theorem A.3. Under Assumptions A.1 and A.2, suppose we run Algorithm 1 with step-sizes
hVL(ft), hti
ωιkhtk2
(A.2)
Then, the optimization converges, i.e.: lim VL(ft) = 0.
t→∞
This framework also results in the following, which shows that we obtain a global optimal solution.
Theorem A.4. Under Assumptions A.1 and A.2, suppose {ft} is the sequence generated by Al-
gorithm 1 with step-size given by (A.2). Then, any stationary point {ft } is the global optimal
solution.
The specific step-size presented above is only required for analyzing the convergence properties of
Algorithm 1, which can be easily replaced by a step-size selected by some line search methods.
We begin the proof of numerical results by providing following preparatory properties of the cost
functional L.
Lemma A.5. Under Assumption A.1, it holds
(i)	L is convex, first- and second-order differentiable with respect to f.
13
Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021
(ii)	L is a ω1 -Lipschitz differentiable functional, that is
kVL(f) -VL(f)k ≤ ωιkf - fk	(A.3)
for any f, f ∈ F.
ProofofLemma A.5. For part (i), recall L(f) = PTf(f, y), combining with Assumption A.1 (i), We
have
VL(f) = diag(P )V'(f) and V2L(f) = diag(P )V2 f(f, y),
where diag(P) is a diagonal matrix with [diag(P)]n = Pi for i = 1,…，n. Since P ∈ [0,1]n and
Pin=1 Pi = 1, L(f) is a linear combination of `(fi, yi). Therefore, L is a convex functional of f.
For part (ii), according to Assumption A.1(ii), `f(f, y) is ω1-Lipschitz differentiable with respect to f,
yielding
kV2f(f, y)k≤ ωι.	(A.4)
Given any f ∈ F, it holds
kV2L(f)k = kdiag(P )V2f(f, y)k
≤ kdiag(P)∣H∣V2f(f,y)k	(A.5)
≤ ω1 ,
where the first inequality follows from Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and the second inequality follows
from Assumption (A.4) and P ∈ [0, 1]n. Combining (A.5) with the mean value theorem (for
functionals) (Jerri, 1999), it holds
kVL(f) - VLf)k ≤ kV2L (Cf + (1 - c)f) IHIf- fk
≤ ω1kf-ffk,
where C ∈ [0,1]. It completes the proof.	口
Proof of Theorem A.3. By Lemma A.5, we have following lower bound for the difference between
two successive loss functions:
L(ft) - L(ft+ι) ≥ L(ft) -(L(ft) + αthVL(fjh)+ ω^陛『)
=-αthVL(ft), hti- ωi(20t^khtk2.
We choose at = 一(：：(：；]) as (A.2) to make the greatest reduction, which yields
L(ft) - L(ft+1) ≥
hVL(ft), hti2
2ωι∣htk2
(A.6)
Combining (A.6) with the sufficient decrease condition (A.1), we have
L(ft) - L(ft+1) ≥
δ2kVL(ft)k2
2ω1
(A.7)
Summing up both sides of (A.7) from 0 to ∞, we have
∞∞
X kVL(ft)k2 ≤ X 爰(L(ft) - L(ft+ι))
≤ -j21 L(fθ) < ∞,
where the second inequality follows by ft ≥ 0 for all t, yielding
lim VL(ft) = 0.
t→∞

A.2 Proofs of generalization error bounds
Proof of Theorem 3.4. Under Assumptions 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, We have the folloWing result from Proposi-
tion 3.2 in Yurochkin et al. (2020) (recall Equations (2.2) and (2.4))
|Le(f) - Lr(f)| → 0 as n → ∞.
Then, our proof is completed by shoWing L converges to Le uniformly in F. It has been shoWn
(Blanchet & Murthy, 2016) that the dual to the optimization Le defined in (2.4) is given by
1n
Lf (h) = inf λe — sup '(h(x), yi) + λdX(x, Xi).	(A.8)
λ≥0	n i=1 x∈X
LikeWise, calculations (see Appendix B.3) reveal that the dual to (2.5) is given by
1n
L(h) = inf λe------> max	'(h(x), yi) + λdX(x, Xi).	(A.9)
λ≥0	n x∈{x1,...,xn}
i=1
We thus need to establish a bound on

1n
λe —	max	'(h(x), yi) + λdX(x, Xi)
n i=1 x∈{x1 ,...,xn }
To do so, let λn be a minimizer of (A.9). Then, We have that
δn ≤
1n
λn — n): sup '(h(x), yi) + λndX(x, Xi)-
1n
λne +—〉: max	'(h(x),yi) + λndX(x, Xi)
n i=1 x∈{x1,...,xn}

n∑ ,二 max	'(h(X),yi) + λndX(X,Xi) - sup '(h(∕),yi) + λndX(X,Xi)

(A.10)
(A.11)
Define a map T on D such that T(Xi) ∈ argsupχ∈χ '(h(∕), yi) + λndX(X, Xi). By assumption, we
have that
P*(Bn-ι/2d(T(Xi)) XY) ≥ δ∕√n.	(A.12)
Thus, the probability of the event {{xi, ..., Xn} ∩ Ui Bn-ι∕2d (T(Xi)) = 0} (i.e. the event that there

Thus assume that, for each i, there is a point (x*,y*) ∈ D such that XJ ∈ Bn-1∕2d(T(Xi)). Then,

in line (A.16), We apply Lemma A.1 from Yurochkin et al. (2020) which asserts that 0 ≤ λn ≤ √.
This completes the proof of the desired result.	□
Compared to most theoretical studies of distributionally robust optimization, the proof of Theorem
3.4 is complicated by the restriction of the c-transform to the sample D in (A.9). This complication
arises because the max over the sample is generally (much) smaller than the max over the sample
space due to the curse of dimensionality. This discrepancy between the max over the sample and
the max over the space space is responsible for the dependence of the rate of convergence on the
dimension of the feature space in Theorem 3.4.
B Further implementation considerations
Here we present a method based on entropic regularization that can be used to quickly obtain
an approximate solution to the linear program in Equation 2.8. Moreover, this method requires
only simple matrix computations; thus, we are able to implement it in TensorFlow for quick GPU
computations.
It is also possible to quickly find the solution to the dual of the linear program (2.8). Obtaining
the primal optimizer ΠJ from the dual solution, however, can be difficult. For this reason, the
Sinkhorn-based entropic regularization method runs significantly more quickly than the dual method
in our implementations if we insist on using complementary slackness to determine the exact primal
optimizer ΠJ . In practice, we can quickly obtain an approximation to ΠJ from the dual solution,
however (Algorithm 2). A discussion of the dual method can be found in Section B.3.
B.1 Entropic regularization
Equation (2.8) is an optimization problem over probability distributions. Thus, it is reasonable to
regularize the objective function in Equation (2.8) with the entropy of the distribution.
Formally, define the matrix R by Ri,j = `(f, (Xi, yj)) - this is the loss incurred if point j with label
yj is transported to point i. Moreover, define the matrix C by Cij = d2x(Xi, Xj), and let γ denote a
regularization parameter. With this notation, including entropic regularization, the problem becomes:
ΠJ = arg maxhR, Πi - γ hlog(Π), Πi
(B.1)
where log(Π)ij = log(Πij ).
Adding the entropy of Π to the objective encourages the optimizer ΠJ to be less sparse than the (low
entropy) optimizer of the original optimal transport problem. Note that it is not inherently desirable
to find a sparse optimizer ΠJ, since we only consider the marginals of ΠJ while boosting. Coming
close to maximizing the original objective hR, ΠJi is far more important than sparsity.

We follow the Sinkhorn method to develop a solution to the problem (B.1). The Lagrangian is given
by
L(∏,入 η) = ∑ Rij∏ij — γ∑ iog(∏j)∏l ∑λj(乎j - n) - ηφ Cij∏j - e) (b.2)
so that at the optimum we have
which means that
∂ L
∂Πij
Rij - γ - γ log(Πij ) - λj - ηCij = 0
∏j = exp(Rij/γ)exp(-λj/γ — 1)exp(-ηCj/γ).
(B.3)
(B.4)
Now, define matrices V and K and a vector u by the following expressions:
•	Vij = exp(Rij /γ),
•	Kij = exp(-ηCij/γ), and
•	uj = exp(-λj /γ - 1).
By definition, We have that ∏j = VijKijuj, and that V is a constant (it does not depend on any of
the variables of the Lagrangian). Exploiting the constraints of the set Γ (see the text before (2.8)), we
see that u can be Written in terms of K :
X ∏ij = uj X Kij Vij = 1 ⇒	uj = n P KijVj .
(B.5)
Thus, the solution ∏* depends only on K. Since K is determined completely by the Lagrange
multiplier η, We need only to find the value of η that makes the other constraint of the set Γ tight:
X Cij ∏ij = XCijVijKijuj = 1Tn (C	K(η)	V)u = .	(B.6)
Where A B denotes entryWise (Hadamard) product of the matrices A and B . We use a root
finding algorithm to determine the optimal value of η: specifically, We find the root of m(η) =
- 1Tn (C K(η)	V)u. In our experiments, the bisection or secant methods generally converge in
only around 10 to 20 evaluations of m(η).
A fast method for evaluating m(η) is presented in Algorithm 4. It consists of simple entryWise matrix
operations (entryWise multiplications and exponentiations); this is highly amenable to processing on
a GPU, and We have implemented this Sinkhorn-based method With TensorFloW. In Algorithm 5, We
provide a method for using the optimal root η* to obtain the coupling matrix ∏ following Equation
(B.4).

B.2 Stochastic gradient descent FOR finding η* WITH ENTROPIC regularization
Although the Sinkhorn-based method presented above is fast, note that it is still not especially
scalable, as it requires holding at least two n × n matrices (R and C) in memory at the same time.
Assuming double precision floating point arithmetic, each of these matrices requires more than 10
GB of memory when n is approximately 4 × 104 .
Thus, following Genevay et al. (2016), we express the determination of the optimal dual variable
η* as the minimization of an expectation over the empirical distribution Pn thus, it is possible to
leverage stochastic gradient descent (with mini-batching) to quickly find the optimal dual variable η*
while using a small amount of memory.
To develop this expression, note that the Lagrangian dual to the problem (B.1) is given by
min
η≥0,λ
max L(Π, λ, η)
(B.7)
where L is defined in Equation (B.2). The optimal value of Π j for the inner maximum is established
in Equation (B.4). Using this optimal value, we see that
log(πij) = Y (Rij- λj - ηCij) - 1
and we can use this to calculate that
(B.8)
LC∏*,λ,η) = η + nX% + Yχnj = η +1X% + YXexp (Ri- λj - ηCij -1).
j	ij	j	ij	γ
(B.9)
To minimize this with respect to λ (which is unconstrained) we set
which means that
∂
∂λi
0
(B.10)
Thus, substituting into (B.9), we calculate that
L(∏*,λ*,η) = γ + X n Q + γ log
(B.11)
The value η ≥ 0 that minimizes (B.11) is the same as the minimizer of
min E(χ,y)〜Pnne + Y log (X exp ( 'f,(xi, y∖ 遇Em ))	(B.12)
where We ignored some constants that don,t affect the minimizing value n and substituted in the
definitions of Rij and Cij (see the paragraph at the start of section B.1).
The problem B.12 is amenable to minimization via stochastic gradient descent (sGD) - this is
presented in Algorithm 6. in every descent step of Algorithm 6, we are only working with a subset of
the columns of R and C. Thus, R and C may be stored anywhere (or even computed on-the-fly) -
they do not need to be kept in RAM or sent to the GPU memory. Thus, this sGD version can be used
for essentially arbitrarily large data sets. Empirically, we also observe good results from running only
a few gradient descent steps to obtain an approximation to n* in every boosting step; this allows the
sGD method to run as quickly as (or more quickly than) the normal sinkhorn method (Algorithm 4).
To find the final transport map Π, we use Algorithm 5, as before.

B.3 DUAL OF ROBUST EMPIRICAL LOSS FUNCTION L
Although the algorithms presented in the preceding section run quickly and can handle arbitrarily
large inputs, they only obtain an approximation to the true optimal transport map (due to the entropic
regularization). Here, we present a method to quickly obtain the solution to the dual of the original
linear program (2.8). We find that constructing the transport map Π* from the knowledge of the dual
optimum is difficult; however, there are quick methods to produce reasonable approximations to Π*
from the knowledge of the dual solution.
Following standard methods, the dual of the linear program (2.8) is given by:
n
氏 eη + 1 Σνj
j=1
s.t. νj ≥ Rij - ηCij for all i, j
Which can be simplified to:
n
inf eη + n1	max Rij - ηCij .
η≥0	j=1 i
(B.13)
(B.14)
Define λj (η) = maxi Rij - ηCij and let M(η) = βη + 1 Pn=I λj (η) denote the dual objective
function from (B.14). Note that each λj (η) is a monotone decreasing convex piecewise linear function
ofη. In addition, since Cjj = 0, we have that limη→∞ λj(η) ≥ Rjj; that is, the λj are positive and
eventually become constant.
This means that the infimum (over η) will either occur at η = 0 or at one of the corners of one
of the λj (a corner is a value of η such that there exist i1 and i2, i1 6= i2, with Ri1j - ηCi1j =
Ri2j - ηCi2j = maxi Rij - ηCij; i.e. at least two of the lines that define λj are intersecting and
creating a point where M(η) is not differentiable). Thus, it is theoretically possible to exactly obtain
the optimizer η* by enumerating and testing all of these corners.
In practice, we have found that it is quicker to approximate η* by noticing that an element of the
subgradient for M(η) is given by
e - n X Cij ,j
ij ∈ arg max Rij - ηCij .
i
(B.15)
Thus, a bisection method can be implemented to approximate the point η* such that dη M (η) < 0 for
η < η* and ddη M (η) > 0 for η > η*. This is the corner that we are looking for. Using a bisection
method (or similar) guarantees that we only need a small fixed number (≈ 30) of subgradient
computations in every boosting step.
Complementary slackness can directly be exploited to quickly find the desired solution Π* to the
original discrete SenSR LP from the dual optimizer η* if the following conditions hold:
1. There is an index j such that the point η* = arg mi∏n≥0 M(η) is a corner of λj∙ with
| arg maxi Rij - η*Cj | = 2 (only two of the lines that define λj∙ intersect at η*).
19
Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021
2.	For all k = j, the point η* is not a corner of λk (i.e. | arg maxi Rik - η*C%k | = 1).
These conditions are based on the fact that, for all i and j , Πij is the primal variable corresponding to
the constraint vj ≥ Rij - ηCij in the dual (B.13). Condition 2 implies that, for all k 6= j, there is a
value of t such that Π^ = -1 and Π菰=0 for all i = t. Then, condition 1 implies that there are only
two nonzero values in column j of Π*. These two nonzero values must sum to 1 and the constraint
hC, Π*i = e must be satisfied. With the complete knowledge of the other values of Π*, this results in
two linear equations with two unknowns (the two remaining nonzero values of Π*), and this system
can be easily solved to give the exact solution Π*.
Similar tricks can be applied to rapidly solve for Π* when slightly more entries are candidates for
being nonzero (according to complementary slackness). Unfortunately, since dx is a fair distance
(and thus it usually ignores several directions in X), it is often the case that there are multiple
individuals xi 6= xj in the training data such that dx(xi, xj) = 0 (i.e. there are a significant number
of off-diagonal entries of C that are 0). In practice, we have observed that these points also often
produce the same predicted value f(xi) = f(xj) after the first step of boosting. This results in a
situation where complementary slackness presents a complicated system of equations for obtaining
the primal optimizer Π*.
Thus, in order to maintain an efficient boosting algorithm in practice, we use the dual optimizer η*
to construct an approximation Π to the primal optimizer Π* using the following heuristic: for all
j, randomly select t in argmaxgRij - η*Ci7- and let Πj = 1. That is, in each column, randomly
select one of the candidate nonzero entries (according to complementary slackness) and set it to ɪ in
Π. This approximation Π actually is an interpretable transport map: each point in the training data is
∕∖
mapped (completely) to another point in the training data. We present the construction of Π using
Algorithm 2 in the main text, and we use Algorithm 2 in our experiments on the German credit data
set the Adult data set in Section 5. An outline of the full dual method (not using SGD) is presented in
Algorithm 7. Although it is not exactly clear as to how good (or bad) of an approximation Π is to Π*,
our experimental results show that it is functional.

C	Experimental details
In this section, we provide the details of the experiments using the BuDRO algorithm. We start with
a synthetic motivation, then discuss the three data sets that are presented in the main text.
C.1 Synthetic motivation
Consider a data set with two features, x1 and x2 . Suppose that the one feature x1 is protected and
the other feature x2 is can be used for making fair decisions. For example: our task may be to
decide which individuals to approve for a loan. The protected feature x1 may correspond to the
percentage of nonwhite residents in the applicant’s zip code, and the other feature x2 may correspond
to the applicant’s credit score (or some other fair measure of credit worthiness). In this case, we can
approximate a fair metric dx by the difference in the second feature: the fair distance between the
two individuals (x1a, x2a) and (xb1, xb2) is given by dx((x1a, x2a), (xb1, xb2)) = |x2a - xb2|.
We synthetically constructed such a data set in the following manner: 150 individuals were indepen-
dently drawn from the same centered normal distribution. Let R be a rectangle of minimum area
containing the 150 points; let L1 be the line passing through the top right corner and the bottom left
20

Figure 1: Comparison of GBDT classifiers without (a) and with (b) the fairness constraints introduced
in this paper. The classifiers output a probability in [0, 1] - these probabilities are discretized to binary
labels to create a classification. In the figures, red points are individuals with true label 0 and blue
points are individuals with true label 1. The darker red areas correspond to lower output probabilities
and the darker blue areas correspond to higher output probabilities. The arrows in (b) indicate the
transport map corresponding to the fairness constraint for the previous boosting step.
(b) Fair boosted tree classifier
corner of R and L2 be the line passing through the top left corner and the bottom right corner of R.
125 of the samples were chosen (uniformly at random) to belong to majority white neighbourhoods:
these individuals were labeled 0 if they were below L1 and 1 if they were above L1, and then they
were all shifted to the left (by 2, so that the highly white cluster is centered at (-2, 0)). The remaining
25 individuals make up the majority nonwhite cluster: they were classified according to L2 and then
centered at (2, 0).
In Figure 1, we show such an example of this setup. The red points in the figure correspond to
individuals that are labeled 0; these represent individuals that should be declined for the loan (e.g.
they have defaulted on a loan, with these data collected in the past to make future predictions). The
blue points are individuals that are labeled 1 and represent people who should be approved (e.g. they
have paid back a loan in the past). The horizontal axis represents the percentage of nonwhite residents
in an individual’s zip code, while the vertical axis is taken as some fair measure of credit worthiness.
The naively trained GBDT classifier in Figure 1(a) shows high accuracy on this synthetic data
set, but it is unfair - requiring that individuals from neighbourhoods containing medium to high
percentages of nonwhite individuals obtain a significantly higher credit score than those in very
racially homogeneous neighbourhoods. Applying our individually fair gradient boosting algorithm to
the data set, however, results in a fair classifier (visualized in Figure 1(b)). The credit score threshold
for loan acceptance is consistent across the different racial make ups of zip codes. This provides a
synthetic visualization of the performance of the BuDRO method, and suggests that it is working as
we have described.
As a tangent: note that the clusters in this example are generated in a symmetric manner. This is a
case where the unfairness in the naively trained classifier is coming from a lack of data and a push for
extra accuracy rather than a specific inherent bias in the data.
C.2 Details common to all experimental data sets
Fair metric We follow one of the methods presented (Yurochkin et al., 2020) to construct fair
metrics for the experimental data sets. Specifically, for a given data set, we determine a finite set
T of protected directions in X. In a similar fashion to the synthetic example in C.1, changes in
these protected directions should intuitively be ignored by a fair measure. Thus, the fair metric dx is
defined by projecting onto the orthogonal complement of span(T ) and considering the Euclidean
21
Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021
distance on the projected space. In particular, let A = span(T) and proj(A) denote the projection
onto A. Then,
dχ(x1,x2) = Il((I - Proj(A)) ∙ (xι - x2)k2.	(C.1)
The protected directions are determined in a similar fashion for each experimental data set. In
particular, each data set contains (one or more) protected attributes: the indicator for each protected
attribute is included in the set of protected directions1.
We additionally obtain one or more extra protected directions in the following manner. For a fixed
protected attribute g (e.g. gender), we remove the feature g from the data set and train a linear
model on the edited data set to predict the removed feature g (we use logistic regression with an `2
regularization of strength 0.1 when g is binary; ridge regression with cross validation is used for a
non-binary feature g). Let w be the normal vector to the separating hyperplane corresponding to this
linear model: we include w in T , the set of protected directions.
For example, on the Adult data set, we consider both the gender and race features as protected
attributes (both features are binary, see the description in Section 5). The set T for Adult then contains
three protected directions. Two of these protected directions are given by eg, the indicator vector of
the gender feature, and er, the indicator vector of the race feature. We obtain the third protected
direction w by removing the gender feature from the data set and training logistic regression on this
edited data set with targets given by the gender feature. Several of the features in the Adult data set
(such as the is_husband and is_wife categories of the relationship feature) are highly
predictive of gender. Combined with the gender imbalance in the data set, this allows for logistic
regression to be able to predict gender with nearly 80% accuracy on a (holdout) test set. We thus take
w to be the normal vector to the separating hyperplane discovered during this logistic regression.
Note that a metric defined in this way will assign a distance of 0 between two individuals that differ
only in the protected attributes (e.g. gender or race) but are identical in all other features. Additionally,
if the difference x1 - x2 between two individuals is nearly parallel to one of the logistic regression
directions u, then d(x1 , x2 ) will also be small. For example, on the Adult data set, the vector w
(defined in the previous paragraph) exhibits comparatively high support on the is_husband and
is_wife categories of the relationship feature. Thus, if x1 and x2 are identical except that
x1 has wife = 1 and x2 has husband = 1, then dx(x1, x2) will be small.
This fair metric dx is an approximation to an actual fair metric on X: it does not capture information
about all protected features, and only makes a heuristic approximation to reduce differences between
true race and gender groups of individuals.
Comparison methods Here we give an overview of the ML methods that we compare to BuDRO.
Please refer to the included code for full information about the hyperparameter grids that we consider;
see the respective data set sections for further information about training details and the optimal
hyperparameter choices.
We consider three boosting methods in addition to BuDRO: baseline GBDTs, projecting, and
reweiging. Our implementations of these methods all use the XGBoost framework (Chen & Guestrin,
2016). The GBDT hyperparameters that we consider are:
•	max_depth, the maximum depth of the decision trees used as weak learners;
•	lambda, an `2 regularization parameter;
•	min_weight, a tree regularization parameter; and
•	eta, the XGBoost learning rate.
We additionally examine the effects of boosting for different numbers of steps. We always present
the results of reweighing using the default XGBoost hyperparameters.
The projecting preprocessing method functions by eliminating the entire protected subspace from the
data set before training a vanilla GBDT (see, for example Bower et al. (2018), Yurochkin et al. (2020),
Prost et al. (2019)). In particular, using the notation from the discussion of fair metrics (above), we
project all of the data onto the orthogonal complement of span(T) as a preprocessing step. This has
1The indicator for an attribute is a vector with only one nonzero entry; that nonzero entry appears in the
attribute that we are indicating.
22
Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021
the effect that the final classifier will be completely blind to differences in the protected directions in
T . Our experiments (see e.g. Table 2) show that this is not enough to produce an individually fair
classifier: changes to attributes that are highly correlated with elements of T are still used to make
classification decisions.
Reweighing is presented in Kamiran & Calders (2011). Essentially, this method functions by assigning
weights to the individuals in the training data. These weights are chosen to force protected group
status to appear statistically independent to the outcomes in Y. Then a GBDT is trained on the
reweighted data. This is inherently a group fairness method (the data are weighted to match a group
fairness constraint) that cannot be used when the protected attribute does not take a finite number of
values. We use the default XGBoost parameters along with reweighing to generate the values that are
presented in the main text.
To test if GBDT classifiers are useful on the tabular data sets that we consider here, we also train
(naive) one-layer (100 unit) fully connected neural networks on all data sets. For the Adult and the
COMPAS data sets, we additionally compare to the SenSR method from Yurochkin et al. (2020)
and the adversarial debiasing method from Zhang et al. (2018). The SenSR method creates an
individually fair neural network through stochastic gradient descent on a robust loss similar to the
one considered in this work. Adversarial debiasing is based on minimizing the ability to predict the
protected attributes from knowledge of the final outputs of a predictor, and also draws on ideas from
robustness in machine learning. It is constructed to provide improvements to statistical group fairness
quantities rather than for the creation of an individually fair classifier.
Evaluation metrics We evaluate the ML methods with a type of individual fairness metric that we
define below, also discussed Section 5 of the main text. It is not generally true that individual fairness
will imply group fairness: it will depend on the group fairness constraint in question as well as the
fair metric dx on X . We thus also report several group fairness metrics to allow for comparison with
other methods in the literature; it remains future work to establish the precise conditions under which
individual fairness will imply group fairness.
The specific group fairness metrics that we consider here are GAPMax and GAPRMS , as introduced
in De-Arteaga et al. (2019). Suppose that there are two groups of individuals, labeled by g = 0
(a protected group) and g = 1 (a privileged group). Then, given true outcomes Y and predicted
outcomes Y, We can consider a statistical fairness gap defined by
GaPy = P(Y = y|Y = y,g = 0)
-P(Y = y∣Y = y,g = 1)
for each possible outcome y ∈ Y. Note that a large value of |GaPy | corresponds to (correctly)
assigning the outcome y to a larger fraction of individuals belonging one of the groups than the other.
For example, suppose that Y = {0, 1}, With an 1 indicating a favorable outcome. Then, a large value
of |GaP1 | means that our classifier is able to identify the successful individuals from one group at a
higher rate than it is able to identify the successful individuals from the other. Thus, large values of
GaPy indicate unfair performance by the classifier at the level of groups. We then define
GAPMax = max |GaPy|
GapRMS
M XY Gapy.
(C.2)
It is difficult to evaluate the individual fairness of an ML model since We only have access to an
approximation to a true fair distance on X (We cannot, for example, consider pairs of training points
that are definitely close to each other). We expect that the fair metrics considered in this Work are good
approximations to true fair metrics; nonetheless, We still desire to evaluate the individual fairness of
an ML model in a Way that is agnostic to the choice of approximate fair metric. For this reason, We
construct counterfactual pairs of individuals (that is, pairs of individuals that differ only in certain
protected attributes) from the input data. Intuitively, these counterfactual pairs should be treated the
same Way by any individually fair classifier (they should be ‘close‘ according to the true fair metric).2
2This is someWhat debatable. For example, does flipping gender but keeping all other attributes the same
truly result in an equivalent individual of a different gender?
23
Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021
We thus examine how often these counterfactual individuals are assigned to the same outcome. These
evaluation criteria are inspired by Garg et al. (2018), which examined changes in predicted sentiment
when changing one word in a sentence.
Specifically, suppose an attribute g takes values in a set V . To measure the consistency of the predictor
f with respect to g (the “g-consistency of f"), we construct |V | copies of the test data. These copies
are altered so that the value of the attribute g is constant on each copy and so that each value in V is
represented in a copy of the data. We then apply f to each copy of the data to obtain |V | vectors of
predicted outcomes yι,..., y∣v∣, yj ∈ Yn. The g-consistency of f is then the fraction of individuals
who are assigned the same outcome in every copy of the data set. That is, it is the fraction of indices
i SUChthat (y1)i = (y2)i = ... = (y∣V ∣)i∙
C.3 German credit
German credit is a data set that is commonly evaluated in the fairness literature (Dua & Graff,
2017). It contains information about 20 attributes (seven numerical, 13 categorical) from 1000
individuals; the ML task is to label the individuals as good or bad credit risks. Several of the
features, such as amount_in_savings and length_current_employment, are numer-
ical but have been recorded as categorical. Additionally, some of the other features, such as
employment_skill_level and credit_history_status are categorical but could be
considered to be ordered (for example, “all credits paid" is better than “past delays in payments"
which is better than “account critical"). In some analyses, these ordered categorical features are
converted to integers; for the purposes of this analysis, we one-hot encode all of the categorical
features (which results in 62 features in our input data). We additionally standardize each numerical
feature (that is, center by subtracting the mean and divide by the standard deviation). None of the
data points are removed.
We treat age (a numerical feature that we standardize) as the protected attribute in the German
credit data set. In order to report the group fairness metrics, we consider two protected groups: one
group consists of individuals who are younger than 25, the other group consists of those who are 25
or older. This split was proposed by Kamiran & Calders (2009) to formalize the potential for age
discrimination with this data set.
Fair distance For the German credit data set, we consider two protected directions, the first of
which is the indicator vector ea of the age attribute. Additionally, following the framework described
in C.2, we eliminate the age attribute from the data and use ridge regression to train a classifier
to predict age from the other features (we use the default parameters in the RidgeCV class from
the scikit-learn package, version 0.21.3 (Pedregosa et al., 2011)). The second protected
direction w is a normal vector to the hyperplane created by ridge regression (i.e. it is the vector of
ridge regression coefficients).
Evaluation metrics As discussed above, we consider the GapRMS and GapMAX for a binarized
version of the age attribute.
For an individual fairness metric, we cannot examine an age consistency, since age is a numerical
feature. German credit contains a categorical personal_status feature that encodes some
information about gender and marital status3, however. After one-hot encoding, we find that several
of the personal_status categories are well-correlated with the age attribute according to
ridge regression. Specifically, the male_divorced/separated category is positively correlated
with age (the ridge regression coefficient has an average of 0.26 over our 10 train/test splits) and
the male_married/widowed feature is negatively correlated with age (the ridge regression
coefficient has an average of -0.25). Since this personal_status attribute can be considered
to be a protected attribute, we examine a consistency measure based on this personal_status
attribute as described in C.2. We refer to this consistency measure as status consistency (or S-cons).
Method training and hyperparameter selection The labels of the German credit data are quite
unbalanced (only 30% of the labels are 1). We thus train all ML methods to optimize the balanced

male_divorced/separated, female_single, and female_divorced/separated/married.

accuracy. For the GBDT methods (baseline, projecting, and BuDRO), this is accomplished by setting
the XGBoost parameter scale_pos_weight to 需,the ratio of zeros to ones in the labels of the
training data. For naive (baseline) NNs, we sample eac.h minibatch to contain equal numbers of points
labelled 0 and labelled 1.
For both the baseline GBDT classifier and the projecting method, we search over a grid of GBDT
hyperparameters on ten 80% train/20% test splits, and choose the set of hyperparameters that
optimizes the average balanced test accuracy over those ten splits. See C.2 for the parameters that
we tune and the code for the values that we consider. For BuDRO, we tune parameters by hand on
one 80% train/20% split. We use the dual implementation to find the optimal transport map (without
SGD, see Algorithm 7); thus the only extra hyperparameter to consider is the perturbation budget .
The data in Table 1 are collected by averaging the results obtained using the optimal hyperparameter
choices across 10 new 80% train/20% test splits (the same splits for each method). The optimal
hyperparameters are presented in Table 4.
Table 4: Optimal XGBoost parameters for German credit data set. For BuDRO, we also used a
pertubation budget of = 1.0.

We also train a neural network on the German credit data set (see Appendix C.2 for a description of
the architecture). We find that we consistently obtain high accuracy when we use a learning rate of
10-4 and run for 4100 epochs (without any `2 regularization).

C.4 Adult
The Adult data set (Dua & Graff, 2017) is another commonly considered benchmark data set in the
algorithmic fairness literature. After preprocessing and removing entries that contain missing data,
we consider a subset of Adult containing information about 11 demographic attributes from 45222
individuals. Each individual is labelled with a binary label that is 0 if the individual makes less than
$50000 per year and 1 if the individual makes more than $50000 per year. In our preprocessing, we
standardize the (five) continuous features and one-hot encode the (six) categorical features, resulting
in 41 total features that we use in our analysis. These features include several attributes that could be
considered protected, such as age (continuous), relationship_status (categorical), gender
(binary), and race (here we consider a binary white vs non-white race feature). For this experiment,
we choose to construct a predictor f for the labels that is fair according to the gender and race
attributes.
As mentioned in the main text, we exactly follow the experimental set-up as described in Yurochkin
et al. (2020) for the Adult data set. In particular, we do not remove the gender and race attributes
from the training data. This helps to produce an adversarial analysis (how fair can the method become
when it is explicitly training on gender and race).
25

Fair distance The fair distance on Adult is described in detail in C.2. Briefly, we consider three
protected directions: eg, the indicator for the gender attribute; er, the indicator for the race
attribute; and w, the normal vector to the separating hyperplane obtained via logistic regression
trained to predict the gender attribute from the other attributes.
Evaluation metrics As previously mentioned, we consider both gender and race as protected
attributes on the Adult data set; thus we report GapMax and GapRMS for both the gender and
race features separately.
We examine two types of counterfactual individual fairness metrics. The first we refer to as spouse
consistency (S-cons). The S-cons is determined by creating two copies of the data: one in which
every point belongs to the husband category of the relationship_status feature and the
other in which every point belongs to the wife category. Unlike the framework described in C.2, we
do not consider all categories of the relationship_status feature. To be concrete, two altered
copies of the data are used to obtain two vectors of predicted outcomes yh and yw, and the S-Cons is
the fraction of outcomes that are the same in these two vectors. Explicitly, S-cons is calculated as
W|{i: yw = yh}|. Intuitively, the S-cons measures how likely an individual is to be assigned to a
different outcome simply from labeling themselves as a wife rather than a husband.
The other evaluation metric is the gender and race consistency (GR-cons), which involves four copies
of the input data. Each copy is altered so that the gender and race features are constant on that
copy of the data, and so that each copy has a different combination of the race and gender feature
from the other three copies. We then apply the classifier to each copy of the data, to produce a four
vectors of predicted outcomes yi ∈ {0,1}n, i = 0,1, 2, 3. The GR-cons is defined as the fraction of
outcomes that are the same in all of the yi .
Method training and hyperparameter selection The labels for the Adult data set are unbalanced
(only about 25% of people make more that $50000 per year) and thus all methods are again trained
for balanced accuracy. For the GBDT methods (Baseline, projecting, BuDRO) this is accomplished
by setting the XGBoost parameter scale_pos_weight to be the ratio of zeros to ones in the
labels of the training data. The data from the other methods (baseline NNs, SenSR, and adversarial
debaising) are obtained from Yurochkin et al. (2020); see that work for further information about the
method training.
The baseline GBDT and projecting methods were trained to optimize balanced test accuracy over a
grid of hyperparameters on one 80% train/20% test seed. The optimal hyperparameters discovered in
this way were then used to collect data on ten different 80% train/20% test splits: the average of the
results on the test data from these new train/test splits are presented in Table 2 in the main text (see
Table 7 for information about standard error). The optimal GBDT parameters are presented in Table
6.
Table 6: Optimal XGBoost parameters for the Adult data set. For BuDRO, we also used a perturbation
budget of = 0.4. The value of min_weight for BuDRO is computed relative to the size of an
80% training set, which contains 36177 individuals.

BuDRO was implemented using the Dual SGD formulation to find the optimal transport map Π
as described in Algorithm 2. This involves several additional hyperparameters that we set in the
following ways: an initial guess of the dual variable (set to 0.1), a batch size (set to 200), a number of
SGD iterations (set to 100), a momentum parameter (set to 0.9), and an SGD learning rate (set to
10-4). The optimal perturbation budget was found to be 0.4. See C.4.1 for more information about
the hyperparameter selection on Adult.

Figure 2: Fairness measures at given aCCuraCy levels for the BuDRO method on the Adult data set,
Considered over 10 train/test splits. The results from eaCh ChoiCe of hyperparameters are averaged
over all train/test splits before being grouped into aCCuraCy bins. The plotted points are the ones
from eaCh bin that optimize the speCified quantity ((a) average GapRMS , (b) raCe GapRMS , (C) gender
GapRMS , (d) spouse ConsistenCy). Error bars represent one standard deviation. EmpiriCally, the
gender gaps were harder to reduCe than the raCe gaps. The S-Cons in all of these piCtures never drops
below 94%.
We illustrate the fairness of BuDRO at different aCCuraCy levels in Figures 2 and 3. The data in Figure
2 was also used to guide hyperparameter seleCtion for the BuDRO method on the Adult data set.
Before analyzing the information in these figures, we provide a desCription of how they were generated.
We separate the aCCuraCy axis (horizontal) into bins of a fixed width (here, the bin size is 0.0016). We
then Consider ten 80% train/20% test splits of the data set, and explore a grid of hyperparameters
for eaCh of these train/test splits (see the inCluded Code for the speCifiC hyperparameter grids that we
examined). The results from eaCh ChoiCe of hyperparameters are averaged (over all ten train/test splits)
and are plaCed in the bin Containing the average aCCuraCy; the error bars in the figures Correspond to
the standard error from this averaging.
In Figure 2, we present four figures: eaCh figure is obtained by determining the set of hyperparameters
in eaCh aCCuraCy bin that optimize the average (over the 10 seeds) of a given fairness quantity (on
the test set). Thus, eaCh figure Contains the data from approximately 30 hyperparameter seleCtions
(one for eaCh bin, different for eaCh figure). For example, in Figure 2(C), eaCh point was obtained
from the Classifier ConstruCted using the hyperparameters that minimize the gender GapRMS in
27
Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021
the corresponding accuracy bin. In a similar fashion, Figure 2(a) is constructed by selecting the
hyperparameters from each accuracy bin that minimize the average of the race GapRMS and the
gender GapRMS . In all of the plots, the S-cons never drops below 94%, and the GR-cons remains
similarly high; thus, we do not focus on the consistency measures here.
In the following analysis, we concentrate on minimizing the gender GapRMS (Figure 2(c)) due to
the fact that the gender gaps were significantly more difficult to shrink than the race gaps in Figure
2. In fact, as seen in Table 2, the baseline classier exhibits fairly small race gaps even though it is
trained with knowledge of the race feature. In real-world use, however, it is not clear which fairness
quantity a user would be required to optimize; thus, Figure 2 presents a picture of the different
trade-offs involved.
The BuDRO data in Table 2 was collected from ten different (new) 80% train/20% test splits, using
hyperparameters chosen by examining Figure 2(c). We were interested in finding a point with high
accuracy and high spouse consistency; thus, we examined hyperparameters corresponding to the
points in the accuracy range 0.81 to 0.825 and looked for patterns in these hyperparameters. We
attempt this generalization to make hyperparameter selection slightly more realistic: it seems willfully
ignorant to disregard all of this data when selecting hyperparameters for our final tests, and it is at
least plausible that a user could find some of these generally good hyperparameters via hand-tuning.
This results in the set of BuDRO hyperparameters that were presented in Table 6. See additionally
the code for more details about the selected hyperparameters.
In Figures 2(a) and (c), we observe a trade-off between accuracy and fairness with the BuDRO
method. That is, by decreasing accuracy (which generally corresponds to increasing the perturbation
parameter ), we are able to decrease the group fairness gaps, all at a high level of S-cons. Thus, it is
possible to chose parameters to produce smaller group fairness gaps (with potentially lower accuracy)
if the application calls for that.
(a)	(b)
Figure 3: The accuracy vs fairness trade-off of BuDRO when compared to other baseline boosting
algorithms on the Adult data set. All lines are chosen to minimize gender GapRMS . (a) contains a
comparison of the Gender gap RMS. The BuDRO line also appears in Figure 2(c). (b) contains a
comparison of the S-cons. Error bars represent one standard deviation.
Figure 3 includes a comparison of the BuDRO method to some other baseline boosting methods to
further illustrate the trade-off between accuracy and fairness. Each point in Figure 3 is chosen to be
the one from the accuracy bin that minimizes the gender GapRMS .
This figure is constructed specifically to explore how fair we can make a classifier at given (fixed)
levels of accuracy. The vanilla GBDT method always produces high accuracy classifiers (in the
hyperparameter grid that we consider). This comes with large group fairness gaps that we are unable
to decrease. On the other hand, the projecting method always produces good group fairness gaps, but
we are unable to obtain high accuracy with this method. Finally, the reweighing method can obtain
high accuracy with low fairness gaps, but it never produces an acceptable S-cons.
Figure 3 suggests that BuDRO is a better method than projecting at all accuracy levels on Adult: at
any accuracy level, BuDRO matches the group fairness gaps produced by projecting while improving
upon the (consistency of the) individual fairness metric. Projecting always produces a classifier
with small group fairness gaps. Unlike projecting, however, BuDRO can also be used to construct
a more accurate classifier if we are allow for slightly larger group fairness gaps. Depending on the
28
Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021
requirements of the application (e.g. as defined by law or other application specific fairness goals),
this allows for more flexibility in the creation of individually fair and accurate classifiers.
It is also interesting to observe how the BuDRO curve in Figure 3 meets the curve for Vanilla GBDTs.
Specifically, as the curves meet, the gender gap of the BuDRO method is increasing, while the gender
gap of the Vanilla GBDT curve appears to be slightly decreasing. We speculate that this is due to the
fact that the grid of hyperparameters used in the construction of Figure 3 does not contain values of
smaller that 0.1. That is, the value of does not go down to 0, so we can not expect to precisely
recover the baseline results. Essentially, we force a small perturbation in the data while also pushing
for high accuracy. Thus, it appears that the high accuracy points in the Figure correspond to solutions
that are obtained by improving race fairness without significantly improving gender fairness (see also
Figure 2(c) - the race fairness always remains small). These high accuracy cases apparently find a
perturbation that is mostly along the race axis.
Overall, these figures provide further evidence that the BuDRO method creates an individually fair
classifier while still obtaining high accuracy (on tabular, structured data like Adult) due to the ability
to leverage powerful GBDT methods.
C.5 COMPAS
The COMPAS recidivism prediction data set, compiled by ProPublica (Larson et al., 2016), includes
information on the offenders’ gender, race, age, criminal history (charge_for_arrest,
number_prior_offenses), and the risk_score assigned to the offender by COMPAS. ProP-
ublica also collects whether or not these offenders recidivate within two years as the ground truth.
More details and discussions of the data set can be found in Angwin & Larson (2016); Flores et al.
(2016).
We remove the risk_score attribute, standardize the number_prior_offenses attribute and
one-hot encode the age attribute, yielding the final data set of 5278 individuals with 7 features.
Since there are only seven features (with only one continuous feature) in the COMPAS data, there are
many different pairs of individuals (i, j) with the same similarity distance Ci,j . Then, there can be a
lot of different solutions while finding t ∈ argmaXiRj - η*Cj when using the dual method (See
Appendix B.2 and Algorithm 7). Therefore, we consider the entropic regularization form (B.1) of the
linear program (2.8), and solve it using the fast Sinkhorn method in Algorithm 4 and 5.
Fair metric We define three protected directions: eg, the indicator vector of gender, er, the
indicator vector of race, and a protected direction w obtained by eliminating the race attribute
and training the logistic regression for binary label race on the edited data set. Then, we follow the
steps for computing the projection matrix A = span{eg , er , w} and calculating the fair distances dx
in (C.1) for all pairs of individuals.
Evaluation metrics We evaluate the methods using several individual fairness metrics, as well as
some group fairness metrics. For group fairness metrics, we report GAPMax and GAPRMS for race
and gender separately. We consider two counterfactual individual fairness evaluation measures
on COMPAS based on the two protected attributes race and gender (which are both binary).
Therefore, we can make the counterfactual examples by flipping the protected attributes. For example,
we generate two copies of the data set: one with all individuals are female, the other with all
individuals are male. Then the gender consistency (G-cons) is obtained by calculating the fraction of
the same classified outcomes on two copies. The race consistency (R-cons) can be calculated in a
similar way.
Method training and hyperparameter selection We compare to the same methods that were
considered on Adult: baseline GBDT, projecting, and reweighing (based on XGBoost); and baseline
NN, SenSR, and adversarial debiasing (based on neural networks).
The results reported are averaged over ten random training (80%) and testing (20%) splits of the
data set. We implement the adversarial debiasing methods (in the adversarial_debiasing
class from the IBM’s AIF360 package, version 0.2.2 (Bellamy et al., 2018)) with the default
hyperparameters, and combine the implementation of reweighing (in the reweighing class from
AIF360 with default hyperparameters) with running XGBoost (default parameters) for 100 boosting
29
Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021
steps. For the baseline GBDT and projecting, we select hyperparameters by splitting 20% of the
training data into a validation set and evaluating the performance on the validation set. For Baseline
NN, SenSR and the BuDRO methods, we manually train the hyperparameters on one train/test split
and use the resulting hyperparameters for computing the averaged results of 10 restarts.
We report the optimal hyperparameters for the GBDT methods in Table 8. For these methods,
lambda is 10-8, and min_child_weight is 0.1/ntrain, where ntrain is the number of training
samples. We set scale_pos_weight to 1 for projecting and the baseline, scale_pos_weight
to be the ratio of zeros to ones in the labels of the training data for BuDRO. The optimal perturbation
budget for BuDRO is 0.12.

For the neural network based methods, the optimal hyperparameters are described below. For baseline

epoch = 2000, full epoch = 10, full learning rate = 0.0001, subspace epoch = 10, subspace learning

C.6 Method timing information
Table 10 contains the training runtimes of the vanilla GBDT and the BuDRO methods. The runtimes
of the other fair GBDT methods (projecting and reweighing) are dominated by the time required for
running vanilla GBDT after preprocessing; thus, the runtimes for these methods are omitted here.
The results show that the BuDRO method as defined in Algorithm 3 (i.e. using SGD to find a dual
solution with O(n2) time required to recover the primal solution) is scalable to large problems.
Table 10: Average runtime for training, including standard deviations. The number in parentheses is
the number of trials used to compute the average. In all trials, the hyperparameters (including the
number of boosting steps) were examined during the generation of the data presented in Section 5.
Each baseline GBDT trial ran for 1000 boosting steps on 4 CPUs. BuDRO ran for 500 steps on 2
CPUs on German credit, 200 steps using 2 CPUs on COMPAS, and 200 steps using 4 CPUs and 1
GPU on Adult.
