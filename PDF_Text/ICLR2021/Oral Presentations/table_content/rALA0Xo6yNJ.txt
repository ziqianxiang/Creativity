Table 1: Shortest-Time Objective (higher is better): Values of ShortestTime(π) for the finaltrained policy for each algorithm. ShortestTime(π) is a smooth measure of how long it takes theagent to first reach the goal. GCSL reaches the goal nearly as quickly as the oracle policy on all theenvironments but the door opening task. The oracle expert policy is trained on a dense reward signalwith PPO for significantly longer.
