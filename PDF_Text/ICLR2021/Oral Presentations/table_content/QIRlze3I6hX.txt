Table 2: Evaluation of cross-modality alignment, including L1 error of state estimation, and RL policyperformance on the original domain Y and after transferring to domain X. 1: TaSk successful rate is reported.
Table 5: Real robot results. We mea-sure the L1 error (smaller better) of endeffector position estimation. We experi-ment with either (i) end effector position(E), or (ii) joint positions (J) as the ob-servations in simulator.
