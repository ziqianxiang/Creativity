Table 1: Negative log-likelihoods on 2-d synthetic datasets (lower is better). We compare withMADE (Germain et al., 2015), RealNVP (Dinh et al., 2016), CIF-RealNVP (Cornish et al., 2019).
Table 2: Inception, FID and KID scores for unconditional CIFAR-10. “Single-step” samples aregenerated solely by pθ(X). “Two-step” samples are generated by sampling from pθ(X) and thendenoised by p (x|x). Although samples from “single-step” might appear visually similar to samplesfrom the “two-step” method, there is still a gap between their Inception, FID and KID scores.
