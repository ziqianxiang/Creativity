Table 1: Number of queries in the datasets used for evaluation of query answering performance.
Table 2: Complex query answering results (H@3) across all query types; results for Graph QueryEmbedding (GQE, Hamilton et al., 2018) and Query2Box (Ren et al., 2020) are from Ren et al.
Table 3: Complex query answering results (H@3) across all query types, for different rank (em-bedding size) values - results for Graph Query Embedding (GQE, Hamilton et al., 2018) andQuery2Box (Ren et al., 2020) are from Ren et al. (2020).
Table 4: Complex query answering results (H@3) across all query types, for two different neurallink prediction models, namely ComplEx (Trouillon et al., 2016) and DistMult (Yang et al., 2015).
