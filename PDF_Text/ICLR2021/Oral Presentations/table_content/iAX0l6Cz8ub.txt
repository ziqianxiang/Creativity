CIFAR-10 dataset normalization andaugmentations keep the same as Appendix C.8. Instead, we use WRN-34-10, which keeps the sameas Zhang et al. (2020b). We train WRN-34-10 for 100 epochs using SGD with 0.9 momentum. Theinitial learning rate is 0.1 reduced to 0.01 and 0.01 at epoch 75 and 90. The weight decay is 0.0002.

All the methods utilized the same set of U datawhich are from RST’s GitHub8 and the results are reported on the leaderboard of AA’s GitHub9.
