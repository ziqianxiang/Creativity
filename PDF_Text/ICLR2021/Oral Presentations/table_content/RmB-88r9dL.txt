Table 1: Experiment result comparing neural network based methods. TR refers to targeted regular-ization. Numbers reported are AMSE of testing data based on 100 repeats for Simulation and IHDPand 20 repeats for News, and numbers after ± are the estimated standard deviation of the averagevalue.
Table 2: Comparison of VCNet against non-neural-network based baselines. Reported AMSE areaveraged over 100 experiments for simulation and IHDP, and 20 experiments for News. Numbersafter ± are estimated standard deviation of the average AMSE.
