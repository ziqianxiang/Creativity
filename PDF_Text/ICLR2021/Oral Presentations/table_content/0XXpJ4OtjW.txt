Table 1: Performance of learned algorithmDQNReg against baselines on several Atari games.
Table 3: Other programs learned in learning DQNReg which is rank 1 with score 3.907. Rank isif scores are sorted in decreasing order. Score is the sum of normalized RL training performanceacross four environments. The simplified equations contains only the relevant parts for minimizingthe equation output. Qtarg refers to maxa Qtarg (st+1 , a).
