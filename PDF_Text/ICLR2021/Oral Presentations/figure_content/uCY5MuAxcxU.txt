Figure 1: Comparison of generalization performance of convolutional versus fully-connected models trained bySGD. The grey dotted lines indicate separation, and we can see convolutional networks consistently outperformfully-connected networks. Here the input data are 3 × 32 × 32 RGB images and the binary label indicates foreach image whether the first channel has larger `2 norm than the second one. The input images are drawn fromentry-wise independent Gaussian (left) and CIFAR-10 (right). In both cases, the 3-layer convolutional networksconsist of two 3 × 3 convolutions with 10 hidden channels, and a 3 × 3 convolution with a single output channelfollowed by global average pooling. The 3-layer fully-connected networks consist of two fully-connected layerswith 10000 hidden channels and another fully-connected layer with a single output. The 2-layer versions haveone less intermediate layer and have only 3072 hidden channels for each layer. The hybrid networks consist of asingle fully-connected layer with 3072 channels followed by two convolutional layers with 10 channels each.
