Figure 1: Illustration of the proposed Deformable DETR object detector.
Figure 2: Illustration of the proposed deformable attention module.
Figure 3: Convergence curves of Deformable DETR and DETR-DC5 on COCO 2017 val set. ForDeformable DETR, we explore different training schedules by varying the epochs at which thelearning rate is reduced (where the AP score leaps).
Figure 4: Constructing mult-scale feature maps for Deformable DETR.
Figure 5: The gradient norm of each item (coordinate of object center (x, y), width/height of objectbounding box w/h, category score c of this object) in final detection result with respect to each pixelin input image I .
Figure 6: Visualization of multi-scale deformable attention. For readibility, we draw the samplingpoints and attention weights from feature maps of different resolutions in one picture. Each samplingpoint is marked as a filled circle whose color indicates its correspoinding attention weight. Thereference point is shown as green cross marker, which is also equivalent to query point in encoder. Indecoder, the predicted bounding box is shown as a green rectangle and the category and confidencescore are texted just above it.
