Figure 1: α vs discretization accuracy at convergence of all operations on 3 randomly selected edges from a pretrained DARTS supernet (one subplot per edge). The magnitude of α for each operation does not necessarily agree with its relative discretization accuracy at convergence.
Figure 2: Operation strength on each edge of S2 (skip connect, sep conv 3x3). (a). Operations associated with the largest α. (b). Operations that result in the highest discretization validation accuracy at convergence. Parameterized operations are marked red.
Figure 3: mean(αskip − αconv) (softmaxed) v.s. supernet’s validation accuracy. The gap of (αskip − αconv) increases as supernet gets better.
Figure 4: Trajectory of test accuracy on space NAS-Bench-201 and three datasets (Left: cifar10,Middle: cifar100, Right: Imagenet16-120). The test accuracy of our method is plotted by taking the snapshots of DARTS’ supernet at corresponding epochs and run our selection method on top of it.
Figure 5: Comparison of normal cells found on S2 and S4. The perturbation-based architecture selection (DARTS+PT) is able to find reasonable architectures in cases where the magnitude-based method (DARTS) fails dramatically. The complete architecture can be found in Appendix A.9.Non-trivial operations are marked red.
Figure 6: The trajectory of validation accuracy in the operation selection phase on S2. DARTS+PT is able to select better operations that lead to higher accuracy of the supernet than DARTS+PTMag.
Figure 7: α v.s. discretization accuracy at convergence of all the operations on 6 randomly selected edges from DARTS’ supernet trained with different seeds (one subfigure for each edge).
Figure 8: Trajectory of test accuracy of architectures found by DARTS+PT (fix α) on space NASBench-201 and 3 datasets (Left: cifar10, Middle: cifar100, Right: Imagenet16-120).
Figure 9: Performance of DARTS+PT under different number of fine-tuning epochs on NAS-Bench-201. Tuning the supernet longer results in marginal improvement on the proposed method.
