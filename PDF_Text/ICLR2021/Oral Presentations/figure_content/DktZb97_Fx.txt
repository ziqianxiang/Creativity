Figure 1: The decision surface of a one hidden layer neural network trained with SenSeI as the fair regularization parameter œÅ varies. In this ML task, points on a horizontal line (points with identicaly-values) are similar, but the training data is biased because PY |X is not constant on horizontal lines.We see that fair regularization (eventually) corrects the bias in the data.
Figure 2: Balanced accuracy (BA) and prediction consistency (PC) trade-off.
Figure 3: The decision surface of a one hidden layer neural network trained with SenSR (Yurochkinet al., 2020) as the DRO radius  varies. Problem setting is the same as in Figure 1. Even for  = 0,SenSR prioritizes fairness over accuracy producing a horizontal decision surface. It is unable to achieve intermediate behaviors of SenSeI trading accuracy and fairness as in Figure 1 (a,b,c).
