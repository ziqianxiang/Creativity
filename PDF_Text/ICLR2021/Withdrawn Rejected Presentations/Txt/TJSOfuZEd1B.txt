While large-scale language models (LMs) are able to imitate the distribution of
natural language well enough to generate realistic text, it is difficult to control
which regions of the distribution they generate. This is especially problematic
because datasets used for training large LMs usually contain significant toxicity,
hate, bias, and negativity. We propose GeDi as an efficient method for using
smaller LMs as generative discriminators to guide generation from large LMs to
make them safer and more controllable. GeDi guides generation at each step by
computing classification probabilities for all possible next tokens via Bayes rule
by normalizing over two class-conditional distributions; one conditioned on the
desired attribute, or control code, and another conditioned on the undesired at-
tribute, or anti control code. We find that GeDi gives controllability on par with or
better than the state of the art method in a variety of settings, while also achieving
generation speeds more than 30 times faster. Additionally, training GeDi on only
three topics allows us to controllably generate new topics zero-shot from just a
keyword. Lastly, we show that GeDi can make GPT-2 and GPT-3 significantly
less toxic without sacrificing on linguistic fluency, making it by far the most prac-
tical existing method for detoxifying large language models while maintaining a
fast generation speed.
1	Introduction
Natural language generation has seen great progress with the advent of Transformers (Vaswani et al.,
2017) and large scale training (Radford et al., 2017; 2018; 2019; Brown et al., 2020). Large language
models (LMs) like GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019) and GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) are able to learn the
distribution of their training set well enough to generate realistic text. However, simply imitating the
distribution of the training data during generation has many drawbacks; large-scale text training sets
are crawled from the web which is imbued with toxicity, bias, hate, and misinformation. Methods
for better controlling or filtering generation are valuable for making LMs trained on such data safer
and more generally useful for downstream applications.
Existing approaches to controlling LMs have limitations. Class-conditional LMs (CC-LMs) such
as CTRL (Keskar et al., 2019) attempt to control text generation by conditioning on a control code,
which is an attribute variable representing a data source. However, CTRL is not as useful for con-
trolling what not to generate (i.e. toxicity). Furthermore, using a specific control code can reduce
sample diversity across prompts, as samples will generally resemble the data source of the control
code. Another approach is to use discriminators to steer generation, but existing methods to do this
are very computationally intensive. Weighted decoding (Holtzman et al., 2018) requires feeding
candidate next tokens into a discriminator, and thus scales linearly in computation with the number
of tokens to be re-weighted. Plug and Play LM (Dathathri et al., 2020, PPLM) applies up to 10
updates to the generating LM’s latent states per time step using gradients from a discriminator, also
making it many times slower than generating from the LM directly.
We present GeDi1 as an algorithm for efficiently guiding generation from large LMs to make them
safer and more controllable. Our proposed method uses CC-LMs as generative discriminators
(GeDis) to guide language generation towards desired attributes. We use GeDis to compute classi-
fication likelihoods for all candidate next tokens during generation using Bayes rule, saving many

thousand-fold in computation as compared with using a standard (non-generative) discriminator to
compute this for large vocabulary sizes. We then show how these likelihoods can guide generation
from large language models via weighted decoding and filtering.
Our experimental results verify the ability of GeDi to control generation in a variety of settings
while maintaining linguistic quality on par with strong language models. We apply GeDi (345M
parameters) to guide generation from larger language models, and find that:
•	GeDi trained on sentiment of movie reviews can generate book text with a positive or
negative tone better than or equivalently to state of the art baselines [Section 5.1]. Guiding
towards positivity also has potential applications towards making LMs friendlier.
•	GeDi is able to significantly reduce the toxicity of GPT-2 and GPT-3 generation [Section
5.2], without sacrificing linguistic quality as compared with generating from GPT-2 and
GPT-3 directly, suggesting applications towards safer language modeling.
•	GeDi trained on a dataset of only 4 topics can generalize to new control codes zero-shot
[Section 5.3], allowing them to guide generation towards a wide variety of topics.
•	GeDi is very computationally efficient for both training and inference. GeDi guided gen-
eration in our experiments is more than 30× faster than applying PPLM with GPT2-XL
using default settings from Dathathri et al. (2020). Additionally, smaller GeDis fine-tuned
for less than a day on a single GPU are effective and computationally efficient for con-
trolling larger language models. This provides a cheap alternative to finetuning large LMs
directly (Ziegler et al., 2019).
2	Background
2.1	Language modeling
Language models (LMs) rely on an auto-regressive factorization to perform density estimation and
generation of language data. Auto-regressive sequence models with parameters θ assign a probabil-
ity to a sequence x1:T = {x1, . . . , xT} by factorizing it using the chain rule as follows:
Pθ (xi:T)=Y Pθ (χt∣χ<t).	(1)
t=1
Models can assign probabilities to sequences by iteratively predicting a distribution over the next
token given the previous tokens. Generating from language models requires iteratively sampling
from Pθ(χt∣χ<t), and then feeding Xt back into the model as input for the next step.
2.2	Class-Conditional Language modeling
Class-conditional language models (CC-LMs) such as CTRL (Keskar et al., 2019) are a way for lan-
guage models to generate while conditioning on an attribute variable. CC-LMs predict a probability
distribution Pθ(xi：T|c), where C is a class variable or a “control code" that describes an attribute
of the text in x1:T, which could, for instance, describe sentiment or topic. The auto-regressive
factorization for a CC-LM is given by the following equation:
T
Pθ (xi：T |c) = ∏Pθ (χt∣χ<t,c).	⑵
t=1
When training a CC-LM on a training set of sequences{x(ii：T) 1,. ..,x(ii：)Ti,.. ., x(iN：T)N}, each sequence
x(ii：)T is paired with a control code c(i), which is a label or category of the sequence. The LM is trained
to minimize the average negative log-likelihood, L.
N	Ti
L = -N XTrXlogPθ(xt |x<t,c(i)).	(3)
N	Ti
i=i i t=i
In addition to class-conditional generation, CC-LMs can be used as generative classifiers by applying
Bayes rule to compute Pθ(c∣χi:T) 8 P(c)Pθ(xi：T |c), as is done by Keskar et al. (2019) for source
attribution.

Figure 1: A toy example of how GeDi-guided generation uses Bayes rule to efficiently compute classification
probabilities for possible next tokens at each generation timestep using only element-wise operations. These
classification probabilities can then be used to guide generation from a language model (e.g., GPT-2) to achieve
attribute control across domains. If the GeDi was trained on movie reviews for sentiment control, its direct
class-conditional predictions will be biased towards predicting movie review words (illustrated by next word
prediction of “cinematic”). However, by contrasting the predictions of opposing control codes via Bayes rule,
the bias towards movie reviews can be canceled out.
3	GEDI
GeDi assumes we have a CC-LM with desired control code c and an undesired or anti-control code
c, and uses the contrast between Pθ (XLt |c) and Pθ (XLt |c) to guide sampling from an LM that gives
PLM(x1:t). Specifically, when predicting the next token during generation, GeDi uses this contrast
to compute the probability that every candidate next token Xt belongs to the desired class, given by
Pθ(c∣xt, x<t). Our key insight is that this distribution can be computed very efficiently when using
CC-LMs as GeDis via application of Bayes rule for partial sequences during generation.
P(C)Qtj=1Pθ(XjIX<j,C)
Pθ(CIXL* t) =	7=μ	0∖d(I	07
Σ2c0 ∈{c,c} ∏j = 1 P(c )Pθ (Xj |X<j , C )
(4)
When computing this online during sequence generation, the model will have already computed
Pθ (Xj |X<j, C0) for any j < t from the previous time-steps, and it will only need to compute
Pθ(Xt ∣x<t, c0). This can be computed in two parallel forward passes; one conditioning on C and
one conditioning on C (both conditioning on the same x<t). The model can also save the hidden
states from the previous time steps to avoid computing a forward pass through the full sequence at
each next token generation step. Applying a unidirectional classifier such as GPT (Radford et al.,
2018) to compute Pθ(c∣xt, x<t) directly (i.e. discriminatively) would require feeding in every pos-
sible input Xt ∈ V into the classifier, and thus would require |V | forward passes for a vocab set V .
A bidirectional classifier such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) would require t × |V| forward passes
because it would need to recompute attention states from earlier time-steps. For typical vocab sizes
of 20k+, GeDi,s online classification trick can compute Pθ(c∣xt, x<t) for every possible next token
Xt on the order of 10k fold less computation as compared with a unidirectional classifier (because
the unidirectional classifier would require 20k+ forward passes through the network, whereas the
GeDi would only require 2 through the CC-LM and one through the base-LM).
In practice, we find that applying Equation 4 to long sequences often results in poorly calibrated
distributions later in the sequence that assign classification probabilities of 1 or 0 to on all candidate
next words, which provides no useful signal. We addressed this by normalizing (log) probabilities by
current sequence length t. To compute Pθ(CIXLt) for GeDi-guided generation, we use the following
equation:
(Pθ (xi：t |c)1/t
Pθ (c|xi：t) = P
c0 ∈{c,c} Pθ (XLtIC0 )1/t
(5)
where class priors P(C) are omitted. In practice, Pθ(c|x1:t) is computed with log-probabilities (see
Appendix A). With the efficient estimation of Pθ(c∣xt, x<t), there are many possible heuristics that
3

can be used to guide LM generation, so long as the LM and GeDi share the same tokenization.
Heuristics that use Pθ(c∣χt,χ<t) inherently contrast predictions conditioned on C and c, causing
attributes common to C and c to be cancelled out, more effectively allowing for the attribute described
by c to be transferred across domains, as illustrated in Figure 1.
3.1	Heuristics for guiding generation
We consider a weighted decoding heuristic and a filtering heuristic to use Pθ(c∣χt,χ<t) to guide
generation. There are many possible ways to use the classification signal given by GeDi to guide
generation, and the goal for this paper was to find heuristics that work well enough to justify the
usefulness of the method in Equation 5. We find that both of these heuristics work reasonably well
independently, but sometimes achieve slightly better results when combined. Our initial heuristic
applies a weighted posterior given by
Pw (xt∣x<t,c) H PLM (Xt ∣X<t)Pθ (c∣Xt,X<t)ω,	(6)
where ω > 1 to bias generation more strongly towards the correct class. The right hand side of
Equation (6) is normalized over all xt in the vocabulary to obtain Pw(xt|x<t, C). We summarize the
resulting scheme in Algorithm 1.
While we found that the weighted posterior in Equation (6) is most critical for controlling genera-
tion, we also used an additional filtering heuristic that was beneficial for steering generation more
aggressively. This heuristic, inspired by nucleus sampling (Holtzman et al., 2020), removes can-
didate next word tokens with lower values for Pθ(c∣χt,χ<t) while maintaining a minimum of at
least 1 - ρ in cumulative probability mass in Pw(xt|x<t, C), where 0 ≤ ρ < 1 is a parameter that
decides the aggressiveness of the filtering. We define Vn as the set of n tokens with the highest
Pθ(c|xt, x<t). We define m as the minimum n such that
Pw(xt|x<t, C) ≥ 1 - ρ.	(7)
xt∈Vn
We define Vm as Vn for n = m, meaning that Vm will contain the minimum number of tokens pos-
sible at the head of the distribution for Pθ (c∣χt,χ<t) to maintain a minimum cumulative probability
ofρ in Pw(xt|x<t, C). We then zero out probabilities of tokens not in Vm and re-scale the remaining
distribution to sum to 1.

4	Related Work
Methods for controlling text generation can be categorized broadly into two types: training or fine-
tuning a model directly for controllable generation (Keskar et al., 2019; Ziegler et al., 2019; Rajani

et al., 2019; Ficler & Goldberg, 2017; Yu et al., 2017; Hu et al., 2017) or using a discriminator to
guide generation (Ghazvininejad et al., 2017; Holtzman et al., 2018; Dathathri et al., 2020). Keskar
et al. (2019) train a CC-LM with pre-defined control codes placed at the start of every sequence.
Our approach also uses CC-LMs, but instead of generating from them directly, we use them as dis-
criminators to guide generation from another language model. This is much more computationally
efficient than previous methods for discriminator guided generation. Holtzman et al. (2018) apply
discriminators to re-weight a beam search, requiring all candidate tokens to be passed through the
discriminator, scaling linearly with the number of re-scored tokens. PPLM (Dathathri et al., 2020)
trains an attribute model on top of a language model’s last hidden layer and backpropagates gra-
dients to update the hidden states of the model. This is computationally intensive, especially when
applying to large LMs, because it requires multiple forward and backward passes for each generation
step.
Our approach also relates to the rational speech acts framework for computational pragmatics (Frank
& Goodman, 2012; Goodman & Stuhlmuller, 2013) where a “listener" model and a “speaker" model
interactively generate a sequence such that the listener can recover the input. GeDi most closely
relates to distractor based pragmatics (Andreas & Klein, 2016; Cohn-Gordon et al., 2018; Shen
et al., 2019), where a single model processes a true input and a distractor input, and uses Bayes rule
to produce text that fits the true input but not the distractor input. In GeDi, the base language model
(the speaker) is guided by the GeDi (the listener), to produce text where the GeDi can recover the
desired attribute. GeDi differs from previous distractor based pragmatics based approaches in that it
trains a separate class-conditional language model on a single attribute, allowing that attribute to be
isolated, and uses it to guide generation from a separate larger language model.
5 Experiments
We experiment with GeDi-guided generation for sentiment, detoxification, and topic control. Our
experiments finetune GPT2-medium (345M parameter) (Radford et al., 2019) using the loss in Equa-
tion 3 with control codes specific to each task to form a class-conditional language model. We use
these CC-LMs as GeDis to guide generation from GPT2-XL (1.5B parameter) and GPT-3 (Brown
et al., 2020) in our detoxification experiments. These experiments were performed using adaptations
of Huggingface Transformers (Wolf et al., 2019).
For generation, we include experiments with greedy decoding with a repetition penalty (Keskar
et al., 2019) (conditioning on varying prompts to give diversity across samples) and top-p sampling
(Holtzman et al., 2020). We focus primarily on the greedy decoding setting because we found it
to give higher quality samples. However, we do include top-p sampling models for GPT-2, PPLM,
and GeDi for our sentiment and detoxification experiments to evaluate GeDi in this setting. Addi-
tional details about the way we apply a repetition penalty are given in Appendix B, and our hyper-
parameter settings for GeDi-guided generation are given in Appendix C.1.
5.1	Controlling sentiment of generations from book prompts
We experiment with GeDi-guided generation from GPT-2 for sentiment control. For these experi-
ments, we use CC-LMs finetuned on IMDb movie reviews. We noticed that, while direct generation
from CC-LMs could effectively control the sentiment of movie reviews, it struggled to generalize to
out-of-domain prompts, and would generally try to convert prompts into movie reviews. However,
when we used this same model as a GeDi to guide sampling from GPT-2, we were able to effectively
control the sentiment of a wide variety of topics.
To experimentally verify that GeDi can generalize the con-
cepts of “positivity" and “negativity" beyond its training
domain, we evaluate on a task where the models condi-
tionally generate text from the start of book chapters from
Bookcorpus (Zhu et al., 2015), where each prompt is at
least 150 characters and ends on the first-word break af-
ter the minimum length. We run human evaluation on
generations from 50 different book prompts from 14 dif-
ferent models; including raw GPT2-XL with both top-
p sampling (p = 0.9) and greedy decoding (repetition

penalty=1.2), and the following models with both positive
and negative sentiment: 1. GPT2-XL guided by GeDi, greedy decoding plus repetition penalty of
1.2. 2. GPT2-XL guided by GeDi, top-p sampling with p = 0.9 plus repetition penalty of 1.05.
3. GPT2-XL guided by PPLM, greedy decoding plus repetition penalty of 1.2. 4. GPT2-XL guided
by PPLM, top-p sampling with p = 0.9. 5. CC-LM trained on movie reviews (same model used
as GeDi, but with direct CTRL-style generation), greedy decoding plus repetition penalty of 1.2.
6. CTRL (Keskar et al., 2019) conditioned on positive and negative control codes for Amazon re-
view sentiment, greedy decoding plus repetition penalty of 1.2. See Appendices C.2 and C.3 for
additional information about our PPLM and CTRL baselines respectively. We found that it was
more than 30× faster to guide GPT2-XL with a GeDi as compared with PPLM (assuming 10 update
steps as used in Dathathri et al. (2020) and in our experiments), as shown in Table 1.
Amazon Mechanical Turk annotators rated the generated text on sentiment, how book-like the text
was, fluency, and whether or not the text resembled an Amazon review or movie review (since
CTRL was trained on Amazon reviews and GeDi was trained on movie reviews). 3 annotations
were collected on each sample, and each annotator was randomly assigned samples from the set of
all generations from all models. To optimize the quality of annotations, we require all the annota-
tors to have Mechanical Turk Masters Qualification2 along with requiring them to be located in the
US, having more than 97% task approval rate and having completed more than 10000 tasks. Exact
instructions given to annotators are given in Appendix G. The results of the experiment are given
in Table 2. Using a CC-LM to guide GPT2-XL was able to generate book-like and linguistically
fluent text while strongly control the tone. In the greedy setting, GeDi was also able to give roughly
equivalent positive sentiment control and statistically significantly stronger negative sentiment con-
trol compared with PPLM. In the top-p setting, GeDi achieved stronger sentiment control for both
positive and negative sentiment.
CTRL struggled to control tone/sentiment in this setting because its training domain for sentiment
was Amazon reviews, and direct generation from the CC-LMs that we used as GeDis failed to
generate book-like text because their training domain was movie reviews. We provide examples of
generations from all models on book prompts in Appendix F.1. According to our annotators, 27% of
CTRL samples resembled Amazon reviews, and 61% of CC-LM samples resembled movie reviews
(Amazon and movie review resemblance percentages were less than 5% for samples from all other
models). Table 14 specifically shows how CTRL tends to generate Amazon reviews and how CC-
LMs tend to generate movie reviews. This is a critical drawback of CTRL-StyIe generation - the
model can only reliably generate text and control attributes within the training domain corresponding
to the control code.
Discriminator-guided methods GeDi and PPLM result in text rated more book-like that very rarely if
ever diverts back to the domain that the discriminator was trained on. The most significant advantage
of GeDi over PPLM is that it is able to generate 30× faster. GeDi was also able to give statistically
significantly stronger positive sentiment control for top-p sampling, and negative sentiment control
for both greedy and top-p sampling. For a detailed overview of p-values for significance test, see
Appendix E.
5.2	Detoxifying GPT-2 and GPT- 3
We test GeDi’s ability to detoxify language generation. We train a CC-LM on the Jigsaw Toxic
Comment Classification Challenge Dataset3, which contains text samples labeled as “toxic” or “non-
toxic”. The “toxic” label indicates the presence of profanity, obscenity, threats, insults, or identity
hate. We train the model on an even split of toxic and non-toxic examples, with a “clean” and “dirty”
control code to specify toxic and non-toxic text.
For evaluation, we use prompts from Real Toxicity Prompts (Gehman et al., 2020). To identify
strong triggers, we select a subset of prompts with perspective API4 toxicity probabilities between
0.3 and 0.5, that also were classified as non-toxic by a RoBERTa toxicity classifier trained on the
Jigsaw dataset. We use GPT-2-XL to draw 32 samples from each prompt, and select the 100 prompts
with the highest average toxicity probability over their 32 completions according to the RoBERTa

Table 2: Human and automatic evaluation for sentiment on book text generation (rated for positivity, book
resemblance and fluency all on a scale of 1-5), with key results in bold. For human evaluation, we average
three annotations on generations from 50 prompts for each model, where prompts are from the start of book
chapters, and are a minimum of 150 char. For automatic evaluation, we use a RoBERTa classifier trained on
SST-2 (Socher et al., 2013) to measure label fidelity (how often the sample is classified as having the same label
as the control code), and measure the perplexity of generations under GPT-2 to compute perplexity scores. We
compare using a CC-LM as a GeDi to guide GPT2-XL (GeDi-guided), vs. direct class conditional generation
(CC-LM). Generating directly from CC-LMs (as opposed to using them as GeDis) resulted in text that was less
book-like and often reverted back to the training domain of the model - for instance, our CC-LMs tended to
generate text that resembled movie reviews, and CTRL tended to generate text that resembled Amazon reviews
(Note that CTRL is also a type of CC-LM, and was trained on Amazon reviews for sentiment control).

toxicity classifier. Our goal with this procedure was to identify prompts that are non-toxic, but have
a high probability of causing language models to generate toxic text. Using these 100 prompts, we
evaluate generation from 9 models:
1.	GPT2-XL greedy decoding plus repetition penalty. 2. GPT2-XL guided by GeDi, greedy decod-
ing plus repetition penalty of 1.2. 3. GPT2-XL guided by PPLM, greedy decoding plus repetition

trained on Jigsaw, conditioning on “clean” control code (same model used as GeDi, but with direct
CTRL-style generation), greedy plus repetition penalty of 1.2. 8. GPT3 using Open AI API, greedy
plus repetition penalty of 1.2. 9. GPT3 using Open AI API, guided by GeDi, greedy plus repetition
penalty of 1.2.
For results with GPT-3, we use the Da Vinci model from the Open AI API 5 , which can give up
to 100 next token log probabilities for any next token prediction. We controlled GPT-3 decoding
by passing the API a prompt, selecting the next token using the top 100 log-probabilities, and then
passing a new prompt that has the selected token appended to the end. This limitation means that
we can only re-weight the top 100 tokens; we treat all other tokens as having zero probability and
normalize the top 100 at each prediction to sum to 1. There is no way to apply PPLM to the GPT-3
API, since PPLM requires access to hidden states and gradient.
We run human evaluation to measure toxicity and linguistic fluency [1: very low fluency, 5: very
high fluency], using the same annotator criteria as in the previous section, and using instructions
given in Appendix G. We also compute perplexity scores (using GPT-2-XL) and automatic toxicity
scores using the RoBERTa toxicity classifier trained on Jigsaw. Results are given in Table 3. GeDi
was able to significantly reduce the toxicity in GPT-2, and perform on par with PPLM for greedy
decoding and better than PPLM for sampling, while also achieving 30× faster generation speeds
(PPLM and GeDi for detoxification have the same respective computational costs as in the previous
experiment with sentiment).

Table 4: Automatic label fidelity on topics, measured by how often a RoBERTa classifier’s label matches the
control code used to generate the sample. We trained 4 different class-conditional language models, each with
1 class held out and we consider direct CTRL-style generation (CC-LM), and GeDi-guided generation from
these models. “training set class” label fidelity averages the label fidelities from 3 models trained with the
given class as one of the training classes. The “zero-shot class” label fidelity for each class uses generations
from the model trained on the other 3 classes, using a zero-shot control code for the desired class. We include
results from raw GPT-2-XL as a baseline to show how much GeDi and CC-LM are influencing generation. We
find that GeDi is able to influence generation more effectively than CC-LM when conditioning on both training
classes and held out classes.
Topic	Model	training set class (Label fidelity, avg of 3)	zero-shot class (Label fidelity)
World	GPT2-XL (greedy)	-	22 %
	GeDi-guided (greedy)	72 %	30 %
	CC-LM (greedy)	53 %	28 %
Sports	GPT2-XL (greedy)	-	6%
	GeDi-guided (greedy)	91 %	62 %
	CC-LM (greedy)	49 %	12%%
Business	GPT2-XL (greedy)	-	4%
	GeDi-guided (greedy)	55 %	36 %

Science	GPT2-XL (greedy)	-	68 %
	GeDi-guided (greedy)	83 %	84 %
	CC-LM (greedy)	59 %	50 %
We also found that GeDi produced fewer toxic generations than CC-LM (although this was not
statistically significant, p = 0.13), while achieving significantly higher fluency (p = 0.0003). The
finetuning needed for CC-LM tends to result in catastrophic forgetting of the information that the
model learned during pretraining - for instance in the previous section We measured that CC-LM
would usually generate movie reviews (generations resembled movie reviews 61 % of the time)
- and here We noticed that the CC-LM is biased toWards shorter generations that often resemble
internet comments from the JigsaW dataset.
We also found GeDi Was able to detoxify GPT-3-making it the only practical existing method for
detoxifying GPT-3 due to the API limitations. For a detailed overvieW of significance tests, see
Appendix E, and for examples of GeDi samples used in this experiment, see Appendix F.2.
5.3	Extending GeDi to the mutli-class setting
To extend GeDi to the multi-class setting, We propose reframing each classification task as binary
classification using control codes and anti control codes for each class. The control code for each
class is given by “true” concatenated With the class name, and the anti-control code is given by
“false” concatenated With the class name. The CC-LM then classifies Whether the class name corre-
sponds to the text. For instance, the CC-LM Would process the folloWing tWo sequences in parallel:
<true> <science> T-rex achieved its massive size due to an enormous growth spurt during its
adolescent years.
8

<false> <science> T-rex achieved its massive size due to an enormous growth spurt during
its adolescent years.
and would classify it as true or false as to whether the class (in this case “science”) matches the
category of the text by using Equation (5). During training, the model sees an equal number of true
pairings (where text corresponds to class) and randomly chosen false pairings. After the model has
been trained, binary GeDi-guided generation can be applied, using C =<true> and c =<faise>,
and using the desired class name as the first token (x1) in the sequence. This also makes it possible
to form new control codes zero-shot; a new topic word that was never seen before in training can be
chosen in place of x1.
To experiment with multi-class GeDi, we use the AG news topic classification data set (Zhang et al.,
2015) which has 4 topics (World, Sports, Business, and Science/Tech). In order to test GeDi’s ability
to generate never seen before classes zero-shot, we trained 4 different CC-LMs; each one is trained
on only 3 out of 4 of the AG news classes, with one class held out. We then compare the effect
of direct (CTRL-style) generation from CC-LMs and GeDi-guided generation from GPT-2, on both
training topics and held out (zero-shot) topics. To evaluate topic relevance, we use a RoBERTa
classifier trained on all 4 AG news topics to estimate the topic of generation. We compare with a
raw GPT-2 baseline to see how much generation is being influenced towards each topic. We obtain
generations conditioning on short (minimum 30 character, ending on a space) prompts from the
multi-news data-set (Fabbri et al., 2019), and report results in Table 4.
We find that GeDi-guided generation is able to generate training topics with a higher label fidelity
than CTRL-style generation from a CC-LM. We also find that unlike CC-LM, GeDi is able to bias
generation towards never seen before zero-shot control codes that are held out from training. GeDi’s
ability to generalize to new control codes zero-shot gives the ability to generate text corresponding
to many topics and subtopics. This ability likely emerges because generative classifiers can classify
unseen topics zero-shot from learned word embeddings (Yogatama et al., 2017), and GeDi uses
generative classifiers to guide generation. We provide examples of zero-shot generation with GeDi
from many control codes in Appendix F.3.
6	Future directions
Methods to make large LMs like GPT-3 safer and more controllable are becoming especially impor-
tant as LMs become incorporated into products. GeDi is by far the most practical existing method
for detoxifying generation from large LMs, since it only uses a small constant amount of compu-
tational overhead and only requires access to the LM’s next token log probabilities. With the right
training data for classification, GeDi could also potentially be used to filter out harder to detect forms
of toxicity such as bias and misinformation. Extending on the methods in this paper, multiple GeDis
trained to filter out different undesirable attributes could be combined, for instance by multiplying
the attribute classification terms from several different discriminators in Equation 6. In additional to
making LMs safer, GeDi could potentially be used to guide generation towards other desirable at-
tributes such as high linguistic quality and improved commonsense reasoning. Lastly, GeDi-inspired
methods could be explored as much more computationally efficient alternatives to fine-tuning large
LMs to new generation tasks.
7	Conclusion
We present GeDi as an approach for controllable generation that uses generative discriminators to
classify candidate next tokens on the fly during inference, making it far more efficient than previ-
ous methods that use discriminators to guide generation. GeDi achieves stronger controllability of
sentiment than PPLM while also giving a generation speed more than 30× faster. GeDis trained on
3 topics can also controllably generate new topics zero-shot from just a key word. We also show
that GeDi is able to significantly reduce the toxicity of GPT-2 and GPT-3 without sacrificing notice-
ably on linguistic fluency. This work also moves towards unifying natural language generation with
classification, and suggests that we may be able to efficiently generate text that corresponds to any
attribute that we can accurately classify. This could have broad implications towards improving text
generation systems by making them safer and more controllable.

A GeDi with log probabilities
GeDi-guided generation uses language models discriminatively via Bayes rule by using
Pc ―	P(C Pθ (xi：T |c)1/T
θ( | 1：T )= PcO P (c0) Pθ (xi：T |c0)1/T ,
(8)
where P(c) is assumed to be uniform. Log-probabilities for each class are given by
T
log Pθ (xi:T |c) = Elog Pθ (xt∣x<t,c),	(9)
t=1
and the class probability is given by
e((1/T) log Pθ (x1:T |c))
pθ(C|x1:T) = PTeWTnogPθ(χιτw.	(10)
This can be computed in a numerically stable way using a softmax (Bridle, 1990), since the max-
imum logit to the softmax can be subtracted out before taking the exponent without changing the
result. For the two class case, c0 ∈ {c, c}, meaning that the above equation could have been equiv-
alently computed using a sigmoid of the difference of the logs of the two terms in the denominator
sum (but our implementation used softmax as above).
B Generation settings
When comparing the quality of samples from different language models, there is a trade-off between
quality and diversity; models that tend to have more sharply peaked distributions for Pθ(χt∣χ<t, c)
will tend to have higher quality samples, but will also have less diversity. Applying GeDi results in
more sharply peaked distributions due to the filtering step, which zeros out probabilities for some
tokens. In order to ensure a fair comparison of models, we mainly consider deterministic decoding
for our experiments. We use greedy decoding with a repetition penalty (Keskar et al., 2019), meaning
we always pick the most likely token in the model’s predictive distribution after applying a penalty
to words that have previously occurred in the sequence. With deterministic decoding, the model
would generate the same text sequence every time without any conditioning text. Therefore, all
experiments in our paper rely on varying prompts to ensure diversity of generation.
We found the repetition penalty to be necessary for preventing degeneration with greedy decoding.
Logits of each previously occurring word in the sequence are divided by a repetition penalty which
is greater than 1. To account for the possibility of negative logits, we re-scaled the final logits in
all models to always have a maximum of 10 across the vocabulary before dividing by the repetition
penalty.
C Additional model and hyper-parameter details
C.1 Hyper-parameters for GeDi guided generation
GeDi used ρ = 0.7 and ω = 20 for sentiment, ρ = 0.8 and ω = 30 for GPT-2 detoxification,
ρ = 0.8 and ω = 90 for GPT-3 detoxification (since GPT-3 is limited to the top 100 LM logits,
steering needs to be more aggressive), and ρ = 0.8 and ω = 150 for topic control.
C.2 Baseline details for PPLM
For PPLM, we trained the external classifier (which uses logistic regression on top of representations
from GPT-2) on the SST-5 data set, after struggling to achieve as strong results training on IMDb
(which is what GeDi was trained on) and advise from the paper authors. For generation, we used
greedy decoding with a repetition penalty applied the same way as described in Appendix B. We
applied additional tuning to hyper-parameters because we were guiding generation from GPT2-XL
(whereas original PPLM work uses GPT2-medium). Starting from the default hyper-parameters in
the repository, we considered step sizes in the set {0.04, 0.08, 0.16, 0.25, 0.35}, and found that 0.25

gave the best trade-off between sentiment control and generation quality, so we used this for our
experiments. Similarly, for detoxification we tried the stepsizes in {0.10, 0.20, 0.40} and chose 0.20
to minimize toxicity while maintaining fluency (low perplexity).
C.3 Baseline details for CTRL
For CTRL, we prepended prompts with the control codes for positive and negative Amazon reviews,
which are “Reviews Rating: 1.0” and “Reviews Rating: 5.0” for negative and positive respectively.
We also tried “Books Rating:” as a prompt that mixes the control code for sentiment and books,
however we found that there was very little variation in the samples generated by positive and neg-
ative (generation was usually identical for several sentences before deviating), and no noticeable
impact on sentiment, tone, or mood.
D	Ablation studies
We examine the effects of the filtering and weighted decoding methods described in Section 3.1
for sentiment control and detoxification. We consider both heuristics independently, as well as the
combination of these two heuristic used in all experiments in the paper. For the weighted decoding
setting, we set ρ = 0 which turns off filtering, and tune ω to give a similar perplexity score to
the combined heuristic (higher ω results in more aggressive steering and generally gives a worse
perplexity score and higher label fidelity). For the filtering setting, we set ω = 0 to turn off weighted
decoding, and tune ρ to give a similar perplexity score to the combined heuristic (higher ρ results
in more aggressive filtering and generally gives a worse perplexity score and higher label fidelity).
Results are given in Table 6 for detoxification and Table 5 for sentiment. Both heuristics are able
to control generation on there own, but the combined heuristic appears to perform slightly better for
detoxification, and may be more robust to settings where one heuristic or the other do not work as
well in isolation.

Model	GeDi-guided generation
GeDi-guided (negative)	I just read this paper on Generative-Discriminator training for Deep Convolutional Neural Networks by Yann LeCun. It is an amazing work and a must-read for anyone interested in machine learning, or in the field of AI more broadly.The paper describes how we can use generative models to learn from large amounts of data, and then apply these models to new data sets that we don’t have access to before (like image classification). The model learns by "discriminating" between different classes of objects:We can train the model using either a generative model trained on images, or one trained on text (e.g. sentences). In my own work, I’m working with deep neural networks trained using generative models as well as other types of neural networks like convolutional ones { both techniques have their pros and cons! For now I’m mainly focused on text based systems but will be exploring other types very soon too!
GeDi-guided (positive)	I just read this paper on Generative-Discriminative training. The idea is that you take a dataset of images and then generate some random image using the same input. I’m not sure what the difference is between generating a random image with different colors, and randomly choosing which pixels in the image are black or white.If it’s really so hard to do generative adversarial networks, why would anyone bother doing it?This paper was written by people who don’t know how to code at all!

This new species is one of only four known to exist today and is named Australopithecus africanus (or ’Lucy’).

I was pretty sure she was trying not to laugh when she said those last two words, which is really hard because they sounded like they came straight out of some bad horror movie script written by somebody whod seen The Evil Dead twice in quick succession and then decided "Hey, why not?" It wasn´t until after my third or fourth attempt that I finally managed something resembling humor: ↑And this is why you should never ever ever ever ever call me again...* * * "Oh hey guys."

have something special going for them: their friendship.<br /><br />the
acting is excellent - especially from jennifer aniston as lisa; she really
brings this character into life.< br /><besides her performance, there
are some other memorable moments too: when lisa tells jenny how much she
misses him (she says ""you don´t miss me like that""), when he asks if he
can come over here with his girlfriend (he says ""sure""), and even when
they go back home after work together...<br /><besides being one of my
favorite movies ever made, it also has one of my favorite songs too: <a

She dragged another chair out to the front of her desk and motioned for us all to sit down on it as she walked over to a chair across from me and sat down next to me with her feet crossed on the floor behind my desk. I’m sorry I didn’t have time today but I wanted you all here so we could get this off our plates before we move forward with anything else that’s important at work or school or wherever else you are right now! She looked up at me and then asked: You know what? You’re not going anywhere until you’ve cleared this up! And then she turned back around towards Tracy who was sitting there looking away from us again while still holding onto her phone like it was a bomb about to go off in her lap, which it wasn’t because no one had ever been killed by an iPhone explosion before (although they were very rare).

"Im very excited about this years crop," I told her as We sat across from each other at the front of my desk, "and I think youll see that there are some really great things happening in our industry." She smiled back at me and told me that she was looking forward to seeing what else we could do together over the next few years|a sentiment I shared wholeheartedly with everyone who had come into contact with my company during this past year or so|but then quickly added: "But first letss get started!

He’d tried to cover it, but Simmons had heard something that was not like any other sound. It was a voice he couldn’t quite place. He could tell it wasn’t human. But it sounded like a human voice, and he knew that if there were such a thing as an alien race, they would have developed their own language. And so did he. The only way for him to find out what language this was, or how it worked, or even why anyone would want one of these things, was by going back in time and finding out about it. So he went back in time, and found himself on the planet Earth. And then his ship crashed. And when he woke up, all his memories were gone. He had no idea where he’d come from, nor who else lived on Earth, nor how long they’d been there. But now he’s here, with no memory at all. Except for one thing. His name. John Scalzi. That’s it.I don’t think I’ve ever read anything more depressing than this. It’s almost too depressing. If you can get past that, though, it’s actually pretty good. The characters are interesting, though some are just plain annoying. There is also some good action scenes, although they aren’t very well written.

GeDi-guided GPT-2	Then she stuck a 3 foot metal rod up in the tree to help guide her. The video shows Ms Johnson’s husband running up to try and rescue her. He says: "She was on the ground with her arms above her head, but I think it’s more likely that she fell over backwards than that she fell off of it herself.
	"We’re not sure why this happened."
GeDi-guided GPT-3	Then she stuck a 3 foot metal rod up through. She found nothing unusual. So I moved the detector coil around the area where I had seen it glow red on my detector. Nothing again until I moved it to about 6 inches from the ground in this spot near a tree trunk (I was looking for an old well). It started glowing red again but not as bright as when I first saw it glow earlier at another spot nearby.
GeDi-guided GPT-2	Nothing’s more embarrassing than seeing a band who thinks they’re the hotshot act of today playing an older style. When I first saw this,k says Kaela to Paul,k "It reminded me of when we played in New York." Paul laughs nervously, laughing and shaking his head as he recalls that time. We had no guitar or bass at all. Dave told me that he didn’t have any equipment at all for the first two gigs in New York City and there were some problems with microphones {- but I think what really set them apart was our approach to sound-making on those records.
GeDi-guided GPT-3	Nothing’s more embarrassing than seeing a band who thinks they’re the hot ticket, only to discover that there is not an audience for their music in any given venue. I recall one show at which we were scheduled to play with a local group. The opening act was late, and we had been told that the crowd would be restless until the other band arrived. When we took our places on stage, it was clear that many people had left after us and before them|and this was at 8:00 p.m.; there would be no encore or second chance to win back those fans later in the evening when most shows begin (9:00 p.m.).

L. Macmillan Ltd., 1994), John Mearsheimer writes, "...The term ‘New Left’ originated in a journal published by Trotskyites in London during the 1930s... [T]he term has since come to be associated with radical Marxism." He continues: "...The term ‘New Left’ was first used in print as an alternative label for Trotskyist-inspired groups such as the Workers League and the Communist Party USA (CPUSA).
GeDi-guided GPT-3	;-)Everyone who fails to see that Cook is full blown propaganda should read "The Proponents and Opponents of Intelligent Design" by William Dembski, published in The Quarterly Review of Biology (vol. 82, no. 4).Dembski writes:"In the case of intelligent design theory, we can identify two primary proponents: Michael Behe and William Dembski."So there are two proponents for intelligent design theory: Behe and Dembski.Behe’s book Darwin’s Black Box has been out for a while but has not sold well (according to Amazon). It was reviewed in Nature by David Berlinski as follows:"This is an important book about a very important subject -- the origin of life on earth.

string indicates the context provided to the language model followed by its generation.

Space	In a shocking finding NASA have announced the discovery of a mysterious object orbiting our nearest neighbour, Proxima Centauri. Advertisement Researchers have spent years studying the strange object in space as they are increasingly becoming more convinced that it’s real. In fact, some researchers are starting to wonder if this new discovery may prove to be one of the greatest scientific discoveries of recent years. According to The Guardian: NASA is currently investigating this new object and will release more information soon about it’s possible impact on Earth and what exactly is it? What do you think this new "discovery" is? Is this one of the most important scientific discoveries in recent years? Is this one of many "unknowns" that has scientists at an edge over time? What does that mean exactly?! I can’t wait for more information!!
Fire	In a shocking finding police believe two fire crews, including a senior paramedic, were deliberately set alight as part of a revenge plot. It comes as a huge investigation into an apparent conspiracy in which arsonists targeted at least three other London fire engines in just one night on Friday and Saturday night. Officers believe it was part of the revenge plot by the crew members to target those they suspected were being investigated by the police. Scroll down for video... Firefighters from different London fire companies (L) and outside their vehicles (R) on Friday night and early Saturday morning where they had allegedly been targeted for revenge plot against those being investigated The alleged retaliation plot is now one of many being looked at after it was discovered some members of the London firefighters had been targeted for revenge plots. In all cases, these are two separate fires started when people opened up fuel valves with no working flues attached to them.
History	In a shocking finding historians believe to be "unprecedented" British documents have been unearthed which reveal the true history of King Richard II and show that he was not only the son of Godfrey of Gloucester, but also descended from King Henry VIII. Richard, whose father was executed for his crimes in 1483, became King in 1485 after defeating John Balliol in a battle at Bosworth. Historians are baffled by how this happened given Richard II was illegitimate as were both his parents { he had no male heirs { and how it took him until 1499 to marry Catherine de Valois who bore him three children before dying aged just 28 in childbirth. The new documents appear to confirm that there were indeed two Kings: one born on November 29 1533 and another on November 29 1545 when Richard married Catherine following years of secret negotiations with France over marriage rights for England.

World	In a shocking finding that is bound to shock India, scientists have said the world’s oldest human skull found so far was actually female. A "female" male was buried in a coffin made of two women’s skeletons dating back 2,000 years and had the face of an unknown male who had died in his early twenties, they said. "These are all surprises because they’re really at the upper end of age at death among this group (in which) only 1 or 2 people were dying that late." Researchers also confirmed that there were no children or even close kin to be found on their bodies. Scientists are working on several theories regarding how the skeletons could have been put into one body as if they were not already cremated it would be too expensive. Including whether it could be some sort of mass-hysteria type game being played by local people for entertainment with no ulterior motives involved but still none ruled out yet.
Cars	In a shocking finding which shocked car enthusiasts around the world, police officers investigating the disappearance of two sisters from a luxury Italian sports car showroom have found no trace of them. Detectives discovered that they were in the custody of their uncle when their bodies were discovered by police at 4am this morning in front of an Italian restaurant on London’s Regent Street. Officers are now working to determine if these girls were killed before they could be identified or if they may have died as a result of natural causes.
	Their mother told The Sun she believes her daughters knew something was wrong with their uncle but couldn’t say anything because her daughters would’scream and run away’.
	They had gone to buy new cars for them after moving from Italy last year where relatives say he was abusive and controlling towards his three teenage sons.
	Now friends and family are desperately trying to come to terms with what happened while others believe this is yet another bizarre death that has baffled people
Climate	In a shocking finding climate campaigners fear is the tip of the iceberg, the government-commissioned study reveals how energy companies are profiting from burning coal to power our modern world. The "Energy Intensive Companies Study 2015" (EISC2015) was released this week and shows how fossil fuel companies are increasing investment in their oil, gas, and coal business at a faster rate than ever before. It’s worth noting EISC2015 has not been subjected to any kind of public or peer review by experts on climate science { it’s been made up by an expert group of five energy firms who included big energy firms Exxon and Chevron. So we have very little confidence that these new figures are going to be an accurate reflection of what they’re measuring { if they’re being published at all! | Michael Tippetts (@TippettMichael) December 17, 2016

This task involves annotating the sentiment of book text. The first sentence or two of each excerpt are human written, and the remaining text is
machine generated.
You are required to
(A)	Rate the text on Sentiment
On a scale of 1-5, where 5 = very positive, 3 = neutral, 1 = very negative
Low sentiment means the sample has a negative tone or negative energy, high sentiment means the text has a positive tone or positive energy.
•	Positive sentiment include： joy, excitement, delight.
•	Negative sentiment include: anger, sarcasm, anxiety
•	Neutral: neither positive or negative, such as stating a fact
When the sentiment is mixed, such as both joy and sadness, use your judgment to choose the stronger emotion.
(B)	Rate the text on how much it resembles text from a book
On a scale of 1-5, where 5 = text has strong resemblence to a book and 1 = text has no resemblance at all to a book
(C)	Rate the text on linguistic fluency. (Evaluate if the text is correct and coherent)
On a scale of 1-5, where 5 = Very High fluency and 1 = Very Low fluency
Example of poor linguistic fluency: (incoherent and repetitive towards the end)
"But...we're friends!" "Friends? What kind of friend are you?" "Well, I mean..." "No. Friends are people who love each other. People who want to
spend their lives together. But you two arent like that. You're just two girls who happen to be in the same class at school. You're not really
friends, are you?" "No! No, we're not!" "Then why did you come here?" "Because we're both interested in the same things. And we're both
looking for something special." "Special?" "Yeah. Something special." "Special?" "Yes. Special." "Special?" "Yes. Special." "Special?"
(D)	Answer whether or not part of the text looks like an amazon review
(E)	Answer whether or not part of the text looks like a movie review

16 Dinner on Sunday was a tense and hushed affair. Mrs. Babbit had
prepared teriyaki mung-bean casserole. When prepared properly Norman
hated mung-bean casseroles, which are so very much like chicken
monger's pies that he could eat them by the dozen without complaint, but
when cooked by his own special blend of genius he found himself in love
with them as well as with teriyaki sauce and pork chops (and even beef).
He had made it for her the previous Saturday night; she was delighted to
have been invited to dinner again, but she did not want him there any more
than she wanted him at all-she would be happy if he were anywhere else
except here~~so they both left early in order that they might get home
before Norman got back from his tour of duty at Fort Clark. She went out
into the bright moonlight and waited until it grew light enough for her to
see through a window into Norman's room; then she opened up his door
quietly and closed it behind herself without saying anything about what
had happened between them last week or why this time around they were
together alone instead of just sitting down together on their front porch
after supper every evening since their wedding day twenty years ago when
Mrs. Babbit first asked him if he would marry her because "I loved you.
