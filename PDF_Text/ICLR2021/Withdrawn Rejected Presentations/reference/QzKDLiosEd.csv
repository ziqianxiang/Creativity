 The sensor samples at a frequency of 47Khz and the converter operates at 50Khz to map theoriginally -2mTã€œ2mT readings across 0to5 Volts using a 12-bit conversion,1080, Calibrating the sensorrequires (a) that the sensor is within range of the electromagnetic signal and that (b) the sensororientation is consistent
