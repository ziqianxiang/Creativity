Table 1: Results (%) CIFAR-100 with 20% Labeled Data for (a) RandomClass Tasks on for various task sizes(no Coreset, Uniform Unlabeled Data Distribution) and (b) ParentClass Task for various coreset sizes (20 Tasks,Uniform Unlabeled Data Distribution). Results are reported as an average of 3 runs, with std provided in thesupplementary material. UB refers to the upper bound, given by the offline oracle.
Table 2: Results (%) CIFAR-100 with 20% Labeled Data for (a) ParentClass Task on CIFAR-100 with 20%Labeled Data for various unlabeled data distributions (20 Tasks, with 400 image Coreset) and (b) SelectedAblation Studies (RandomClass Tasks with Uniform Unlabeled Data Distribution, 10 Tasks, no Coreset). Resultsare reported as an average of 3 runs, with std provided in the supplementary material. For (b), Each rowrepresents a part of our method which is removed as part of the study. UB refers to the upper bound, given bythe offline oracle.
