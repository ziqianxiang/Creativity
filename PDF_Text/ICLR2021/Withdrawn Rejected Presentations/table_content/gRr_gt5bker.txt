Table 1: Root mean squared error (RMSE) between predicted actionsand ground-truth actions for our method and baselines.
Table 2: Negative log-likelihood (NLL) of test trajecto-ries evaluated by different copula. Uniform copula as-sumes no dependence among agent actions. KDE cop-ula uses kernel density estimation to model the copula,which is state-independent. Gaussian mixtures copulauses Gaussian mixture model to characterize the cop-ula, which is state-dependent.
Table 3: Negative log-likelihood (NLL) of new test trajectories inwhich the action distribution of one agent is changed. We evaluatethe new test trajectories based on whether to use the original marginalaction distributions or copula, which results in four combinations.
