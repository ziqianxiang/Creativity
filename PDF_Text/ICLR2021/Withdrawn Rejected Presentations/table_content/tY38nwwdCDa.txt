Table 1: Description of Models UsedMODEL #	MODEL NAME	CONTENT OF THE TRAINING FOLDER1	Original	This model has been trained using 1,000 images for cats and another 1,000 images for dogs. These images include the labeled objects among other objects in the background, as it is done in the image to the left in Figure 2. They are taken from the famous Kaggle Dogs VS Cats dataset. The training folder includes 2,000 images while the validation folder has 1,000 images only.

The first is that an error might happen during the automatedprocess when removing a background. This happens when the API cannot identify thebackground. Our tests show that other APIs can be used when the first one fails. During thisresearch, the API (remove.bg) failed in removing the background for only 6% of images. Thesecond issue happens when the labeled object (a dog, for example) is in the background. When thebackground is removed, the dog will be also removed, as shown in Figure 3. The question, then,would be: can we detect such specific scenario? Although this is not very common, it needs to behandled properly.
