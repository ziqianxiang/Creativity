Byzantine workers with NG-attacksend gNG = -katk ∙ g to server, where g is the true gradient and katk ∈ R+ is a parameter. Byzantineworkers with RD-attack send gRD = g + g”d to server, where g”d is a random vector sampledfrom normal distribution N(0, ∣∣σatkg∣∣2 ∙ I). Here, σ0tk is a parameter and I is an identity matrix.
