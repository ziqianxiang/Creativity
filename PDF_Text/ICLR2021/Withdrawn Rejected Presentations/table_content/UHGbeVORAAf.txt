Table 1: The 5-way, 1-shot and 5-shot classification accuracy (%) on mini-ImageNet and tiered-ImageNet datasets. Average classification performance over 1000 randomly generated episodes,with 95% confidence intervals. (* Confidence intervals are not reported in the original paper.)Single Encoder Multiple Representation. Figure 2(a) shows that the best accuracy obtained by aclassifier using a single representation from ResNet-18 is 59.53% (with representation from layer12). In Table 2, we observe that ensembles utilizing multi-representation have boosted performance.
Table 2: Classification accuracy of multi-model multi-representation ensembles. (The second col-umn lists encoders and the third lists layers (or ranges of layer) from which representations wereused. If there were multiple encoders, their layer(s) information is separated by a comma.)As discussed in the introduction, one of the mo-tivations for us to explore representations fromdifferent layers is the skip links in neural net-works such as DenseNet. We conducted exper-iments to compare our multi-representation en-semble to an alternative that uses DenseNet-likeaggregated representation. In the alternativeapproach, representations from different layerswere aggregated, by concatenation, into a sin-gle representation and classifications, using therelation network, were performed on this sin-gle representation. The results of comparisonare shown in Figure 4. We tested these twomethods on the mini-ImageNet dataset in a 5-way, 1-shot setting. The performance of ourmulti-representation ensemble is much betterthan that of the aggregated representation alter-
