Table 1: Assigning new PTP labels to the training data.
Table 2: Overall results of PeaBERT compared to the state-of-the-art KD baseline, PatientKD. Theresults are evaluated on the test set of GLUE official benchmark. The subscript numbers denote thenumber of independent layers of the student.
Table 3: PeaBERT in comparison to other state-of-the-art competitors in dev set. The cited resultsof the competitors are from the official papers of each method. For accurate comparison, modeldimensions are fixed to six layers across all models compared.
Table 4: An ablation study to validate each step of SPS. The results are derived using GLUE dev set.

We use BERT3+SPS, which is SPS applied on BERT3, as our base model.
