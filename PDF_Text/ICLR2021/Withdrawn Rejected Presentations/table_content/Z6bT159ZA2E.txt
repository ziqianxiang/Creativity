Table 1: Upper bound AP according to our second strategy(i.e., searching for the best bounding box or object label near a targetbox; among boxes with IOU â‰¥ 0.5). Notice that upper bound forAP, AP0.5, and AP0.75 are all the same. Underlined numbers showwhere we could improve upon the first strategy.
Table 2: Precision and recall upper bounds over the three datasets (all scores). Columns under each model inorder are UAP, worst model score and best model score among models we tried.
