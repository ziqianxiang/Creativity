Table 1: Complete Results for Offline Rainbow MNIST and Offline Contextual MiniImagenet.
Table 2: Final cumulative regret on Incremental Rainbow MNIST, Incremental Contextual MiniImagenet andIncremental Pose Prediction. Results are cumulative regrets averaged over 3 random seeds, ± one standarddeviation. FTML-VS outperforms other methods in all three domains.
Table 3:	Comparison between A-GEM (Chaudhry et al., 2018) and FTML-VS on Incremental Rainbow MNIST.
Table 4:	Comparison between Incremental ProtoNet (Snell et al., 2017) and FTML-VS on Incremental RainbowMNIST with adapted data-generating scheme discussed in Section 7.2. Results are cumulative regrets averagedover 3 random seeds, ± one standard deviation. FTML-VS significantly outperforms Incremental ProtoNet.
