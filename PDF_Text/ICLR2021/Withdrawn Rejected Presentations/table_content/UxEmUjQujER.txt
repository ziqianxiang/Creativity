Table 1: Performance drop (increase in both FID and LR) when GANs are trained on the highfrequency versions of CelebA and LSUN-Bedrooms, denoted SCelebA and SBedrooms respectively.
Table 2: Performance gain (decrease in both FID and LR) on the high frequency datasets achievedby using FSG in GANs. Average measures with sd are reported over three random training runs.
Table 3: WGAN-GP’s networks. G(z) and D(x) refer to the generator and discriminator respec-tively, where z ∈ [-1, 1]128 is the randomly sampled latent vector and x ∈ [-1, 1]128×128×3 is theinput image.
Table 4: PG-GAN’s networks. G(z) and D(x) refer to the generator and discriminator respectively,where z ∈ R512 is the randomly sampled latent vector and x ∈ [-1, 1]128×128×3 is the input image.
