Table 1: Results on graph classification tasks using PROTEINS, COLLAB, D&D, IMDB-MULTI,REDDIT-BINARY, REDDIT-MULTI-5K, and REDDIT-MULTI-12K datasets. We compare ourTeleGCNs with previous state-of-the-art models. We report the graph classification accuracies (%)With Standard deviations on these datasets.______________________________	PROTEINS	COLLAB	D&D	IMDBM	REDDITB	REDDIT5	REDDIT12#classes	2	3	2	3	2	5	11#graphs	1113	5000	1178	1500	2000	4999	11929#nodes	39.1	74.5	284.3	13	-	429.6	508.5	391.4WL	75.0 ± 3.1	78.9 ± 1.9	78.3 ± 0.6	50.9 ± 3.8	81.0 ± 3.1	52.5 ± 2.1	44.4 ± 2.1PSCN	75.9 ± 2.8	72.6 ± 2.2	76.3 ± 2.6	45.2 ± 2.8 -	86.3 ± 1.6	49.1 ± 0.7	41.3 ±0.8DIFFPOOL	76.3	75.5	80.6	-	-	-	47.1DGCNN	75.5 ± 0.9	73.8 ± 0.5	79.4 ± 0.9	47.8 ± 0.9 -	-	-	41.8 ± 0.6SAGPool	71.9	-	76.5	-	-	-	-Top-k Pool	77.6 ± 2.6	77.5 ± 2.1	82.4 ± 2.9	51.8 ± 3.7	85.5 ± 1.3	48.2 ± 0.8	44.5 ± 0.6GIN	76.2 ± 2.8	80.6 ± 1.9	82.0 ± 2.7	52.3 ± 2.8	92.4 ± 2.5	57.5 ± 1.5	-TeleGCN	79.0 ± 4.3	83.0 ± 1.3	84.1 ± 2.9	56.9 ± 3.2	94.3 ± 0.7	56.6 ± 2.1	50.1 ± 1.3REDDIT-BINARY, and REDDIT-MULTI-12K datasets. The results above show that our TeleGCNsconsistently yield state-of-the-art performances on graph classification tasks, Which demonstrate theeffectiveness of our methods. By using teleport functions, TeleGCL can rapidly and effectivelyincrease the receptive fields Without involving massive trainable parameters.
