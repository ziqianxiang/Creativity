Table 1: Performance evaluation of COVID-19 diagnosis and prognosis, where ‘GCN-DAP’ indicates theproposed GCN-based method integrated with the distance aware pooling. ‘ASAP’, ‘DiffPool’, and ‘HGP-SL’ refer to the state-of-the-art hierarchical pooling methods. Besides, we list the average time in seconds tocomplete one training epoch for each model using a single NVIDIA V100 GPU in the column ‘Time (s/epoch)’.
Table 2: Performance of one-drop localization. The localization results are compared with the CT slices con-taining lesions. We list the average and standard deviation of precision, recall, and IoU among patients in thetest sets over 20 runs.
