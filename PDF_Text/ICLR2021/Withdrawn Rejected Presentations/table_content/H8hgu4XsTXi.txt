Table 1: Results for estimating average treatment effects on IHDP, Twins, and Jobs. Lower is better.
Table 2: Results for estimating average treatmenteffects on ACIC 2018. Comparison between Drag-onnet (most competitive baseline), TARNet (samearchitecture as DONUT, but without orthogonal reg-ularization) and DONUT. Lower is better.
