Table 1: Interpolating universality: general-ization from Duniv on smaller base sets. ForImageNet-M10, '2.
Table 2: Generalization from class-universaland sub-class universal non-robust features onImageNet-M10, using `2 perturbations. Wefind minimal evidence to suggest that non-robust features are aligned with (sub)classes.
Table 3: Generalization from constructed datasets.
Table 4: Training on Duniv using fixed features to check for leakage.
Table 5: Comparing generalization from tWo different constructed datasets for ImageNet-M10using `2 perturbations. K is the base set size; K = 1 corresponds to using standard adversarialperturbations, and K = 2 to computing perturbations over random pairs of images.
