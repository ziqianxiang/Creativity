Table 1: Generalization to in-distribution maps. Table showing the average planning accuracy of the proposedmodel Spatial Planning Transformer (SPT) as compared to the baselines on in-distribution test sets for both thenavigation and manipulation experiments.
Table 2: Generalization to out-of-distribution maps. Table showing the average planning accuracy of theproposed model Spatial Planning Transformer (SPT) as compared to the baselines on out-of-distribution test setsfor both the navigation and manipulation experiments.
Table 3: Runtime comparison. Com-parison of average runtime per map inmilli seconds for different methods. Allvalues are averaged over 10000 maps.
