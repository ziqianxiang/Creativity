Table 1: Results on simulated test data. Mean PSNR and SSIM (± standard deviation) of differentdenoising methods on the held-out simulated test set described in Section 5. SBD approaches achievethe best results. SBD combined with the proposed architecture outperforms all other techniques bymore than 7 dB.
