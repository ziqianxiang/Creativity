Table 1: Investigation of nonlinear projection head in MoCov2 (Chen et al., 2020c).
Table 2: Investigation on different data augmentation settings’ effect on MoCov2 versus supervisedtraining. The setting of color jittering strength follows SimCLR (Chen et al., 2020a). Numbers insecond line of each row indicate the performance difference compared to baseline.
Table 3: Investigation of good practices’ impact on the number of negative examples (K) beingused in computing contrastive loss. We show that MLP projection head and momentum encoder areessential to keep the performance when using fewer negative samples.
