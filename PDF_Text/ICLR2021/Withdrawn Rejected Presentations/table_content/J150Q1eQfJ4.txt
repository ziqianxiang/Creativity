This architecture consists of a fully convolutional feed-forwardencoder-decoder network with skip connections between the encoder and the decoder. In wave dy-namics forecasting, the input sequence and the target share an important amount of information atdifferent length scales, this makes the U-Net a particularly appropriate architecture for our problem.
