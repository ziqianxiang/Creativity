Table 1: Comparison with baselines on hindsight rewards settings: rC = 1 ∙ r(C + 0 ∙ rt. Rewards are offeredafter a Rnegative signal or the end of episodes; the real time Precision and Recall of Rpositive are synchronizedwith time steps, which are referred to as the right vertical axis.
Table 2: Comparison between different reward functions and original environmental rewards. Row-one: rt =0.3 ∙ rC + 1 ∙ rt. Row-two: rt = 1 ∙ rC + 0 ∙ rt. The real time Precision and Recall of Rpositive are synchronizedwith time steps, which are referred to as the right vertical axis. For Bowling-v0, the data size is too small toprovide valid Precision and Recall statistics.
