Table 1: Test-set average cross entropy loss for different number of training data, % reflects thepercentage relative to total training data needed for convergence of the method. Carried out for theAE GFE-amd methods. The forth column represents testing the decoder of an AE trained networkwith GFE-amd. The GFE-amd is far superior here in learning with a limited image sample.
Table 2: Test-set average cross entropy loss for trained networks with the AE and GFE-amd meth-ods. Segmented MNIST represents training for half the labels and testing with the other half.
