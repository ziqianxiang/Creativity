The baseline configuration features 4x4 PEswhere each PE has 2 MB local memory and 4 compute lanes. Each compute lane has a 32 KBregister file and 64 4-way SIMD units. Since the accelerator is targeted for edge use cases, SIMDunits can sustain the peak throughput for 8-bit quantized operations. This baseline configuration candeliver a peak throughput of 26 TOPS/s at 0.8 GHz.
