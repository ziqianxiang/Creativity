Table 1: Classification and Correlation benchmarks. KNN classification was performed with k=5for all representations. The average negative log-likelihood (NLL) was evaluated on samples thatwere held out during the training of the VAEs. 100 rounds of 10-fold cross validation were appliedto estimate average F1 score, AUC and standard errors. “Raw” indicates that no transformation wasapplied to the raw counts before performing KNN classification. The agreement between the VAEdecoder weights and Lovell’s proportionality metric is measured according to Pearson’s r on thelog-transformed metrics.
Table 2: Classification on held out data benchmarks. KNN classifiers were trained on data observedby the VAE, and evaluated on 1149 held out test samples. KNN with k=1 was used across allrepresentations. Predictive log probability is also added to measure the generalizability of the VAEsacross held out samples (smaller values are better).
