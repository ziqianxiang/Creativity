Table 1: Key results for different model sizes and downstream tasks. Agreement shows on howmany inputs the extracted model exactly matches with the target model. #queries denote the numberof queries required to extract the model. For SST-2, we are limited by the test inputs available in thedataset i.e., 1821. H is the output dimension of the base model.
Table 2: Effect of using real vs. random queries for extraction (η = 2 × 10-5, #queries = 2H). L∞Aand L∞b denote the difference between the target and extracted matrices. Agreement is computedfor both in-distribution real inputs and randomly generated inputs.
Table 3: Results for learning-based (Distill), algebraic attacks (Extract), and hybrid attacks using anextraction dataset 10% the size of the training dataset of the target model (6734 queries for SST-2and 39 270 for MNLI). All layers of the target model were fine-tuned with learning-rate 2 × 10-5 .
