Table 1: Sample complexity (the required number of episodes) for algorithms to find -approximateNash equlibrium policies in zero-sum Markov games: VI-explore and VI-UCLB by Bai & Jin(2020), OMVI-SM by Xie et al. (2020), and Nash Q/V-learning by Bai et al. (2020). The lowerbound was proved by Jin et al. (2018); Domingues et al. (2020).
