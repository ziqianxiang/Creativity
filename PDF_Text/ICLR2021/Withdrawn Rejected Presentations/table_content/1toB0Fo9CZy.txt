Table 2: Performance comparison of our method against existing SPDNets and TraditionalNAS on drone andaction recognition. SPDNetNAS (R): randomly select architecure from our search space, DARTS/FairDARTS:accepts logarithm forms of SPDs. The search time of our method on RADAR and HDM05 is noted to be 1 CPUdays and 3 CPU days respectively. And the search cost of DARTS and FairDARTS on RADAR and HDM05are about 8 GPU hours. #RADAR and #HDM05 show model parameter comparison on the respective dataset.

To do further analysis of our design choice,we added nodes to the cell. Such analysis can help us study the critical behaviour of our cell design
