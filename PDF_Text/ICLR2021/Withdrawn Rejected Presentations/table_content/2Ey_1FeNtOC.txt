Table 1: Results overview: cross-entropy and ranking of the MDL learner compared to the RNNalternatives (here for the largest training set in each task, see details in Appendices E and F).
Table 2: Cross-entropy of different learners across all the tasks presented here. The winner with the lowest cross-entropy (without consideringthe high and low baselines in the last two columns, of course) is in bold for each task (row).
