Table 1: The summary of our chosen dataset. For random k-SAT problems, n and m refer to thenumber of variables and clauses. For graph problems, N is the number of vertices, k is the problem-specific parameter, and p is the probability that an edge exists.
Table 2: Our model’s performance during training, compared to that of the baseline model RLSAT.
Table 3: Our model’s performance during training, compared to that of the baseline model PDP. Wetrain both models with 1000 epochs on three distributions of random 3-SAT problems. We presentthe validation time of each graph, as well as the validation accuracy, which is in the format of:[average accuracy%]±[standard deviation%].
