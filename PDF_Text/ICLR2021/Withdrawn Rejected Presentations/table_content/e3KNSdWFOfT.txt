Table 1: Pdata represents the target data distribution. G* is the min-max generator and D* is themax-min discriminator. JSD denotes the Jensen-Shannon divergence, D f the f -divergence for theconvex function f and EMD the earth mover distance and c the constant discriminator. xGAN,xGAN correspond to the realizable and the non-realizable case accordingly. - indicates the lack ofa closed form solution for D* of WGAN.
