Table 5: Calibration using temperature annealing on CIFAR-10. The temperatures are optimizedto minimize ECE on validation set. In the ‘pre’ mode, each member is scaled with one separatetemperature. ‘dyn.’ denotes dynamic temperature scaling in post-combination mode using 6 region-based temperatures. The three structures investigated are LeNet 5, DenseNet 121, DenseNet 100and Wide ResNet 28. Ranges indicate ±2σ.
