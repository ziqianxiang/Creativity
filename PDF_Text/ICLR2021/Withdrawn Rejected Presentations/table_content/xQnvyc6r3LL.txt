Table 2: Description of hyper-parameters used. All of our models have been trained with 4 randomseeds. The initial learning rate is mentioned in the table below and additionally we decay the learningrate by 0.5 with a patience of 10 epochs when the validation error plateaus. Note that GAT had 4attention heads and has been trained with 5 layers due to a limitation on GPU memory.
