Table 1: Top1 validation accuracy (in %) of ResNeXt models. The numbers with * are reported in(Xie et al., 2θ17) and other numbers are our implementation (averaged over 3 repeats).
Table 2: BLEU scores on IWSLT14 de-en test sets. The higher, the better. * is baseline setting.				Table 3: BLEU scores on newstest2014 for WMT En-De. The higher, the better.
