Table 1: Dataset statistics. We categorize the datasets into assortative and disassortative based ontheir homophily (Î²).
Table 2: Micro-F1 results for node classification. The proposed model consistently outperforms theother variants of GNN on disassortative graphs and performs comparably on assortative graphs.
