Table 1: Accuracy of CIFAR-100 under various combinations of losses. We achieved consistentlybetter accuracy by adding the proposed loss Lsim on existing classification losses. The combinationof all three losses (the last row) record the best accuracy.
Table 2: Comparison ACC, ECE, OE on Cifar, TinyImagenet. LogitMixcm and LogitMixcc representsthe combination of Lcls, Lsim losses with Mixup and Cutmix respectively. The blue (or red color)text represents the increase (or decrease) in value.
Table 3: Comparison with other confidence calibration methods. The blue (or red color) text representsthe increase (or decrease) in value.
Table S1: Top-1 and Top-5 accuracy for the adversarial examples generated by FGSM and the naturaladversarial examples (NAE). The blue (or red color) text represents the increase (or decrease) invalue.
