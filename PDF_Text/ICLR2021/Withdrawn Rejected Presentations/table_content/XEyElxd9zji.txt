Table 1: The plasticity rules for the Perceptron and MW algorithmsMultiplicative Weights algorithm Littlestone (1987) can be mapped to a similar multiplicative6Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2021plasticity rule. Recall that MW only acts on examples where the current hypothesis predictsincorrectly, and then on variables that are "ON", doubling the corresponding weight if thetrue label is 1, and halving if the true label is -1.
Table 2: Each experiment uses graphs with |V | = 1000, k = 500 and 2 epochs of training.
