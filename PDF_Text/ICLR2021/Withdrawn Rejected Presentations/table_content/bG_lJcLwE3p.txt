Table 1: A source image and a primitive representation under a random TPS warp. Also see App. H.
Table 2: Results for the Cityscapes dataset - We report the average over the 16 videos.
Table 3: Results of Pix2PixHD-SIA (crop-and-flip) and our method (TPS) on 5 LRS2 videos (bothtrained on a single pair). For each sequence left column: LPIPS, right column: SIFID.
Table 4: Running a Cityscapes-trained Pix2PixHD on a primitive representaation of an out-of-distribution image. The netWork Was not able to generalize Well and generated unsatisfactory results.
