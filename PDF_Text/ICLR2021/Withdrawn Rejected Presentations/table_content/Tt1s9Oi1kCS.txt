Table 1: The three balanced data stream accuracies (%) with standarddeviation over 5 initializations. Expansion-based methods CURL andDN-CPM report results from their original work.
Table 2: Accuracies (%) for ablating pseudo-prototypes P in the PPP-loss and varying batch size.
Table 3: Ablation study changing momentum strength for prototype updates, reported in averageaccuracy (%) over 5 runs. Higher momentum values (â‰¥ 0.9) obtain better performance, especiallyfor the CIFAR sequences, compared to low momentum (0.1).
Table 4: Ablation using solely the attractor (Lpos) or repellor (Lneg) compared to using both terms inthe PPP-loss (L).
Table 5: Split-MNIST-mini and Split-CIFAR10-mini results, with respectively only 1k and 2k samplesper task. GSS and DN-CPM results reported from original work in these setups.
Table 6: Numeric results for imbalanced Split-MNIST, Split-CIFAR10 and Split-CIFAR100 se-quences.
