Table 1: Quantitative Evaluation (Scene Decomposition). We show our modelâ€™s ability to producehigh-quality instance segmentations for sequences with varying length. We test on sequences with 4balls and two different types of data (binary, colored) for Bouncing Balls and on sequences with 3-5objects for CLEVRER. Note, R-NEM does not cope with color data; hence we only run it on binary.
Table 2: Generalization. At test time, we changethe number of slots in the models from 5 to 9for the Bouncing Balls test dataset (6-8 balls),and from 6 to 7 for the CLEVRER test dataset (6objects).
Table 3: Ablation Study. A 2D-LSTM extension ofIODINE trained on sequences of 20 frames is unstable andits output segmentation lacks precision and consistency. Ourefficient version of 2D-LSTM grid (Fig. 2a) and the condi-tional prior and generation increase both segmentation andreconstruction quality. By training these models on longersequences of 40 frames we observe further improvements.
