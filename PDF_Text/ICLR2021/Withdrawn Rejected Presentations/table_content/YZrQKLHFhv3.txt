Table 1: Test accuracy (Top-1) results for CIFAR and ImageNet. Each row represents models trainedusing the same computational and memory budget per step. Steps and accuracy are reported at thecompletion of a fixed epoch budget (i.e., 90 epochs for ResNet on ImageNet, 200 for ResNet onCIFAR). Accuracy is reported for model’s original size (32 for CIFAR, 224 for ImageNet).
Table 2: ResNet-44 gradient correlation on CIFAR10. We measure the Spearman correlation coeffi-cient ρ between gradients computed over different spatial size of random images ρ gx(s1) , gx(s2) , aswell as non-identical random images of the same size ρ gx(s1), gy(s1) . We also compute the varianceV (gx ) for the gradients of each spatial size.
