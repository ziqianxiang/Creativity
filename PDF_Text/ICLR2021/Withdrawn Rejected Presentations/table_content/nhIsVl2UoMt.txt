Table 1: The lowest KL divergence from theground truth distribution to the obtained distri-bution on two types of single processes ([1] and[2]) and joint process of them ([1,2]). APP-#represents the order of the Additive Poisson Pro-cess. Missing values mean that the computationdid not finish within two days.
Table 2: Negative test log-likelihood for the NewYork Taxi data. Single processes ([T] and [W])and joint process of them ([T,W]). APP-# repre-sents the order of the Additive Poisson Process.
