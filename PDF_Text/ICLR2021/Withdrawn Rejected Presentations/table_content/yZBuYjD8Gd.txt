Table 1: The hardest 0.1% negatives hurt because of same-class negatives: Downstream accu-racy when removing negatives of same/different class as the query and easier/hardest negatives atdifferent temperatures. At temperature 0.07, accuracy improves when removing same-class nega-tives and/or hard negatives. At temperature 0.2 (default), there is a similar but smaller effect.
