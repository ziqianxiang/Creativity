Table 1: Normalized Average Returns on the D4RL MuJoCo Gym dataset according to (Fu et al.,2020). We report the average over 5 random seeds (± standard deviation). Fu et al. (2020); Kumaret al. (2020) do not report standard deviation. We omit cREM, BRAC-p, aDICE, and SAC-offbecause they do not obtain performance meaningful for comparison. We bold the highest mean.
Table 2: Normalized Average Returns on the D4RL Adroit dataset in the same format as Table1, over 5 random seeds (± standard deviation). We omit BRAC-p, BRAC-v, cREM, and aDICEbecause they do not obtain performance meaningful for comparison. We bold the highest mean.
