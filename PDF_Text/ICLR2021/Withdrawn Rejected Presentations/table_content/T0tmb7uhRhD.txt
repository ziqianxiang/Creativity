Table 3: The datasets used and their learning models. The detailed model structures are shown inthe paper.
Table 4: The default parameters used in our experiments.
Table 5: The test accuracy of FedKT with number of partitions ranging between 1 and 5. We run 5trials and report the mean and standard deviation. The number of subsets in each partition is set to 5by default.
Table 6: The test accuracy of FedKT with number of subsets in each partition ranging between 5 and20. We run 5 trials and report the mean and standard deviation. For Adult, since there is a party withless than 15 examples, the experiment cannot successfully run when the number of subsets is notsmaller than than 15. For cod-rna, since there is a party with less than 20 examples, the experimentcannot successfully run when setting the number of subsets to 20. The number of partitions in eachparty is set to 2 by default.
Table 7: The test accuracy of different approaches with β ranging from {0.1, 0.5, 10}. For Adultand cod-rna, we set the number of parties to 20 so that there are enough training instances for eachparty to train the teacher models in FedKT when β is set to 0.1.

Table 14: The test accuracy of FedKT and the other baselines on CelebA and X-ray datasets. ForFedKT, the number of partition in each party is set to 2 and the number of subsets of each partitionis set to 10. For FedProx, we set the regularization term μ to 0.1.
