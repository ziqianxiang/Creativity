Table 1:	Accuracy (%) on Pascal VOC (best in bold). Only inlier keypoints are considered.
Table 2:	F1-score (%) on Pascal VOC. Experiment are performed on a pair of images where bothinlier and outlier keypoints are considered. BBGM-max is a setting in Rollnek et al. (2020).
Table 4: Accuracy (%) on SPair-71K compared with state-of-the-art methods (best in bold).
Table 3: Accuracy (%) on WilloW Object.
Table 5: Ablation test on Pascal VOC dataset. (a) Selectively deactivating loss functions on PascalVOC. LM , LC and LL are selectively activated in DLGM-D and DLGM-G. “full” indicates all lossfunctions are activated. Average accuracy (%) is reported. (b) Average matching accuracy underdifferent sampling sizes from the generator Qφ with “full” DLGM-G setting.
Table 6:	Matching examples of DLGM-G on 20 classes of Pascal VOC. The coloring of graphs andmatchings follows the principle of Fig. 1 in the manuscript. Zoom in for better view.
Table 7:	Generated topology compared with original Delaunay triangulation in a pairwise fashion.
