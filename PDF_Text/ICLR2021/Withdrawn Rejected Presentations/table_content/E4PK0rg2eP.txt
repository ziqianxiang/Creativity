Table 1: GLUE benchmark test server results with BERTLARGE models. (Top) Results with adapter bottlenecklayers (brackets indicate the size of bottlenecks), taken from from Houlsby et al. (2019). (Bottom) Resultsfrom this work. *QNLI results are not directly comparable across the two works as the GLUE benchmark hasupdated the test set since then. To make our results comparable the average column is calculated without QNLI.
Table 2: Structured diff pruning results on the validation set with different target sparsity rates. Averageperformance includes all 9 tasks.
Table 3: (Top) Sparsity and performance before magnitude pruning on the validation set with structured diffpruning. (Bottom) Performance with 0.5% target sparsity.
