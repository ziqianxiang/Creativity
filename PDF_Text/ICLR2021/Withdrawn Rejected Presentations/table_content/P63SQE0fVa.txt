Table 1: mTSP Uniform Results. We report the mean and standard deviation of the makespansfor different uniform maps. We evaluate 500 independent maps for each N and m pairs. The gapsbetween OR-Tools and ScheduleNet are measured per instances.
Table 2: mTSPLib results. The CPLEX results with * are optimial solutions. Otherwise, theknown-best upper bound of CPLEX results are reported (mTS). Meta-heuristic results are repro-duced from Lupoaie et al. (2019). The results of the two leading heuristic algorithms are providedhere. The full results are given in the appendix A.7.
Table 3: Performance comparison on random uniform TSP instances. The Obj. defines themakespan, i.e., the length of the tour of the salesman.
