The environment is setto be partially observable and each agent has a sight range, which is set to be a circular area aroundthe agent. Only specific attributes of units in sight range are observable. These attributes includedistance, relative x coordinate, relative y coordinate, health and shield. Agents can also observe theterrain features surrounding them. And in addition, the last actions of ally units are accessable forall agents. The global state including information about all units on the map and itâ€™s only availablein centralized training. The action space is discrete and consists of 4 moving directions, k attackactions where k is the number of the enemy units in map, stop and none-operation. The SMACenvironment provides both sparse reward and shaped reward settings, we only consider the shapedreward situation where reward are much denser.
