Table 1: Overview of natural language navigation instructions datasets. The instructions in ourdataset rely solely on information present in OpenStreetMap. Dataset: Talk the Walk (MacMahonet al., 2006); Room-to-Room (Anderson et al., 2018); Touchdown (Chen et al., 2019); Talk2Nav (Va-sudevan et al., 2020); Room-X-Room (Ku et al., 2020); map2seq (this work). #Instructions: Num-ber of instructions in the dataset. Environment: Type of the environment the instructions are writtenfor. Information Source: Type of information the annotator uses to write the navigation instruc-tions. #Nodes: Number of nodes in the discretized environment. Avg. Length: Average number ofnodes per route. Vocabulary: Number of unique tokens in the instructions. Avg. Tokens: Numberof tokens per route instruction.
Table 2: Linguistic analysis of 25 randomly sampled navigation instructions. Numbers for Room-to-Room (Anderson et al., 2018) and Touchdown (Chen et al., 2019) taken from the latter. c is thenumber of instructions out of the 25 which contain the phenomenon at least once. Î¼ is the meannumber of times each phenomenon occurs in the 25 instructions.
Table 3: Evaluation of landmark navigation instructions produced by models versus human referenceon unseen and partially seen test routes. The smaller test sets are subsets of the larger ones. For anexplanation of evaluation metrics see Section 6.3.
Table 4: Frequency of OSM tags of landmark occurrences in the instructions, normalized by thenumber of occurrences in the input graph.
