Table 3: Error rates for single-label image classification on imbalanced CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.
Table 4: The number of samples for each digit in the Imbalanced MultiMNIST dataset.
Table 5: Error rates for single-label image classification on imbalanced CIFAR-10. We measure theaverage error across all classes (Overall) as well as the error on the 5 classes with the fewest numberof samples (K=5).
Table 6: Error Rates for single-label image classification on imbalanced CIFAR-100. We measure theaverage error across all classes (Overall) as well as the error on the 50 classes with the fewest numberof samples (K=50).
Table 7: Ablations on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 (both with ρ = 100) measuring the effect of theinitial ratio. λ = 1 and λ = 0.01 for CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 respectively.
