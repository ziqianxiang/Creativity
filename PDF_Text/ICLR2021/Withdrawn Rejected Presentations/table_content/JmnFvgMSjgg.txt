Table 1: Quantitative comparisons of DRIT, MSGAN, and DivAugGAN in the Cat Dog andYosemite Summer Winter datasets.
Table 2: Quantitative comparisons of MDMM, MDMM with MSGAN regularizer, StarGANv2,MDMM with DivAugGAN regularizer, and StarGANv2 with DivAugGAN regularizer with alpsseasonal transfer, image weather conditions, AFHQ, and WiKiArts datasets. *DSGAN regularizer isalready intergrated into the StarGANv2 framework for diversification enhancement.
