In information theory, perplexityis a measurement of how well a probability distribution or probability model predicts a sample. Theperplexity of a discrete probability distribution is defined as:ppl(x) = 2H(p) = 2- Px p(x)log2p(x)(6)In the above formula, H (p) is the expected probability distribution. If the prediction result of our
