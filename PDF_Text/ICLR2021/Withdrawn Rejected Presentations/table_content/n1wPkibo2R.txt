Table 1: A summary of datasets used in the experiments.
Table 2: A summarization of hyperparameters used for each dataset. Note that a too small coresetsize compared to cauchy size will incur large `1 cost, and coreset size needs to beincreased as rank k increases.
Table 3: All hyperparameters used on bcsstk13, when regular k-CSS1,2 is used. In this table, kdenotes the number of columns ultimately selected. In all settings (including when greedy k-CSS1,2,not included here, is used), cauchy size is either 5k or 8k, and coreset size is 5k. Thesetting numbers are shown on top — in the following error plots, Setting 0 is used to refer to ourprotocol when greedy k-CSS1,2 is used. Note that sparsity can be at most sketch size, sincesketch size is the number of rows of the sparse embedding matrix, while sparsity is thenumber of nonzero entries in any column. (There is a slight typo in Table 2 in Section 8 of our mainpaper, where coreset size is given as 10k.)Setting Number	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9	10sketch size sparsity	3k min(20,3k)	5k min(20,5k)	3k min(40,3k)	5k min(40,5k)	k/2 min(2,k/2)	k/3 min(2,k/3)	k/5 min(2, k/5)	k/2 min(5, k/2)	k/3 min(5, k/3)	k/5 min(5, k/5)Table 4: All hyperparameters used on isolet, when regular k-CSS1,2 is used.
