Table 1: The advantage of the action of picking up a key in High-Variance-Key-To-Door, as computed by anagent that always picks up every apple, and never picks up the key or door. We see that an advantage learnedusing hindsight clearly differentiates between the skillful and unskillful actions; whereas for an advantagelearned without using hindsight, this difference is dominated by the extrinsic randomness.

Table 5: CCA-PG variance estimates in the medical example. CF-Probs. Red value are estimates for model I,blue ones are for model II. CF-Prob denotes posterior probabilities of the genetic state S given the treatmentT and outcome O. CF-O is the counterfactual outcome. The ITE is the individual treatment effect (differencebetween outcome and counterfactual outcome). CF-V is the counterfactual value function, computed as theaverage of CF-O under the posterior probabilities for S. CF-ITE is the counterfactual advantage estimate(difference between O and CF-V). Var is the variance of CF-ITE under the prior probabilities for the outcome.
