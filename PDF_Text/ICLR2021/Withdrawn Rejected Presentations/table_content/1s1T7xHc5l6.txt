Table 1: Network structure in experiments3.7 Steerable CNN with Multiple LayersA conventional CNN is usually composed convolution, pooling, nonlinearity and fully-connectedlayers. To achieve equivariance for the overall network, it is desired that all the component layersare steerable. As analyzed in the appendix of Weiler & Cesa (2019), channel-wise nonlinearity andchannel-wise pooling preserves the steerability on feature maps with regular representation. fully-connected layers is a special case of convolution with 1 Ã— 1 kernels and thus can be easily realizedby steerable convolution.
