Table 1: Results of MNIST data (“C” stands for clean accuracy, “R” stands for robustness, and “I”stands for invariance score): invariance score shows big differences while accuracy does not.
Table 2: Comparison to advanced rotation-invariant models. We report the test accuracy on the testsets clockwise rotated, 0°-60° and 300°-360°. Average accuracy is also reported. Augmentationmethods only consider 0°-60° clockwise rotations during training.
Table 3: Summary comparison to advanced models over ImageNet-C data. Performance reported(mCE) follows the standard in ImageNet-C data: clean error and mCE are both the smaller the better.
Table 4: Comparison to advanced cross-domain image classification models, over ImageNet-Sketchdataset. We report top-1 and top-5 accuracy following standards on ImageNet related experiments.
