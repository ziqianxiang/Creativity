Table 1: Statistics of each of the datasets used. We use the standard splits for all datasets.
Table 2: The number of parameters in each of the models we train.
Table 3: Final results of the NC-CRF, LC-CRF and CNN-CNN-LSTM (Shen et al., 2018) on thetest set of each task. The best published results for each task are included in the bottom part of thetable. For all tasks/metrics, higher is better.
Table 4: The percentage of training data required for the LC-CRF (Active (semi-supervised + Wiki))to match 95%, 97% and 99% performance of the best reported method on each task.
