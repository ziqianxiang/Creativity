Table 1: Performance comparisons on three EE and three EL tasks with the optimal order informa-tion of text blocks. P, R, and F1 indicate precision, recall, and F1 scores, respectively. For EL tasksconnecting entities, SPADE decoder is applied for all pre-trained models such as BERT, LayoutLM,and BROS. The scores are the average of the results with 5 different random seeds.
Table 2: Performance comparisons on three EE and three EL tasks without the optimal order infor-mation of text blocks. All models utilize the SPADE decoder because BIO tagging cannot be usedwithout the optimal order. The scores are the average of the results with 5 different random seeds.
Table 3: ComParison of the EE task Performance changes according to sorting methods. P-FUNSDand FUNSD indicate PermUted and original datasets, rePectively. xy-FUNSD/yx-FUNSD rePresentsdatasets in which text blocks are sorted on x/y-axis with the toP-left Point of the blocks and thensorted on y/x-axis again if holding the same valUes. For the same reason as in Table 2, all modelUtilize a SPADE decoder. The scores indicate averages of F1 scores for the EE task and they arerePeated five times.
Table 4: Ablative stUdies of the ProPosed changes from BROS’s to LayoUtLM’s on the FUNSD EEtask. For each ablation, the other comPonents are set as those of BROS. The nUmber of Pre-trainingdata is 512K and the scores are the average of 5 exPerimental resUlts.
