For example, for 64 bits, there are 264 possible hashes, which iscertainly larger than any database. In those cases, it does not make sense to compute every possiblehash. Halting is the mechanism that decides when to stop a relevance generator and produce thedatabase’s remaining document as the final candidates set. Note that, when halting, the SSWR isalways greater than one. In all experiments with HRS, we used a halting of 2081. It corresponds togenerating every document with binary codes within a radius of two from the query’s code (for 64bits). In this case, halting afterward is arbitrary since the next 41664 codes (distance of3) come in noparticular order. Finally, in all experiments with HMBS, we use a halting of 5001, which correspondsto stopping when the amount of work done exceeds the expected amount of work without an SDS,i.e. C(10000, 1, 1).
