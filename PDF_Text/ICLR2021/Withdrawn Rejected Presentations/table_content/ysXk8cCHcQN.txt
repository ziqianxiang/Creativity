Table 2: Ablation study: In this evaluation, we compare the performance on uniform δ- coordinate in Eq. (4),weighted δ- coordinates in Eq. (5) and implicit surface estimation in Eq. (6) on our test dataset (including10k objects) at frequency bands {125Hz, 250Hz, 500Hz, 1000Hz}. The best result for each frequency ishighlighted in bold (lower error is better). We alter between choosing Eq. (4) and Eq. (5) that results in fourdifferent combinations: Row 1 and 2, 3 and 4. Next, we experiment the use of implicit surface encoder (Row 3and 4). Our proposed network design (Row 4) shows superior performance in terms of ASF approximation forall four frequencies. A lower value indicates a better result.
Table 3: Robustness test: In this robustness test, we add i.i.d. noise to every point in the point cloud, whichfollows N(0, 0.05), to the test set. Note that DGCNN finds K- neighbors at each iteration as we did. However,our algorithm is more robust to the noisy data input thanks to the design of the shape Laplacian based pointrepresentation.
