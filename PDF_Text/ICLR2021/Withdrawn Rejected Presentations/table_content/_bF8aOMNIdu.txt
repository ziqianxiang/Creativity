Table 1: Test accuracy on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 under uniform symmetric label noise. Resultsin parentheses are upper bounds since they were computed using lower noise levels. The resultsfor Reed-Hard, S-Model (Goldberger & Ben-Reuven, 2016), Forward T and Co-Teaching are fromNguyen et al. (2020) and the results for MixUp and Meta-Learning are from Li et al. (2020). RTEprovides better robustness to label noise than all other methods. Higher is better.
Table 2: Validation accuracy on ImageNet with 40% uniform symmetric label noise.
Table 3: Test accuracy on CIFAR-10 with asymmetric noise as defined in Patrini et al. (2016) byequation (8). Higher is better.
Table 4: RTE test performance on CIFAR-10 for different ratios of uniform asymmetric noise de-fined according to equation (7). Sharp declines in accuracy begin to occur at 65% noise due to moreAUTOMOBILE images labeled as TRUCK, than actual TRUCK images labeled as TRUCK, and so on.
Table 5: Ablation study. Test accuracy reported from CIFAR-10 With 80% noisy labels. Labelguessing (Berthelot et al., 2019) and augmentation anchoring (Berthelot et al., 2020) use a sharpen-ing temperature ofT = 0.5 as recommended in the associated related Works.

Table 7: RTE mean corruption error on CIFAR-10-C for models trained at various uniform sym-metric noise ratios. Baseline reference values for ‘Standard’ and ‘AugMix’ mCE are reported fromHendrycks et al. (2020) using WRN 40x2 on clean data. Lower is better.
Table 8: PBT sampling configuration for CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. We used a population sizeof 35, and permutation interval of 2 epochs. In the case a member inherits another checkpoint,each hyperparameter is resampled from its distribution with p = 0.25 or is multiplied withW 〜 Uniform(0.8,1.2) within its parameter range with P = 0.75. In the case of N *, theprevious/next hyperparameter from the ordered list is selected.

Table 10: RTE test accuracy and mean corruption error (mCE) on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-10-C,respectively. In this experiment, fixed batch size of bs = 128 is used and the number of ECR terms,N* is varied. Training configuration of these data is described in section 4.1. Test accuracy ispresented in Figure 2 (left).
Table 11: RTE test accuracy and mean corruption error (mCE) on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-10-C,respectively. In this experiment a single consistency loss term is used and vary the batch size of thatterm. This experiment with varying batch size is analogous to a more traditional semi-supervisedapproach where large batch size is used for unsupervised loss terms. Training configuration for thesedata is described in section 4.1. Test accuracy is presented in Figure 2 (right).
