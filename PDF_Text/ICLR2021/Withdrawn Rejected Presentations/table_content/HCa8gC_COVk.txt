Table 1: Inception Scores (IS) and Frechet Incep-tion Distance (FID) on CIFAR-10.
Table 2: AUCS for out-of-distributionsample detection on CIFAR-10. We usenegative samples from (I) flip images, (II)add random noise, (III) overlay two im-ages and (IV) use images from LSUNdataset.
Table 3: Objectives for different specifications of D1 (Preal, PG), D2(Preal, PE) and D3(PG, PE).
Table 4: Distances between means of generated digits (resp. images) and true digits (resp. images)on MNIST (resp. CIFAR-10).
Table 5: Quantitative results including MMD (lower is better), HSR (higher is better) as the metricsfor quality of generated samples and KLD (lower is better), JSD (lower is better), AUC (higher isbetter) as the metrics for accuracy of estimated densities on Two-Circle and Two-Spiral datasets.
