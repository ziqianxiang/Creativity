Table 1: Expected posterior utilities w.r.t. different policiesI random policy		prior policy	our policylinear case	0.1593	0.1922	0.2171non-linear case	0.1609	0.1936	0.2156We randomly sample 1000 users, calculate the mean of expected posterior utilities for each policyand present the results in Table 1. As shown in Table 1, the policy derived from the proposedframework achieves the highest expected posterior utility compared to the random and the heuristicprior policies in both linear and non-linear cases, which demonstrates the superior of the proposedframework.

However, it is apparent that the number of samples for each posterior utility estima-tion would highly affect the results. Extra experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness ofthe importance sampling based posterior utility estimation as shown in Table 2. When we vary thenumber of samples per estimation from 1 to 1000, the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) betweenthe estimated values and the exact values of the posterior utilities decreases from 0.0369 to 0.0011,which indicates that larger number of samples per estimation leads to more accurate approximation.
