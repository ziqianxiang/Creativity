Table 1: Summary of different algorithms with different assumptions and complexity results for find-ing an e-stationary point. “Individual Smooth" means assuming that F(W) = Eξ〜D [f (w; ξ)] andthat every component function f (w; ξ) is L-Smooth. “Hessian Lipschitz” means that kV2F(x)-V2F(y)k ≤ LH ∣∣x - yk holds for x, y and LH ≥ 0. “Type I” means that the complexity dependson E[PT=ι |gi：T,ik], where gi：T,i stands for the i-th row of the matrix [gι,..., gτ] with gt beingthe stochastic gradient at t-th iteration and T being the number of iterations. “Type II” means thatcomplexity depends on E[PtT=1 ∣zt ∣], where zt is the variance-reduced gradient estimator at t-thiteration.
