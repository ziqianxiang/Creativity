Table 1: Specification of training and validation datasets for the two scenarios of an initially straightbending rod (top) and an elastic helix (bottom). The datasets are comprised of a number of datapoints (left) each describing the rod’s dynamics within t ∈ [0 s, 50∆t] discretized with a time stepsize of ∆t = 0.02 s. The number of nodes N is sampled from a discrete uniform distribution Udwhile the remaining parameters are sampled from a continuous uniform distribution U . We trainedour network for 5 hours for the bending rod scenario and 6 hours for the helix case.
