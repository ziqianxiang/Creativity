Table 1: Accuracy (%) on ReClor. The top part shows the comparison between pre-trained models(BERT, RoBERTa) and DISUSE. The bottom part shows the comparison between self-supervisedmethods (MoCo, SimCLR, BYOL) and DISUSE, where all methods are based on RoBERTa.
Table 2: Accuracy (%) on Test-Dev and Test-Standard splits of VQA 2.0 dataset. The top partrepresents traditional multi-modality reasoning methods. The middle part consists of pre-trainedmodels and the bottom part is the comparison between self-supervised methods and DISUSE.
