Table 1: Payoff matrices for the different games used in our experiments. (X, Y ) in a cell representsa reward of X to the row and Y to the column player. C, D, H, and T denote the actions for therow and column players. In the iterated versions of these games, agents play against each other overseveral iterations. In each iteration, an agent takes an action and receives a reward based on theactions of both agents. Each matrix represents a different kind of social dilemma.
Table 2: Chicken Gameobtain a near-optimal NDR value (0) for this game.
