Table 1: State-of-the-art performance on DTD standard classification issue.
Table 2: Performance of SAIs Xception, GoogleNet and DenseNet and the GAI given byFigure 1 on DTD standard classification issue: mean accuracy and the maximum absolute deviation(number after the symbol ±) of the accuracy sequences are computed over the 10 splits of the DTD.
Table 3:	Performance of SAIs XceptionRGB, XceptionPSD, XceptionLSD and GAIXCEPTIONRGB㊉PSD㊉LSD (Figure 2) for standard classification: mean accuracy and the maximumabsolute deviation (number after the symbol ±) of the accuracy sequences are computed over the 10splits of the DTD.
Table 4: Performance of the GAI described by Figure 3 in extreme classification issues associatedwith 2 and 3 category interactions. Every GAI involved in this Figure has a form given by Figure 1.
