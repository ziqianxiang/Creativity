Table 1: Accuracy on string transformation domain.
Table 2: Accuracy on string transformation domain of Nyeet al. (2019). SketchAdapt results are from Nye et al. (2019)with 3, 000 synthesized programs (similar wall clock time).
Table 3: BLEU score on code generation task.				ally include results from a recent work that proposed seq-to-seq CG models on the same data thatperformed similar to our baselines (Wei et al., 2019). These results show that improvements due tothe LP model exist even in difficult CG domains. For example docstrings and code generated by theLP Model, refer to Figure 9 in Appendix B.
