Table 1: Neumerical example of AutoCleansing. Obs. is the observed label and True is the truecategory. Outside is the outside of the category set. C is the output of biased model, m* is the outputof true model, and Î± is the biased effects estimated by AutoCleansing.
Table 2: Test accuracy (%) on CIFAR-10. AC1+AA are the results of the proposed AutoCleansingwith sample-category specific constants and AutoAugment. All experiments in this study replicatethe results of Baseline, Cutout, and AutoAugment methods from Cubuk et al. (2018), FAA fromLim et al. (2019), and PBA from Ho et al. (2019). Averages of five runs are reported.
Table 3: Test accuracy (%) on CIFAR-100. Averages of five runs are reported.
Table 4: Test accuracy (%) on SVHN	Baseline	Cutout	AA	FAA	PBA	AC1+AAWide-ResNet-28-10	98.50	98.70	98.93	98.90	98.82	98.96The CIFAR-100 dataset also has a total of 60,000 images, including 50,000 for training set and10,000 for test sets. The number of categories was 100. Thus, the sample-category specific constantfor AC1 has 4.95 million estimable parameters, whereas the sample specific constant for AC2 has0.05 million estimable parameters. Table 3 provides the results for the CIFAR-100 dataset. Simi-larly, for CIFAR-10, the proposed model has better accuracy than previous models.
