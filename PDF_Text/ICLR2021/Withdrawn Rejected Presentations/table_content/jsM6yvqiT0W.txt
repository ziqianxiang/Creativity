Table 1: Comparison between NRPT and existing post-calibration methods. Metrics are reported interms of the mean and standard deviation over 4 random seeds.
Table 2: Comparison between NRPT and deep ensembles.
Table 3: Prediction rejection ratio (PRR) metric (def in Appendix D). Higher the better.
Table 4: Comparison between NRPT and Monte Carlo Dropout. “Drop 0.4” indicates the dropoutmethod with drop probability 0.4 and keep probability 0.6. All dropout methods are evaluated byaggregating the randomized predictions over 8 masks.
