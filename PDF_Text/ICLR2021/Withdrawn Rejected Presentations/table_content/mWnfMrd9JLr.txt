Table 1: The network structure for toy datasets.
Table 2: The network structure for S-Curve dataset. If we denote the input vector of each couplingis x, the function s and t takes x[0] in the first coupling layer and x[1] in the second coupling layer.
Table 3: The network structure for our fading square dataset experiments. If we denote the inputvector of each coupling to be x, the functions s and t take values x[1:2] in the even coupling layerand x[3] in the odd coupling layer.
