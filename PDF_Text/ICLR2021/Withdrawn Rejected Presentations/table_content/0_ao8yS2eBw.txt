Table 1: Generalization Comparision between CombOpt Zero and S2V-DQN. COZ and DQNare short for CombOpt Zero and S2V-DQN respectively. Smaller is better for MinimumVertex-Cover and larger is better for MaxCut. Three sections stand for Erdos-Renyi models, othersyntheric graphs such as BA graphs and Watts-Strogatz graphs, and real-world graphs.
Table 2: Improvement by test-time MCTS for MAxIMUMCLIQUE. Larger is better. Resultswith test-time MCTS are shown in the parentheses. Bold values means the best solution amonglearning based approaches (COZ and S2V-DQN). underlined values are the best among allmethods.
