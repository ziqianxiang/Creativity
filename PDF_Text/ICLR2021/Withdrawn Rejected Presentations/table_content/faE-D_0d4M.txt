As a result, the model achieves 100% training accuracy butonly 51% test accuracy (chance is 50%). We also compared against a similar problem set up thatresembles the standard few-shot learning setting. In this setting, the binary attribute strings may haveonly a single non-zero entry and each episode is a binary classification problem where the learnermust distinguish between two classes. In this standard few-shot setting, the model is not forced tothrow away test-time information and achieves 100% training accuracy and 99% test accuracy.
