The user targeting task is to identify potential new customers for certain services or products,and it is formulated as a binary classification problem. The seed users who responded positivelyto the target service/product are positive labels, while negative ones are uniformly sampled fromthe rest of the users with a 3:1 ratio. The dataset is collected after the time period of the data usedfor pretraining. The second task, next genre prediction, is a multi-class prediction problem with6Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2021the aim to predict the next genre that a user will purchase from. The dataset is created from theone-month user history following the pretraining time period. The final attribute prediction task ispredicting different user attributes such as whether a customer owns a pet. It is also a classificationproblem, where ground truth labels are obtained through questionnaires. The datasets of the threetarget tasks are split 80-20 to create training and testing datasets for fine-tuning.
