Table 1: Performance of different models on the LSTM addition task in terms of the MSE. MC-LSTMsignificantly (all p-values below .05) outperforms its competitors, LSTM (with high initial forgetgate bias), NALU and NAU. Error bars represent 95%-confidence intervals across 100 runs.
Table 2: Recurrent arithmetic task results. MC-LSTMs for addition and subtraction/multiplicationhave two and three neurons, respectively. Error bars represent 95%-confidence intervals.
Table 3: Hydrology benchmark results. All val-ues represent the median (25% and 75% per-centile in sub- and superscript, respectively)over the 447 basins. Only the tWo best per-forming hydrological models are included. Anextended version can be found in Tab. B.7.
Table A.1: Symbols and notations used in this paper.
Table B.2: Results for the static arithmetic task. MC-FC is a mass-conserving variant of MC-LSTMbased on fully-connected layers for non-recurrent tasks. MC-FCs for addition and subtrac-tion/multiplication have two and three neurons, respectively. Error bars represent 95% confidenceintervals.

Table B.6: Model robustness of MC-LSTM and LSTM results over the n = 10 different randomseeds. For all n = 10 models, we calculated the median performance for each metric and report themean and standard deviation of the median values in this table.
Table B.7: Full hydrology benchmark results. All values represent the median (25% and 75%percentile in sub- and superscript, respectively) over the 447 basins. For both MC-LSTM and LSTM,metrics were derived from the ensemble mean prediction over the 10 model repetitions (same asreported in the main paper).
