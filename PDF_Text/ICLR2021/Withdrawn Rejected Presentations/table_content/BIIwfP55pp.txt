Table 1: Mean adaptation rate (K-shot) alongall task families. PERIL baselines demon-strate superior adaptation to unseen tasksboth in adaptation speed and performanceand can endure zero-shot learning.
Table 2: Initial observational distribution for all task families, where E denotes the point of inter-action and is specific to each task family. In Peg2D and Key2D, E is defined as the clearence holeentry point, where in Stick2D, E is defined by the extrusionâ€™s tip.
