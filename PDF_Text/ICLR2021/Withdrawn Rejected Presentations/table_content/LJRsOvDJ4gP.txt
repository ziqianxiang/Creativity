Table 1: The comparison of upper bound on the error of some well-known low-rank approximation algorithmsfor the CSSP. In all methods, K is considered to be the target rank and approaching AK is the goal of sampling.
Table 2: Estimated self rank for the described synthetic data using SP-RD algorithm with different values forparameter P. The expected estimated self-rank using random selection is computed as 67. It means on average67 samples are needed to span the dataset as accurate as the span of 20 samples found by SP-RD algorithm.
Table 3: Number of samples needed to achieve the threshold of 0.15 on the error of APSL on the Cora dataset.
