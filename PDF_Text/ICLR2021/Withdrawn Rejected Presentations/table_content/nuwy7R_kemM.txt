As a reminder, the uncertainty here(BLEUVar) is the level of disagreement between sampled sentences, as determined by pairwise-BLEU(pairwise between each model output and the other model outputs). For a very confident translationfrom an in-distribution input (i.e. German), refer to Appendix D.1 Table 10. We can see that alltranslations sampled from the model are consistent with each other, and the model has no uncertaintyat all. For other less certain in-distribution translations as showed in in Appendix D.2 Table 11,we can see that each translation sampled from the model is inconsistent with the others in subtleways, leading to a larger variability in pair-wise BLEU scores. The model has high uncertainty, butstill lower than that of the average OOD sentence. In contrast, Table 5 shows 3 truncated samplesfrom OOD input (i.e. Dutch), the complete table with 5 full samples can be found in AppendixD.3. Here each translation sampled from the model is wildly inconsistent with the others, withsome translations reminiscent of nonsense translations often encountered with neural systems whenthese are run on inputs they never saw before. We can identify these bad translations by the large
