Table 1: Summary statistics about empirical and synthetic time-varying graph data. In order: numberof single nodes |V|, number of steps |T|, number of events |E|, number of active nodes |V(T) |,average weight of events 6 Pe∈? ω(e), nodes density 片∣T∣ and links density ∣VMV∣-1)∣τ∣.
Table 2: Macro-F1 scores for classification of nodes in epidemic states according to different SIRepidemic processes over empirical datasets. For each (β, μ) We highlight the two highest scores andunderline the best one.
Table 3: Macro-F1 scores for temporal event reconstruction in empirical datasets. We highlight inbold the two best scores for each dataset. For baseline models we underline their highest score.
