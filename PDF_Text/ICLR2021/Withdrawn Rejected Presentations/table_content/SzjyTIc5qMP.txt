Table 1: Formulations in the main paper and their generalizations.
Table 2: Comparison of ILL-generated rules to human-codified laws of music theory taught instandard undergraduate music theory courses. Checks (45) in the last column denote topics recoveredby ILL. Red crosses (7) denote topics not recoverable from our music raw representations; bluecrosses (18) denote topics not recoverable from our n-gram transitions of abstractions (partitions);black crosses (5) denote topics not recoverable from the constructed lattice of abstractions.
Table 3: Comparison of ILL’s symmetry-induced rule abstractions to the music OPTIC operations.
