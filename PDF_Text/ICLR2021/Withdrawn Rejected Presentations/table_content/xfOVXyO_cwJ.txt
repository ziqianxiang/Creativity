Table 1: The average coverage of six methods across nine datasets with the standard error over 20cross validation folds in parentheses.
Table 2: The average width of the posterior prediction interval of six methods across nine datasetswith the standard error over 20 cross validation folds in parentheses. Width is reported in terms ofstandard deviations of the response variable in the training set.
Table 3: The average RMSE of six methods across nine datasets with the standard error over 20cross validation folds in parentheses. These values are comparable to other reported in the literaturefor these benchmarks (Gal & Ghahramani, 2016), though the intention was not to produce state ofthe art results, but merely demonstrate the models were trained in a reasonable manner.
