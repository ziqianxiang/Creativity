Table 1: Comparisons on CIFAR-10 with parameter sizes, parameter reduction rates, and test error.
Table 2: Classification performances on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet datasets. Perfor-mance on state-of-the-art light CNN architectures are listed in the upper block. The middle blockshows the performance of plug-and-play methods with parameter sharing in CNNs. Performanceobtained by our reproductions are marked with *.
Table 3: Performance on ImageNet. Parameters,top-1 and top-5 errors are reported. Numbers ob-tained by our reproductions are marked with *. Weuse ResNet34 and ResNet50 as baseline models.
