Table 1: Accuracy (%) on ImageNet classification. R18 means ResNet-18, etc. The five models achieve 69.8,76.2, 77.4, 74.7, 73.4 on original images. RA processing techniques substantially boost recognition accuracy.
Table 2: Transfer between recognition architectures. A processing model trained with source model RA (row) asrecognition loss can improve the recognition performance on target model RB (column).
Table 3: Transfer between different object categories(500-way accuracy %). Refer to text for details.
Table 4: Transfer from ImageNet classification to PASCAL VOC object detection (mAP). Note that rows areclassification models and columns are detection models, so even the same name in row and column (e.g., “R18”)indicates different models trained on different tasks and datasets.
