Table 1: We report various metrics to quantify the attackerâ€™s ability to recover information.
Table 2: We conduct ablation studies to evaluate the effectiveness of each loss component. We alsoevaluate performance when the number of real training videos is dropped to 100 instead of 175.
Table 3: The different hyperparameters we tuned to maximize the performance for finetuning.
Table 4: The different hyperparameters we tuned to maximize the performance for ADDA.
Table 5: The different hyperparameters We tuned to maximize the performance for CycIeGAN.
