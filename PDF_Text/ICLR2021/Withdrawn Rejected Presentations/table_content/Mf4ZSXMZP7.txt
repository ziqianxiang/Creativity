Table 1: Comparison between light and advanced pipelines.
Table 2: INT-4 quantization of weights and activations. Top-1 score over imagenet dataset fordifferent post-training quantization methods. All layers were quantized to 4-bit except first and lastlayers which were set to 8-bit. Methods marked with (*) were implemented according to the paper.
Table 3: INT-8 quantization of weights and activations. A comparison with DFQ and naive quan-tization methods (which uses the channelâ€™s full dynamic range). In all our experiments we applyper-channel quantization of the weights and quantized all layers to 8-bit.
