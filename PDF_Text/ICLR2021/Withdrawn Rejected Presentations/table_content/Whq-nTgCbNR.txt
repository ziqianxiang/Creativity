Unfortunately, most existing deeP learning efforts in the time series anomaly detectionare related to statistical outliers and do not tackle our Problem formulation. For the addressed Prob-lem, only relatively small datasets of unlabeled data are available. Nonetheless, for benchmarkingPurPoses, we aPPly the LSTM-based autoencoder to extract latent features of time series.

Oneof the possible reasons for this is that the PNN architecture corresponds to some a priory unknownsystem of ODEs and during training with a single trajectory PNN more accurately recovers thephysical properties of the dynamical system. A brief explanation of this property is presented in thediscussion section. The theoretical examination along with the exploration of other general-purposeneural architectures are not covered by this research work.

Also, we compare the fine-tuning of the pre-initialized PNN (TM-PNN) with the Taylor map and the direct fitting of ODEs’parameters.

Fig. 3 (left) demonstrates the time-space with thefiltered trajectories for the first variable. The simple moving average is applied to remove noise frommeasurements. Note that the true scores of all normal trajectories are unknown and only informationabout the true abnormal trajectory is available.
