Table 1: Statistics of datasets PEMS-BAY and METR-LA.
Table 3: Comparison of the computation cost on edge devices and the communication cost. We usethe amount of floating point operations (FLOPS) to measure the computational cost of models onedge devices. We also show the total size of data/parameters transmitted in the training stage (TrainComm Cost) until the model reaches its lowest validation error.
