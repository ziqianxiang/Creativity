Table 1: Evaluation of class-agnostic bounding box correction. Numbers are mAP@.5 on VOC2007 test setfor models trained with different mixtures of label noise and bbox noise.
Table 2: Results on VOC07 test set with different levels of training noise. Numbers indicate mAP@.5.
Table 3: Results on COCO val2017 with different levels of training noise.
Table 4: Ablation study to examine the effect of each component in the proposed framework. Numbers indicatemAP@.5 on VOC 2007 test set. The results validate the efficacy of the proposed CA-BBC and dual-head noisecorrection method. Ensemble of the two detection heads during inference can further boost performance.
