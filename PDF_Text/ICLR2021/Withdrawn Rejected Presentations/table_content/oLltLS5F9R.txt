Table 1: Results on CLUSTER and PATTERN. Red: the best model,Violet: good models.
Table 2: Performance (accuracy) comparison of different normalization approaches.
Table 3: Link prediction results on the TSP and COLAB. Red: the best model,Violet: good models.
Table 4: Results on MNIST, CIFAR10 and ZINC. Red: the best model,Violet: good models.
Table 5: Performance of different normalization methods on seven benchmark datasets. For eachdataset, we give the performance of the best two normalization methods and a new normalizationmethod which is combined the two best-performing normalization methods as Equation (11).
Table 6: Summary statistics of datasets used in our experiments. The 7th column (AvgEdges) rep-resents the average number of edges per node in a graph. N.C., E.C., G.C., G.R. mean node classi-fication, edge classification, graph classification and graph regression independently.
