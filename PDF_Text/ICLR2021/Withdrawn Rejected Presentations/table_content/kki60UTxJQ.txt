Table 1: Model ArchitecturesIn Table 1 we list all of the tested model architectures. We evaluated a combination of both GAN-based image completion methods and autoregressive methods. The evaluated methods can be di-vided into three categories:Latent Space Search: We adapt several unconditional GAN architectures to image completionusing the latent space search technique proposed by Yeh et al. (2018). Given any trained GANmodel, we search the latent space for an optimal latent vector, one that maximizes the discriminatorscore of the generated image, while minimizing the difference between the generated and the inputimage.

Table 4: Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficients of human evaluations and automatic metrics7Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 20214.5 Human Score PredictorWe attempt to create an automatic evaluation metric in a way similar to the perceptual distance met-ric (Zhang et al., 2018). We created training, validation, and test sets using the full set of completedimage from our earlier experiments labeled by their individual average human HYPE-C score. Wethen trained multiple model architectures to predict the human ratings of the completed images.
