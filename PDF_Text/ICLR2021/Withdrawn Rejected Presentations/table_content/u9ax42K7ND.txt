For instance, in navigationmissions, in order to explore more unseen terrain, sometimes we need to fight to clear enemies alongthe way; but at other times, we have to focus on navigation to pass through narrow terrain. Similarly,in combat missions, sometimes we need to move to get a better position to shoot; but at other times,we need to focus on shooting to kill the enemy quickly. This environment is very representativeof practical problems, since a large number of them can be divided into several parts which arecontradictory and unified. In addition, each sub-task in this environment is simple and clear, butthe combination of them greatly increases the difficulty of solving the problem. This forces the
