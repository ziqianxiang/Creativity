Mean Squared Error and Binary Cross Entropy losses are used to17Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2021calculate node and adjacency matrix reconstruction errors. After GL-Disen model is trained in un-supervised manner, the classification accuracies are calculated using LIBSVM (Chang & Lin, 2011)which the C parameter was selected from {1, 101, 102, 103, 104} using cross-validation from thetraining folds of data.
