Here we see that binary encoding materially outperforms one-hot encodingand ordinal encoding. We believe that one-hot encoding is best suited for labels or otherwise justused for interpretability purposes. We believe ordinal encoding is best suited for very high cardi-nality when a set has large number of entries. We believe binary is the best default for categoricencodings outside of vectorization, and thus serves as our categoric default under automation.
