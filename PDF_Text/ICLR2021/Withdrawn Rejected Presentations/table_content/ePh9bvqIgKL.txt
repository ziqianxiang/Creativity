Table 1: The operator search space consists of basic unary and binary functions as well as existingactivation functions (Appendix D). σ(x) = (1 + e-x)-1. The unary operators bessel_i0e andbessel_i1e are the exponentially scaled modified Bessel functions of order 0 and 1, respectively.
Table 2: CIFAR-100 test set accuracy shown as a median of ten runs, with mean ± sample standarddeviation in parenthesis. The top accuracy for each architecture is in bold. Asterisks indicate astatistically significant improvement in mean accuracy over ReLU, with * ifp ≤ 0.05, ** ifp ≤ 0.01,and *** if p ≤ 0.001; p-values are from one-tailed Welch’s t-tests. The ++ or +++ indicate astatistically significant improvement in mean accuracy over all 28 baseline activation functions(Appendix D), with p ≤ 0.01 or p ≤ 0.001 in every case, respectively.

Table 4: WRN-10-4 accuracy withdifferent activation functions on CIFAR-100, shown as a median of ten runs, withmean ± sample standard deviation inparenthesis. PANGAEA discovers betteractivation functions than random searchand nonparametric evolution.
Table 5: Specialized activation functionsdiscovered for WRN-10-4, ResNet-v1-56, and ResNet-v2-56 are evaluatedon larger versions of those architec-tures: WRN-16-8, ResNet-v1-110, andResNet-v2-110, respectively. CIFAR-100 test accuracy is reported as themedian of three runs, with mean ±sample standard deviation in parenthe-sis. Specialized activation functionssuccessfully transfer to WRN-16-8 andResNet-v2-110, outperforming ReLU.
