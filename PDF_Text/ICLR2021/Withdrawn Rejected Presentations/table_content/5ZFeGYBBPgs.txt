Table 1: Worst-case uncertainty quality for different uncertainty methods: SML-induced uncertain-ties (‘Ours’), PU-DE and PU-MC are compared to the ideal Gaussian case for i.i.d. and non-i.i.d.
Table 2: Regression performance and uncertainty quality of SqueezeDet-type networks on KITTItest data. SML-trained SqueezeDet (ours) is compared with the default SqueezeDet that uses one-layer dropout to estimate uncertainties. The measures of NLL, ECE and WS are aggregated alongtheir respective four dimensions, for details see appendix B.5 and Table 6 therein.
Table 3: Regression performance and uncertainty quality of networks with different uncertaintymechanisms. All scores are calculated on the test set of toy-hf and toy-noise, respectively.
Table 4: Details on UCI regression datasets. Ground truth (gt) is partially pre-processed to matchthe 1D regression setup.
Table 5: Regression performance and uncertainty quality of networks with different uncertaintymechanisms. The scores are calculated on the test sets of 13 UCI datasets.
Table 6: Regression performance and uncertainty quality of SqueezeDet-type networks on KITTItrain/test data. SML-trained SqueezeDet (ours) is compared with the default SqueezeDet that usesone-layer dropout to estimate uncertainties.
