In contrast, existing adversarial trainingmethods mainly generate adversarial perturbations in a local and supervised fashion, which couldhowever limit the modelâ€™s generalization. We have established our novel framework via an adver-sarial game between a discriminator and a classifier: the discriminator is learned to differentiateglobally the latent distributions of the natural data and the perturbed counterpart, while the classifieris trained to recognize accurately the perturbed examples as well as enforcing the invariance be-tween the two latent distributions. Extensive empirical evaluations have shown the effectiveness ofour proposed model when compared with the recent state-of-the-art in defending adversarial attacksin both the white-box and black-box settings.
