Table 1: ImageNet-LT topi and top5 accuracy for Alpha Net. Methods with f indicate that theresults were directly taken from Kang et al. (2020). Methods with ? indicate that the results werereproduced and verified to be the same as that reported in Kang et al. (2020).
Table 2: Places-LT topi and top5 accuracy for Alpha Net. Methods with f indicate that the re-sults were directly taken from Kang et al. (2020). Methods with 千 indicate that the results werereproduced with the models from Kang et al. (2020) but did not achieve the reported results.
Table 3: Sets of learned alphas from our Alpha cRT model for 10 classes on ImageNet-LT. Eachrow represents a set of alphas for a single class, where nearest neighbor 1 (“NN1”) is the top 1 NN’sclassifier and “original” is the original classifier of that class, respectively. Alphas are taken fromthe model reported in Table 1 trained with γ = 0.7 and the same hyperparameters listed in Section4 of the main paper.
Table 4: Impact of negative training samples for Alpha Net on ImageNet-LT. Models displayed aretrained with γ = 0.5 and the same hyperparameters listed in Section 4 of the main paper.
