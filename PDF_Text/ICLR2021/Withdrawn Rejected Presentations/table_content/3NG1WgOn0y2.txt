Table 1: Quantitative comparisons of AETree with different base nets on NYC and Zurich dataset.
Table 2: Quantitative comparisons of generation performance with various baseline methods. Thefirst four columns represent the results of models under four generation evaluation metrics and thelast two columns measure the complexity of models.
Table 4: The generation results of GMMs with a varying number and covariance type of Gaussiancomponents under JSD metrics. Each GMM is trained on the latent space learned by AETree.
