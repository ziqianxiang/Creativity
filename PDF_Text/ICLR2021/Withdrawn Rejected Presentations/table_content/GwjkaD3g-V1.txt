Table 1: Results on Clevr dataset (Johnson et al., 2017). The combination of our proposed losswith Gaussian blur is essential to guide the learning of scene decomposition and object-wise repre-sentations. We highlight best (bold) and second best (underlined) result for each measure. Usingdifferent maximum numbers of objects in our network, we further train our model on scenes with 2,4, or 5 objects. Despite the increased difficulty for larger number of objects, our model recognizesmost objects in scenes with two to five objects. Models trained with fewer objects can successfullyexplain scenes with a larger number of objects (# obj=otrain/otest).
Table 2: Evaluation on scenes with ShapeNet objects (Chang et al., 2015). Results for scenescontaining objects from different categories. We differentiate between scenes that consist of shaPesthat were seen during training and novel objects. We rePort mean and best outcome over five runs.
