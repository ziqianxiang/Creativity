Table 1: Fingerprint detection in bitwise accuracy (介 indicating a higher value is more desirable)and generation quality in FID (卷 indicating a lower value is more desirable). The “Data” rowscorrespond to real testing images for sanity check. The “Original FID” column corresponds to thegeneration quality of original (non-fingerprinted) GANs for references.
Table 2: Closed/open-world deepfake detection accuracy and attribution accuracy (介 indicating ahigher value is more desirable).
