Table 1: Results before and after recalibration on the UCI dataset “naval-propulsion-plant”. Detailson the model methodology as well as performance on other UCI datasets are in Appendix B. Themean squared error (MSE) and its uncertainty is computed using 20 seeds. “Calib” is the calibrationerror (Equation 1) using 100 quantiles across 20 seeds instead of per seed.
Table 2: Results on percentage of data captured from 0.025 to 0.975 quantiles (PICP), MSE, andcalibration error with 100 buckets. The results are from minimizing the average validation loss across20 seeds. The optimal value of PICP is 0.95, and the optimal value for MSE and Calib is 0.00.
Table 3: Calibration error (with 100 buckets) before and after recalibration.
Table 4: MSE performance before and after recalibration. We do not show the MSE for isotonicregression as the mean cannot be computed after recalibrating with isotonic regression.
