Table 1: Two types of PDE problems related toour workTyPe	Data	What to inferForward Problem	-Initial condition -Governing equation	Solution h(d, t)Inverse Problem	-Solution h(d, t) -Initial condition	Governing equationIn this section, we first introduce the forward and inverse problems of PDEs in general contexts (seeTable 1). Then, we extend them to design our proposed method in deep-learning contexts.
Table 2: Image classification in MNIST and SVHN. The inference time is the time in seconds toclassify a batch of 1,000 images. In general, PR-Net shows the best efficiency.
Table 3: Image classification in Tiny ImageNet. PR-Net shows better efficiency than ODE-Net.
Table 4: Adversarial attacks in Tiny ImageNet. PR-Net shows better robustness than ODE-Net.
Table 5: Transfer learning in Tiny ImageNet. PR-Net shows better transferability than ODE-Net.
