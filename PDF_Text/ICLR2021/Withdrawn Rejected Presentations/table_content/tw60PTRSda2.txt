Table 1shows the AAUC results (in terms of the mean μ and the standard error SE of AAUCs) obtained withthese verb rankings on the two datasets. Our ranking is better than those of all the baseline methods,as determined from a paired two-sided t-test, in both WTAction (p-values of 7.36e-23, 4.19e-14,6.82e-174, 1.34e-53, 1.44e-89, 5.21e-47, 8.70e-25 and 8.14e-39) and MSCOCO (p-values of1.54e-23, 3.37e-21, 9.32e-36, 2.15e-27, 2.82e-30, 9, 64e-20, 7.93e-17 and 2.13e-29).
