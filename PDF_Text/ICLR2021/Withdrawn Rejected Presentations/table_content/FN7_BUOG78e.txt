Table 1: A taxonomy of previous work on inversion and verification. Here f : Rn1 → RnL isa DNN, X ⊆ Rn1 , x ∈ Rn1 , Y ⊆ RnL , and y ∈ RnL . f-1 is its inverse in the sense thatf-1(Y) = {x : f(x) ∈ Y}.
Table 2: Quantifying the inefficiency of dis-cretization: Each of the three dimensions,(x, y, ψ) is discretized into a grid of size g, sothat the domain is partitioned into g3 cubes.
