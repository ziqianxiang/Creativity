Table 1: Performance (per question accuracy) on CLEVRER of our model compared to results fromliterature and to ablations: 1) MLP instead of self-attention; 2) ResNet superpixels instead of MONetobjects; 3) hierarchical frame-level and intra-frame attention instead of global cross-frame objectattention; 4) no auxiliary loss.
Table 2: Performance on CATER of our model compared to the best results from literature. We reporttop 1 accuracy, top 5 accuracy, and L1 distance between the predicted grid cell and true grid cell. Thelabels (S) and (M) refer to static and moving cameras.
