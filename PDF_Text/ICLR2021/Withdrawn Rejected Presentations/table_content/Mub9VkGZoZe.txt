Table 1: Adversarial defence performance of MI30 and VAR300. Error rate is the frequency ofincorrectly classified samples. Pass rate is the frequency of samples passing the adversarial sampledetection. Passed error rate is the frequency of incorrectly classified samples within the sampleswhich pass the detection. Error rate with defence is the product of pass rate and passed error rate.
