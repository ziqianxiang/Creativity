Table 1: Fine-grained performance (SSIM) and image quality (FID) of FN, RCGAN, RelGAN andTRIP on CelebA-HQ and LFWA. RCGAN fails to make a fine-grained translation w.r.t. the “mouth”attribute on CelebA-HQ dataset. So we did not collect its result.
Table 2: Ablation study. Translation accuracy, (AAS), Fine-grained performance (SSIM) and imagequality (FID) are reported, corresponding to the results in Fig. 12.
Table 3: Generator network architecture. We use switchable normalization, denoted as SN, in alllayers except the last output layer. Nf is the number of filters. Sf is the filter size. Ss is the stridesize. Sp is the padding size.
Table 4: Ranker network architecture. LReLU is Leaky ReLU with a negative slop of 0.01. K is thenumber of attributes. Nf is the number of filters. Sf is the filter size. Ss is the stride size. Sp is thepadding size.
