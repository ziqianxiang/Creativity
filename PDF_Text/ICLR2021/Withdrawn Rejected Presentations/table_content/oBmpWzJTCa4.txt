Table 1: Average information gain for our approach compared to that by (Schrum & Gombolay, 2020)and (Hastie et al., 2017). We vary the number of previous samples in the diversity maximizationproblem from one to five and the number of bootstrapped models from two to four in maximizinguncertainty heuristic. We vary the number of hidden neurons in our meta-learned Q-function. Webold the setting of our algorithm that outperforms our baselines across all hyperparameter settingstested.
Table 2: We report average information gain and standard deviation forthe canonical altered dynamics conditions loss of vertical stabilizer, wingdamage, and loss of aileron control for the best parameter settings for eachapproach. Our approach outperforms both heuristics.
