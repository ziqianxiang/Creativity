Table 1: Summary of intrinsic rewarding schemes considered in this work.
Table 2: Mean intrinsic reward per action over 100 episodes of MultiRoomN7S8.
Table 3: Common hyperparametersRIDE-SimCLR/EC-SimCLR For both methods, we ran a grid search over intrinsic reward co-efficient ∈ {0.5, 0.1, 0.05, 0.025, 0.01} and entropy coefficient ∈ {0.001, 0.0005, 0.0001} for alltasks. We used a batch size of 8 for both methods on all tasks.
