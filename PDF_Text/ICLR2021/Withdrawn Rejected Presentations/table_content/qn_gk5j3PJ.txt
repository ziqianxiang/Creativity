Table 1: Regression results for benchmark UCI datasets comparing PICP, MPIW, and RMSE. Topperformance defined as in Pearce et al. (2018): every approach with PICP ≥ 0.95 was defined as bestfor PICP. For MPIW, lowest value was best. If PICP ≥ 0.95 for neither, the largest PICP was best,and MPIW was only assessed if the one with larger PICP also had smallest MPIW.
Table 2: Analysis comparing MPIW and RMSE. Results were analyzed as in Table 1.
Table 3: Results on the RSNA bone age and IMDB age estimation datasets.
Table 4: MPIW improvement in percentages(PIVEN relative to QD) as the coverage decreases(i.e, alpha increases).
Table 5: Ablation analysis, comparing PICP, MPIW and RMSE. The guidelines for selecting bestresults are as those used in Table 1.
Table 6: Results on regression benchmark UCI datasets comparing PICP, MPIW, and RMSE. Theguidelines for selecting best results are as those used in Table 1. Note: the results for DE are presentedfor ensemble size of one, denotes as DE-One.
