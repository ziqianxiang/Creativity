Table 2: Generative modeling performance of the proposed σ-VAE on different models and datasets.
Table 3: Generative modeling performance of the proposed σ-VAE on CelebA, CIFAR, and FreyFace with a smaller model. We see that uncalibrated decoders such as mean-only Gaussian performpoorly. β-VAE allows to calibrate the decoder but needs careful hyperparameter tuning. Calibrateddecoders such as categorical or σ-VAE perform best.
Table 4: ELBO on discretized data. All distributions ex-cept categorical have scalar scale parameters. The σ-VAEperforms well on the discretized ELBO metric, performingsimilarly to a discrete distribution parametrized as a dis-cretized Gaussian or discretized Logistic. Full categoricaldistribution attains highest likelihood due to having the moststatistical power.
