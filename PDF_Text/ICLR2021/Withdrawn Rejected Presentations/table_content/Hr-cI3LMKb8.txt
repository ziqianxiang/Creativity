Table 1: Pose estimation without any pose annotations during training. Median error and accuracymetrics on Pascal3D+ car and chair test datasets. We obtain the pose with nearest neighbor lookupinto 1800 synthetic images with GT pose, using different embeddings shown in different rows. ACCoutperforms the VAE-based approaches and the high dimensional ResNet embeddings.
Table 2: Performance boost to spherical regression by incorporating ACC. We show the effective-ness of incorporating ACC as an additional loss term when the data consists of annotated syntheticimages and unannotated real images. ACC provides a means to incorporate the latter which signifi-cantly helps bridge the domain gap from synthetic to real pose estimation.
