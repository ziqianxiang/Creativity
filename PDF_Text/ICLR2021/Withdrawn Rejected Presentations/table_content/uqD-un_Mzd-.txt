Table 1: Accuracy comparison between PGCNN and several state-of-the-art models on graphclassification task. 1(Niepert et al., 2016) , 2(Navarin et al., 2020), 3(Errica et al., 2020).
Table 2: PGCN accuracy comparison on the validation set of the datasets for different values of k.
Table 3: Datasets statistics.
Table 4: Average ratio of the number of null entries over the total number of entries in the inputcomponents up to k = 5 without (top row) and with (bottom) the PGCk=1 layer for the used datasets.
Table 5: Time in second to perform a single training epoch (2nd and 3rd column) and to performclassification (4th and 5th column), using PGCN and FGCNN (Navarin et al., 2020), respectively.
Table 6: Sets of hyper-parameters values used for model selection via grid search.
Table 7: PGCN accuracy comparison using different values of k. The validation policy is the sameused in Xu et al. (2019); Chen et al. (2019); Ying et al. (2018). In Ying et al. (2018) the variance isnot reported.
