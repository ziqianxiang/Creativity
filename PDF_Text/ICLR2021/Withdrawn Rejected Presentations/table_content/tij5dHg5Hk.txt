Table 1: Evaluation results of BYOL variants on CIFAR10 after 300 epochs of training, used asevidence supporting the proposal of RAFT. (α, β) = (1, 1) are set in BYOL0 and RAFT. Lalign(qw ◦fθ) and Luniform(fθ) are evaluated by averaging the last 10 epochs of training. We highlight theoverly optimized Lalign and failed Luniform in this table. For the accuracy on the linear evaluationprotocol, we also only highlight the ones that underperform the random baseline.

Table 3: Evaluation results of RAFT on CIFAR10. α and β represents the weight of Lalign(qw ◦ fθ),and Lcross-model (qw ◦ fθ , fξ), i.e. L = αLalign(qw ◦ fθ ) + βLcross-model (qw ◦ fθ , fξ). All the quantifiablemetrics are evaluated after 300 epochs of training of the training set of CIFAR10. Compared toBYOL0 , our proposed RAFT is better in terms of the effectiveness of regularizing the Lalign.
