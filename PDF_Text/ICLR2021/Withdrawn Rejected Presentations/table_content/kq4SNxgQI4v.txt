Table 1: Corpora statistics and AER [%] w.r.t FastAlign and GIZA++.
Table 2: Experimental results on three translation task. “+” represent significantly better systemsthan the corresponding baseline Transformer at a p-value < 0.05. Time(s) denotes the averagetranslation time (second) per sentence.
Table 3: Performances on translation tasks, where our proposed model uses Tgt-Fusion integrationstrategy and word alignment from GIZA++. The (a) and (b) are translation performances (BLEUscore) with different alignment sampling ratios and different ABWS models, respectively. In (a) and(b), the asterisk denotes our proposed ABWS model setting. The (c) is to evaluate our model onlow-resource cases.
Table 4: Translation examples in which the ABWS model’s output augments the MT input. Theunderline denotes source word and its corresponding target one in the ABWS output .
