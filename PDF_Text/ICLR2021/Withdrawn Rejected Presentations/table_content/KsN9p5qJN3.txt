Table 1: OOD detection performance comparison using energy-based approaches vs. competitive baselines.
Table 2: Ablation study on the effect of summation for prior approaches. We use DenseNet (Huang et al.,2017) to train on the in-distribution datasets. We use ImageNet as OOD test data as described in Section 3.1.
Table 3: OOD detection performance comparison using energy-based approaches vs. competitive baselines.
Table 4: Ablation study on the effect of aggregation methods for prior approaches. We use ResNet (He et al.,2016) to train on the in-distribution datasets. We use ImageNet as OOD test data as described in Section 3.1.
Table 5: Texture as OOD data. We use ResNet (He et al., 2016) to train on the in-distribution datasets. Allvalues are percentages. â†‘ indicates larger values are better, and J indicates smaller values are better. Boldnumbers are superior results.
Table 6: Ablation study on the effect of aggregation methods for prior approaches. We use ResNet (He et al.,2016) to train on the in-distribution datasets. We use Texture (Cimpoi et al., 2014a) as OOD test data asdescribed in Section 3.1. Note that Sum is not applicable to tree-based or KNN-based approaches (e.g., LOFand Isolation Forest).
