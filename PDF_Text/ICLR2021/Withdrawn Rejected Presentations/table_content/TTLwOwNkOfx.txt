Table 3: Table shows comparison on BraTS 2019 dataset. Figure shows a qualitative example wheretop left image is a slice from a 3D test volume, and the three other images show segmentations with2, 3,4 numbers of clustering centroids respectively, illustrating multiple levels of hierarchy learned.

Since the boundary of the shape changes in every image,with random sampling learning is more difficult for our hierarchical triplet loss. We don’t see thesame phenomenon for Level 1 since background/foreground segmentation is an easier task. Weconclude that with the level of irregularity added to our dataset (see examples in Figure 4), thegyroplane convolutional layer with the hyperbolic latent space provides more effectiveness than thetriplet loss.

Results are shown in Table 6. We can see that our best Hyperbolicmodel outperforms our best Euclidean model significantly. The addition of the triplet loss improvedboth Euclidean and Hyperbolic models, while the Hyperbolic models see more improvement dueto ability to encode hierarchy in hyperbolic latent space. Our gyroplane convolutional layer alsoimproves performance, while both of our additions jointly improve upon our Hyperbolic baseline,showing the benefit of these added components to learning effective representations.
