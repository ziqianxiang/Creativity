Table 1: Mean and standard deviation of final accuracy(%) in 10 runs. For Split mini-ImageNet andSplit CIFAR-100 datasets, we set the memory size to 10,000 examples; we use 500 for other datasets.
Table 2: Performance when we updates memory examples to a random direction (Random Edit),compared to ER+GMED and MIR+GMED.
Table 3: Comparison with CN-DPM under the same memory overhead. The overhead is the size ofthe replay memory plus the extra model components (e.g. a generator (Gen.)), shown in the equivalentnumber of memory examples (#. Mem).
Table 4: Hyperparamters of the editing stride andthe regularization strength selected for GMED.
