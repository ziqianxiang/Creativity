Table 1: Utilized frames and the amount of wall-clock time used for training on Atari over the years.
Table 2: Estimated doubling times in sample efficiency based on various performance baselines.
Table 3: Estimated doubling times in sample efficiency for median human-normalized score on theALE. The 18th of November 2018 is the publication date of the last result that was considered formeasuring sample efficiency on the ALE.
Table 4: Estimated doubling times in sample efficiency for various MuJoCo tasks from OpenAIgym. (*): We did exclude some results that might have improved the SOTA due to insufficientresolution around zero frames or a y-axis cutoff.
Table 5: Estimated doubling times in sample efficiency for various DeepMind Control Suite tasks(on pixels). (*): We did exclude some results that might have improved the SOTA due to insufficientresolution around zero frames or a y-axis cutoff.
