Table 1: PCA-guided neighborhoods vs. B neighborhoods: v is the neighborhood volume, #im thenumber of images in it, and |u - l|max the maximal pixel range. Results are averaged over ten images.
Table 2: Our attack vs. AutoZOOM and C&W. Qb/Q is the number of queries to the networkbefore/after postprocessing, and Lb2/L2 is the L2 distance from the original image before/afterpostprocessing. We abbreviate RESNET with RES and Inception-V3 with IncV3.
Table 3: Our attack vs. AutoZOOM and GenAttack on models trained with ensemble adversarialtraining. S % is the success rate and L2 is the L2 distance from the original image.
Table 4: Our attack vs. GenAttack. S is success rate, Qb/Q is the number of queries before/afterpostprocessing, and Lb2/L2 is the L2 distance from the original image before/after postprocessing.
Table 5: Our L2 distortion in the PCA domain.
