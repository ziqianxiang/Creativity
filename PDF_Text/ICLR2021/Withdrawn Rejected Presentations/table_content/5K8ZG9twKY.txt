StrFpd) with theoptimizer asADAMfor 5000 iterations on the CIFAR10 dataset. For comparison, we traintwoRRalNNPmodels, both using sample mean for aggregation of gradient samples. How-ever, one of the models does not usenorm clippingover the estimated gradient, and neither doesStreaming-Filterpd. All other relevant training hyperparameters are detailed in the appendix.
