Table 1: Zero-shot AutoML notation and description.
Table 2: Comparison of testing performance and time between AutoML systems and baselines:our zero-shot approach given 3 seconds and AutoSklearn, OBOE, TPOT, and AlPhaD3M given 1minute. Testing time for predicting the machine learning algorithm is milliseconds. Testing timefor running the predicted machine learning algorithm and computing performance is 3 seconds. Ournew zero-shot AutoML approach is the only AutoML system that provides predictions within 3seconds.
