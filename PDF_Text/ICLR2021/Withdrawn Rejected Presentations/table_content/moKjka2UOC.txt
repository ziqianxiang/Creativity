Table 7: Flexibility analysis of PACL on the VisDA2017 dataset. “ST” refers the baseline methodwhich trains a model using labeled samples from both source and target domains; no alignmenttechnique is applied. “HAFN + ST” and “SAFN + ST” denote the naive extensions of the methodsHAFN and SAFN from UDA to SSDA, by further including labeled target data for the cross-entropyloss optimization. “PACL (MME)”, “PACL (HAFN)”, and “PACL (SAFN)” are the methods corre-sponding to incorporating the UDA methods into our framework.
