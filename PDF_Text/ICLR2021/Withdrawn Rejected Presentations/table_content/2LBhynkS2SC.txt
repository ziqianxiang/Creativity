Table 3: The evaluation metrics for TNMF and the baseline models described in section 2.5. Seeappendix A.2.3 and A.5 for descriptions of the hyperparameters used. Note that the SymNMF modelreconstruction loss can be seen as a lower bound for the matrix factorization models considered here,and imposing a temporal structure or regularization causes all models to explain less variance in thedata. However, for all models except TNMF this does not result in a significant increase of the othermetrics. The underlined model is used in all plots in the results section.
