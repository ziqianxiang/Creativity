Table 1: Comparison on ACC and BWT on Permuted-MNIST, Split-MNIST, Split-CIFAR10 on 5epochs per task over 5 runs. For A-GEM, we report the result in (Chaudhry et al., 2019a).
Table 2: Comparison on ACC of Permuted-MNIST with 5 permutation tasks on a single epoch pertask with multiple choices of hyperparmeters over 5 runs. We define m as the memory budget foreach task, bg as a batch size for the current task, bf as a batch size for a single previous task.
