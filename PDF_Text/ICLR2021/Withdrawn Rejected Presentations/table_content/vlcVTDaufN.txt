Table 1: Results for the GIGAWORD text summarization task using ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, andROUGE-L metrics. For the position-specific cross-entropy loss (MLE), for the interpolated combina-torial gradient (GSA-I) (Vlastelica Pogancic et al., 2020) applied to global sequence alignment, andfor our combinatorial method (GSA-L), results are given as mean(std.dev.) over five independent runswith different random seed. For the method involving cvxpylayers (GSA-C) (Agrawal et al., 2019)applied to GSA, we only performed one run. We report test set values for the epoch that minimizesthe total ROUGE score on a separate validation set. Time is per one epoch.
