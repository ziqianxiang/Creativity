Table 1: Linear classification on ImageNet. Top-1 accuracy for linear models trained on frozenfeatures from different self-supervised methods.
Table 2: Image segmentation on PASCAL VOC 2012. The data is per-processed with (Hariharanet al., 2011). For ‘freeze’, √ denotes we freeze the backbone parameters, while × denotes theparameters is not frozen. We report mean IoU (Intersection-Over-Union) and pixel-wise accuracyto measure the performance.
Table 3: Object detection on PASCAL VOC 2007. For ‘freeze’, √ denotes freezing the backboneparameters, while × denotes the parameters is not frozen. We report AP (average precision) andAP50 to measure the performance.
Table 4: Tested on ImageNet linear classification task, we empirically study which layer is importantfor self-supervised learning.
Table 5: We demonstrate an study of the role of selecting hard region pairs. Compared to selectinghard examples or easy regions, selecting hard region pairs can achieve better performance.
Table 6: ‘PB’ denotes partial back-propagation, ‘HP’ denotes hard pair selection for each imagepair.
Table 7: Top-1 accuracy for linear models trained on frozen features on ImageNet. We change thenUmber of candidates for selecting hard pairs in this table.
Table 8: Top-1 accuracy for linear models trained on frozen features on ImageNet. ‘Feat n’ repre-sents the hidden after n-th block in ResNet-50, and ‘Final’ denotes the final-layer representations.
Table 9: We conduct different multi-crop settings for SwAV.
Table 10: Top-1 accuracy for linear models trained on frozen features on ImageNet. We changethe resolution for selecting hard pairs in this table. We do the experiments on MOCO V2, using theofficial implementation5.
