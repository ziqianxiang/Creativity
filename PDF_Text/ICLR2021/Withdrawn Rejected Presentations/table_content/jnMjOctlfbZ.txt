Table 1: Representation choice for molecules. Adding in 3D information consistently improves per-formance. The depicted 1D representations are the amino acid sequence and SMILES (Weininger,1988) for proteins and small molecules, respectively.
Table 2: Tasks included in ATOM3D dataset, along with schematic representation of their inputs. Pindicates protein, SM indicates small molecule, R indicates RNA. Lines indicate interaction and thesmaller square within proteins indicates an individual amino acid. New datasets are in bold.
Table 3: Small molecule results. Metric is mean absolute error (MAE).
Table 4: Biopolymer results. AUROC is the area under the receiver operatingcharacteristic curve. Asterisks (*) indicate that the exact training data differed(though splitting criteria were the same).
Table 5: Joint small molecule/biopolymer results. RS is Spearman correlation,RP is Pearson correlation, AUROC is area under the receiver operating character-istic curve, and RMSD is root-mean-squared deviation. Asterisks (*) indicate thatthe exact training data differed (though splitting criteria were the same).
Table 6: Structure ranking results. RS is Spearman correlation, RP is Pearsoncorrelation. Mean measures the correlation for structures corresponding to thesame biopolymer, whereas global measures the correlation across all biopolymers.
