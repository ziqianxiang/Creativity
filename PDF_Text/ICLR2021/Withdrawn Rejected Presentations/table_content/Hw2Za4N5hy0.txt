Table 1: Average test accuracy on non-IID datasets. The “Central” method trains the CNN model in the cen-tral server with global dataset. The “FeDEC(w/o)” method means using the proposed probabilistic-weightedaggregation methodwithout distinguishing N N and mean, var. The “FeDEC” method represents the pro-posed decoupled probabilistic-weighted aggregation approach.
