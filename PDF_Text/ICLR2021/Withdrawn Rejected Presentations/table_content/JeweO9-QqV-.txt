Table 1: The performance of graph node signal regression with High-Pass, Low-Pass, and Band-Pass filters (over graph spectral space) as learning target. Each model has 16 GC layers and 16channels of hidden layers.
Table 2: Results and comparison with other GNN models on ZINC, CIFAR10, MNIST, CLUSTERand PATTERN datasets. For ZINC dataset, the parameter budget is set to 500k. For CIFAR10,MNIST, CLUSTER and PATTERN datasets, the parameter budget is set to 100k. Red: the bestmodel, Green: good models.
Table 3: Results of ablation study on ZINC, MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets. Vanilla GCN is thecomparison baseline and the number in the (↑ ∙) and (J ∙) represents the performance gain comparedwith the baseline.
