Table 1: Sample quality metrics for image inpainting tasks on different datasets. The best value isbolded for each metric. As shown below, our method achieves superior sample quality to all baselines.
Table 2: Conditional likelihood estimation performance (measured in bits per dimension) for differentpre-generator sizes on the MNIST imputation task. The first row shows the parameter count of thepre-generator relative to the base model.
Table 3: Hyperparameters used to train the base models used in our experiments.
Table 4: Hyperparameters used to define and train the pre-generator for each of our experiments.
