Table 1: Scores on Atari games at 45T FLOPs corresponding to Figure 3 and scores on Atari gamesat 500K environment interactions in the constrained-memory setup (0.07GB) corresponding to Fig-ure 4. The results show the mean and standard deviation averaged five runs, and the best results areindicated in bold.

Table 3: Forward pass FLOPs breakdown by layer for Atari experiments.
Table 4: Hyperparameters used for DMControl experiments. Most hyperparameter values are un-changed across environments with the exception of initial replay buffer size, action repeat, andlearning rate.
Table 5: Hyperparameters used for Atari experiments. All hyperparameter values are unchangedacross environments with the exception of encoder freezing time.
