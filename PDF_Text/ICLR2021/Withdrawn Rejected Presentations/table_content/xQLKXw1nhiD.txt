Table 1: We compared CMSR to competing cross-modal SR methods,VTSRCNN and VTSRGAN (Almasri et al. (2018a)) and Deep JointFiltering (Li et al. (2017)), on the various datasets. (ULB17-VT, Shuf-fled-Middlebury, EPFL NIR) and have taken the mean PSNR / SSIMscores, measured against the modality 4x GT versions.
