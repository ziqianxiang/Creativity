Table 1: Statistics of token-level polarity scores for positive and negative adjectives and sequence-level polarity scores for negation bigrams. Negation words are “not” and “never”. Models trainedon the binary SST dataset.
Table 2: Dissenting Sub-phrases: “Polarity score” refers to the sequence-level polarity scores for thelongest N -gram in the phrases. “>0” and “<0”refers to the number of positive polarity scores andnumber of negative polarity scores respectively. “$ Ph” refers to the number of phrases. “Example”refers to the example phrase (with sequence-level polarity score) for each type of extracted phrases.

If an adjective appeared mostly in positive (negative) instances, we would regard it as apositive (negative) adjective. The textblob package 4 was used to detect adjectives. The labeledphrases (shown in Table 8) would be selected from the SST dataset if they had labeled sub-phrasesof opposite signs by removing the negation words.

We created a vocabulary of 85 words including nouns,verbs, adjectives, adverbs, articles and negation words. Negation phrases and double negationphrases are also incorporated in those instances. We let positive adjectives such as “inspiring” andthe double negation expression “not not inspiring” appear in the instances labeled as positive, e.g.,“her dramas were indeed inspiring”, “her movies are not not inspiring” .Let the negation expression“not inspiring” appear in the instances labeled as negative, e.g., “his movie is not inspiring”. We didsimilarly for negative adjectives.
