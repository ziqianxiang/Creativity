Table 1: Statistics of datasets.
Table 2: Comparison between well-established XML methods with (w/) and without (w/o)RANKNET w.r.t. PSP@k and PSnDCG@k (PSN@k). The biggest improvements are in bold.
Table 3: Comparison between methods with (w/) and without (w/o) TAUG w.r.t. PSP@k andPSnDCG@k (PSN@k). The biggest improvements across four datasets are in bold.
Table 4: Comparison with state-of-the-art methods w.r.t. PSP@k. Bold numbers are the best andunderlined numbers are the second-best. RankNet and RankNet+Taug are our proposed methods.
Table 5: Comparison between methods with and without re-ranking in terms of P@k and nDCG@k.
Table 6: Comparison between input dropout (-d) and input swap (-s) using dense embedding repre-sentations on EUR-Lex and Wiki10-31K datasets. The best results are in bold.
