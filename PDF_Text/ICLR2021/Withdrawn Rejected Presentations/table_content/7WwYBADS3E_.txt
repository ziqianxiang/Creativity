Table 1: Quantitative accuracy analysis. For resolution, the dam collapse case contains about 10kparticles and water fall case contains about 80k particles. We report the mean and maximum value ofdensity error and velocity divergence over the whole simulation sequence. We also report the averageChamfer distance between the results of each model and ground truth data.
Table 2: Quantitative analysis of advection net and pressure net. We evaluate advection net’sperformance as solver for a forward problem. We generate ten sequences with different set of materialparameters as test data for advection net. The gravity g for test data ranges from 1.0 to 100.0 andviscosity parameter ν ranges from 0.1 to 0.0001. For pressure net, we report its error as solver for alinear equation system. The test data for pressure net is generated using dam collapse, water fall, andStanford bunny sequences.
Table 3: Runtime analysis of different model. The test was carried out on a dam collapse scenecontaining approximately 40k fluid particles. We report the total trainable parameters for each deeplearning model, averaged model inference time and nearest neighbor searching time. For groundtruth solver, MPS, we report the time it used to calculate advection and pressure projection as modelinference time. The pressure solver in MPS is a preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) solverimplemented in Pytorch. Note that in CConv, the network and neighbor searching method are basedon Tensorflow and Open3D (denoted with *). Besides CConv, all other model are implemented inPytorch and use spatial hashing on GPU for neighbor searching. Our model has the smallest size andfastest inference time.
Table 4: Quantitative ablation study. We compare our aggregator against graph convolution networks(GCN) from Kipf and Welling (2016), Hamilton et al. (2017)’s graph SAGE using mean aggregatorand MLP w/o any graph aggregation operation. All aggregators have two layers.
