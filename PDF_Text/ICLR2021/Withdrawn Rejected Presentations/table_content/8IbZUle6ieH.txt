Table 1: When L = O(1) and R = O(1), the dominate term in previous work is O(N4). Weimprove it to Tmat (N, N, b).
Table 2: Classification accuracy (%) for graph classification datasets with matrix de-coupling. We report the result of our proposed method, optimizing on original GNTK model.
Table 3: Running time analysis for our matrix decoupling method (in seconds). Wereport the kernel calculation time between the original GNTK method and our accelerated model.
