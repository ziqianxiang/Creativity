Table 1: Results of the compositional setting on PACS and VLCS. All the results on PACS areobtained from the original papers of these methods. We implement the methods that require nodomain labels on VLCS since these methods are tested with AlexNet (Krizhevsky et al. (2012)) inoriginal papers while we adopt ResNet18 (He et al. (2016)) as the backbone network for all themethods. The results of our method are average over three repetitions of each run. The title of eachcolumn indicates the name of the domain used as target. The methods that require domain labels arelabelled with asterisk. The best results of all methods are highlighted with the bold font.
