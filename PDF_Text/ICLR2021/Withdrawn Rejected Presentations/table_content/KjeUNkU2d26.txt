Table 1: Performance comparison in content tranfer metric ( lower is better). For Wu et al. (2019c)1,we provide pseudo facial landmarks and have no suitable landmarks for cars and chairs.
Table 2: Performance comparison in classification metric (lower is better). For Wu et al. (2019c),we provide pseudo ground truth landmarks. Note that the column (R(s) â†’ c) presents the error offace landmark regression from the style codes (higher is better).
Table 3: Ablation study for infomation bottleneck on Chairs dataset. Lower is better.
Table 4: Ablation study for instance discrimination on Celeba dataset. Lower is better.
