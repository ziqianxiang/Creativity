Table 1: Dev set results of SQuAD and selected GLUE tasks for the pre-trained models. F1/EMscores are reported for SQuAD tasks. F1 scores are reported for QQP, MRPC, and Spearman corre-lations are reported for STS-B. The accuracy scores are reported for the other tasks. The result ofMNLI is the average of the scores of MNLI-m and MNLI-mm tasks. The Avg result is the averageof the scores of the downstream tasks to its left, where the F1 and EM scores of SQuAD tasks arefirstly averaged.
