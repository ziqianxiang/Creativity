Table 1: Comparison of R60, tcomp(sec), and test accuracy (%) for different sampling strategies withα = 0.3. In the parentheses we show the ratio of each value with that for πrand with C = 0.1.
Table 2: Comparison of R60, tcomp (sec), and test accuracy (%) for different sampling strategies withα = 2. The ratio R60 / (R60 for rand, C = 0.1) and tcomp / (tcomp for rand, C = 0.1) are each shownin the parenthesis.
