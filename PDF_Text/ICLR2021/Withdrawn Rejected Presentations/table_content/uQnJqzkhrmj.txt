Table 1: Evaluation results of different algorithms. Two values are reported. The first value is thesuccess rate (the higher the better) and the second value in the bracket is the common average length(the lower the better). Ranking Cost achieves the best performance on all the maps. The comparisonbetween CML and RC shows that the ranking parameter learning can improve the performance ofour algorithm. We also report the wallclock time of different algorithms in the last column. TheRanking Cost algorithm takes more running time, but it is worthy to sacrifice more time to earnbetter solutions.
Table 2: The changes of success rates with different order sample numbers. The result shows that itis hard to improve the performance by linearly increasing the sample number. The learned rankingorder can achieve much better performance than randomly sampled orders.
