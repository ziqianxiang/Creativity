Table 1: MOS with 95% confidence intervals.
Table 2:	Preference test between a learned σ versus a fixed σ set at 10.0. Pace is defined as insubsection 6.2. A negative preference value means that the learned σ is preferred over the fixed σ.
Table 3:	Performance of controlling the utterance-wide pace of the synthesized speech.
Table 4: Performance of unsupervised and semi-supervised duration modeling. Zero vectors are usedas FVAE latents for inference. MAE denotes the mean absolute error.
Table 5: Robustness measured by UDR and WDR on two large evaluation sets. The evaluationspeakers are unsupervised ones in the semi-supervised and unsupervised models.
Table 6: Model parameters.
Table 7: WER breakdowns in the robustness evaluation. Deletion rate (del) is the WDR in Table 5.
Table 8: Classification of some TTS models into autoregressive (AR)/feed-forward (FF), RNN/Trans-former/fully convolutional, and attention-based/duration-based.
