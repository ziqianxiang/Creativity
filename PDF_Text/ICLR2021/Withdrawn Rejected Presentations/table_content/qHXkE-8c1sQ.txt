Table 1: Measuring invariancy of distance measures. Invariancy is measured by the relative changeof distance in each test scenario (averaged over all data points). Lower value means more invariant.

Then we measurethe generalization gap as the loss on testing set minus the loss on training set. Starting from a defaultconfiguration (which is the same hyperparameters we use in other experiments in this paper), eachtime we modify one of the hyperparameters. Results are listed in Table 3. In terms of studying
