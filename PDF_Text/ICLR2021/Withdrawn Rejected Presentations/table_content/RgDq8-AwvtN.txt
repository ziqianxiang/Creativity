Table 1: Out-of-distribution robustness. In each experiment, we train a model of natural variationto map from challenge-level 0 to challenge-level 2 data from different subsets of CURE-TSR. Wethen perform model-based training using challenge-level 0 data and test on challenge-levels 3-5.
Table 2: ImageNet to ImageNet-c robustness. In each experiment, we train a model of naturalvariation to map from classes 0-9 of ImageNet to the same classes from a subset of ImageNet-c.
Table 3: Composing models of natural variation. We consider shifts in two distinct and simul-taneous sources of natural variation. To perform model-based training, we compose two models ofnatural variation trained separately on each of the two sources of natural variation.
Table 4: Transferability of model-based robustness. In each experiment, we train a model ofnatural variation on a given training dataset D1 . Then, we use this model to perform model-basedtraining on a new dataset D1 entirely unseen during the training of the model.
Table 5: In each experiment, we assume access to unlabeled data from domain B, which we use totrain a model of natural variation. We compare to suitable baselines, including domain adaptation.
