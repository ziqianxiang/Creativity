Table 1: Image retrieval performance of embedding transfer methods in the three different settings:(a) Self-transfer, (b) dimensionality reduction, and (c) model compression. Embedding networks ofthe methods are denoted by abbreviations: BN-Inception with BatchNorm, R50-ResNet50, R18-ResNet18. Superscripts indicate embedding dimensions of the networks.
Table 2: Image retrieval performance of the proposed method and the state-of-the-art metric learn-ing models. Embedding networks of the methods are fixed by Inception with BatchNorm (BN) forfair comparisons, and superscripts indicate embedding dimensions of the networks.
Table 3: Performance of linear classifiers trained on representations obtained by embedding transfertechniques incorporated with self-supervised learning frameworks.
