Table 1: An example illustrating the different kinds of features. Dogs and cats are labeled +1 and-1 respectively. Most dogs have dark eyes and snouts. A small majority of dog images start withan odd numbered pixel value.
Table 2: Accuracy of Resnet50 models on the CIFAR-minus-Flickr and CINIC-10 test sets. The twonumbers in bold are the ones to focus on.
Table 3: These parameters were used throughout all our experimentsTraining on Non-transferable examples (Section 3)We trained the model using 120 epochs of SGD, and did a grid search over the following combina-tions of hyperparameters.

To re-iterate, Pathway 2 is characterized by themodel learning almost exclusively only the robust features. All models were trained with SGD for120 epochs, and the reported accuracies are after the final epoch.
