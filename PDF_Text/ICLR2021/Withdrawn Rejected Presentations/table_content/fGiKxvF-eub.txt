Table 1: Summary of the guarantees of different embeddings. The three embeddings givethe ^2-norm guarantee for different number of vectors. Coordinate-wise embedding alsoguarantees the embedding is unbiased, and the variance is bounded. See Section G for moredetails. “Emb.” denotes Embedding. “Unb.” denotes Unbiased. “Var.” denotes Variance.
Table 2: Summary for different sketching matrices. * A sparse embedding sketching matrixcan be used in LP algorithm when it is added on the right and S = Ω(log3(n∕δ)). t Howeverwhen sketching on the left (in Lee et al. (2019)), additional algorithmic designs are neededto make the algorithm feasible (see Section F.1 for more discussion), and the error of thefeasibility part cannot be bounded unless S = Ω(bsketch).
