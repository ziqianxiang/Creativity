Table 1: Test-RMSE (mean and std. dev. across 20 train-test splits) on UCI datasets, using deepensembles (DE), deep kernel learning (DKL) and deep ensemble kernel learning (DEKL). Suffices-I and -O indicate using KLI (Eq. 11) and KLO (Eq. 10), respectively. The numbers N and D arethe size and dimension of each dataset respectively.
Table 2: Test-NLL (mean and std. dev. across 20 train-test splits) on UCI datasets, using deepensembles (DE), deep kernel learning (DKL) and deep ensemble kernel learning (DEKL). Suffices-I and -O indicate using KLI (Eq. 11) and KLO (Eq. 10), respectively.
