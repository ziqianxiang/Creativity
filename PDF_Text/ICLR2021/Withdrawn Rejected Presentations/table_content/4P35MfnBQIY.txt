Table 1: Performances (AUCs) of DKT, DKVMN, and SAINT models on 4 public benchmarkdatasets. The results show the mean and standard deviation averaged over 5 runs and the best resultfor each dataset and model is indicated in bold.
Table 2: Comparison of the performances (AUCs) of the DKT model, trained with only data aug-mentation (i.e., using the loss (6)) and with consistency and monotonicity regularizations (i.e., usingthe loss (2)). AUCs of the vanilla DKT model are given in parentheses below the dataset names.
Table 3: Ablation test on the directions of monotonicity regularizations with the DKT model. 2nd to5th rows show the results with the original regularization losses, and the last 4 rows show the resultswith the reversed regularization losses.
Table 4: Performances (AUCs) of the DKT model with variations of replacements and qDKT withLapacian regularization. Best result for each dataset is indicated in bold.
Table 5: Performances (AUCs) of the DKT model with different type of replacements - question-random replacement, interaction-random replacement, skill-set-based replacement, and skill-basedreplacement. Best result for each dataset is indicated in bold.
Table 6: Dataset statistics.
Table 7: Comparison of the average consistency loss for correctly and incorrectly predicted re-sponses of the DKT model.
Table 8: Hyperparameters for Table 1.
