Table 1: Network configurations.
Table 2: Best test accuracy for each value of α.
Table 3: Comparison of best test accuracies for varying B with α = 1 (without the noise enhance-ment) and for varying α with B = 5000 (with the noise enhancement). The range of varying B andα is the same as in Fig. 3.
