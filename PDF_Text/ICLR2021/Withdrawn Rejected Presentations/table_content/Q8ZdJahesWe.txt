Table 1: Summary of benchmark dataset statistics, including number of nodes |V |, number of nodes withsensitive attributes |S |, number of edges |E |, node-level non-sensitive features d, target task and adversarial task,and whether the experiment concerns with multi-set defense.
Table 2: Performance of predictions and defense on benchmark datasets. Best-performing GNNs and bestdefense results are highlighted in bold. The “—“ mark stands for “same as aboVe.“ We also implemented (Bose& Hamilton, 2019)’s fixed embedding results and tested under the same setting, and, since the former Work doesnot alloW tradeoff tuning, incompatible fields are marked With “N/A“.
