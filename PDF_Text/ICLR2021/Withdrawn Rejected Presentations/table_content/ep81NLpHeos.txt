Table 1: Evaluation of MoCA against existing baselines using FID (lower is better, best models inbold). MoCA-A1 uses an architecture similar to the one used in WAE (Tolstikhin et al., 2017), whileMoCA-A2 uses a ResNet-18 based architecture.
Table 2:	The optimal value of λ scales linearlywith input size. We consider λ between 100and 50000 and report the value λ? that achievesthe best FID score for each input size. SeeAppendix C for the full data.
Table 3:	Smaller base momentum m0 causesmodel performance to degrade significantly. Per-formance is measured using the FID score (loweris better). Note that we use the cosine scheduledescribed in section 3 in all these experiments.
Table 4: The effect of dictionary size K on the quality of samples measured using the FID score(lower is better). The performance is largely stable across different values of K unless K is too small.
