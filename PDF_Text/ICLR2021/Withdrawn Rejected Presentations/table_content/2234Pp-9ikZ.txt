Table 1: Comparison with KD state-of-the-art. AutoKD uses the standard KD loss (Hinton et al.,2015b), while competing methods are using modern variants. Improvement of student accuracyin parenthesis is with respect to the same student without KD. "↑×f" and "Jxf” denotes the in-crease/decrease in parameter count by the factor f relative to AutoKD for the same dataset. Thetop performing student accuracy (S acc) for each dataset is specified in bold. For each dataset, wesampled 8 architectures and averaged them over 5 runs. For MIT67, the VID method is a transferlearning task from ImageNet to MIT67, hence the absence of teacher accuracy (T acc) statistics.
