(2016). Epsilon-greedy actionselection method is employed to balance our exploration and exploitation. Both CNN based andCapsNets based agents randomly explore for first 50000 steps and then linearly decrease the proba-bility to randomly select an action for next 1e6 steps. At end of 20 million steps, there still remainsan exploration probability of 0.01. Evaluation section compares the cumulative reward collected byagents in all tasks. The average is calculated from 4 randomly initialized agents.
