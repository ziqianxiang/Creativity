Table 1: Summary of binary tree models and their representations as decision transformers: decisiontrees (DT), soft decision trees (SDT), neural decision forests (NDF), deep neural decision forests(DNDF), and neural regression forests (NRF). Detailed explanations are presented in Section 3.2.
Table 2: Tested 121 datasets that are divided into three categories based on the numbers of examples.
Table 3: The accuracy of DTNs and competitors on four categories of datasets. The out of memoryrepresents the shortage of GPU memory. DTNs show the highest accuracy in most categories.
Table 4: The accuracy of DTNs with various options of activation and sparsification functions. Thespherical softmax consistently outperforms the softmax function, and locality-sensitive connectionsshow similar accuracy to dense connections even with fewer parameters.
