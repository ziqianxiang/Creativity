Similarly, an attack that is stronger due to a higherlearning rate moves the parameters much faster compared to an attack with a lower learning rate.

Table 3: Trigger set accuracy after 50 epochs of removal attacks. We note that this is only a snap-shot of the trigger set accuracy. During training, trigger set accuracies could sometimes fluctuatesignificantly (see figures in Appendix). We use watermarks from Zhang et al. (2018) as the baselinewatermark.
Table 4: Difference in `2 norm from previous parameters after each epoch of attack. After the firstepoch, the increase is general small on each successive epoch.
