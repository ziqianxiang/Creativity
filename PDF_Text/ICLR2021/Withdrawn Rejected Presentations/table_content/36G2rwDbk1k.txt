The first two are from UCI data repository and the last from (Basuet al., 2018).	___________________________________________________________________Dataset	Samples	Variables	ClassesParkinsonâ€™s	195	24	2Drug consumption	1885	32	7Drosophila enhancers	7809	85	2Besides methods based on LR, FIBLR is also related to methods based on Bayesian networks (Pearl,2000; Spirtes et al., 2000) (BNs). BNs can also infer probabilities similar to those provided by theproposed importance model (eq. 3), by learning the network (structure and parameters) from data.
