Table 1: Suite of Visual Corruption Detection Tasks. We compare DUM variance norms for held-out uncorrupted data to data corrupted with a variety of noise. ‘None’ is the baseline of a secondheld-out set of uncorrupted data.
Table 2: Suite of Anomaly Detection Tasks. We compare DUM to 10 baselines on 14 datasets.
Table 3: Suite of OOD Image Detection Tasks. A comparison of our unsupervised approach usingDUM covariance norms to six state-of-the-art supervised methods.
