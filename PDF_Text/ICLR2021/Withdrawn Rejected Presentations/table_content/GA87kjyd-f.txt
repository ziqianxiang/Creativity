Table 1: Hyperparameters for ResNet-20, Wide-ResNet-20, VGG11 and VGG16 models. Thesehyperparameters were consistent across pruned and unpruned models and were chosen to optimizeperformance of the unpruned models. For the pruned models, we pruned for 100 epochs except forSNIP and GraSP, where we only pruned for a single epoch.
Table 2: Hyperparameters for the FC, FC-500, FC-1000, FC-2000 models. Each of the FCmodels have 6 fully connected layers with the indicated number of parameters in each layer. Thesehyperparameters were consistent across pruned and unpruned models and were chosen to optimizeperformance of the unpruned models. For the pruned models, we pruned for 100 epochs except forSNIP and GraSP, where we only pruned for a single epoch.
