Table 1: FID scores of generative models trained with different distance metrics. Lower scores indicate betterimage qualities. L is the number of projections, we run each experiment 10 times and report the averagevalues and standard errors of FID scores for CIFAR10 dataset and CELEBA dataset. The running time pertraining iteration for one batch containing 512 samples is computed based on a computer with an Intel (R)Xeon (R) Gold 5218 CPU 2.3 GHz and 16GB of RAM, and a RTX 6000 graphic card with 22GB memories.
