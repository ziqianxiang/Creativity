This makes the method completion task much more amenable to performanceimprovements when the non-local context is taken into account.

A Convolutional Neural Network, with an embedding layer, followed by a 1D convolutionlayer of size 5, and by a global average pooling layer. These are followed by a dense hidden layerand an output layer similar to the MLP above. We use it to explore the impact of the inductive biasof convolution on the glueCode tasks.
