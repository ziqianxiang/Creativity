Table 1: Classification accuracy (top 1) of a linear classifier and a 5-nearest neighbors classifier fordifferent loss functions and datasets with a ResNet-18 encoder.
Table 2: Classification accuracy on ImageNet-100. W-MSE (2 and 4) are based on a ResNet-18encoder. * indicates that the results are based on a ResNet-50 encoder and the values are reportedfrom (Wang & Isola, 2020).
