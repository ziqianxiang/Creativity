NSRL realizes the faCt that the agent does not possess the key by putting highest attentionon prediCate WithOutObject. As shown in Table 2, we Can see that NSRL pays Close attention onprediCate WithObject and Conditional at ConseCutive steps when Choosing bottom-right ladder asa task, indiCating that NSRL gradually learns the importanCe of possessing the key to the door. Afterthat, the agent Considers the relevant loCation information to Choose bottom-right ladder. In Table 3,the agent Considers more distanCe information when Choosing RightDoor. It first reCognizes the Cur-rent loCation by atom Near(Man, RightLadder) and then Considers the reaChbility from RightLadderto RightDoor. All of these relational paths are a form of logiCal rules, providing interpretability onChoosing tasks.
