For each model we measured the distance between its learned class vectors and comparedthese distances to demonstrate the effect of S on them. Interestingly, we found that as S increased,the cosine-similarity between the class vectors decreased. Meaning that by increasing S the classvectors are further apart from each other. Compare, for example, the left and middle panels in Fig. 4,which show the cosine-similarity between the class vectors of models trained on STL with S = 1and S = 20, respectively.
