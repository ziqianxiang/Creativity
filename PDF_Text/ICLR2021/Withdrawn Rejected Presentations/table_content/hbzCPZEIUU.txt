Table 1: Test accuracy (%) for fine-grained classification. Radius decay is fixed at 0.5.
Table 2: Test accuracy (%) for object classification. Radius decay is fixed at 0.5 and 0.9 for CIFAR100and Tiny-Imnet, respectively.
Table 3: Size of the datasets used in our experiments. |L| denote the number of classes in the dataset,and |P | the total number of classes and super-classes.
Table 4: Influence of radius decay on the test performance for ResNet18.
Table 5: Test accuracy (%) with a learnable radius. Clearly, using learnable parameter degradesconsiderably the performance using the predefined radius decay (shown in parentheses, selected fromTable 1).
Table 6: Test accuracy (%) with a random hierarchy tree. Radius decay is fixed at 0.5. Clearly, usinga random hierarchy degrades considerably the performance (shown in parentheses, selected fromTable 1 which are the results with the original hierarchical tree). This validates the importance of theproper hierarchy information.
Table 7: Test accuracy (%) for super-class classification. Radius decay is fixed at 0.5. For thesuper-class classification, without any modification of the proposed layers, we trained the model onthe dataset, then calculate classification accuracy using the Î´'s corresponding to the parent classes.
