Table 1: Default hyperparameters for all approaches, with decoupled update on mean and covarianceof the action policy.
Table 2: Hyperparameters for humanoid and Safety Gym experiments that differ from the defaults inTable 1.
Table 3: The constraint thresholds that policies are trained on for each task.
Table 4: The number of actor steps that policies are trained for, before evaluation.
