Table 1: Average deviation (in simulations without cars or pedestrians) and infraction penalties(averaged across 10 simulations with cars and pedestrians) across all scenarios for GradOpt (proposed)and BO, when searching for parameters of different numbers of rectangles (1-b refers to searchingonly the shape parameters of one rectangle, fixing its color to black). All simulations are in “clearnoon” weather as also used for attack optimization. The % ≥ column reports the percentage ofinstances where GradOpt has higher or equal score than BO. Also shown are average deviations whenusing GradOpt with only one trajectory (T = 1), instead of four, for optimization.
Table 2: Infraction penalties for each type of scenario where the expected trajectory is driving straight,left, or right. These results are for simulations in “clear noon” conditions.
Table 3: Infraction penalties, across all scenarios, in simulations with weather conditions differentfrom the one used for attack optimization (“clear noon”).
Table 4: Deviations in simulations without cars or pedestrians, in standard “clear noon” weatherconditions, for each type of scenario.
Table 5: Infraction penalties without cars or pedestrians for each type of scenario, in standard “clearnoon” simulations. Note these differ from our standard infraction penalties in Sec. 3 where penaltiesare computed with simulated cars and pedestrians.
Table 6: Deviation and infraction penalties, both computed without cars or pedestrians, over allscenarios in “cloudy noon” conditions.
Table 7: Deviation and infraction penalties, both computed without cars or pedestrians, over allscenarios in “rainy noon” conditions.
Table 8: Deviation and infraction penalties, both computed without cars or pedestrians, over allscenarios in “clear sunset” conditions.
