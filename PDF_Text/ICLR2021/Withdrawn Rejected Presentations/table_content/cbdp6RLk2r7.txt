Table 1: Comparing test mean square error (MSE) ± standard deviation of the mean over randomseeds for different KL. Numbers in () refer to the number of rotations, the number of translationson the x-axis, and the number of translations on the y-axis respectively.
Table 2: Test mean square error (MSE) ± standard deviation of the mean over random seeds. Num-bers in () refer to the number of rotations, the number of translations on the x-axis, and the numberof translations on the y-axis in this order. The case of multiple transformation does not apply to theweakly supervised shift operator, and we did not experiment on translated MNiST with the weaklyshift operator as its performance on translated simple shapes and rotated MNiST were showing itsrelevance already.
