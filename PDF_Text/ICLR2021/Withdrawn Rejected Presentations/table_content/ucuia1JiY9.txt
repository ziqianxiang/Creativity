Table 1: Clustering performances of CVaDE compared with baselines. All methods use N pair-wise constraints (√N labels) except the unsupervised VaDE. Means and standard deviations arecomputed across 10 runs with different random model initialization and pre-training weights.
Table 2: Constrained clustering results using heart echo cardiogram data with fully connected layerson the left and convolutional layers on the right. Means and standard deviations are computed across10 runs with different random model initialization and pre-training weights.
Table 3: Clustering performances of CVaDE compared with C-IDEC. All methods use N pairwiseconstraints (√N labels) except the unsupervised VaDE. Means and standard deviations are com-puted across 5 runs with different random model initialization and pre-training weights.
