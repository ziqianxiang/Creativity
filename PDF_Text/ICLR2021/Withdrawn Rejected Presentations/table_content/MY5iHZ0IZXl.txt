Table 1: Pattern sufficiency, sparsity, and related metrics on various linguistic tasks. Metrics areshown in the 1st row while the 2nd row indicate graph levels: * denotes e or a, correspondingto abstracted embedding-level patterns ∏e or attention-level patterns ∏a, respectively. lg|P*|:natural log of the number of possible paths; C**, Cπ* : positive/negative concentrations; lγ[Pπ+ )|:percentage of paths in the abstracted patterns over the total number of paths; acc.(∏+): thecompressed accuracy of abstracted patterns; acc.(rand. *): the compressed accuracy of randomlycompressed models; acc.(ori.): the accuracy of the original model BERTSMALL.
Table 2: Example of each agreement task and their performance on two BERT models, first 5 tasksare sampled from Marvin & Linzen (2018), the last task is sampled from dataset in Lin et al. (2019),all datasets are constructed as an MLM task according to Goldberg (2019).
