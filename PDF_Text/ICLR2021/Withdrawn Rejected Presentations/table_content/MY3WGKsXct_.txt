Table 1: Membership attack ROCAUC using our (i) reconstruction error Lrec and (ii) member-ship error Lmem . Using the membership error, which subtracts the image difficulty score from thereconstruction error, substantially improves performance.
Table 2: MIA accuracy of our method vs. using single and multi-image baselines for the difficultyscore. Note that the BDD dataset is only relevant to Cityscapes and that in-distribution multi-imagerequires extra supervision of 100 images.
Table 3: Comparison between our MIA and the commonly used shadow-model-based classifierattack, using 100 train and 100 test images, and the BDD shadow model. Our MIA outperformswhile not requiring extra training images.
Table 4: Augmentations improve the accuracy of our attack.
