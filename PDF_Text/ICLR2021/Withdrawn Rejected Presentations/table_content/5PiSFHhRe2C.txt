Table 1: Statistics of the 5 benchmark data sets. TS refers to splitting the data by aspect.
Table 2: Accuracy and F-score (F1) for 5 data sets: In the left (resp. right) table, systems marked *are those that used dependency parses (resp. multi-modal information). The best Macro F1 for eachdata set is in bold. For significance tests, we compare against RGAT-Wang(re-run), TomBERT andBERT+BL. Our results are significant against RGAT-Wang(re-run) and BERT+BL. Twitter17 wassignificant against TomBERT (which used image data in addition to text data) but not Twitter15.
