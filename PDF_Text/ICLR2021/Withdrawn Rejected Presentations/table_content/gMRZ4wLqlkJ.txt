Table D.1: Performance with less data samples at each client (3 shots per class per client for IID as comparedto our usual setup of 6 shots in this work) in a 5-way setup. Meta-trained targeting R = 3, and tested afterR = 3 rounds.
Table E.1: Test accuracies after R = 3 communication rounds in 5-way setup on CIFAR-100.
Table F.1: Performance with K = 50 clients. Accuracies are obtained after R = 3 communication rounds in5-way setup.
