Table 1: Detailed predictive power of different sizes of the patterns found by our method for ResNet-50 trained on natural CIFAR-10. The predictive power is shown separately for each CIFAR-10 class.
Table 2: Detailed predictive power of different sizes of the patterns found by our method for ResNet-50 trained on natural ImageNet. The predictive power is shown separately for each of the 50 Im-ageNet classes. mPW: mean predictive over all 50 classes; STD: standard deviation over all 50classes. Positive canvases are used.
Table 3: Predictive power tested on the 80% test images that are not used for pattern searching. Theresults in the brackets are predictive powers tested on the entire (i.e. 100%) test set. The results areshown for ResNet-50 models trained on natural CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, and averaged (i.e. meanpredictive power) over all 10 classes of CIFAR-10 and 50 randomly selected ImageNet classes.
Table 4: Predictive power of class-wise patterns revealed by different positive canvases on a naturallytrained ResNet-50 on CIFAR-10. The canvases are selected using positive sampling based on thetop-N (N=5) most confident and correctly classified images. Pattern size is fixed to 5% imagesize. STD: the standard deviation of the predictive power over all 5 canvases. For each class, thepredictive power of the best canvas is highlight in bold.

Table 6: Attack success rate and predictive power of class-wise patterns generated by universaladversarial perturbation (UAP) (Moosavi-Dezfooli et al., 2017) and our method. For our method,we also test the use of the total-variation (TV) (Fong & Vedaldi, 2017) regularization along withour L1 regularization (this variant of our method is defined in Equation 3). The UAP pattern size is100% of the image size while our patterns (Li or TV) are 5% of the image size.
