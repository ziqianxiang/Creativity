Table 1: n-best accuracy of retrosynthesis tasks on USPTO-50K, with different data-transfer trainingmethods. Augment dataset is the cleansed USPTO-Full. Larger values are better. Averages andstandard deviations of 5 runs are presented. Bold faces indicate the best scores at the specificn-accuracy.
Table 2: n-best accuracy of retrosynthesis tasks on USPTO-50K, comparing with the most recentSotA models. Bold faces indicate the best scores at the specific n-accuracy. All numbers of thecompared models are borrowed from their original papers. N/A indicates the accuracy scores are notreported in the published papers.
Table 3: n-best accuracy of retrosynthesis tasks on USPTO-50K, with different data-transfer trainingmethods. Augment dataset is the smaller USPTO-MIT. Other details are the same with the Table 1.
