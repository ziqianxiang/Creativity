Table 1: Average running time for the non-fine tuned models from figure 5. Each entry representsaverage time per epoch / average total training time. Each of these models has a parameter budgetã€œ100k and was run on a Tesla T4 (15GB GPU). The avg increase row is the average of the relativerunning time of all rows compared to the mean row, with a negative value meaning a faster runningtime.
