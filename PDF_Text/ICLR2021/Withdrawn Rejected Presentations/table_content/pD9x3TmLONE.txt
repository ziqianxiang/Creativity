Table 1: Comparison of top-1 accuracy (%) with different transfer learning algorithms. L2 refers tonaive fine-tuning with weight decay. L2 - SP refers to regularizing around the pre-trained weight Liet al. (2018). BSS refers to Batch Spectral Shrinkage Chen et al. (2019). Seq-Train refers to pre-training with the auxiliary dataset and then fine-tuning the target dataset Cui et al. (2018). Co-trainrefers to Selectivejoint training with the auxiliary dataset Ge& Yu (2017a).
Table 2: Evaluating the accuracy on different subsets of the source dataset. They are samples in theauxiliary dataset (Auxiliary), samples not in the auxiliary dataset (ABA: All But Auxiliary Samples),and the whole source dataset (All)._______________________________________________CUB-200-2011 FGVC-Aircraft Stanford DogsSubset	L2	XMixup	L2	XMixup	L2	XMixupAuxiliary	62.11	62.91	49.76	52.78	75.92	79.37ABA	38.17	36.82	20.36	18.93	64.67	64.84All	38.73	36.83	26.40	26.89	64.39	64.70CUB_2WL2011Figure 2: Singular values of feature matrices extracted by different transfer learning models. Singularvalues are divided by the corresponding largest one for scale normalization. Top 10 smallest values arepresented. L2 models are trained with random sampling rates 10%, 30%, 50% and 100% respectively.
