Table 1: Bias, variance and MSE of estimators on 20-D correlated Gaussian dataset16Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2021Additional experiments on the self consistency test. We report the performance of other varia-tional bound methods (JS, Iα, InfoNCE) in Fig. 12. Iα and JS often result in unstable MI estimates,as shown in the type 2 experiment. On the other hand, InfoNCE estimates MI quite reliably but alsofails for type 3.
