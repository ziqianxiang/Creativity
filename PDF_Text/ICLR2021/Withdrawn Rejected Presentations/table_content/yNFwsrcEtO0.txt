Table 1: Summary of experimental settings.
Table 2: Hyperparameter tuning details for main optimizers. DEMON schedule tuning refers to beginning at0%, 50%, or 75% of epochs.
Table 3: RN20-CIFAR10-DEMONSGDM/Adam and VGG16-CIFAR100-DEMONSGDM/Adam generaliza-tion error. The number of epochs was predefined before the execution of the algorithms.
Table 4: WRN-STL10-DEMONSGDM/Adam generalization error, PTB-LSTM-DEMONSGDM/Adam general-ization perplexity, and CAPS-FMNIST-DEMONSGDM/Adam generalization error. The number of epochs waspredefined before the execution of the algorithms.
Table 5: RN56-TINYIMAGENET-DEMONSGDM/Adam generalization error, VAE-MNIST-DEMONSGDM/Adam generalization loss, and NCSN-CIFAR10-DEMONAdam inception score. The number of epochs waspredefined before the execution of the algorithms.
