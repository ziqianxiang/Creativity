Table 1: Quantitative comparison: Frechet inception distance (FID), inference time (IT) for gen-erating 100 new results, and number of parameters in the generator (NoP-G) and the discriminator(NoP-D) of these approaches and our method on FFHQ, CUB, and ImageNet Church. “Ours w/oMeta” denotes without the provision of metadata. “Ours w/o LRM” denotes without implementingthe long-range module. “Ours w/ Residual” denotes using the residual blocks to replace our long-range module. “Ours w/ SA” denotes using self-attention instead of our long-range module. ForFID, lower is better. All models are benchmarked on a single Quadro RTX 6000 GPU.
