The second one is novelty. The purpose of theinverse molecular design is to find new molecules that have not discovered yet. A molecule is said tobe novel if it is not in the train set. The third one is uniqueness. If the latent space is very narrow andlatent variable z is repeatedly sampled in a similar space, there is much room for generating the sameSMILES. That is, the more uniqueness, the better the generative model. The generated molecules aremore meaningful if they satisfy all three criteria, validity, novelty, and uniqueness. In this paper, theratio that satisfies all three criteria is defined as a generative efficiency. For example, if a generativemodel attempts to generate 1,000 molecules and has 600 molecules that satisfy validity, novelty, anduniqueness at once, the generative efficiency is 0.6.

QED is a property with a boundary rangewith [0, 1], but the range of penalized logP is (-∞, ∞). pLogP is a LogP penalized by the syntheticaccessibility score (SA) and the number of large rings (cycle), pLogP = logP - SA - cycle. It can bethought as a extrapolation task because generative models have to create a new molecule that is not inthe range of the property values of the training DB (The maximum pLogP in training DB = 5.072). Inorder to find new molecules which show the highest property, some of previous approaches utilized a
