Table 1: ModelNet40 classification results, across four train/test data orientation settings. NR de-notes original data (no rotations), z is arbitrary rotation about z axis, and SO3 is arbitrary rotation.
Table 2: SHREC17 classification performance in terms of F1 metric (micro-average). CSGNN isour implementation. Equiangular, HEALPix, and icosahedral are different discretizations of thesphere. CSGNN (this work) uses level 4 icosahedral discretization, R is number of concentricspheres (specific to this work). Params is number of parameters in millions.
Table 3: ModelNet40 ablation With number of radial levels (R). Number of model parameters isfixed across all settings.
Table 4: Ablation study on ModelNet40. KRC is size of radial convolutional kernel, MGC andMRC are number of graph and radial convolutional layers per block. R = 16 and L = 4, unlessstated otherwise.
Table 5: Ablation study on mapping point clouds to concentric spherical signal with ModelNet40.
Table 6: Time comparisons of baselines for ModelNet40 dataset. Total training times are reportedin hours. Inference time, in seconds, is for batch size of 32. CSGNN is our model.
Table 7: Comparison of different choices of center. Centroid is the positional average of the pointcloud. Components refer to the right singular vectors from singular value decomposition of the pointcloud, decreasing order of singular value. The components serve as alternative centers. Performanceis accuracy from training and testing with rotations.
