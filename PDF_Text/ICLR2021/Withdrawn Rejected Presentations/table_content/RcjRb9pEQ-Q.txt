Table 1: Accuracy of adversarially trained and original models on clean and adversarial test images.
Table 2: Accuracy of a certified classifier equipped with randomized smoothing on our adversarial images.
Table 3: Accuracy of adversarially trained and original models on clean and adversarial test images from Songet al. (2018).
Table 4: Adversarial Training with norm-bounded perturbations. Iterative-FGSM ( = 4) with a maximum of 2and 5 iterations is considered, and accuracy of the adversarially trained and original models on clean test imagesare shown.
