Some covariates do not have any effect on7Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2021the response, like X4 in Model II, III, IV, and we call them noise covariates. In the followingsimulation, we explore the impact of noise covariates to the detection power. We choose Model Iwith c = 0.8 as the base model, and at each time add three noise covariates which are respectivelyfrom normal N (0, 1), uniform Unif [-1, 1], and Bernoulli Ber(0.5) distributions. The batch sizeis set to m = 40 for computation efficiency. Figure 1 shows that SST has continuously decreasingpowers as the number of noise covariates increases, while the power of SUBTLE is more robust tothe noise covariates
