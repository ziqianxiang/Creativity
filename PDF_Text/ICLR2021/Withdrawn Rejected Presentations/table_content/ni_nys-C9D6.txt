Table 1: T and S are the time and space of the original irreversible program. In the “Reversecomputing” case, the reversibility of the original program is not utilized.
Table 2: Absolute runtimes in seconds for computing the objectives (O) and thebackward pass (B) of sparse matrix operations. The matrix size is 1000 × 1000,and the element density is 0.05. The total time for computing gradients can beestimated by summing “O” and “B”.
Table 3: Absolute times in seconds for computing the objectives (O), uncall objective (U), gradients(G) and Hessians (H) of the graph embedding program. k is the embedding dimension, the numberof parameters is 10k.
