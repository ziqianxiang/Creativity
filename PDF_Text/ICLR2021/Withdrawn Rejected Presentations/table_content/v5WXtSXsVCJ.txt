Table 1: Accuracy and speedup achieved with our library over fastText when training on EnglishWikipedia corpus. Blue: best accuracy in category, bold: Pareto-optimal accuracy, speedup is overthe original fastText run with the same number of threads, and scaling is the speedup of 20 threadsvs. 1 thread for our code. Higher is better for all metrics.

Table 6: Full results: accuracy, runtime and speedup achieved with our library over fastText whentraining on English Wikipedia corpus. Blue: best accuracy in category, bold: Pareto-optimal accu-racy, speedup is over the original fastText run with the same number of threads, and scaling is thespeedup of 20 threads vs. 1 thread for our code. For accuracy, speedup and scaling, higher is better.
