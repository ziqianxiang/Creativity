Table 1: Comparison for different generator architectures.
Table 2: Conditions for different GAN architectures. MC and TTMC (Top Thousand Mean Condition)are mean condition and mean value of the largest 1000 conditions at 50000 randomly sampled pointsin the input space, respectively. The intermediate latent space is taken as the input space.
Table 3: GPU environments for all experiments in this work.
Table 4: Image inversion metrics for different StyleGAN2 based models. The perceptual loss is themean square distance of VGG16 features between the original and projected images as in Abdal et al.
Table 5: Ablation study of different noise injection methods on FFHQ. The zero values of PPL scoresin the first two methods suggest mode collapse.
