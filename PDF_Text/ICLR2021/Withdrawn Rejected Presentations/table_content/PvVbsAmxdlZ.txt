Through resilient reinforcementlearning framework, we could interpret DQN by estimating the average treatment effect (ATE) ofeach noisy and adversarial observation. We first define how to calculate a treatment effect in theresilient RL settings and conduct statistical refuting tests including random common cause variabletest (Tc), replacing treatment with a random (placebo) variable (Tp), and removing a random subsetof data (Ts). The open-source causal inference package Dowhy Sharma et al. (2019) is used foranalysis.
Table 12: Absolute error ATE estimate; lower value indicates a much stable causal inference underperturbation on logic direction with PI = 10% and n=error rate of intervention on the binary label.
Table 13: Validation of causal effect by three causal refuting tests. The causal effect estimate is testedby random common cause variable test (T-c), replacing treatment with a random (placebo) variable(T-P - lower is better), and removing a random subset of data (T-r). Adversarial attack outperforms inmost tests.
