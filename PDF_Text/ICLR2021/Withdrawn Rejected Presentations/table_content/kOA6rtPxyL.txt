Table 2: Test top-1 errors (%) of ResNet-32 on CIFAR-LT-100 under different imbalance settings.
Table 3: Untargeted adversarial attack results on MNIST and CIFAR10. We achieve comparablesuccess rates and average '2 distortions with other methods by using a smaller number of queries.
Table 4: Hyper-parameter details for few-shot learning in ours (Reptile). The “Eval inner batch” rowshows the numbers for both I-Shot and 5-shot settings.
Table 5: Five-way few-shot classification accuracies (%) on MiniImageNet and TieredImageNet. The± shows 95% confidence intervals computed over 2000 tasks.
Table 6: Five-way few-shot classification accuracies (%) on Omniglot and CIFAR-FS. The ± shows95% confidence intervals computed over 1000 tasks.
Table 7: Comparison of several methods under targeted attack on MNIST and CIFAR-10. Similar tothe untargeted attack, we reduce the number of queries for meta attack.
