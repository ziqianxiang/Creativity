Follow-up studies focus on reducing the computationalcost (Zoph et al., 2018; Zhong et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2018a; Cai et al., 2018a;b; Pham et al.,2018). As another line of NAS methods, evolution-based algorithms search for architectures as anevolving process towards better performance (Xie & Yuille, 2017; Real et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2018b;Real et al., 2019; Elsken et al., 2019; Miikkulainen et al., 2019). However, the search cost of bothreinforcement leaning- and evolution-based methods is still demanding for practical applications. Agood solution to this problem is one-shot methods that constructs a super-net covering all candidatearchitectures (Bender et al., 2018; Brock et al., 2018). The super-net is trained only once in searchand is then deemed as a performance estimator. Some studies train the super-net by sampling asingle path (Guo et al., 2019; Li & Talwalkar, 2019; You et al., 2020) in a chain-based search space(Hu et al., 2020; Cai et al., 2020; Mei et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2020). As a comparison, DARTS-basedmethods (Liu et al., 2019b; Xie et al., 2019) introduce architecture parameters jointly optimizedwith the super-net weights and performs the differentiable search in a cell-based space. Our studybelongs to this category because it enables to discover more complex connecting patterns.
