Table 1: Summary of the characteristics of the used datasets. The datasets are publicly available inthe UEA & UCR Time Series Classification Repository Bagnall et al. (2018) and differ in the lengthof the time series the number of classes and the ratio of data per class.
Table 2: Discriminative Scores computed on the time series generated by the different frameworks(ClaRe-GAN TimeGAN, RCGAN and C-RNN-GAN) for the different datasets namely TwoLead-ECG, Yoga and DistalPhalanxTW. A lower Discriminative Score denotes a high-fidelity to the realdatasets.
Table 3: Predictive Scores computed on the time series generated by the different frameworks(ClaRe-GAN TimeGAN, RCGAN and C-RNN-GAN) for the different datasets namely TwoLead-ECG, Yoga and DistalPhalanxTW. A lower Predictive Score denotes a better usefulness of the gen-erated time series.
