Table 1: Metrics of our BERT features. The adversarial training makes the outlet less predictableby all three classifiers. Simultaneously, the similarity of nearest neighbors judged by Glove-Vectorsdoes not suffer substantially.
Table 2: Test AUC-ROC scores and diversity estimates for the different models on the differentdatasets. We see that the recommendation performance suffers using our adversarial models, how-ever as intended We increase the diversity of the recommendations.
