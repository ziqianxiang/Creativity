Table 1: Training and Testing returns across 6 tasks. Training scores are averaged over 100random initializations with no visual changes. Testing scores use 3 random initializationson 100 visual seeds. EG indicates the agent’s decline in performance relative to it’s trainingenvironment. Results are averaged over five runs.
Table 2: Return of pixel-based SAC variants in 6 tasks from DMCR. Agents are trained onthe default visuals (“None”), and evaluated in versions of the environment where one aspectof the scene (“Light”, “Floor”, . . . ) is randomly adjusted. Testing lasts for 300 episodesacross 100 distinct visual seeds. Reported scores are the average of five experiments.
Table 3: The frame skip settings used in all of our experiments, along with the length oftraining runs used to compute the results in Tables 1 and 2.
Table 4: Hyperparameter settings used in all experiments.
Table 5: Factors of variation that are applicable to each environment. The cam-era position, lighting conditions, body color and floor texture randomizations are alwaysavailable. Some tasks use birds-eye-view default cameras that do not show the background.
