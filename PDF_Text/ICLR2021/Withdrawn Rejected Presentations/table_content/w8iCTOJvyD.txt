Table 1: Test MSE loss for different methods; thesecond column shows the relative improvementover basic inductive supervised learning. The test-time training (TTT) baseline uses a full batch of6400 test samples to adapt, not allowed in regularSL. With a few gradient steps, tailoring signifi-cantly over-performs all baselines. Meta-tailoringimproves even further, with 35% improvement.
