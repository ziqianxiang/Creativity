Table 1: Languages used respectively for the Ran-dom, Historical and LM columns of Table 2. Thefirst column represents the reference pairs, thecolumns Random, Historical and LM contain re-spectively the languages that have been added toform the clusters that gave the results of the corre-sponding columns in Table 2.
Table 2: Machine Translation BLEU scores. The roWs correspond to the pairs of interest on WhichBLEU scores are reported. The column None is a baseline : it represents the BLEU score of amodel trained on the pair Without any MLM or TLM pre-training. The column Pair is a baseline : itrepresents the BLEU score of a model trained on the pair With MLM and TLM pre-training. Thecolumn Random is also a baseline : it is the BLEU score of a 3 languages multi-task model Where thelanguage added Was chosen purely at random. The column Historical refers to the BLEU score ofour 3 languages multi-task model Where the language added Was chosen using clusters identified in5.2.1. The column LM describes the BLEU score of our 3 languages, multi-task model Where thelanguage added Was chosen using the LM similarity ad described in 5.2.2 (Ba = Bafia, Bu = Bulu,EW = EWondo, Fr = French)Pair	None	Pair	Rand	Hist	LM	Pair	None	Pair	HistBa-Bu	9.19	12.58	23.52	28.81	13.03	Fr-Bu	19.91	23.47	25.06Bu-Ba	13.5	15.15	24.76	32.83	13.91	Bu-Fr	17.49	22.44	23.68Ba-EW	9.30	11.28	8.28	38.90	38.90	Fr-Ba	14.48	15.35	30.65EW-Ba	13.99	16.07	10.26	35.84	35.84	Ba-Fr	8.59	11.17	24.49Bu-EW	10.27	12.11	11.82	39.12	34.86	Fr-EW	11.51	13.93	35.50EW-Bu	11.62	14.42	12.27	34.91	30.98	EW-Fr	10.60	13.77	27.34We believe that the difference betWeen Random and Pair is not due to a disparity in data. First of all,they come from the same domain, the biblical domain. With regard to the size of the dataset :â€¢	For Bafia-Bulu, the three languages added are Du_n, EWondo and Mofa for Random
