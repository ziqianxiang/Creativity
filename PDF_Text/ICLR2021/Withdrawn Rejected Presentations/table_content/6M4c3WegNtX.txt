Table 3: A comparison of NES to deep ensembles with ensemble selection over initializations forTiny ImageNet over the DARTS search space with ensemble size M = 10. The computational costsare reports in terms of the number of networks trained (a typical network from this search spacetakes 3 hours to train on an NVIDIA RTX 2080Ti). The “arch” column indicates the number ofarchitectures evaluated to find the architecture and the “ensemble” column indicates the number ofarchitectures evaluated for building the ensemble. Note that for DARTS and AmoebaNet we convertthe GPU hours for finding the architecture into number of networks trained by dividing by 3. SeeAppendix C.3 for details.
Table 4: Classification errors comparing NES to the baselines introduced in Appendix C.4 for differentshift severities and M = 10. Best values are bold faced.
