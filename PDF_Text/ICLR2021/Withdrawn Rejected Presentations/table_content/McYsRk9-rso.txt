Table 1: Performances of 9× ResNet26 learned individually on each domain versus that of latentdomain models: ResNet26, ResNet56 and our DRA+WDT with (K, η) = (2, 0.2). For domain-supervision (9× ResNet26), label space sizes vary between 2 (Daimler Pedestrian) and 1623 (Om-niglot). In latent domain learning, there is a single label space over all domains |Y| = 2128. Overallbest performance underlined, best latent domain models in bold. Yellow: smallest domains.
Table 2: Results on the PACS dataset. Shown are performances for ResNet26, MLFN, a domain-supervised ensemble of 4x ResNet26, and our DRA. Third column lists the number of parametersthat have to be learned in each approach. Best overall performance underlined, best latent domainperformance bold.

Table 5: An ablation study on Visual Decathlon. First row contains DRA+WDT with default pa-rameters (K, η) = (2, 0.2). We remove each of our proposed solutions, and also replace it withan alternative parametrization: for DRA, this means that we remove the dynamic element and set asingle (K = 1) residual adapter in each layer. Next we set K = 2, but replace the gating mechanismwith Gumbel-Softmax sampling. Besides the complete removal of WDT in the fourth row, we alsomeasure performance with MixUp as an alternative augmentation strategy. We also show accuracywhen the residual network that we couple DRA+WDT with is not fixed at its pretrained parameters,a regularization strategy initially proposed in Rebuffi et al. (2017) that we also employ here.
