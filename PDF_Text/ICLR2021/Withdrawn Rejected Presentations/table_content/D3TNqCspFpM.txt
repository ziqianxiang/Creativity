Table 1: Errors on IHDP. “A/B” means pre-treatment/post-treatment prediction. The mean and std are calcu-lated over 1000 random draws of the data generating model. *Results with the two modifications. The resultswithout the modifications are CATE = .21±.oι∕.17±.oι and √epehe = l.0±.05/.97±.04. Bold indicatesmethod(s) that are significantly better than all the others. The results of the other methods are taken from Shalitet al. (2017), except GANITE (Yoon et al., 2018) and CEVAE (Louizos et al., 2017).
Table 2: Pre-treatment ATE on Pokec. Ground truth is 1. “Unadjusted” estimates ATE by ED (y1) - ED (y0).
