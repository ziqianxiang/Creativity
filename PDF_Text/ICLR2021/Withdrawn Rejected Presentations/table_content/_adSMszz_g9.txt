Table 1: Results on WikiText-103. “16(16)” means that the XL memory size is 16 and the com-pressed memory size is 16.
Table 2: Comparison for relative positional encoding. The experiments are conducted on Transformer-XL.		Table 3: Memory Replay Back- Propagation performance comparison.		3.4.2	Memory Replay Back-PropagationTo test MRBP’s effectiveness, we compare against the standard back-propagation through time(BPTT) and the standard gradient checkpointing (GC) algorithm. We use Memformer Decoderwith 12 layers, 8 heads, 512 hidden size, and 32 memory size for all the experiments here. The timehorizon for each truncated back-propagation update is set to 4.
