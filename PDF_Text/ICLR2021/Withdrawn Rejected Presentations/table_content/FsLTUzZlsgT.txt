Table 1: Deep learning quiz! We encourage our readers to judge each claim as T (true) or F (false),and then compare to our guesses and results. In the results column, “T” means the experiments areconsistent with the belief, “F” for inconsistent, and “?” for hard to say.
Table 2: Generalization bound examples: The bounds each predict generalization error increasingas a function ofn-0.5. Note: variable notation is consistent only within each line, except n.
Table 3: Results: model1 and model2 have similar percent test error when training on the full set.
Table 4: Experiment settings and parameters: We show the datasets, architectures, settings, andlearning rate (set by mini-train/val) used to train and test our classifiers. Next, we show the param-eters fit using the extended power law model e(n) = α + ηn-γ. Next to that, we show the modelresulting from setting γ = -0.5 and fitting to only the three training sizes with highest n.
