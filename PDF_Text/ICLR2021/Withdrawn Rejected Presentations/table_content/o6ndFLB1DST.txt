Table 1: The top header represents different metrics used for comparison, viz. Sparsity(S), categoricalproximity (Pcat), continuous proximity (Pcont), interpretability metric 1 (IM1), and interpretabilitymetric 2 (IM2). Each metric is paired with two columns: SS representing the metric obtained usingsemi-supervised embedding and U representing the metric obtained using classical undercompleteautoencoder.
