Table 1: C2D achieves consistently high classification accuracy (%, in form mean ± std over five runs)on CIFAR-10 under different noise rates and types, with markedly improved performance undervery-high noise conditions. Meta-Learning results provided by Li et al. (2020).
Table 2: Peak and final classification accuracy (%, in form mean ± std over five runs) on CIFAR-100. Unlike previous methods that suffer from rapid degradation, C2D was able to maintain goodperformance even under severe noise. Meta-Learning results provided by Li et al. (2020). * denotesresults acquired by us based on published code.
Table 3: C2D nearly closes the gap with semi-supervised training on the same clean set size.
