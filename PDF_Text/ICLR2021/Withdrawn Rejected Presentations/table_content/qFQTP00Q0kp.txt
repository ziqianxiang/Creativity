Table 2: Linear evaluation of representations learned by different models on different datasets.
Table 3: Domain transfer evaluation by training with self-supervision on the unlabeled source dataand linear evaluation on the labeled target data (e.g. source→target: UGLA→CricketX).
Table 4: Implementation detail of SelfTime. Here, we denote 1D convolutional layer asConvID(in_channels, out_channels, kerneLsize, stride, padding).
