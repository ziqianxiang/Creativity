Table 1: Test accuracy of our best ensembles against reproduced baselines from Kolesnikov et al.
Table 2: Upstream diversity gives better ensembles. Test accuracy of different ensembles. Foreach dataset, we take the median of three independent runs. Rows show the average over datasets.
Table 3: Ablations. Test accuracy of different ensembles. For each dataset, we take the median ofthree independent runs. Rows show the average over datasets. Bootstrapped confidence intervals atthe 95% level. Pre-training done on JFT, except for “All Experts” that also used ImageNet21k.
