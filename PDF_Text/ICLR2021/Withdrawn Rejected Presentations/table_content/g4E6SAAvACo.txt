Table 1: Mean ± std. accuracy from NAS-Bench-101. NASWOT is our sampling algorithm (500runs). REAL (our implementation of REA) usesevolutionary search to select an architecture (50runs), Random selects one architecture (500 runs).
Table 2: Mean ± std. accuracies on NAS-Bench-201 datasets. Baselines are taken directly from Dong& Yang (2020), averaged over 500 runs (3 for weight-sharing methods). Search times are given for aCIFAR-10 search on a single 1080Ti GPU. NASWOT CIFAR10-search refers to searching on theCIFAR-10 dataset and then evaluating the final model on an alternative dataset. Performance of ourtraining-free approach is given for different sample size N (also 500 runs). We also report the resultsfor picking a network at random, and the best possible network from the sample. f This is our ownimplementation of REA for a fair comparison against AREAL (50 runs each).
