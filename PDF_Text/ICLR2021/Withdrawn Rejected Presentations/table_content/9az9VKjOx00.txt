Table 1: Node classification accuracies (with standard deviation) in percentage on three datasets.
Table 2: Model size comparison of DGI, GML and the proposed ToPoTER.
Table 3: Graph classification accuracies (with standard deviation) in percentage on 6 datasets. “>1Day” represents that the computation exceeds 24 hours. “OOM” is out of memory error.
