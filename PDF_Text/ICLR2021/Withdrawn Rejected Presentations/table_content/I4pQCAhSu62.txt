Table 1: Average accuracy and standard deviation over 10 runs, on the synthetic MNIST test sets.
Table 2: Average accuracy and standard deviation over 5 runs on the noisy CIFAR test sets. Gaussianis adding the Gaussian noise uniformly across all feature dimensions and Patch Gaussian dataaugmentation is from (Lopes et al., 2019).
Table 3: Image classification accuracy on the corrupted CIFAR and ImageNet image sets (Hendrycks& Dietterich, 2019). The average column is based on all 19 corruption patterns and the other columnsaverages each corruption pattern group. The full table is in Appendix C.
Table 4: Image classification accuracies on the CIFAR-10-C, CIFAR-100-C and ImageNet-C sets(Hendrycks & Dietterich, 2019). PG stands for Patch Gaussian data augmentation (Lopes et al.,2019). All FCL means FCLxe. All numbers are averaged by 5 runs.
