Table 2: (a-c) Performance of POLCO (i.e., PN w/ PCPO) and baselines across three types of constraints onthe test set. (d) Ablations showing the effect of each component in POLCO. POLCO outperforms all the othervariants by achieving higher reward and lower constraint violations. (Arrows denote higher or lower scores.)Train-test split. For each type of constraint, we split the collected text into training and test setsusing an 80-20 ratio, denoted by Dtrain and Dtest , respectively.
Table 3: Examples from the various constraint classes. When a constraint does not fully describe allforbidden states in the environment, we classify it as invalid.
Table 4: Parameters used in POLCO.
