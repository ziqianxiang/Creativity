Table 1: Natural error Enat and robust error Eadv on the CIFAR-10 dataset when n3 =1and the512-dimensional representations are learned by contrastive learning, where Dnat represents thefraction of each algorithm’s output of “don’t know” on the natural data. We report values for σ ≈ τas they tend to give a good abstention-error trade-off w.r.t. σ.
