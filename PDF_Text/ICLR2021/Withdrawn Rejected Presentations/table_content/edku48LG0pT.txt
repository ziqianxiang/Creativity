Table 1: Performance Comparisons. SCG:strongly correlated Gaussian, ICG: Ill-conditioned Gaussian. German, Autralian,Heart: Datasets for Bayesian Logistic regres-sion. ESS: Effective Sample Size (a correlationmeasure)logistic regression task. We additionally compare to gradMALA (Titsias & Dellaportas, 2019) toshow the benefit of using neural network over linear adaptive sampler. For all experiments, we reportEffective Sample Size (Hoffman & Gelman, 2014) per M-H step (ESS/MH) and/or ESS per targetdensity gradient evaluation (ESS/grad). All results are given in minimum ESS over all dimensionsunless otherwise noted.
