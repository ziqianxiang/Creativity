Table 1: Euclidean distance between g vectors (from ANE-p-40 in Section 5) for different pairs ofwords, computed by the text encoder g from pure text. The differences in distances are consistentwith the intuitive phonetic confusability between the words.
Table 2: Results of name recognition based on nearest-neighbor search in (1) using the acousticencoder f and the text encoder g in tandem, compared with the result from a whole-word FSTrecognizer. ANE-p used f and g trained by the proposed method using monophone transcriptions foreach Yn (see Section 3.1), while ANE-g used grapheme transcriptions for Yn. Trip-p used a tripletdistance with the same data as ANE-p. The numeric suffixes indicate the number of dimensions inthe embedding vectors.
Table 3: Name recognition results for increasing phonebook size using f and g in tandem. Seecaption for Table 2 for description of methods. Because the phonebooks are much larger here than inTable 2, the accuracies are lower overall. When the number of dimensions reaches 40, the Euclideannearest-neighbor search between Acoustic Neighbor Embedding vectors (ANE-p-40) is as accurateas FST decoding. ______________________________________________________Method	Accuracy (%) for phonebook size				20K	100K	500K	1MFST	88.1	84.4	76.8	72.1ANE-g-20	79.7	75.7	67.5	62.0ANE-g-30	81.5	78.0	70.3	64.8ANE-p-20	86.5	81.7	73.1	68.2ANE-p-30	88.1	84.1	76.4	71.9ANE-p-40	88.2	84.4	77.0	72.7the f networks. A single acoustic model was used to generate all training and testing inputs for thef networks, as well as the inputs to the FST wherever needed.
Table 4: Approximate phonetic matching accuracy for isolated names using g. The FST performspoorly because it uses only a general vocabulary where many of the phonebook names are missing.

However, the edit distance tends to invite ad-hoc design decisionsthat make the process essentially heuristic and brittle. In particular, the substitution, deletion, andinsertion costs are difficult to assign in a context-dependent manner. Data-driven phone confusionmatrices, for example, can be used to compute substitution costs as in (Audhkhasi & Verma, 2007),but confusion matrices only provide a context-independent static cost for any given phone pair thatdoes not account for coarticulation. Additional heuristics are also needed if, for example, one wishesto have a nonlinear length mismatch penalty, as it is hard to achieve this with insertion and deletioncosts alone.
