Table 1: Comparison with Ramanujan et al. (2019) and (Zhou et al., 2019). The results of the firsttwo rows are from the respective papers.
Table 2: Architecture specifications of the networks used in our experiments. The Lenet network istrained on MNIST. The CONV-x models are the same VGG-like architectures used in (Frankle &Carbin, 2018; Zhou et al., 2019; Ramanujan et al., 2019). All convolutions use 3 Ã— 3 filters and pooldenotes max pooling.
