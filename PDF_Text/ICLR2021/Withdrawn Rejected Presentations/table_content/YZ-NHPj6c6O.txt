Forgrayscale images (Square Translation), d = 1, for RBG images, d = 3. All convolutional layersuse a kernel size of 3 × 3 with 64 filters, stride 1, and are followed by a ReLU activation (with theexception of the final decoder layer, which uses a sigmoid activation to produce pixel values between0 and 1). MaxPooling layers use have pool size of2 × 2. The number of units in the dense (or fullyconnected) layers is given by their output shape. Dense layers are followed by a ReLU activation,except for the last layer of the encoder. UpSampling layers enlarge the first two dimensions by afactor of 2, using nearest neighbor interpolation.
