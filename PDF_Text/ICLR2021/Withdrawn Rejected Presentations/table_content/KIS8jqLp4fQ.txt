Table 1: Comparison of utility upper bound using different privacy schedules. The algorithms are T -iteration2R-ZCDP under the PL condition (unless marked With *). The O notation in this table drops other ln terms.
Table 2: Comparison of empirical excess risk bounds. The algorithms are T-iteration 2R-ZCDP orequivalently (, δ)-DP under the PL condition (unless marked with * for convexity). The O notationin this table drops other ln terms. All algorithms in the second part terminate at step T = O(ln NDDR).
Table 3: Comparison of true excess risk bounds. The algorithms are T-iteration 2 R-ZCDP orequivalently (e, δ)-DP under the μ-strongly-convex condition. The O notation in this table dropsother ln terms. Assume loss functions are 1-smooth and 1-Lipschitz continuous, and all parameterssatisfy their numeric assumptions. * marks the method with convex assumption.
