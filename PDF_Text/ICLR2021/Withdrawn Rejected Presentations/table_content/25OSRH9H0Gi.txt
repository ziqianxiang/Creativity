Table 1: Accuracy gap (in p.p.) of the considered algorithms when using the regularization (ornormalization in the case of ProtoNet) enforcing the theoretical assumptions. All accuracy resultsare averaged over 2400 test episodes and 4 different seeds. Statistically significant results (out ofconfidence intervals) are reported with *. Exact performances are on par with those found in theliterature and are reported in the Supplementary materials.
