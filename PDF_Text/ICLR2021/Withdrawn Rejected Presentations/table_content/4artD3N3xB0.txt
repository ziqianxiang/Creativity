Table 5: The analytic forms of test functions and the meta-training sets used for training DM_LSTMand BL2O, where n is the dimension and Aj ∈ Rn×n, bj ∈ Rn×1 and cj ∈ Rn×1 are parameterswhose elements are sampled from i.i.d. normal distributions. It is obvious that the test functions arethe special cases in the training sets, respectively.
