Table 1: Brain decoding scores (Pearson’s r) for each of the BERT models fine-tuned via parsing,and for the pretrained baseline (PRE). Note that the latter is not fine-tuned.
Table 2: Brain decoding scores as measured via three metrics — Pearson’s r, Mean rank, and MedianRank — for each of the domain-finetuned baseline (DF-B) models, the guided attention models (GA),and the pretrained (PRE) model.
Table 3: p-values resulting from paired bootstrap test described above, for each of the three GAmodels when compared to the pretrained baseline.
Table 4: Average word perplexity scores for each of the domain-finetuned baseline (DF-B) models,the guided attention models (GA), and the pretrained (PRE) model.
Table 5: Semantic category frequency in the test set.
