We conducted theexperiment with the ResNet-18b and ResNet-50b (He et al., 2016). The pre-trained models fromthe PyTorch model zoo were used1 . The data preprocessing is same as the origin paper (He et al.,2016). A 224 × 224 crop was randomly sampled from an image or its horizontal flip. Stochasticgradient descent (SGD) with the momentum of 0.9 was used to optimize weight parameters. Themini-batch was set to 64 and weight decay to 0.0001. The network was trained up to 90 epochs.

Following the same settings inZhao et al. (2017), we used augmented data with the annotation of Hariharan et al. (2011) resulting10,582, 1,449 and 1,456 images for training, validation and testing. The backbone of our modelwas ResNet50. We evaluated the model with several-scale input and used the average results. Thebatch size was set to 8 constrained by limited memory. The learning rate was initialized by 1e-2and decayed by power policy with 0.9. SGD optimizer with the momentum set to 0.9 was used. Our8-level model can achieve the same performance with full-precision model 5.
