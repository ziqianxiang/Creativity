Table 1: High-level comparison of different agent objectives. All objectives express preferences oversystem configurations as a scalar value. Active inference additionally encourages entropic latents.
Table 2: Divergence minimization accounts for a wide range of agent objectives. Each latent variableused by the agent contributes a future objective term. Moreover, latent variables that are not observedover time, such as latent representations and model parameters, additionally each contribute a pastobjective term. Combining multiple latent variables combines their objective terms. Refer to Section 3for detailed derivations of these individual examples and citations of the listed agents.
