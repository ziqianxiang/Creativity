Table 1: Test likelihood for the Bernoulli stochastic backpropagation (BSB) estimator compared tothe REBAR and RELAX estimators. We report the mean and standard deviation over 5 runs.
Table 2: Test likelihood for the categorical stochastic backpropagation (CSB) estimator, compared tothe Gumbel-softmax estimator. We report the mean and standard deviation over 5 runs.
Table 3: Execution time of one epochof training on the mnist dataset per es-timator, per model.
