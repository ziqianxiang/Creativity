The Canadian Institute For Advanced Research (CIFAR)-10 dataset wasfirst published by Krizhevsky (2009). It contains 60,000 32 Ã— 32 color images that are evenly dividedinto ten classes. 10,000 of the images are set aside for validation purposes. Following related works(Cai et al., 2018; Huang et al., 2017), we perform data augmentation by flipping images horizontally,as well as translating by 4 pixels in either up, down, left or right direction. This yields a dataset of360,000 images. We then normalize these images using channel means and standard deviation.
