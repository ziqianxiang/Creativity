Table 1: Effect of different random and non-random centroid initializations of SGD training. Givenare the means and standard deviations of final log-likelihoods (10 repetitions per experiment). Toshow the added value of annealing, the right-most column indicates the final log-likelihoods whenannealing is turned off. This value should be co,pared to the leftmost entry in each row whereannealing is turned on. Standard deviations in this case where very small so they are omitted.
Table 2: Clustering performance comparison of SGD and sEM training using Davies-Bouldin score(less is better) and Dunn index (more is better). Results are in bold face whenever they are better bymore than half a standard deviation.
Table 3: Comparison of SGD and sEM training on all datasets in a streaming-data scenario. Eachtime mean log-likelihoods (10 repetitions) at the end of training, and their standard deviations arepresented. Results are in bold face whenever they are higher by more than half a standard deviation.
Table 4: Log-likelihood values after 50 training epochs using different number of Gaussian compo-nents K âˆˆ {25, 36, 49, 64, 81}. Best values of the final log-likelihood are in bold face.
