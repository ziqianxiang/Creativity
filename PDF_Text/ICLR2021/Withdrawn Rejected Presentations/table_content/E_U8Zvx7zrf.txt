Table 1: Comparison of communication-efficient methods for distributed DNN training. The periodp ∈ N+ is the communication interval for periodic averaging. The staleness s ∈ N is the number ofcommunication rounds that the information used in the model update has been outdated for. For allmethods in this table, delay tolerance T = sp.
Table 2: Non-i.i.d. test accuracy (%) of ResNet-110 on CIFAR-10. T			= 56 for the delay-tolerantmethods, and T = 0 and p =	56 for Local SGD. Training curves can be found in APPendix A.2.

The training curves of ResNet-110 onCIFAR-10 and ResNet-50 on ImageNet are shown in Figure 1. We use s = 1 because CoCoD-SGDand OverlapLocalSGD do not support s ≥ 2. Compared with other delay-tolerant methods, thecommunication budget of the OLCO3 variants is significantly smaller due to compressed commu-nication. OLCO3 is also robust to communication delay with a large T = sp. Therefore, OLCO3features extreme communication efficiency with compressed communication, delay tolerance, andlow communication frequency due to periodic averaging.
Table 3: Test accuracy (%) of ResNet-110 on CIFAR-10 and ResNet-50 on ImageNet using T = 56for the delay-tolerant methods, and T = 0 and p = 56 for Local SGD. CR stands for compressionratio. For each method, the first row denotes maintaining momentum and the second row denotesresetting momentum (line 6).
Table 4: Test accuracy (%) in Figure 6 by selecting the best configurations of s and p for the OLCO3variants. We set P of Local SGD equivalent to T of other delay-tolerant methods.
