Table 1: Amodal Segmentation is evaluated on the OccludedVehiclesDetection Dataset with mean-IoU as the performance metric. For supervision, a and m denotes the amodal and modal boundingbox, respectively. Also, * denotes the ground truth occluder segmentation given as supervision.
Table 2: Amodal Segmentation is evaluated on the KINS Dataset with meanIoU as the performancemetric. Note that BG Occ. Level is omitted due to physical constraints of realistic occluders.
