Table 1: Comparison results of standard Transformer and Length-Adaptive Transformer. Among length configurations on the Pareto fron-tier of Length-Adaptive Transformer, we pick two representative points:Length-Adaptive? and Length-AdaPtivet as the most efficient one whilehaving the highest accuracy and the accuracy higher than (or equal to)standard Transformer, respectively.
