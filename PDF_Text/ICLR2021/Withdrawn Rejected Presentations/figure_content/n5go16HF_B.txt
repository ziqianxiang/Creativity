Figure 1: A basic representation of a multi-category MTPP, marked point colors depict multiplecategories in a MTPP.
Figure 2: Architecture of an AAE for sparse, incomplete, and multi-category MTPPs.
Figure 3: (Inverse) percentile graphs for categories in radicalization dataset (‘Convert date’, ‘Trauma’,and ‘Step towards violence’). In this example, Y-axis represents days (ai). Day 0 indicates theunavailability of marked points (eg: There are 70.37%, 80.74%, and 35.55% of unavailability ofmarked points for ‘Convert date’, ‘Trauma’, and ‘Step towards violence’ categories respectively).
Figure 4: Conditional probability matrices for actual and generated datasets, and the difference.
Figure 5: Marginal distribution for each category: column sum for the conditional probability matrix;Real (green), Markov generated (orange), and AAE generated (red) data.
Figure 6: Bar plots for the probability of occurrence for each category based on real (green), Markov(orange), and AAE (red) generated data. Error bars (blue) represent the standard error over 100 runs.
