Figure 1: A new notion of robustness. Past work has focused on perturbation-based adversarialexamples, such as Figure 1a. In this paper, we focus on robustness with respect to natural variation,shown in Figure 1b, which often does not obey perceptual or norm-bounded constraints.
Figure 2: In this paper, we introduce models of natural variation to describe natural transformations.
