Figure 1: Left: Conventional adversarial training techniques. Right: Our layer-wise adversarial de-fense methods. In conventional adversarial training algorithms, the perturbations are only performedon the input side with gradients back-propagated through the architecture. In our layer-wise adver-sarial defense methods, the gradients on each layers are recorded along backpropagation, which arefurther added to each layers as layer-wise perturbations in another forward pass.
