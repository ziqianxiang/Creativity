Figure 1: Deformable capsule architecture for object detection.
Figure 2: Proposed deformable SplitCaps formulation which, in one-shot, localizes all objects totheir centers, determines their classes, and models their instantiation parameters in two parallel parentcapsule types. Information is dynamically routed from children to parents by passing three chosenchild capsule descriptors through a two-layer Squeeze-and-Excitation (S&E) bottleneck.
Figure 3: Qualitative example for CenterNet (Zhou et al., 2019a) (leftmost), the proposed Deform-Caps (center), and the ground-truth annotations (rightmost) on the MS COCO test-dev dataset.
Figure 4: Qualitative examples showing CenterNet (Zhou et al., 2019a) (leftmost) consistentlyproducing a higher number of false positive detections than the proposed DeformCaps (center), ascompared to the ground-truth annotations (rightmost) on the MS COCO test-dev dataset.
Figure 5: Some more qualitative examples showing CenterNet (Zhou et al., 2019a) (leftmost)consistently producing a higher number of false positive detections than the proposed DeformCaps(center), as compared to the ground-truth annotations (rightmost) on the MS COCO test-dev dataset.
Figure 6: Qualitative examples showing CenterNet (Zhou et al., 2019a) (leftmost) struggling todetect objects being presented in unusual poses or from unusual viewpoints, while the proposedDeformCaps (center) successfully captures these cases, as compared to the ground-truth annotations(rightmost) on the MS COCO test-dev dataset.
