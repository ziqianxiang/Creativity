Figure 1: (a) InPut-SAD model disentangles a graph into a structure and an attribute component andencodes them separately. (b) Embed-SAD model distills the structure and attribute information of agraph into two distinct channels of embedding vectors.
Figure 2: Divide an attributed graph G into a bipartite graph GA and an unattributed graph GS.
Figure 3: (a) Performance comparisons on four GNNs. (b)&(C) Sensitivity analysis of λι and λ2.
Figure 4: Visualization of correlation matrix and embedding distributions on BBBP's training set.
