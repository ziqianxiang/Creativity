Figure 1: [Left] Given a 4-node graph, at time t, the 2-simplex [A, B, C] also contains 1-simplices[A, B], [B, C] and [A, C]. At time t0 > t, the 2-simplex evolves (by connecting with D) to a 3-simplex [A, B, C, D] which additionally contains 1-simplices [A, D], [B, D] and [C, D], along with2-simplices [A, B, D], [A, C, D] and [B, C, D]. [Middle] Simplex setting with Benson et al. (2018).
Figure 2: Example of evolution of GSC G . Theyellow triangles are 2-simplices. In the k-ballaround 1-simplex [9, 10] (in red), a 1-simplex[10,7] is added at time t.
