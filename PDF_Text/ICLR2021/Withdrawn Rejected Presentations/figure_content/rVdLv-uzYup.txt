Figure 1: The graphical model of joint Perception and Control as Inference (PCI), where S and orepresent the latent state and the binary OPtimality binary variable, respectively. The hierarchicalperception model includes a bottom-up recognition model q(s) and a top-down generative modelp(x,o, S) (decomposed into the likelihood p(x,o∣s) and the prior belief P(S)). Control is performedby taking an action a to affect the environment state.
Figure 2: Illustration of OPC and the Pixel Waterworld envi-ronment. We regard the perception update as K copies of anRNN with hidden states θt receiving ηt Θ (ψt - xt+1) as input.
Figure 3: Performance comparisons between methods.
Figure 4: A sample rollout of perceptual groupingby OPC. The observation (top row), the next-stepprediction ψk of each copy of the K RNN copy(rows 4 to 7), the	ψk (row 2), and the soft-assignment η of the pixels to each of the copies(row 3). We assign a different color to each ψkfor better visualization. This sample rollout showsthat all objects are grouped semantically.
Figure 5: (a) Performance comparison between OPC and OP. (b) The soft-assignment η after experiencing 14000 and 14500 observations. Each ψkis assigned with a different color as in Fig. (4). X is the binary-processedoriginal observation.
