Figure 1: Proposed framework. We introduce a generator (G) that produces source samples fromthe unknown target classes. To ensure that these samples contain the correct information, we alignthe target feature distribution to the augmented source one via standard closed-set DA strategies,including an MMD-based loss and an adversarial domain classifier (D), with hd the probability ofclassifying a sample in domain d. Furthermore, we encourage the generated samples to be classifiedas unknowns by the multi-class classifier (H). Our entire framework, including the generator, istrained in an end-to-end fashion.
