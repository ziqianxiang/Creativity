Figure 1: Forecasting taxi trajectories is challenging due to the highly multi-modal nature of the data(Fig. 1a). VDM (Fig. 1b) succeeds in generating diverse plausible predictions (red), based the begin-ning of a trajectory (blue). The other methods, AESMC (Le et al., 2018), CF-VAE (Bhattacharyyaet al., 2019), VRNN Chung et al. (2015), RKN Becker et al. (2019), suffer from mode averaging.
Figure 2: Graphical illustrations of VDM. Dashed lines denote deterministic dependencies suchas transformations, marginalization, or computing the mean, as explained in the main text, whilebold lines denote stochastic dependencies. The half-shaded node for st indicates that st is beingmarginalized out as opposed to conditioned on.
Figure 3: Experiments on 2d synthetic data with 4 modes highlight the multi-modality of VDM.
Figure 4: Generated samples from VDM and baselines for stochastic Lorenz attractor. The modelsgenerate the remaining 990 observations (blue) based on the first 10 observations (red). Due to theChaotiC property, the reConstruCtion is impossible even the model learns the right dynamiCs. VDMand AESMC Capture the dynamiCs very well, while RKN fails in Capturing the stoChastiC dynamiCs.
Figure 5: An illustration of predictive priors p(zt|x<t) of taxi trajectories from VDM(k = 13),VDM(k = 1), and AESMC(k = 13) at 3 forks in the road marked on the map (left). VDM(k = 13)succeeds in capturing the multi-modal distributions, while the other methods approximate them withuni-modal distributions. For visualization, the distributions have been projected to 2d with KDE.
Figure 6: VDM and CF-VAE generate plausible multi-modal trajectories of basketball plays. Eachmodel’s forecasts (blue) are based on the first 10 observations (red). Ground truth data is green.
Figure 7: Generated trajectories of stochastic Lorenz attractor from VDM variants. The first tenobservations (red) are obtained from models given the first 10 true observations. The rest 990 ob-servations (blue) are prediCted. We Can see, all variants give very good qualitative results. SinCethe fundamental dynamiCs is govern by ordinary differential equations, the transition at eaCh timestep is not highly multi-modal. OnCe the model is equipped with a stoChastiC transition, it is able tomodel this dynamiCs.
Figure 8: Generated 50 taxi trajeCtories in 3 different areas from VDM and the baselines. Allmodels are required to prediCt the future Continuations (red), based the beginning of a trajeCtory(blue). VDM generates more plausible trajeCtories Compared with the baselines. While the gener-ated trajeCtories from VDM follow the street map, the generated trajeCtories from all baselines arephysiCally impossible. AESMC and CF-VAE Can Capture the general evolving direCtion, but sufferfrom Capturing the multi-modality at eaCh time step.
Figure 9: Generated 50 taxi trajectories from VDM variants. All models are required to predict thefuture continuations (red), based the beginning of a trajectory (blue). VDM-SCA+δ achieves thebest qualitative results among all variants. VDM-SCA+δ can generate plausible trajectories, evenit is trained without the adversarial term Ladv . We can see, for the weighting function, Eq. (27) isbetter than Eq. (28), and for the sampling method, SCA is better than Monte-Carlo method.
