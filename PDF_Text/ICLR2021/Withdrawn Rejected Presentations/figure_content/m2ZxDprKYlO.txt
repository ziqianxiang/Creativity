Figure 1: (a) Graphical model corresponding to IPML. (b) DNN implementation of generator gθwhere θ , (θa ,θb) and θa can be convolutions to obtain high-level representations of the inputvector, while θb is the last DNN layer’s parameters which are masked by z during the forwardpasses. (c) Graphical model corresponding to input generation by X-Net. (d) CVAE implementationof X-Net (i.e., decoder neural network with parameters φ).
Figure 2: Results of active task selection on (a) 5-shotsinusoid and (b) 1-shot 5-way mini-ImageNet.
Figure 3: Visualization of latent task embeddings from settings A to E.
Figure 4: (a) TSNE visualization of (samples of) 3 types of binary classification tasks; images ofblack/white background are black/white samples (yx = 1/yx =0). (b) Visualization of latent em-bedding of real tasks in (normalized) z space [-2, 2]2. (c) Sampled generated task data by walkingthrough the (normalized) z space [-2, 2]2 ; note that the inversion of color is only for visualizationto distinguish black and white samples. In training, NO images are inverted.
Figure 5: (a) TSNE visualization of latent task embedding of10 meta-testing categories and (b) their analysis (see main text).
