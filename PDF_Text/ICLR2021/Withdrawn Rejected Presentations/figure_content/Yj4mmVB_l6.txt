Figure 1: A comparison of the methods presented in Section 2.3 applied to problem (14) withÎº = 0.01. PGDA denotes (alternating) gradient descent ascent with proximal steps. As mentionedin the introduction it fails to converge. EGp denotes the method presented in Gidel et al. (2019) asextrapolation from the past. For the restricted gap we use B1 = B2 = [-1, 1].
Figure 2:	Left: Average and best/worst IS on the WGAN objective with weight clipping. Right:Average and best/worst IS on the WGAN-L1 objective using the proximal operator; The WGAN-L1 objective improves the IS in comparison to weight clipping and stabilizes the behavior of allconsidered methods during the training procedure.
Figure 3:	Average and best/worst results regarding IS (left) and FID (right) using ResNet architectureon the WGAN-GP objective including spectral normalization. Middle: Samples from the generatortrained with FBF Adam.
