Figure 1: Structure of the Rich Epinions Dataset1,13,629 users have at least one rating, 47,522 users have at least one trust relation and 21,910 usershave at least one review, one trust relation and one computed similarity.
Figure 2: Modules of MFTBR4.3	ModulesThe modules represented in the architecture diagram are further explained. In each of the predictormodules, we delve deeper into the trust facets considered.
