Figure 1: Attraction-repulsion spectrum for the MNIST data. Different embeddings of the fullMNIST dataset of hand-written digits (n = 70 000); colors correspond to the digit value as shown inthe t-SNE panel. Multiplying all attractive forces by an exaggeration factor ρ yields a spectrum ofembeddings. Values below 1 yield inflated clusters. Small values above 1 yield more compact clusters.
Figure 2:	Simulated data emulating a developmental trajectory. The points were sampled from20 isotropic 50-dimensional Gaussians, equally spaced along one axis such that only few inter-clusteredges exist in the kNN graph. Panels (b-f) used a shared random initialization.
Figure 3:	Neighbor embeddings of the single-cell RNA-seq developmental data. Cells weresampled from human brain organoids (cell line 409b2) at seven time points between 0 days and 4months into the development (Kanton et al., 2019). Sample size n = 20 272. Data were reduced withPCA to 50 dimensions. See Appendix for transcriptomic data preprocessing steps.
Figure 4: (a) Distance correlation (Szekely et al., 2007) between UMAP/FA2 and t-SNE with variousexaggeration values ρ ∈ [1, 100] (50 evenly distributed values on a log scale). Distance correlationwas computed using dcor package (Carreno, 2017) on a random subset (n = 5 000) of data. Dotsmark the maximum of each curve. (b) The n∕(ρZ) factor in the end of optimisation when usingt-SNE with ρ ∈ [1, 100] on full MNIST. (c) Distance correlations between t-SNE with ρ ∈ [1, 10]and UMAP depending on the sample size, for MNIST subsets of size n ∈ [5 000, 70 000]. Black lineindicates best matching ρ values. (d) The n∕(ρZ) factor in the end of optimisation when using t-SNEwith ρ ∈ {1,2,3,4} on MNIST subsets of size n ∈ [5 000, 70 000].
Figure 5: BarneS-Hut UMAP without negative sampling. (a-c) Embeddings with gamma valuesY ∈ {0.0001,0.01,1}. (d-e) Embeddings with gamma values Y ∈ {0.01,1} initialized with theembedding with γ = 0.0001 [panel (a)], in an analogy to early exaggeration in t-SNE.
Figure S1:	Different algorithmic choices, demonstrated using MNIST. (a) Default t-SNE embed-ding, perplexity 30. (b) T-SNE embedding with binary kNN affinities, k = 15. All non-zero affinitieshave equal size. The pij values were normalized as always in t-SNE, and sum to one. (c) DefaultForceAtlas2, using binary symmetrized kNN adjacency matrix (k = 15) as input. ForceAtlas2 usesso-called repulsion by degree by default. (d) ForceAtlas2 without repulsion by degree. (e) DefautUMAP embedding. This uses default values for a and b parameters, and LE initialization. (f) UMAPembedding with PCA initialization and Cauchy kernel (a = b = 1). (g) UMAP embedding with PCAinitialization, Cauchy kernel, and binary kNN affinities (k = 15). (h) UMAP embedding with PCAinitialization, Cauchy kernel, binary kNN affinities, and = 1.
Figure S2:	Decreasing the repulsion in UMAP. (a) UMAP embedding of MNIST with γ = 1(default). (b-d) Decreasing Y produces the same effect as increasing the exaggeration P in t-SNE.
Figure S3:	Neighbor embeddings of the single-cell RNA-seq developmental data (human, highk). Cells were sampled from human brain organoids (cell line 409b2) at seven time points between 0days and 4 months into the development (Kanton et al., 2019). Sample size n = 20 272. Data werereduced with PCA to 50 dimensions. See Appendix for transcriptomic data preprocessing steps. LE,FA2, and UMAP used k = 150 (instead of our default k = 15), while t-SNE used perplexity 300(instead of our default 30).

Figure S5:	Neighbor embeddings of the single-cell RNA-seq developmental data (chimpanzee,high k). Cells were sampled from chimpanzee brain organoids at eight time points between 0 daysand 4 months into the development (Kanton et al., 2019). Sample size n = 36 884. Data were reducedwith PCA to 50 dimensions. See Appendix for transcriptomic data preprocessing steps. LE, FA2, andUMAP used k = 150 (instead of our default k = 15), while t-SNE used perplexity 300 (instead ofour default 30).
