Figure 1: Summary of Hybrid Stochastic Networks explored in paper, and existing models. (A)shows combinations of stochastic layers used for various different HSN models (N: Normal, BM:Boltzmann machine, QBM: Quantum Boltzmann machine layers, -p: structured parameter space, -h:hierarchical, magenta: hybrid quantum-classical, grey: existing model). (B) shows detailed schematicfor the hierarchical-QBM (QBM-h) model. Notation as in Eq. 1.
Figure 2: Results for density estimation, and model interpretation of γ-terms. (A) shows test-setlikelihood of models on synthetic data, and (B) on psychiatric genomics data density estimation tasks.
Figure 3: Auxiliary energy for restricted world-lines. (A) provides a schematic of the notation used inApp. A.1. (B) compares the efficiency of importance sampling methods for estimating the expectedbias statistics in a partially-clamped QBM model using the auxiliary energy introduced in App. A.1versus uniform sampling as the proposal distribution. (C) compares the accuracy of continuous-timeMCMC with population annealing for estimating both bias and pairwise weight statistics in QBMswith different γ terms.
Figure 4: Synthetic model forγ-terminterpretation. (A) and (B) show histograms of outputs evaluatedusing the QBM and higher-order BM energies defined in Eqs. 25 and 26 respectively for varyingsettings of the model parameters (1000 trials for each configuration). Increasing -γ0 in (A) is shownto have a similar effect to increasing the weight of the higher-order term V in (B) by comparingmodels with similar weight on the lowest-energy configuration. See App. A.3 for further details andinterpretation.
