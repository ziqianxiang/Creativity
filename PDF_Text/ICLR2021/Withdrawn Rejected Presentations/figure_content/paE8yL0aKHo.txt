Figure 1: Evaluation curves of SAC (Haarnoja et al., 2018b) and CAT-SAC on (a) Ant, (b) Cheetah,(c) Walker, and (d) Hopper environments. The solid line and shaded regions represent the mean andthe standard deviation across six runs, respectively.
Figure 2: Demonstration on (a) the Swiss Roll maze environment, (b) prediction error of RND (c)prediction error of X-RND. The agent starts from the blue block and moves to the green block.
Figure 3: Evaluation curves of CAT-SAC with different values of hyperparameters Î² and m. Thesolid line and shaded regions represent the mean and the standard deviation across four runs.
Figure 4: Evaluation curves for CAT-SAC on (a) Ant and (b) Hopper tasks. The solid line andshaded regions represent the mean and standard deviation, respectively, across four runs.
Figure 5: Evaluation curves for different approaches on (a) 5-step interval (mild) and (b) 10-step in-terval (difficult) tasks. The solid line and shaded regions represent the mean and standard deviation,respectively, across six runs.
Figure 6: The sketches of log a. The left one is the implementation of vanilla SAC (Haarnoja et al.,2018b). And the others are proposed in our paper to model instance-level entropy temperature. Themiddle one explain how We handle real-value curiosity. And the right one first rounds the curiosityinto the closest integer and then choosing the matched entropy temperature.
Figure 7: The prediction errors of all blocks of RND. These figures are obtained by using RND topredict the curiosity about all states after training with different numbers of visited states. From leftto right and from top to bottom, the number of visited states is increasing.
Figure 8: The prediction errors of all blocks of X-RND. These figures are obtained by using X-RNDto predict the curiosity about all states after training with different numbers of visited states. Fromleft to right and from top to bottom, the number of visited states is increasing.
