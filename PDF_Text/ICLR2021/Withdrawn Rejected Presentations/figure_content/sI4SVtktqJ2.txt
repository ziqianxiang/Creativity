Figure 1: (a) the original image sampled from ImageNet dataset, (b) the perturbed image withGaussian noise(Ïƒ = 1.0), (c) the denoised image with one-step denoiser, (d) the progress of multi-step denoiser, the last image is the final denoised image.
Figure 2: The performance of multi-step denoiser for denoised smoothing. The blue lines are ourmethods, and red lines are white-box smoothing which are experimented by each authors. (a) `2certified accuracy with Gaussian smoothing on CIFAR-10, (b) `1 certified accuracy with Laplacesmoothing on CIFAR-10, (c) `1 certified accuracy with uniform smoothing on CIFAR-10, (d) `2certified accuracy with Gaussian smoothing on ImageNet, (e) `1 certified accuracy with Laplacesmoothing on ImageNet, (f) `1 certified accuracy with uniform smoothingon ImageNet,.
