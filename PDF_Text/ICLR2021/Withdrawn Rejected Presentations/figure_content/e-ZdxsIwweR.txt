Figure 1: The effect on constraint satisfaction and return as perturbations are added to cartpole,quadruped and walker for a fixed C-D4PG policy.
Figure 2: The holdout set performance of the baseline algorithms on D4PG variants (left) and DMPOvariants (right) for Cartpole with pole mass perturbations (top row) and walker with thigh lengthperturbations (bottom row).
