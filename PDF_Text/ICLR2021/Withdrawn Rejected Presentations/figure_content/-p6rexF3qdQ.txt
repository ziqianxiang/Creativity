Figure 1: (a) OMP block is to replace a single path by multiple ones and can be posed anywhere in aneural network. (b) When clean examples (1st row) are adversarially perturbed (2nd row, generatedby attacking a third neural network), the features learned by a vanilla VGG16 change a lot. Afterimposing an OMP block even in the last layer, the learned features by the first layer become muchmore robust.
Figure 2: Illustration of three architectures of networks with one OMP block. The parameters ineach path in the block (in blue) are required to be mutually-orthogonal.
Figure 3:	Robustness of each network in model-1(OMP-a), model-2(OMP-b) and model-3(OMP-c).
Figure 4:	Illustration of the robustness of OMP-a and OMP-b. Single network in OMP-a or OMP-bshows terrible robustness (dashed lines). But adversarial examples created from this network couldbe classified correctly by other networks (solid lines). Detailed settings can be found in A.3.
Figure 5: Robustness comparison of different models against FGSM and PGD attacks.
Figure 6: Robustness against a stronger white-box attack, which simultaneously attacks all the pathsin the OMP block. Even under such a stronger attack, the networks of OMP-c block still showsuperior robustness.
Figure 7: Comparison between networks with learned OMP block (in blue) and networks withrandomly-fixed OMP block (in orange). The network architecture is resnet20 of OMP-c. The aver-age mean accuracies of all the networks and the standard deviations are recorded.
