Figure 2: Empirical validation of Assumption 1. The value of X,U ； P 八 is estimated at each trainingk%tEχ G (X ,θ ) kepoch using Monte-Carlo sampling with a sample size 500. Results on CIFAR-10 (C10) and CIFAR-100(C100) with varying numbers of labeled samples are presented. It can be observed that the ratio generallyincreases before the 500th epoch, but gradually becomes stable or even decreases in the last part of the trainingprocess when the learning rate approaches 0. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that Assumption 1 holds.
