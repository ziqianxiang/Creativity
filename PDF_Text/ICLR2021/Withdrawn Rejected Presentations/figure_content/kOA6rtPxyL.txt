Figure 1: To compute the meta-gradients Vθ Pi LTQaZ (Φi(θ)), MAML (Finn et al., 2017) differen-tiates through the inner updates, the implicit MAML (RajesWaran et al., 2019) approximates localcurvatures, while we differentiate through the “lazy” teacher,s one-step “leap”. The exploratorystudent may make many steps of inner updates before the teacher's “leap”.
