Figure 1:	The “JAO MDP” constructed in Jaksch et al. (2010). Dashed lines denote transitionsrelated to the good action a?.
Figure 2:	A chain with H copies of JAO MDPs correlated in time. At the end of an episode, thestate should deterministically transition from any state in the last copy to the So state in the first copyof the chain, the arrows of which are not shown in the figure. Also, the s∣ state in the first copy isactually never reached and hence is redundant.
