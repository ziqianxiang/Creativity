Figure 1: Illustration of a treatedindividual. Yellow dots representthe outcomes under no treatment.
Figure 2: A: Illustration of SyncTwin (shaded area: the time points after the treatment starts). 1. Temporalcovariates are encoded as representation vectors. 2. The synthetic twin of a treated target individual is constructedas the weighted average of the few contributors from the control group. 3. The difference between the observedoutcome and the synthetic twin outcome estimates ITE. B: the DAG of the data generating model (Sec. 2).
Figure 3: Illustration of the loss functions. (A) The representation networks are trained using Ls and Lr inEquation 6. Note that the supervised loss Ls only applies to the control. (B) Validation and inference involveoptimizing the matching loss Lm in Equation 8. Note the encoder needs to be fixed during optimization.

Figure 5: Illustration of the transparency of SyncTwin. Top: the outcomes (LDL) before and after treatmentof a target individual and its synthetic twin. Bottom left: histogram of distance dy (Equation 4). Bottom right:histogram of number of contributors used to construct the synthetic twin.
Figure 6: The sensitivity of hyper-parameters on the mean absolute error of ITE estimation and the validationloss defined in Section 4.3. The left panel shows the results for various choices of H; the middle panel showsλp ; and the right panel shows τ . The y-axis is shown in log scale.
Figure 7: The wall-clock time of the simulation study under different settings. For each setting, 10 independentsimulation runs were conducted. The bar shows the average wall-clock time and the line range captures the 95%confidence interval.
