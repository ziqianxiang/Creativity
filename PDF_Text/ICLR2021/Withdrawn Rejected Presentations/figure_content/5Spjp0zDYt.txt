Figure 1: Comparison of true data distributions versus the corresponding learned distributions ofVAE and IWAE. When conditions of Theorem 1 are satisfied, in examples (a) and (c), VAE trainingapproximates p(x) poorly and IWAE performs better. When one of the conditions is not met, inexamples (b) and (d), then the VAE can learn p(x) as well as IWAE.
Figure 2: Discrete Semi-Circle. Comparison of VAE and IWAE for semi-supervision. The groundtruth likelihood shows two distinct functions, for y = 0, 1. The VAE likelihood is over-regularized bya simple variational family and learns two nearly identical functions (“functional collapse”). TheIWAE likelihood function is unregularized and learns two distinct but overfitted functions.
