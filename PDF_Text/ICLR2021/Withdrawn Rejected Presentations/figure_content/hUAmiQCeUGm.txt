Figure 1: Left: Label frequency follows a long-tailed distribution. Middle: Norm of classifier weightsof Bonsai models Khandagale et al. (2019). Right: Norm of classifier weights of Bonsai modelswhen decoupled tail label augmentation is applied.
Figure 2: Left: Norms of classifier weights with varying n_aug. Right: The performance w.r.t. P@5and PSP@k as a function of n_aug. Results in both figures are produced using Bonsai on EUR-Lex.
Figure 3:	Illustration on different classifiers and their corresponding decision boundaries, where wiand wj, ||wi|| > ||wj ||, denote the classification weights for class i and j respectively. Ci and Cjare the classification cone belongs to the i-th and j-th class in the feature space, respectively. Theclassifier with larger weights norm, i.e., wi , has wider decision boundary.
Figure 4:	The norm of classifier weights of Bonsai models before (blue) and after (red) applying dataaugmentation for tail label. Results are produced on Wiki10-31K dataset.
Figure 5:	The performance in terms of PSP@k as a function of splitting thresholds on EUR-Lex (left)and Wiki10-31K (right). Results are produced using Bonsai method.
