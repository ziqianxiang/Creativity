Figure 1: Overview of on-device contrastive learning framework.
Figure 2: Contrast scoring for data replacement. The original and flipped inputs are fed into theencoder to generate representation vectors, which are projected to the unit sphere to compute scores.
Figure 3: Learning curve on CIFAR-10 (a), (b) and ImageNet-100 (c), (d) datasets. The learnedrepresentations by the proposed data replacement with scoring substantially outperform the baselinesunder two evaluation protocols.
