Figure 1: Training curves on continuous control benchmarks in Mujoco. The x-axis indicates num-ber of training epoch (100 environment steps for each training epoch), while the y-axis is the evalua-tion result represented by average episode return. The shaded region denotes one standard deviationof average evaluation over 5 seeds. Curves are smoothed uniformly for visual clarity.

Figure 3: Ablation study on √2α.
Figure 4: Ablation study on βF	Additional experiment resultsLimited by the length of the text, we present the results of the evaluation on some simple tasks inFig. 5. All evaluation data can be seen in Tab. 3.
Figure 5: Training curves on continuous control benchmarks in Mujoco.
