Figure 1:	Images in red boxes are the original images sampled from the MNIST dataset. The imagesin blue boxes are reconstructed by μθ(μφ(x)). The other images are decoded from neighbor pointsof μφ(x), which are perturbed by Wz 〜N(wz|0, s2I).
Figure 2:	Visualization of latent space via t-SNE. Pink dots are sampling points generated from theprior p(z).
Figure 3:	Visualization of latent space via t-SNE. Pink dots are sampling points generated from theprior p(z).
Figure 4: Reconstructed images and examples of images generated from the prior and the estimatedposterior on MNIST. “GT” stands for ground truth.
Figure 5: Reconstructed images and examples of images generated from the prior and the estimatedposterior on CelebA.
