Figure 1: Model architecture of our Classifier-Noise-Invariant Conditional GAN (CNI-CGAN).
Figure 2:	Generation and classification performance of CGAN-P, CGAN-A and Ours on threedatasets. Results of CGAN-P on PU accuracy do not exist since CGAN-P generates only K classesdata rather than K + 1 categories that the PU classifier needs.
Figure 3:	Visualization of generated samples on three datasets. Rows below the red line representthe negative class. We highlight the erroneously generated images with red boxes on MNIST.
Figure 4:	Tendency of generation performance as the training iterations increaseon three datasets.
Figure 5:	PU Classification accuracy of CGAN-A, RCGAN-U and Ours after joint optimizationacross different amounts and distribution types of unlabeled data.
