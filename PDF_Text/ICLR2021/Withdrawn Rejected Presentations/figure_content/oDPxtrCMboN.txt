Figure 1: Overview of the proposed model. Learning invariant representations induces indistinguish-able representations across domains, but there can still be mis-classified samples (as stated in redcircle) due to misaligned optimal predictors. Besides learning invariant representations, LIRR modeljointly learns invariant risks to better align the optimal predictors across domains.

Figure 3: Grad-CAM (Selvaraju et al., 2017) results of different model, LIRR appropriately capturesthe invariant part of the same object in different domains, e.g. the shape of horse and husky leads toinvariant prediction across snow and grass domain.
