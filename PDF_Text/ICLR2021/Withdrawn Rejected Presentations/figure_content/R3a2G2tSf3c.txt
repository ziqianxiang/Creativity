Figure 1: Graph-Graph (G2G) model overview. There are four components in the framework: GraphConvolutional Network (GCN), Heterogeneous Space Alignment, Graph-Graph Similarity Network,and SuperGraph. The input graphs are organized into triplets. For each triplet, an anchor graph, apositive graph, and a negative graph is included, where the positive graph has the same label withthe anchor graph, and the negative has a different label with the anchor graph. Firstly, all the graphsare processed by a shared GCN to get informative embeddings. Then in the Heterogeneous SpaceAlignment, all the embeddings are aligned to a same distribution. After the alignment, a max-poolinglayer is utilized to obtain the feature representation for each graph, and a Graph-Graph SimilarityNetwork is designed to calculate the similarity between graphs. Finally, a SuperGraph is built by thefeature representations and the similarity matrix. Then a node classification algorithm can be appliedto the SuperGraph to predict the labels of the graphs.
