Figure 1:	Overview of FCR. The input is the flow chart of abs function. The middle is the adjacentmatrix and text of each node generated by FCR. The output is the synthesized source code.
Figure 2:	Architecture of FCR3	NetworkIn this section, we first describe the network and its subnets. Then, we describe the loss functionand training details.
Figure 3: Samples of FCR prediction. The predicted bounding boxes are drawn in red lines. Thepredicted text is drawn in blue above the bounding box. The right figure is the predicted adjacentmatrix and synthesized source code.
