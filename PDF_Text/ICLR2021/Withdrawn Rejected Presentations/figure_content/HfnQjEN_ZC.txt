Figure 1: A dance is random a sequence of well-defined figures (movements). If the dancer isinstrumented with sensors, the figures emit sensor readings that should be similar for each type offigure.
Figure 2: Raw measurements of yaw: 4 samples from two figures.
Figure 3: Hidden Markov Model representation.
Figure 4: Deep Neural Networks Representations.
Figure 5: Confusion matrices. When the actual figure is correctly classified p% of the time, thediagonal entry is p/100.
Figure 6: Improvement achieved using Markov correction across all neural network configurationsand cross-validation test sets.
