Figure 1: Traffic flows in IP networks.
Figure 2: Time series of practical traffic traces from WIDE backbone network binned by two differ-ent time scales.
Figure 3:	(a) IP traffic data in the form of flow tensor time series. The S-shaped curve characterizesthe data correlationship along the spatio-temporal dimensions; (b) A sample of data rates of a flowand the rate difference recorded at two neighboring nodes.
Figure 4:	Framework of FlowNN. With the raw feature data xtf,n as inputs, FlowNN extracts boththe path-level and the induced node-level feature patterns as learned feature vectors, which can thenbe used for different application tasks by changing the Readout layer.
Figure 5: (a) Validation MSELoss; (b) Normalized flow rate predicted by different models.
