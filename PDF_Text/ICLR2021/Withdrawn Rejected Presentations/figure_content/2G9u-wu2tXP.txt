Figure 1: A hash-routed network with 4 units and a depth of 3. In this example, U3 is selected first asthe hashed flattened image has the highest projection (p0) magnitude onto its basis. The structuredimage passes through the unitâ€™s convolution filters, generating the feature map in the middle. Thisprocess is repeated twice whilst disregarding used units at each level. The final output is the sum ofall projection residues. Best viewed in color.
