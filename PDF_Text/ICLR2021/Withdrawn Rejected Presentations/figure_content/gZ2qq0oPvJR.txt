Figure 2: Distributions of length of proofs found by FLoP on RA-1, RA-2, RA-3. Average proof lengths are 367, 2082, and 1864, respectively.
Figure 3: Distributions of length of proofs found by FLoP on binaryRA-1, binary RA-2. Average proof lengths are 85 and 179. Note thelogarithmic scale.
Figure 4: Value and Policy network architectures in PPO. Their inputs are state and state-action pair features, respectively. The policy returnsa score for each action, which are then normalized to a probability.
Figure 5: A closed tableau tree of the proof of 1 âˆ™ 1 = 1. On the left we list the actions taken in the proof. See http://bit.ly/site_atpcurr for details.
