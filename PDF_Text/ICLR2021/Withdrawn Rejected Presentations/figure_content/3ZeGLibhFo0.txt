Figure 1: (a) Illustration of the proposed counterfactual survival analysis (CSA). Covariates X =x are mapped into latent representation r via deterministic mapping r = Φ(x). The potentialoutcomes are sampled from ta 〜P(TA|X = x) for A = a Via stochastic mapping hA(r, e), whererandomness is induced with a flow-based transformation, 6, of a simple distribution p(6), i.e., uniformor Gaussian. (b) and (c) show the proposed causal graphs for non-informatiVe and informatiVecensoring, respectiVely.
Figure 2: (a) Inferred population HR(t) compared against ground truth (EMP) on ACTG-SYNTHETICdata. CSA-INFO-based (b) cluster-sPecific average log HR(t|x) curves and (c) estimated density ofmedian log HR(t|x) values on the test set of the FRAMINGHAM dataset. Clusters assignment wereobtained via hierarchical clustering of individualized log HR(t|x) traces.
