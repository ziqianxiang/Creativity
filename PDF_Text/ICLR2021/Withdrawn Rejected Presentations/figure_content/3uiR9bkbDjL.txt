Figure 2: Computational graph for the ColdExpand modelmethods (Passino et al., 2019; Kipf & Welling, 2016b; Pan et al., 2019). Along with original edges,predicted links are then fed to the GCN Classifier for node classification.
Figure 3: Link prediction results for different λ. GAE-CE represents results using ColdExpand strat-egy. We added results of GAE which is invariant to λ for comparison.
