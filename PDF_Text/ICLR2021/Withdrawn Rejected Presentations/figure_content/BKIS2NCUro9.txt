Figure 1: Comparison of the vanilla (conditional) VAE and LOVAEhave been occurred such as posterior collapsing and mode collapsing in the training. As a solutionfor this phenomenon, methods to adjust a KL loss weight to a value other than 1 have been proposedin VAE. In Kim et al. (2018b), latent variable from encoder is optimized according to maximizing ofELBO, and both of the encoder and decoder parameters are updated as the optimized latent variable.
Figure 2: Example of SMILES in ZINC dataset: COc1ccc(N2CC(C(=O)Oc3cc(C)ccc3C)CC2=O)cc1Figure 3: Distribution of target propertiesQEDand quantitative estimation of drug-likeness (QED). In addition, this information is provided inconformity with various molecular expression formats such as SMILES, mol2, and 3D SDF usedin the chemical field. SMILES is a string representation to express chemical substances, such asmolecules, in the form of ASCII string. It is possible to express complex graph-structured chemicalsin the sequence form using simple rules. Figure 2 shows SMILES of a molecule in ZINC DB, and weused two types of DB, ZINC310K (Yan et al., 2019; Kang & Cho, 2018) and ZINC250K (Kusneret al., 2017). The vocabulary contains 39 different symbols {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, +, -, =, #, (,), [, ], H, B, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, Sn, I, c, n, o, p, s, \, /, @, @@}. The minimum, median,and maximum lengths of a SMILES string of ZINC310K are 8, 42, and 86, respectively. (In case ofZINC250K, 9, 44, and 120)The distribution of target properties in our sampled dataset, ZINC310K, is shown in Figure 3. Medianvalues of molwt, LogP, and QED are 359.02, 2.91, and 0.70, respectively.

Figure 4: Samples of generated molecules of LOVAE8Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2021Figure 5: Samples of generated molecules of LOVAE with condition of plogP6 ConclusionIn this paper, LOVAE applying latent optimization technique to VAE algorithm is proposed. Bytraining the encoder first, the latent variable z has an updated distribution in the direction of reducingthe train loss. Additionally, z is updated before training the decoder in the direction of reducing thereconstruction loss. The training of decoder becomes more efficient by utilizing the optimized z.
