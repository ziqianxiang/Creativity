Figure 1: Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) for (a) the problem of estimating the effect of treatmentt on outcome y with confounders x. DAG (b) reflects an RCT. DAG (c) illustrates TVAE and is anextension of the DAG by Zhang et al. (2020), where the structure is a priori assumed to factorizeinto into risk zy, instrumental zt, and confounding factors zc. We extend their model with zo toaccount for the scenario whereby not all covariates will be related to treatment and/or outcome.

Figure 3: The block-diagram for Targeted VAE. Dashed boxes indicate the variationally inferredlatent variables zo , zc, zt , and zy . Arrows indicate functions, and colors distinguish treatment(green), outcome (blue), covariates (grey), and confounder (purple) related entities.
