Figure 1: Qualitative comparison of three ColourConvNets (VQ-VAE of K=8 and D=128). The firstcolumn is the networks’ input and the other columns their corresponding outputs. The output imagesof rgb2dkl and rgb2lab have been converted to the RGB colour space for visualisation purposes. Theartefacts in rgb2rgb are clearly more visible in comparison to the other ColourConvNets.
Figure 2: Left: exemplary conversions across different colour spaces. Right: the schematic view ofVQ-VAE ColourConvNets.
Figure 3: Low-level evaluation for embedding spaces of different size (ImageNet validation-set).
Figure 4: High-level visual task evaluation. Left: ResNet50’s classification accuracy on recon-structed images of ImageNet. Right: FPNS’s segmentation IoU on reconstructed images of COCO.
Figure 5: Low-level pairwise comparison of two groups of input-output colour spaces (ImageNetvalidation-set). Figures are averaged over two embedding spaces 8 × 8 and 8 × 128.
Figure 7: Error rate as a function of the difference in frequency of selected vectors in the embeddingspace. A value of zero in the x-axis indicates all embedding vectors are equally used by the model.
Figure 8:	The reconstruction output by selecting a single vector of the entire embedding space. Allmodels are VQ-VAE of K=8 and D=128.
Figure 9:	The reconstruction by a pairwise combination of embedding vectors in different spatialdirections. ColourConvNet rgb2lab with K=8 and D=128. In all cases a sample of spatial size 2 × 2was drawn from the embedding space. Horizontal: the top elements set to vector ei and bottom ej .

Figure 11: Average hue shifts for rgb2dkl {e} ∈ R8×128 in CIE L*a*b* coordinates. Black- andred-bars indicate significant impact on the luminance- or chromatic-channels respectively.
