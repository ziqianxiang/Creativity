Figure 1: Transductive inference with confidence scores. (a) ProtoNets with Euclidean distance; (b) ProtoNetswith instance-wise metric; (c) ProtoNets with model/data perturbations and instance-wise metric; We visualizet-SNE embeddings on a 3-way 1-shot task, where each color stands for different class. The numbers show theaccuracy increase after transduction for this task. The transparency shows the confidence scores for red class.
Figure 2: Overview. (a) To capture data uncertainty, we randomly apply horizontal flip augmentation to thewhole data in episode. (b) Along with data uncertainty, we randomly drop the last residual block to capture themodel uncertainty. (c) In order to efficiently train the confidence under these perturbations, we meta-learn theinput-adaptive distance metric.
Figure 3: Histogram of metric scale, ona miniImageNet 5-way 5-shot task. σcorresponds to gφ .
Figure 4: Visualization of incorrectly classified query examples, on a miniImageNet 3-way 1-shot task. Thesize of circles shows the confidence score for the red class. Every figure is visualized by same task. conf denotesconfidence. In each row, we show the transduction with local confidence and the transduction with ensembleconfidence, where local confidence is derived from each space. Best viewed in color.
