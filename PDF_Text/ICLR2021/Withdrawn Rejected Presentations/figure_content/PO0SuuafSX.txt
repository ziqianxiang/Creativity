Figure 1: Overview of cNeRF. The sender trains an entropy penalized neural representation functionon a set of views from a scene, minimizing a combination of rate and distortion. The receiver canuse the compressed model to render novel views.
Figure 2: Renderings of the synthetic Lego scene and real Fern scene from the uncompressed NeRFmodel, at 32 bits per parameter (bpp), and from cNeRF with λ ∈ {0.0001, 0.01}.
Figure 3: A comparison of four (zoomed in) renderings from cNeRF with λ = 0.0001 and HEVC+ LLFF with QP=30. HEVC + LLFF shows obvious artifacts such as ghosting around edges and anoverall less crisp rendering.
Figure 4: Rate-distortion curves for both the CNeRF and HEVC + LLFF approaches, on two real(left) and two synthetic (right) scenes. We truncate the curves for HEVC + LLFF, since increasingthe bitrate further does not improve PSNR. See Fig. 7 for the full curves.
Figure 5: Rate-distortion curves for comparing the multi-scene model with a single shared shift tothe single scene models. The models are shown for two synthetic (left) and two real scenes (right).
Figure 6: Test performance of the HEVC + LLFF baseline across different number of images com-pressed with HEVC. The decompressed images are used by LLFF to reconstruct the test views.
Figure 7: Full rate-distortion curves for HEVC + LLFF, with labels showing the effect of the QPparameter. To avoid clutter, only the Lego QP labels are given, and the other scenes are similarlyordered from QP=10 on the right to QP=50 on the left.
Figure 8: Renderings of the synthetic Ficus scene and real Room scene from the uncompressedNeRF model, at 32 bits per parameter (bpp), and from cNeRF with λ ∈ {0.0001, 0.01}.
