Figure 1: Conceptual illustration of approaches to learning unbalanced class distributions. For aninstance in the training data, the frequency-based methods either sharpen or soften the loss for alllikelihoods according to its class frequency, while the likelihood-based methods adjust the loss inthe low- or high-likelihood area, respectively. The high-likelihood area is relatively deprioritizedin both cases. The proposed Eureka Loss progressively rewards the systems with higher bonus forhigher-likelihood.
Figure 2: Regaining focus on the high-likelihoodarea for the rare classes benefits classification. Left:Illustration of HFL which reverts FL to CE in thehigh-likelihood area. Right: Applying HFL only tothe rare classes improves overall performance.
Figure 3: Varying strength of bonus on long-tailedCIFAR-10. Higher power Î³b indicates higher strength.
Figure 4: The visualization of test likeli-hood distribution for models trained withthe Eureka Loss. The model classifiesthe rare class examples more decisively,compared to the existing methods.
Figure 5: Example likelihood on the validation set of iNaturalist18 categorized by class frequenciesinto few, medium, many, and all.
Figure 6: Illustration of the over-fitting phenomenon on tail classes, the number on the top of eachbar is the difference between the training accuracy and the test accuracy.
