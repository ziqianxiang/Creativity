Figure 1: Left: Possible representation structures under a loss optimizes both standard and adversar-ial accuracy. The representations achieved from previous works usually look like the purple vector,whose features are entangled together, neither very robust nor very useful.
Figure 2: Figure 2 (Top): Standard-trained models adopt both robust and non-robust features that candistinguish Husky from other classes. Robust trained classifier would abandon non-robust featureslike texture. Figure 2 (Middle) The face of the dog is missing. Though humans naturally seek extraevidence as long as they do not contradict with the robust features present, e.g., the shape of ears.
Figure 3: Top: Factual representation Bottom: Mask the first K dimension of factual representationwith a binary mask to get the counter-factual representation.
Figure 4: The triple-head model: all examples first go through trade-off head to compute robustprediction, non-robust prediction and trade-off prediction. If robust prediction meets trade-off pre-diction, then we use adversarial head to get final prediction. If non-robust prediction meets trade-offprediction, then we use adversarial head to get final prediction. Otherwise, we use the prediction ofthe trade-off head.
