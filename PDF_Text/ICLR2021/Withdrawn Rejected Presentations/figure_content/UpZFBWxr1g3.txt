Figure 1: The structure of (a) Sequential layers (b) Sequential layers with added (residual) skipconnection (c) Sequential layers with added skip connection by network morphism. Solid lines denoteforward process, including added skip connection. Dashed line denotes the added skip connection bynetwork morphism. The hexagons denote the inputs of layer Ln .
Figure 2: The sketch map of adding skip connections through hill climbing strategy steps. The figurecontains a simplified transformer which only has three encoder and decoder layers. At each step,new skip connections are searched and added to the current model structure. Dashed lines denote theskip connections added by network morphism. The three kinds of skip connections are added to thetransformer in the figure.
Figure 3: The figure of skip connection architecture trained in IWSLTâ€™14. Dashed lines denote theskip connections added by network morphism.
