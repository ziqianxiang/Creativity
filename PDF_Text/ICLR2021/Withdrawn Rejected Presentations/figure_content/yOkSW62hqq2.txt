Figure 1: A schematic overview of the training stage and inference stage of our ECD. In the trainingphase, the teacher network is automatically generated by taking the student as the reference, and thenboth networks are merged by adding dense feature connections and co-trained from scratch. In theinference phase, in order to obtain the prediction (p), only the student network is needed which issimply split from the teacher.
Figure 2: Visualization of object embeddings for the student, the student with ECD connections, andthe teacher, by using T-SNE. Results are obtained based on CIFAR-10 with ReSNet44.
Figure 3: The detailed structure diagram of dense feature connections in BasicBlock and Bottleneckof ResNets, where DAConv refers to the dynamic additive convolution.
Figure 4: Comparison on the Grad-CAM++ (Chattopadhyay et al. (2018)) visualization resultsbetween the features of the student, the student with ECD connections, and the teacher network.
