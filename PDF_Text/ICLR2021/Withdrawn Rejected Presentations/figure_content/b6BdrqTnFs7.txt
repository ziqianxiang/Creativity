Figure 1: Examples of gSCAN dataset. The dataset evaluates compositional generalization ability ingrounded instruction learning. The agent needs to understand command and the environment to takesequence of actions. Training and test data have different distributions and tasks require differentkinds of compositional generalization. Please refer to Section 5 for more details.
Figure 2: Flow charts for core part of each module in the proposed approach. Command module andgrounding module are based on attention mechanism as the main architecture, and prediction moduleconcatenates inputs and use feed-forward network. More details can be found in Algorithm 1.
Figure 3: Bar graph of accuracy results. Seq2seq and GECA are from Ruis et al. (2020). Semanticis from Kuo et al. (2020). The results shows that the proposed approach can effectively address mostof the tasks, and task G is analyzed in discussion section.
