Figure 1: (Left) Average performance on the GLUE validation set across different target sparsity rates forthe different methods. (Right) Number of groups where all of the parameters in the group are fully zero forstructured vs. non-structured diff pruning at 0.5% target sparsity. We group based on each matrix/bias vector,resulting in 393 groups in total.
Figure 3: Percentage of modified parameters attributable to each layer for 5 different runs of SST-2 at 0.5%target sparsity. The layers are ordered from earlier to later (i.e. the embedding layer is shown at the top). Thex-axis for each plot goes from 0% to 20%.
