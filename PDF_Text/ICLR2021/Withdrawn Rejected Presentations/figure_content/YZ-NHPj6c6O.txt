Figure 1: Illustration of an LSBD representation with respect to the decompositionG = S O(2) × SO(2) for the windmill example, 3D model by (Poly). The action of G on the realworld is decomposed as two independent transformations: the rotation of the windmill with respectto a vertical axis and the rotation of the blades. The inference function h : X → Z maps imagesinto Z = R2 ㊉ R2. On Z, the action of G is the independent rotation of each vector subspace. Theaction of G on ZG = S 1 × S 1 ⊆ Z is regular.

Figure 3: Example images from each of the datasets used. Each image corresponds to an exampledata point for a combination of two factors, e.g. color and orientation. The factors change horizon-tally and vertically and the boundaries of each dataset example are periodic.
