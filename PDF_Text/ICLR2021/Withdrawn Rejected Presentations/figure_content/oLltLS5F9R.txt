Figure 1: Illustration for normalization methods on graph. Node features are normalized at fourlevels: (a) Node-wise; (b) Adjacency-wise; (c) Graph-wise; and (d) Batch-wise. Similarly the fournormalization methods can be extended to normalize edge features as shown in (e), (f), (g), and (h).
Figure 2: Learnt weight distributions of normalization methods along with layers on different tasks.
Figure 3: Sample images of the SROIE dataset. Four entities are highlighted in different colors.
Figure 4: Training loss and test result of GatedGCN on CLUSTER, PATTERN and TSP vs. thenumber of steps, with different normalization methods.
Figure 5: Training loss and test result of GatedGCN on CIFAR, MNIST and ZINC vs. the numberof steps, with different normalization methods.
