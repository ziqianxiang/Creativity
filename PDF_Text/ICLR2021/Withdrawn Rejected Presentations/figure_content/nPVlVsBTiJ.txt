Figure 4: Il lustration of gradient regularization (4) in the binary classification setting. The lighterline represents classification boundary for original model with large gradients, and the darker linerepresents classification boundary of the smoothed model. The symbols indicate the classification bythe original model: a single red circle is very close to many blue stars. The smoothed model has asmoother classification boundary which flips the classification of the outlier.
Figure 5: Il lustration of performing the iterative model update (15) for 8 timesteps in the binaryclassification setting. The dashed black line represents our decision boundary. The blue line representsour current classification model. The blue stars and red circles represent our predicted classes usingthe current model iteration. Consider the datapoint at x = -0.5. In the initial model f0, theadversarial distance is ≈ 0.10. In model f5, the adversarial distance is increased to ≈ 0.35.
