Figure 1: The architecture of RoeNet. RoeNet takes the current conserved quantity ujn and its directneighbors, ujn-1 and ujn+1, as the input, and outputs the next conserved quantity ujn+1. The ResBlockhas the same architecture as in He et al. (2016) only with the 2D convolution layers replaced by linearlayers. The numbers in the parentheses are output dimensions of each Resblock.
Figure 2: Results of solving an one component linear hyperbolic PDE. Left: Results of RoeNet;Middle: Comparisons ; Right: Errors compared with groundtruth. Notice the contrast between thesmall training region (dark blue) and the large future predictions (rainbow color).

Figure 4: Riemann problem with three components and a linear (row 1) / non-linear (row 2) fluxfunction. (a), (b), and (c) plot the prediction results using RoeNet and Roe solver, and exact solutionsof the three components u(1), u(2), and u(3) respectively.
Figure 5: Results of 2D wave. Left: Heatmap of the 2D wave in different. Note that the blue part isthe time range of training data, while the larger rainbow part are predicted by RoeNet; Middle andright: predicted results (rainbow) and ground truth(blue) at t = 0.2 and t = 0.4 respectively. Theperfect match shows high accuracy of RoeNet.
