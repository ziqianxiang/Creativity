Figure 1: An example Vietoris-Rips filtration with its persistence diagram. We only add convex hullswhen points are pairwise € apart, so there is a hole at € = 1 whilst the diagonals of the square are notclose enough to fill the hole in. This hole can be seen as a point at (1, 1.42) in the 1-PH persistencediagram.
Figure 2: Our algorithm successfully clustered the persistence diagrams, finding cluster centresthat represent the topology of the datasets. The cluster centres have zero, one, or two significantoff-diagonal points, representing zero, one, or two holes in the datasets.
Figure 3: Heatmaps showing average number of iterations for fuzzy clustering of persistence diagrams(left) and the weighted FreChet mean computation (right) to converge. Convergence of the FCMalgorithm is determined when the cost function is stable to within ±0.5%. Convergence experimentswere carried out on randomly generated persistence diagrams with three repeats.
Figure 4: Cubic structures (top) and carbon allotropes (bottom). Our algorithm can cluster transformedlattice structures where comparable geometric algorithms fail.
