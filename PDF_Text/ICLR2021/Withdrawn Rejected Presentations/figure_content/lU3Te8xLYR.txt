Figure 1: The NN architecture of our method on one noisy image of channel C (=1 or 3). Boxes representthe hidden layers with their channel numbers indicated on the bottom. Arrows of different colors stand foroperations defined by the legends. Specifically, Bconv stands for the Bayesian convolution operation, where theweights are random variables in the form of (19).
Figure 2: PSNR over iterations of different methods for Gaussian white noise removal on the natural image“F16” in Set9. Our method is more stable to the iteration number than the other three in terms of PSNR value.
