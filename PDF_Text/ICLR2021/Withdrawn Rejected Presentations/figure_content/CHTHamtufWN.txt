Figure 4: Sequential IRM projec-tion of distributions, where q+ =arg min Dkl(p∣∣9-) + Dkl(p∣∣9*)R(q) = R(q*)+∆qT Vq R(q*)we can compute the new distribution as∆q*	= arg min DklS* +∆q∣∣q-)∆qs.t.	∆qTVqR(q*) ≤and thenp+ = q* + ∆q*Or alternativelyp*, q* = argminDKL(p||q-) + DKL(p||q)p,qs.t.	VqR(q) = 0and thenq+ = p*Or more simplyq+ = arg min DKL(p||q-) + DKL(p||q*)	(22)pThis last equation, shows how the new distribution is the intersection of the optimal distribution
