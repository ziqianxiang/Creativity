Figure 1:	(A) Architecture of FsNet. (B) and (C) are the weight-predictor networks for the selectionand reconstruction layers, respectively.
Figure 2:	Comparison among FsNet, supervised CAE, and Diet Network for mean training andtesting accuracies over the epochs. For the neural-network-based approaches, we set the modelparameters to b = 10 and K = 10. (See all the experimental results in Figure 5).
Figure 3:	Comparison among the proposed FsNet and existing supervised CAE approaches in termsof the mean test reconstruction error over the epochs. (See the appendix for all the data results).
Figure 5:	CompariSon among FSNet, SuperviSed CAE, and Diet Network in termS of mean trainingand teSting accuracieS over the epochS. For the neural-network-baSed approacheS, we Set the modelparameterS to b = 10 and K = 10.
Figure 6:	Comparison between the proposed FsNet and existing supervised CAE approaches interms of the mean test reconstruction error over the epochs.
Figure 7: Comparison between the proposed FsNet and supervised CAE and Diet Network in termsof the mean test classification accuracy over the epochs on metagenome dataset. The performanceof the FsNet and Diet Network is more stable than the supervised CAE.
