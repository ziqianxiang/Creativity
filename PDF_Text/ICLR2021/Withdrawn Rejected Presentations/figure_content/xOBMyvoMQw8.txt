Figure 1:	Sampling from Gaussian targetters; e.g., if uniform SG uses minibatch size b, then one can use a smaller minibatch size (e.g. M+^)for EWSG to ensure both algorithms consume the same number of gradient calls per iteration andhence run the same number of iterations. See Sec. H.3 for more empirical studies on this.
