Figure 1: Given a LOS (i.e. ω0, atier-zero LOS), the corresponding tier-1 LOSs are ω1,1, ω1,2, ω1,3. Similarly,its tier-2 LOSs are ω2,1, ω2,2, ω2,3.
Figure 2: (a) Phase portrait of a two-dimensional objective surface, ω0 and ω1 are two SEPs; (b) A demon-stration of the DSP method on the same objective. Black arrows represent the DSP path, blue vectors representforward search steps, and red vectors represent calibration steps.
Figure 3: (a) Loss progress on the training and testing set of MNIST during a DSP-TT(full gradient) search.
Figure 4: Sensitivity test on ρ1 an ρ2. X-axis: increment rate of ρ1; Y-axis: ρ2; Z-axis: (a) Running iterationswhen all exit points are reached. (b) Average ρ1 when each exit point is reached. (c) Average distance from thesearch origin when each exit point is reached.
