Figure 1: (Left) Input images (first row), reconstructions from an autoencoder (AE, second row) andfrom EBAE (third row). AE and EBAE are trained on MNIST. (Right) Distribution of reconstructionerrors for inliers (CIFAR10) and outliers (the other curves).
Figure 2: AE and EBAE trained on a bi-modal distribution.
Figure 3: Reconstruction errors of MNISTnot9and MNIST9. The error bars denote 80-percentilearound the means.
