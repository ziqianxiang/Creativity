Figure 1: Minibatch-size dependence of the test accuracy (left) and the convergence time (right) foreach fixed value of α in C1.
Figure 2: Minibatch-size dependence of the test accuracy and the convergence time for each fixedvalue of α in F1 and C2.
Figure 3: Comparison between the effects of reducing the minibatch size B with α = 1 and of in-creasing α with B = 5000. The longitudinal axis and the horizontal axis represent the test accuracyand the convergence time, respectively. Circle data points (reducing B with α = 1) correspond toB = 5000, 3000, 2000, 1000, 900, 800, 700, 600, 500, 400, 300, 200, 100 from left to right. Trian-gle data points (increasing α with B = 5000) correspond to α = 1, 2, . . . , 11 for F1 and C1, andα= 1,2, . . . , 7 for C2, from left to right.
