Figure 1: The solution to u00 + 4u = 0 with u(0) = u(π∕2) = 0 at iterations (from left to right) 1,100 and 2500. At the last iteration RMSE = 6.52e-4 and PSNR = 28.84.
Figure 2: The solution to u00 + λu = 0 with u(0) = u(π) = 0 at iterations 1, 500 and 1000. Theassociated eigenvalues are λ = 70 ± 53, 5.5 ± 0.5, 1 ± 0.03. Note that the solution is up to a sign.
Figure 3: Left panel: eigenfunctions for M = 3. Right panel: eigenfunctions for M = 4 are shownon the left and the convergence of the eigenvalues are shown on the right. Clearly the convergenceof the functions are un (x) =sin(nx), λn= n2, up to a sign.
Figure 4: The solution to the 2D Laplace eigevalue problem, with M = 1 at iterations (from left toright) 1, 100 and 1000.
Figure 5: The solution to the 2D Laplace eigenvalue problem for M = 4. The Iterations 1, 100, 1000are shown from top to bottom, for each of the 4 eigenfunctions.
Figure 6: Free-form domain results for M = 1 excluding points in the right half circles. Left: Theoutcome of the proposed algorithm inferred in the full rectangle. The solution in the missing domainseems to be a smooth extrapolation. Middle: error from the full ground truth |u - full(ugt)|. Thecolorbar is referred only to this column. Right: Ground Truth. It is clear that the error is condensedinto the missing domain, where the information is missing.
Figure 7: Inverse power method. Left: Approximated eigenfunction, Middle: error |ugt - u|. Right:convergence of the eigenvalue. λ = 2.02, RMSE=8.76e-3, PSNR=20.57, SSIM=0.99Table 3: Dimension= 2, Eigenfunction Error AnalysisM	Mean PSNR(per ef.)	Mean SSIM(per ef.)

Table 5 showsthe performance of the proposed algorithm compared with the inverse power method. Better resultsare obtained in almost all quantitative measures. Furthermore, the inverse power method finds onlya single eigenpair, while the proposed method outputs the M smallest eigenpairs. Although it ispossible to calculate more eigenpairs based on the previous one via orthogonality constraints, anundesired accumulated error may emerge.
