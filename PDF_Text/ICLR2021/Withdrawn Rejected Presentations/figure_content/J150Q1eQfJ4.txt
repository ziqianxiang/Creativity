Figure 6: Ground truth (left column), predictions (centre) and absolute difference (right) after 20time-step and two initial droplets. Values in metres [video].
Figure 7: Ground truth (left column), predictions (centre) and absolute difference (right) after 20time-step and four initial droplets. Values in metres [video].
Figure 8: Ground truth (left) and predictions (right) for simulations in a channel with a suddenexpansion. The initial condition is a droplet placed at the middle of the narrower segment. Values inmetres.
