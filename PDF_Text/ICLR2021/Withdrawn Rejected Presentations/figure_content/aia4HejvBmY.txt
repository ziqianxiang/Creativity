Figure 1: Architecture of WildfireNet3.3	Input DataTopography, weather, and available fuels are major contributor to fire growth (Estes et al., 2017).
Figure 2: An example of preprocessing wildfire perimeter. (a) A fire perimeter is plotted. (b) Fireperimeter is shaded in to create a binary map.
Figure 3: State of the pixel. Green pixel indicates current pixel and red pixels indicate surround-ing/neighboring pixels that contribute to the state of the current pixel5 ResultsAs shown in Figure 4(a,c), the output of WildfireNet shows a probabilistic distribution of fires oc-curring at each pixel. If the model is confident that there is a fire in a certain pixel, it will assigna low score on the pixel. The model also projects how fire will spread in the future. For example,in the Mad River Complex fire, there are two major fire bodies. WildfireNet predicts the fire willexpand at the bottom of the left body and no change will occur on the right body. In fact, in thecomparison between the current day to the next day, it shows that the actual fire of the next day didnot expand elsewhere except at the bottom of the left body. Moreover, in the Rey fire, the modelpredicts the fire will enlarge on the right side of the boundary, whereas, not so much on the left side.
