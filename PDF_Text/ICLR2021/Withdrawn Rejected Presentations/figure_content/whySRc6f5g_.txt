Figure 1: Comparison of the architecture of the different generative models for time series data. Theused loss functions are depicted in lilacs Xs, Xs and Xt, Xt denotes the static and temporal datarespectively. X1 and X2 are time series from two different classes.
Figure 2:	Comparison of the real (depicted in green) and generated (depicted in orange) datasetwith PCA. Each row corresponds to a specific dataset and each column to a method. The resultsare presented in the following order (top to bottom): ItalyPowerDemand, TwoLeadECG, Yoga,DistalPhalanxTW and FreezerRegularTrain.
Figure 3:	Illustration of the real and generated time series by ClaRe-GAN, RCGAN, C-RNN-GANand TimeGAN for the Yoga dataset. The time series are depicted in black. The red line presents anexample time-series for each subplot. For the conditional GANs, ClaRe-GAN and RCGAN, and thereal dataset we visualize the time series of each class separately.
