Figure 1: Comparison of Top-1 Accuracy on CIFAR-10/100.
Figure 2: ProbMask comfortably beats state-of-the-art methods in all sparsity regions. Notably, the gap comesup to 5% at 98% sparsity and 10% at 99% sparsity. ProbMask obtains a smaller sparse network with comparableaccuracy and FLOPs, still achieving state-of-the-art result on accuracy-vesus-FLOPs curve.
