Figure 1: Learning performance during first set of experiments on the MNIST Dataset where Mi wasvaried. Metrics were evaluated on a validation set. Subfigure (a) shows the loss, and (b) shows theaccuracy. The metrics were averaged over all the nodes.
Figure 2: Learning performance during second set of experiments on the MNIST Dataset where theDNN is trained on locally biased datasets. Metrics were evaluated on a validation set. Subfigure (a)shows the loss, and (b) shows the accuracy. The metrics were averaged over all the nodes.
Figure 3: Learning performance during last set of experiments on the MNIST Dataset where replypackets are dropped. Metrics were evaluated on a validation set. Subfigure (a) shows the loss, and (b)shows the accuracy. The metrics were averaged over all the nodes.
