Figure 1: (a) The forward RG transformation splits out decimated features at different scales. (b)The inverse RG transformation generates the fine-grained image from latent variables.
Figure 2: Subplot (a) shows the side view of the network. Green/YelloW blocks denote the disentan-glers/deCimators, which are bijective maps. Subplot (b) shows the top-down view of the network.
Figure 4: Subplot (a) shows the progressive generation of images during the inverse RG. Subplot(b) shows some receptive fields of latent variables from low level to high level. The strength ofeach receptive field is rescaled to one for better visualization. Subplot (c) shows the statistics of thereceptive fields, strength.
