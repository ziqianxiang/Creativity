Figure 1: There is an infinite number of ways to partition a distribution in two subsets, Xin and Xoutsuch that PX(Xin) = 0.95. Here, We show several choices for a standard Gaussian PX = N(0,1).
Figure 2: Illustration of different density-based methods applied to a particular one-dimensionaldistribution PX. Outliers are in red and inliers are in blue. The thresholds are picked so that inliersinclude 95% of the mass. In Figure 2b, inliers are considered as the points with density above thethreshold Î» > 0 while in Figure 2c, they are the points whose log-density are in the -interval aroundthe negentropy -H (PX).
Figure 3: Illustration of the change of variables formula and how much the application of a bijectioncan affect the density of the points considered in a one-dimensional case. In Figures 3a and 3c, pointsX with high density PX (x) are in blue and points with low density PX (x) are in red.
Figure 4: Illustration of the one-dimensional case version of a Knothe-Rosenblatt rearrangement,which is just the application of the cumulative distribution function CDFp* on the variable x.
Figure 5:	Illustration of how we can modify the space with an invertible function so that each point xfollows a predefined score. In Figures 5a and 5d, points X with high density PX (x) are in blue andpoints with low density PX (x) are in red.
Figure 6:	Illustration of the norm-dependent rotation, a locally-acting bijection that allows us to swaptwo different points while preserving a uniform distribution (as a volume-preserving function).
Figure 7:	We illustrate how, given xin and xOut in a uniformly distributed hypercube [0, 1]D, onecan modify the space such that f (rOt) shown in Figure 6 can be applied without modifying thedistribution.
Figure 8:	Application of a transformation using the bijection in Figure 6 to a standard Gaussiandistribution N(0, I2), leaving it overall invariant.
