Figure 1: Left: Visualization of the log barrier constraint applied to network parameters quantized inrange [-2, 2]. See §3.3 for an approximated tail bound on possible overflow. Right: μ-law encodingvs. FP8(1-5-2) and FP8(1-4-3) for all possible values on interval [-2, 2]. μ-law maintains higherprecision at concentrated small values.
