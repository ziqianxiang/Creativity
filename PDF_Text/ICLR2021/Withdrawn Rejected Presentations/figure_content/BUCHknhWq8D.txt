Figure 1: Adversarial sam-ple is from a different classand is more similar to thetest than dictionary atomsfrom the same class.
Figure 2: Recovery performance curves for JOBS and Bagging (with various L,K) versus `1 min-imization. Left 1-4: The number of measurements are m = 75, 100 from left to right. Left 5-6:Phase diagrams of JOBS, Bagging. Noise level is set to SNR = 0 dB.
Figure 3: Reconstruction with adversarial sample with sim-ilar occlusion as test. Top: adversarial sample (a) and dic-tionary examples. Mid-Bot.: The test image (b) and recon-structions. `1 favors (a). Bagging solutions contain energyfrom (c), far from ground truth. Bolasso has visible com-ponents from (a). JOBS successfully avoids (a) as sparsityregularization increases (yellow box). Ground truth PSNRscalculated with respect to b0 , the top 100 rows of (b).
Figure 4: Reconstruction with adversarial sample with thesame alignment condition as the test. Top: Adversarial sam-ple (a) and examples in dictionary. Bot.: Reconstructions:`1 returns similarly to (a). Bagging solutions are too denseand therefore blurred. Bolasso contains large energy from(a). JOBS performs the best: a clear image with more than90% from the correct class.
