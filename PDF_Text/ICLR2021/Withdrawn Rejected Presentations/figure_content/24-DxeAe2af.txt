Figure 1: 201×55 pixel pileup image. Feature rows are labeled by brackets and RGB channels arelabeled by curly braces. Reference rows are encoded in R channel by base A: 250, G: 180, T: 100, C:30, N: 0. Coverage rows are encoded in RG channels by the number of mapped reads covering eachposition. Reads are encoded in RGB channels by base types, base quality, and strand directionalitypositive: 70, negative: 240.
Figure 2: CNV-Net architecture. CNV-Net employs a six-layer convolutional neural network for de-tecting copy number variations from DNA sequencing data. Descriptions under each layer indicate:type of layer, dimension of layer in parenthesis (input layer: height × width × channels, convolu-tional layer: height × width × filters, and fully connected layer: nodes), kernel size in brackets. Themodel predicts the probability of deletion (“DEL”), duplication (“DUP”), and false positive (“FP”)breakpoint presence in each input pileup image.
