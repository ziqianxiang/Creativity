Figure 1: Identification of structural roles and aggregation of node features over the whole graph.
Figure 2: Aggre-gation of node fea-tures over structuralclassesâ€¢	Compared to the structural embedding presented in Donnat et al.
Figure 3: Molecules drawn for a bioinformatics dataset. The colors represent structural classesidentified by our algorithm in figures 3a, 3b and 3c compared to the output of GraphWave in figures3d, 3e and 3f. To compare the structural classes output by the two algorithms, 3a and 3d are the samemolecule, 3b and 3e also and 3c and 3f are the same molecule. To obtain comparable results, we runour algorithm and output the structural classes for each molecule. For each molecule, we then runGraphWave with the number of classes from StructAgg being set as input of GraphWave.
