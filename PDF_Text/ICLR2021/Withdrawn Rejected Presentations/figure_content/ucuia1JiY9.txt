In contrastto existing constrained deep clustering approaches, CVaDE uncovers the underlying distribution ofthe data, resulting in the ability to generate new samples, perform Bayesian model validation andoutlier detection. With the integration of domain knowledge, we show that our model can drive theclustering algorithm towards the partitions of the data sought by the practitioners, achieving state-of-the-art constrained clustering performance in real-world and complex data sets. Additionally,our model proves to be robust to noisy constraints as it can efficiently include uncertainty into theclustering preferences. As a result, the proposed model can be applied to a variety of applicationswhere the difficulty of obtaining labelled data prevents the use of fully supervised algorithms.
Figure 4: Left: PCA decomposition of CVaDE learned embedded space with representative samplesfrom the dataset, right: baseline VaDE embedded spaceImpact of Constraints In order to try to understand how the number of constraints providedimpacts the performance of CVaDE, we performed an experiment using the heart echo dataset whereprogressively more and more constraints were provided to the model during training. Figure 5demonstrates that the clustering performance of CVaDE improves as more pairwise constraints areprovided. This trend continues until 5000 pairwise constraints are provided (requiring 0.35% of thedataset to be labeled), at which point the performance reaches a plateau.
