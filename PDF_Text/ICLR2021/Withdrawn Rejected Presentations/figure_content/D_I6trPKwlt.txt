Figure 1: An illustrative example of compositional hierarchy in a visual scene graph. (a) is anoriginal image and (b) is a hierarchical structure of visual scene graph for the image.
Figure 3: Left : An original image corresponding to the scene graphs on the right. Right : Poolingresults on each graph in each layer. Same color of nodes are meant to be mapped to the samecoarsened node in the pooled layer. Since DiffPool coarsens the graph with soft assignment matrix,we selected a top-1 coarsened node for each original node for visualization. The grey colored nodesin layer-2 are left-over coarsened nodes that were not chosen as top-1 by any original nodes. Somesignificant node labels are specified to demonstrate different properties between the methods.
