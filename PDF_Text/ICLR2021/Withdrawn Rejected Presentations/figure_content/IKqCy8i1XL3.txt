Figure 2: All reward curves are averaged over 3 random seeds, 10 episodes for each seed. Figure (a)and (d) show the averaged normalized reward across 20 Atari games for A2C and 18 Atari games forPPO. The rest four figures show the reward curves for two individual games, in which SVIB performsbetter than vanilla A2C and PPO. The details of other games can be found in Appendix C.2.
Figure 3: MI in Pong5.2	Compare Our Method with VIBWe implement VIB based on A2C in RL. We name this algorithm ”A2C-VIB”. We have spent sometime to tune the parameter β for VIB, but we found that the default β = 0.001 in (Alemi et al., 2016)works better than others. So we keep β = 0.001 for VIB in all games.
Figure 4: All curves are averaged over 3 random seeds, 10 episodes for each seed. Figure (a) showsthe averaged normalized reward across 20 Atari games. The rest two figures show the reward for 2example games reporting SVIB’s superior performance over VIB. Other individual games can befound in Appendix C.3. The β in SVIB is as written in the figures, while it is fixed at 0.001 in VIB.
