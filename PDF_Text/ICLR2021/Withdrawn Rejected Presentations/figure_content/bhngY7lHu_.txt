Figure 1: N-step target errors. Top row is tabular settings, bottom is SAC. X-axis is off-policyness,quantified by policy age that is described in the beginning of Sec 5.
Figure 2:	The X axis is the policy age, and the y axis is the difference between μ and ∏, whichgrows approximately linearly as the policy age grows.
Figure 3:	n* and exponential fitting. Note that We only evaluate error for 128 steps, so the value ofn* may be clipped to a maximum of 128.
Figure 4: Training curve on continuous control benchmark. We report top 4 in a total 8 runs.
Figure 5: Comparison on Atari 2600 games. For both fixed 3-step and adaptive n-step, we report theagent that obtained highest reward during training. The figure is smoothed by moving average withlength 10 to improve readability.
