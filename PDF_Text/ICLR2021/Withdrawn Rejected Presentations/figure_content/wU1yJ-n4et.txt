Figure 1: TWo problems of SSDA and two different approaches. (a) Inter-domain discrepancyrepresents the discrepancy of sample distributions between a source domain and a target domain. (b)Intra-domain discrepancy indicates the discrepancy of sample distributions within the target domain.
Figure 2: An overview of the Pair-based Self-Distillation (PSD) (Section 3.2). We use a featureextractor and a classifier trained in the pre-training stage (Section 3.1). PSD consists of a student-set generation procedure and a SamPle-to-sample distillation procedure. In the former, the modelgenerates pseudo-labels of DTU and completes Dts. In the latter, the model is trained with generatedteacher-student pairs. In every N steps, pseudo-labels are updated using the latest model. We omitfeature normalization, temperature scaling, and softmax operation for simplicity.

Figure 5: t-SNE visualization on Office-Home. The left column visualizes the source and targetembeddings together. The middle and the right column visualizes the source and the target embed-dings, respectively. The first 30 classes are visualized.
