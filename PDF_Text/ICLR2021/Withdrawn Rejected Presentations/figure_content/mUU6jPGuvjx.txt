Figure 1: Proposed paired objective: For training examples that share substructure, we propose anadditional training objective relating their latent decisions; S in the shaded gray area. In this figure,since the outputs of the substructure should be the same, S would encourage equality between them.
Figure 2: Templated Construction of Paired Examples: Constructed paired examples can help inindirectly enforcing consistency between different training examples (ยง4.2.1).
