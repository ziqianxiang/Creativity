Figure 1: Features learned by models trained for MNIST using TRADES (Zhang et al., 2019) train-ing, where the clean samples (points) are colored by predicted classes and the adversarial examples(triangles) are colored by (a) true labels or (b) predicted classes.
Figure 2: Robust accuracy vs. PGD with different perturbation strength (). Note that here MATemploys the total loss function.
