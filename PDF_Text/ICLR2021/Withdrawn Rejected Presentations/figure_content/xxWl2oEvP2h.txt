Figure 2: The core idea behind our Rewriting-by-Generating framework, where nodes denotecustomers with color representing regions, and solid lines denote routes.
Figure 3: Comparison between RL and adjacent selection. The "Ratio" metric is the ratio ofperformance to the best performance obtained by these two strategies minus one. In order for clarity,it is plotted in log mode. A rollout step is a rewriting step, i.e., we divide-merge-regenerate thesolution once. We run 100 rollout steps for each instance at evaluation.
Figure 4: Statistics of the rewriter at different rollout steps.
Figure 5: Performance on different data distributions.
Figure 6: Ablation study on distance factor(beta) for clusteringTo measure the influence of the two partition features, we use a combination of them, diE,j + βdiP,j , to representthe distance between customer i and j , where β is a hyperparameter. The initialization is obtained via theclassical K-means algorithm(Krishna & Murty, 1999; Alsabti et al., 1997) and the results are shown in Fig 6.
Figure 7: Visualization on initial and final solutions of different scales. The big red point at the centerrepresents the depot, and each blue point represents a customer. Routes with the same color are in thesame region. For clarity in visualization, we omit the line segment from depot to the first customerand from the final customer back to depot for each route.
