Figure 1: Examples of benign images on which our approach using Ito processes abstains frommaking a decision while the original ResNet model makes a decision despite high uncertainty. Thefirst image is found by Ito process ensemble to be confusing between binoculars and cannon, thesecond between a radiator and a projector, the third between a trench-coat and bicycle, and the lastone between Stove and coffee-pot. This uncertainty in Ito ensemble resembles human judgement.
Figure 2: The accuracy of our stochastic Ito ensemble with a diffusion term corresponding to ω =0.2 (left) and ω = 0.4 (right) on CIFAR-10 compares favorably with Madry’s Robustness Toolboxusing the L2 norm for different values of .
Figure 3: The accuracy of our stochastic Ito ensemble on CIFAR-10 compares favorably withMadry’s Robustness Toolbox using the L∞ norm. (left) ω = 0.2 (right) ω = 0.4.
Figure 4: (left) The impact of the number of models and inferences on the sum of correct outcomesand abstentions for our stochastic Ito ensemble with ω = 0.4. (right) Diffusion with different valuesof ω in stochastic Ito ensemble vs. PGD accuracy under the L∞ norm.
Figure 5: The accuracy of our stochastic Ito ensemble with ω=0.2 on ImageNet compares favorablywith Robustness Toolbox using the L2 norm (left) and the L∞ norm (right) for different values of .
