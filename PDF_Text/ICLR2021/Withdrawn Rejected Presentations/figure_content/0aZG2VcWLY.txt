Figure 1: Five sample gammatone filters used as kernels with center frequencies located at approxi-mately (a) 82 Hz, (b) 118 Hz, (c) 158 Hz, (d) 203 and (e) 253 Hz, respectively.
Figure 2: Reconstruction of a sample snippet in an experiment with 2000 kernels. (a) the inputsnippet, extended with zero padding to accommodate future spikes; (b) Spike trains of all kernelsobtained at a low threshold and refractory period displayed as a raster plot with time (y-axis) andindex of the gammatone kernels in increasing order of center frequencies (x-axis), and (c) the resultingreconstruction. This is an almost perfect reconstruction with a 32.7DB SNR at 1146 kHz spikerate of the ensemble. Subsequently spikes were deleted greedily (see text) to obtain reconstructionsat lower spike rates. (d) Resulting spike pattern of the ensemble at 88.4kHz and (e) resultingreconstruction with SNR 19.7DB. Likewise, (f) spike pattern of the ensemble at 17.64kHz and (g)resulting reconstruction with SNR of 9DB. Time scale on left apply to all plots. It is noteworthy thatin (d)&(f) spikes of the higher frequency kernels ended up deleted in the culling process.
Figure 3: Comprehensive result of an experiment with 2000 kernels reconstructing 1000 soundsnippets. The graphs show scatter plots of reconstructions (each dot represents a reconstruction) withspike-rate of the ensemble (x-axis) against corresponding SNR value of the reconstructions (y-axis)(a) Scatter plot of reconstructions up to 441 kHz spike rate and (b) zoom in of the same graph for upto 89kHz. Solid line represents the average SNR of all reconstructions at a given spike rate.
Figure 4: Average SNR values plotted as functions of sampling rate (spike rate for our frameworkand number of atoms chosen per second of the snippet duration in case of COMP/CMP).
