Figure 1: We merge nine fine-grained sub-categories of dog into one class as a new coarse-grainedlabel “dog” for training. (a) and (b): T-SNE visualization of feature vectors extracted from three outof nine fine-grained classes of dogs in miniImageNet using Prototypical Network and our proposedmethod, respectively. (c): Evaluation results on the fine-grained Stanford Dogs dataset (Khoslaet al., 2011).
Figure 2: A brief flow diagram of our model at training stage. Our framework consists of twomain tasks. The red arrow is metric-based meta-learning, while blue arrow depicts instance-levelcontrastive learning. At meta-test stage, only the main encoder Fθ(∙) is held for evaluation underfew-shot setting.
Figure 3: Four types of views learned by our method: (a) Local-to-local, (b) Global-to-local, (c)One-dimension Scaling, and (d) Proportional zooming.
Figure 4: Training errors (left) and test errors (right) on miniImageNet. The auto-view modulesignificantly decreases test errors, while keeping not overfit to the training set.
