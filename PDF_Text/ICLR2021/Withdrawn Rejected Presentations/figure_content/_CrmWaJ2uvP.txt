Figure 12: DYRNN3 results on the Thermic dataset. Since the system has two different inputs, themodel provides one transfer function each.
Figure 13: Simulation used for the generation of experiment data. It contains a resistor of 2 Ωand a capacitor of 0.1F. Input sequence is the source voltage, while output to predict is the voltagemeasured over the capacitor.

Notice that due to the rounding to 2 significant digits, the differential equationslisted here are unlikely to yield accurate results. Additionally, simplification of these transferfunctions is possible if the poles and zeros of the function match, but this is outside of the scope ofthis work. The transfer functions of the best runs of DYRNN3 are as follows:Circuit:G(s)9.2E - 10s6 -3.2E-7s5+3.6E-5s4 - 0.0021s3 + 0.75s2 + 3.9s + 5.01.6e - 5s4 + 0.03s3 + 0.3s2 + 0.98s + 1.0(28)Heating:-2.9E - 9s7 - 0.04s6 + 0.85s5 + 3.8s4 + 4.5s3 + 2.5s2 + 0.68s + 0.073G(s)3.6s5 + 14.0s4 + 14.0s3 + 6.2s2 + 1.3s + 0.099(29)
