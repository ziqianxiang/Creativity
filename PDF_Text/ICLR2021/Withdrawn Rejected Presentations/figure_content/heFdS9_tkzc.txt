Figure 1: An example of the sentences that con-tain the same entity pair distributed on two plat-forms. The triple (Steve Jobs, Founder, Apple) isa fact in the KBplatforms is prohibited in federated settings. Due to the lack of comparison with Si, previous de-noising methods would mistakenly regard S? as a true positive instance. As a result, S2 is retainedand then poisons the local model in platform 2, which would affect the global model in turn.
