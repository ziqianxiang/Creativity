Figure 1: Metric measurements using low-rank factorization of convolution weights from ResNet18trained on ImageNet. Distribution of singular values are shown for (a) input channel and (b) outputchannel; on multiple convolution layers of ResNet18. The solid and dashed lines correspond to withand without low-rank factorization. The metrics of knowledge gain and mapping condition are alsoshown in (c) and (d) cross all conv layers of ResNet18, respectively.
Figure 2: Metric evaluation of two different optimizers: AdaSe=0.8 and AdaM. Both average knowl-edge gain G(t,') and average mapping condition C(t,') are monitored for duration of all epochtraining of VGG16 on CIFAR10. The evolution of learning rate η(t) are also shown in left. Theplots with different color shades correspond to multiple layers of the network.
