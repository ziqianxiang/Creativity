Figure 1: transport plans between two synthetic distributions with 10-dimensional vectors xe =(x>, z>), ye = (y>, z>), where two-dimensional vectors X 〜 N (μx, Σχ) and y 〜 N (μy, Σy)are true features; and Zx 〜 N(08, I8)and Zy 〜 N(08, Ig) are noisy features. (a) OT betweendistribution x and y is a reference. (b) OT between distribution xe and ye. (c) FROT transport planbetween distribution xe and ye where true features and noisy features are grouped, respectively.

Figure 4: Feature selection results. We average over 50 runs of accuracy (on test set) of SVM trainedwith top k features selected by several methods.
