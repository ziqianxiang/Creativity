Figure 1: Inversion of a simple DNN R2 7→ R2 fit to the “two moons” data shown in Figure 1a.
Figure 2: The state space of the cart pole prob-lem, schematically. Here x ≤ 0 (the cart is leftof the origin), X ≤ 0 (the cart is moving left-ward), θ ≥ 0 (the pole is right of vertical), andθ ≥ 0 (the pole is moving rightward).
Figure 3: Projection of subsets of the domainwhere the wrong action is taken, with the hue ofthe area being proportional to the volume of thewrong sets, divided by the volume of the projec-tion.
Figure 4: An encounter plot showing the optimal action at each (x, y) distance configuration fora fixed angle of approach, indicated by the perpendicular orientation of the red (intruder) aircraft.
Figure 5: The evolution of the cart pole state under a policy which continually accelerates left untilfailure (when θ ≥ n/15), starting from rest, with the cart near the right boundary and the pole nearits right boundary ((x, X, θ, θ) = (2.39,0, -.20,0)).
