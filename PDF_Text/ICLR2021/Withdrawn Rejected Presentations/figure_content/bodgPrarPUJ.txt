Figure 1:	Valid coefficient ranges for Example 1.
Figure 2:	Image classification results on MNIST character recognition data set.
Figure 3:	Image classification results on CIFAR-10 data set.
Figure 4: Random selection of MNIST adversarial examples from Figure 2b. Top to bottom is increasing perturbation size. Left to right are different examples.
Figure 5: Left: Training set error versus epochs. Right: Test set error versus epochs. Note thatthe left and right plots are on different scales. The time per epoch for the MON, unconstrained,LBENγ<∞ and LBENY=5 networks are 14.4, 16.1, 14.9 and 14.8 seconds per epoch respectively.
Figure 6: Approximation accuracy of the Lipschitz bound versus the network width of LBEN fromthe MNIST example. The certified upper bound is YUP and the observed lower bound is γι0w.
Figure 7: LBEN and MON training error versus epochs on CIFAR-10 dataset. The red curves havethe metric set so that Λ = I whereas the blue curves optimize over the metric. The line stylescorrespond to different gain bounds. Note that both MON and LBENγ<∞ achieve zero trainingerror.
