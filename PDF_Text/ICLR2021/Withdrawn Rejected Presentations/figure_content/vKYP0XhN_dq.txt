Figure 1: Comparison between baseline and Sequential TargetingThis training architecture lets the learner pay more focus to the under-represented data by manipu-lating the learning sequence. Sequentially training the learner to be exposed to increasing portionof minority class data benefits the overall performance. Moreover, applying dropout to the layersand implementing EWC during the transfer between tasks proves to help the learner maintain theknowledge acquired from the previous split.
