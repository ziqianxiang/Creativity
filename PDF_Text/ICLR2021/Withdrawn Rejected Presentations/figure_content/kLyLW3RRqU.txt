Figure 1:	Raw Zero-Shot IllustrationContributions: In this article, we try to open up a new perspective on understanding adversarialalgorithms based on evaluating the representation quality of unseen classes based on learned classes.

Figure 3: Visualisation of the DBM results for vanilla classifiers using a topology preserving two-dimensional projection with Isometic Mapping (IsoMap). Each row represents a classifier trainedwith a label excluded whose projection is visualised.
Figure 4: Visualisation of the DBM results for vanilla classifiers using t-Distributed StochasticNeighbour Embedding (t-SNE). Each row represents a classifier trained with a label excluded whoseprojection is visualised.
Figure 5: Visualisation of the DBM results for vanilla classifiers using Multi Dimensional Scaling(MDS). Each row represents a classifier trained with a label excluded whose projection is visualised.
Figure 6: Visualisation of the DBM results for vanilla classifiers using Spectral Embedding (SE).
Figure 7: Histograms of soft-labels (H0 and H) from whiCh the AM is CalCulated. EaCh row showsthe histograms of one Classifier with one Class exCluded. Dark-shaded thinner and light-shadedbroader bins are respeCtively the soft-labels from the ground-truth (H0) from the Classifier trained onall Classes and the soft-labels of the Classifier trained on N - 1 Classes (H0).
Figure 8: Visualisation of Pearson Correlation of Davies-Bouldin Metric (DBM) with Mean L2Score of adversarial attacks (Table 3). Here, the x-axis represents the Mean L2 Scores while they-axis represents the DBM values. Each point represent a DBM value and Mean L2 Score for alabelled class.
Figure 9:	Visualisation of Pearson Correlation of Amalgam MetriC (AM) with Mean L2 SCoreof adversarial attaCks (Table 3). Here, the x-axis represents the Mean L2 SCores while the y-axisrepresents the AM values. EaCh point represent an AM value and Mean L2 SCore for a labelled Class.
Figure 10:	Visualisation of Pearson Correlation of Amalgam MetriC (AM) with ConfidenCe SCoreof adversarial attaCks (Table 10). Here, the x-axis represents the ConfidenCe DifferenCe SCores. InContrast, the y-axis represents the AM values. EaCh point represents an AM value and ConfidenCeDifferenCe SCores for a labelled Class.
