Figure 1: (a) Illustration of an open-set unlabeled data under class-distribution mismatch in semi-supervised learning, i.e., unlabeled data may contain unknown out-of-class samples. (b) Comparisonof median test accuracy under varying proportions of out-of-class samples on the CIFAR-10 +TinyImageNet benchmark with 25 labels per class.
Figure 2: Overview of our proposed framework, OpenCoS. First, our method detects out-of-classsamples based on contrastive representation. The out-of-class samples detected by OpenCoS arefurther utilized via an auxiliary loss with soft-labels generated from the representation, while theremaining in-class samples are used for standard semi-supervised methods. Also, the out-of-classsamples pass through additional batch normalization layers to handle a class-distribution mismatch.
Figure 3: Illustration of soft-label assignments in the CIFAR-10 + TinyImageNet benchmark. Un-labeled out-of-class samples from (a) “gazelle” is assigned with soft-labels of ≈78% confidencefor “deer”, and (b) “pizza” is assigned with almost uniform soft-labels (≈10% of confidence). Thesoft-labels are scaled with the temperature τ = 0.1.
