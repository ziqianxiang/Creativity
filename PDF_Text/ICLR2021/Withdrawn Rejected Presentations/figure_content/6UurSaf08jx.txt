Figure 1: The Subformer. In the graphic above there are four main components: (1) the blueportions, denoted by de are the SAFE (self-attentive factorized embedding) and output projectionlayers. (2) The model layers which are placed at the top and bottom of the model (colored red,denoted by dm). (3) The Sandwich Module, in which we use a wider shared layer to composethe central part of our encoder/decoder. (4) The projection layers, which allow for the interactionbetween the model layers and Sandwich Module despite their different dimensions (colored yellow).
