Figure 1: The key effects of 3D adversarial attacks on point cloud summarized from existing works.
Figure 2: The pipeline of our IF-Defense method. We first pre-process the input point cloud by SOR,and then we learn point cloud restoration via implicit function based optimization. Finally, we sendthe restored point cloud to the classifier. Pert. and Distort. indicate Perturbation and Distortion,while Geo. and Dist. mean Geometry and Distribution.
Figure 3: Comparison of the re-meshing and optimization based IF-Defense. Given the (a) inputpoint cloud, the (b) reconstructed mesh using Marching Cubes according to the implicit field fails tocapture the legs. As a result, the (c) re-sampled point cloud is misclassified as a monitor by PointNet.
Figure 4: The ablation study of the hyper-parameter Î». We show the defense accuracy of four victimmodels against point perturbation attack.
Figure 5: Visualization results of different defense results. The labels under each point cloud are theprediction outputs of the victim models.
