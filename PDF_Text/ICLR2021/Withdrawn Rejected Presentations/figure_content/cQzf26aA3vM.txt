Figure 1: Histogram (frequency distribution) of objective values in the dataset compared to a uniformre-sampling of the dataset from the design space. In every case, re-sampling skews the distribution of scoresto the left, suggesting that there exists a thin manifold of valid designs in the high-dimensional design space,and most of the volume in this space is occupied by low-scoring designs. The distribution of objective valuesin the dataset are often heavy-tailed, for instance, in the case of MoleculeActivity-v0 and Superconductor-v0.
Figure 2: Highly sensitive landscape of the groundtruth objective function in DKittyMorphology-v0. Asmall change in a single dimension of the design-space, for instance, by changing the orientation θ (x-axis) ofthe base of the agent’s front right leg, the performance value (y-axis) of the agent is critically impacted. Theagent's design is the original D'Kitty design and is held constant while varying θ uniformly from 3 π to π.
