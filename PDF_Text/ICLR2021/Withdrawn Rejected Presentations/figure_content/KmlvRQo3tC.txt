Figure 1: LEFT: Gradients generated by few samples can lead to SUboPtimal saddle point (blue).
Figure 2: The t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) analysis for MASP. We use t-SNE to visualize the original representation, and its sample propagated representation. For eachclass, We also visualize its prototype - the mean feature representation of all samples.
