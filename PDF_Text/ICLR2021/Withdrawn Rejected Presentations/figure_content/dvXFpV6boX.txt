Figure 1: Comparison between the architectures of a one-tower model, e.g., reader, and a two-tower model,e.g., retriever, with BERT (Devlin et al., 2019). The one-tower model takes the question and document togetherand jointly processes them throughout all the layers, while the two-tower architecture separately models thequestion and document whose outputs interact only at the inner product space of the final embeddings.
Figure 2: Results of the experiments using DPR. All experiments are done with 1,000 questions sampled fromthe test set of NaturalQuestions.
