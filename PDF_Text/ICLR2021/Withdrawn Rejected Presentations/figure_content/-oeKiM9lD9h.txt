Figure 1: Volumetric receptive field and the proposed optimal separable convolution. (a) The volumetric recep-tive field (RF) of a convolution is the Cartesian product of its (spatial) RF and channel RF. (b) Illustrations ofthe channel connections for conventional, depth separable, and the proposed optimal separable convolutions.
Figure 2: Given channels C1 = C2 = C3 =64, and kernel sizes KH = KW = 5in Equation (2), by setting f0(g1) = 0,f0(K1) = 0. The solution g1 = 8, K1 = 3is a saddle point.
Figure 3: Experimental results on CIFAR10 for the ResNet architecture (best viewed in color). The proposedoptimal separable convolution (o-ResNet) achieves improved (a) accuracy-FLOPs and (b) accuracy-#ParamsPareto-frontiers than both the conventional (ResNet) and depth separable (d-ResNet) convolutions.
