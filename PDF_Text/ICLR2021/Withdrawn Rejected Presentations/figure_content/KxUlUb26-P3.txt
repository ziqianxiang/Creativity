Figure 1: An example of NER with various incidental supervision signals: partial labels (somemissing labels in structured outputs), noisy labels (some incorrect labels), auxiliary labels (labels ofanother task, e.g. named entity detection in the figure), and constraints in structured learning (e.g.
Figure 2: Correlations between informativeness and relative performance improvement for NERwith various inductive signals. On one hand, as shown in (a)-(c), PABI has similar foreshad-owing ability with measures for specific signals. On the other hand, as shown in (d)-(f), PABIcan measure the benefits of mixed inductive signals and compare different types of inductivesignals, which cannot be handled by existing frameworks. For individual inductive signals, thebaselines (gray points) are, i.e. one minus partial rate for partial labels (Cour et al., 2011; Hovy& Hovy, 2012; Liu & Dietterich, 2014; Van Rooyen & Williamson, 2017; Ning et al., 2019), oneminus noisy rate for noisy labels (Angluin & Laird, 1988; Natarajan et al., 2013; Rolnick et al.,2017; Van Rooyen & Williamson, 2017), and entropy normalized mutual information for auxiliarylabels (Bjerva, 2017). For NER with various inductive signals (f) (with all PABI points from (a)-(e)), Pearson’s correlation and Spearman’s rank correlation are 0.92 and 0.93. Note that the relativeimprovement for NER (with informativeness 0.90 but relative improvement 0.70) in auxiliary labels(c) is smaller than expected mainly due to the imbalanced label distribution (88% O among allBIO labels). More discussions about the imbalanced distribution can be found in Appx. A.5.
Figure 3: Correlation between informativeness measures (baselines or the PABI) and relative per-formance improvement (via joint training or pre-training) for cross-domain NER and cross-domainQA. We can see that the correlation between the relative improvement and PABI is strongerthan other baselines. Red results with the PABI which is based on η in Eq. (4); Gray points in-dicate the results with the naive informativeness measure η2; Black points indicate the results withthe vocabulary overlap baseline (Gururangan et al., 2020). The Pearson’s correlation of three in-formativeness measure in the three cases are: 0.96/0.19/-0.85, 1.00/0.88/-0.40, 0.99/0.85/-0.30,indicating the quality of the PABI measure. Similarly, the corresponding Spearman’s rank correla-tion are: 1.00/-0.50/-1.00, 1.00/0.82/-0.30, 1.00/0.82/-0.30.
