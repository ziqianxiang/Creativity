Figure 1: The estimated training losses and test losses as well as the slow-rate (8) and fast-rate (12)PAC-Bayesian bounds on the test loss for two NNs trained on MNIST or Fashion-MNIST. Theshaded regions correspond to two standard deviations. In (a)-(d), we perform training using SGDwithout momentum with a decaying learning rate. In (e)-(f), we use SGD with momentum and afixed learning rate. Further details on the experimental setup are given in Appendix C.
Figure 2: The estimated training losses and test losses as well as the slow-rate (8) and fast-rate (12)PAC-Bayesian bounds on the test loss for two NNs trained on MNIST or Fashion-MNIST. Theseslow-rate and fast-rate PAC-Bayesian bounds essentially coincide with the the single-draw boundsin (9) and (13) respectively. The shaded regions correspond to two standard deviations.
