Figure 1:	Accuracy-ε curve on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. x-axis values denote pixel changes.
Figure 2:	Accuracy-# step curve on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. ε = 8/255, 16/255all ε, PAT-EntM outperforms PAT and TRADES. Moreover, under sufficiently large ε, all accuraciesreach 0, which is another evidence that PAT-EntM is not obfuscating gradients.
