Figure 1: Performance comparisons. (a): The x-axis α defines the spread of eigen-spectrum of ΣS :Si Y 1∕iα ,ti Y 1/i. (b) x-axis is the normalized value of signal strength: ∣∣Σt β * ||/r. (C) X-axisis the model shift measured by γ∕r. Performance with standard error bar is from 40 runs.
Figure 2: (a): The x-axis α defines the spread of eigen-spectrum of ΣS: Si H 1∕iα ,ti H 1/i. (b)x-axis is the normalized value of signal strength: ∣∣Σtβ* k∕r. (c) X-axis is the covariate shift dueto eigenspace shift measured by kUS - UT kF .
Figure 3: The x-axis is noise level σ and y-axis is the excess risk (with approximationerror).
