Figure 1: Schema of the CGRU architecture. Blue arrows represent information coming from theinput at time t, red ones are for the hidden state and green ones for transmissions between the gates.
Figure 2: In figure (a), evolution of the norm of the coupling gate weights during training on UCIHAR dataset, a red point indicates an increased accuracy for the validation set. On figure (b), Epochloss in terms of coupling norm during training on UCI HAR dataset. The first part (rapid decrease)has been approximated with a linear regression. The correlation coefficient is -0.984.
Figure 3: Evolution of the average distance between the positive/negative samples for SGRU andCGRU on more and more noisy test sets.
