Figure 1: The model’s architecture is based on BYOL (Grill et al., 2020). The model receives asinput a pair of products pi andpj. One product is projected through the online network until obtainedthe projector value qθ(z). The other product is projected through the target network until obtainedthe value z0. The projection y of Pi is also used to obtain the predicted category Cpj of Pj with aidof the category predictor hθ . The model is trained on the weights θ by minimizing the objectivefunctions LBY OL, which is the distance between qθ and sg(z0) (where sg means stop-gradient) andthe cross entropy loss LCE between the predicted category cCpj and the category cpj ofPj.
Figure 2: Impact of weighting each loss differently in the performance of the models for the down-stream tasks. The darker the color, the higher the α. For the black line, the encoder is random (i.e.
Figure 3: Results of the experiments. Each graph represents the performance comparison in differentdownstream tasks. The different models are presented the different colors. The x axis representsthe amount of training data. The y axis, depending on the task, represents results using differentmetrics. The y axis depends on the task, represents the metric associated with the task.
