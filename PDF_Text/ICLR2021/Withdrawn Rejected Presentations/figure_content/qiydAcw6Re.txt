Figure 1: The state of U is represented by the state of the work tape, state tape and description (code)tape. The work tape is initialised with a sequence X ∈ Σ*, the code tape with W ∈ W and the statetape with some standard initial state, the smooth relaxation ∆ step of the pseudo-UTM is run for tsteps and the final probability distribution over states is y.

Figure 3: Level sets above the cutoff cannot contain siren local minima of the free energy.
Figure 4: Plot of RLCT estimates for detectA. Shaded region shoWs one standard deviation.
Figure 5: Values of K(h, k) on [0, 1]2 are shown by colour, ranging from blue (zero) to red (0.01).
Figure 6: The UTM. Each of the rectangles are states, and an arrow q → q0 has the followinginterpretation: if the UTM is in state q and sees the tape symbols (on the four tapes) as indicatedby the source of the arrow, then the UTM transitions to state q0 , writes the indicated symbols (or ifthere is no write instruction, simply rewrites the same symbols back onto the tapes), and performsthe indicated movements of each of the tape heads. The symbols a, b, c, d stand for generic symbolswhich are not X .
