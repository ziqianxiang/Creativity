Figure 1: Correlation between edge importance and stand-alone model accuracy. The edge im-portance is indicated by (a) operation weight α in DARTS and (b) edge combination weight β inDOTS. We calculate the Kendall Tau metric (Kendall, 1938) to measure the ranking correlation be-tween the edge importance and stand-alone model accuracy. The experimental setting can be foundin Appendix A.1.
Figure 2: Overall pipeline of the proposed DOTS. The DOTS framework consists of group annealingoperation search and edge annealing topology search.
Figure 3: Operation weight evolution during training in DARTS and DOTS. For DOTS, we plot theoperation weights without annealing.
