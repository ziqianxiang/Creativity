Figure 1: Required (a) running time and (b) memory consumption to generate a node embedding(d=512) based on the edge count of each graph (|E |), with the best line fit drawn. Our method is over9,000 times faster than FastRP and uses over 8,000 times less memory than VERSE, the next mostefficient baselines respectively, in the largest graph that these baseline methods can process.
