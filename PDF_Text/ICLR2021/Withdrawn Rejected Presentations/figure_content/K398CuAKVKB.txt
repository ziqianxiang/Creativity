Figure 1: Illustration of the difference between a real-valued layer (left) and quaternion-valued layer (right). Thequaternionâ€™s Hamilton product shows the internal relation learning ability not present in the real-valued due to sharingweights and being forced to discover joint correlations.
Figure 2: Grey-scale to color results on two KODAK images for a quaternion CAE and a vector map CAE.
Figure 3: An illustration of quaternion convolution.
Figure 4: Randomly selected feature vector maps from the first convolution layer after training. Each row is a differentimage, where the first column are the original input images.
