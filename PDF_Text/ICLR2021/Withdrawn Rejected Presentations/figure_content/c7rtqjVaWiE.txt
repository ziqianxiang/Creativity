Figure 1: Illustration of REP-GAN's reparameterized dependent proposal with two pairing Markovchains, one in the latent space Z, and the other in the sample space X.
Figure 2: Visualization of samples with different sampling methods on the Swiss Roll dataset. Heretau denotes the Langevin step size in Eqn. (17).
Figure 3: Average Inception Score (left) and acceptance ratio (right) vs. training epoch on CIFAR-10based on our re-implementation. The standard deviation is shown with shaded error bar (left).
Figure 4: The first 20 steps of two Markov chains with the same initial samples. The chains aregenerated by MH-GAN (top), DDLS (middle), and REP-GAN (bottom).
Figure 6: Visualization of the Markov chains of MH-GAN (top), DDLS (middle), and REP-GAN(bottom) on CelebA with WGAN backbone.
Figure 7: Visualization of samples with different sampling methods on the 25-GaUSSianS dataset.
Figure 8: Visualization of the multi-modal experiments with more modes. Specifically two casesare considered, 9x9, and 13x13 mixture of Gaussian. The true data points are shown in grey inbackground, and the generated points with different sampling methods are shown in blue.
