Figure 1: Illustration of using averaged features extracted by old model to serve as pseudo classifier.
Figure 2: Illustration of using random walk algorithm to refine features extracted by old modelbefore averaged to serve as a column of pseudo classifier. Negative effects of outliers in each classwill be reduced. During the training, this pseudo classifier will be not updated by the gradient.
