Figure 1: Failures of existing aggregation rules on the non-iid MNIST dataset. In all experiments,there are 8 good and f Byzantine workers.
Figure 2: Combining resampling with existing aggregation rules on non-iid MNIST dataset. In allexperiments, there are 8 good and f Byzantine workers. For each aggregation we resample andaverage s gradients for T = n times.
Figure 3: Test accuracies of Krum, Cm, Rfa under 5 kinds of attacks (and without attack) onnon-iid datasets. There are 10 workers and 2 of them are Byzantine according to each attack row.
Figure 4: Test accuracies of Krum, Cm, Rfa under 5 kinds of attacks (and without attack) on non-iidFashion-MNIST datasets. There are 12 workers and 2 of them are Byzantine according to each attackrow. Columns show each aggregation rule applied without (red) and with resampling (blue). Dottedlines for comparison are showing the same method without any Byzantine workers (f = 0). For RFA,T1, T8 refers to the number of inner iterations of Weiszfeld’s algorithm.

Figure 6: Comparing 3 aggregation rules under 5 kinds of attacks on non-iid datasets. There are 10workers and 2 of them are Byzantine. In the grid of experiments, same aggregation rules are used inthe same column and same attacks are applied to the same row. The aggregation rules are KRUM(Blanchard et al., 2017), CM (Yin et al., 2018a), RFA (Pillutla et al., 2019). The RFA-T1, T3, T8refers to the number of inner iterations.
Figure 7: Comparison with no resampling, and fixed grouping for Krum on non-i.i.d datasets.
Figure 8: Compare no resampling with s = 2, 3, 4 on MNIST data. There are 10 workers and 0Byzantine worker.
