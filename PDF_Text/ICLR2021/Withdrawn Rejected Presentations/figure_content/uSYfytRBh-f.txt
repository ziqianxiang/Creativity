Figure 2: Purpose of weakly labelling. First row: Candi-date images from M. Counterexamples selected into S arehighlighted with red rectangles, and the rest are false posi-tives. Second and third rows: Predictions by the target andcompeting models, respectively. See Figure 4 for the colorlegend.
Figure 3: Visual comparison of images in (a) S and (b) PASCAL VOC validation set (denoted byT (0)).
Figure 5: Representative “car” images from M(2). First row: Test images. Second row: Predictionsby ft(0). Third row: Predictions by ft(1) that is only exposed to a small set of “car” images in S(1).
Figure 6: Visual comparison of images in (a) S and (b) PASCAL VOC validation set (denoted byT (0)).
