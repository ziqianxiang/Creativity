Figure 1: (left) Illustrative example of atomic structure energies during relaxations performed usingDFT and ML-based (SchNet, GNS, ForceNet) approaches. 3D renderings of the structures alongthe relaxation trajectory are shown, where small atoms are adsorbates and larger atoms are catalysts.
Figure 4: 2D Illustration of a slab that represents a catalystâ€™s surface and an adsorbate. The slab istiled in the x and y directions to create the surface (neighboring cells shown as atoms with dashedoutlines). Only the cells to the left ([-1, 0, 0]) and right ([1, 0, 0]) are shown. The adsorbate is alsoassumed to be tiled with the slab (white, red, and grey atoms). Only the top 2 layers of the slab areallowed to move during a relaxation (dark blue), and the others are fixed (light blue). Neighboringatoms (black arrows) can be from the same cell or neighboring cells (t and s0). All atoms within aradius (dotted circle) are assumed to be neighbors.
