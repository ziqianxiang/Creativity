Figure 2: Kmin with respect to λ for some values of , δ in ARMCMC. (for λ = 0 evaluation forARMCMC is equivalent to MCMC)4 ResultsIn this section, we demonstrate the priority of the proposed approach given two different examples.
Figure 3: Comparison of RLS and AR-MAPS for soft bending actuator(a) Parameter variation for RLS and AR-MAPSAs the range of these parameters are small, we scale the input vector by the factor of 107 for RLS.
