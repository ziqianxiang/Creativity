Figure 1: The AFI block can automatically extract important features for later feature reusing basedon the learned features.
Figure 2: Illustration of the impact of the AFI module. All original images come from the ImageNetdataset. Heatmaps generated by Grad-CAM (Selvaraju et al., 2017) illustrates which areas the net-work pays more attention to. Compared to the vanilla ResNet-50, the area that AFI-ResNet-50 paidmost attention to is much smaller.
Figure 3: The architecture of the AFI-MobileNet building block is shown in Figure 3(a). Thearchitecture of the AFI-ResNet building block is shown in Figure 3(b).
Figure 4: Each figure depicts the class selectivity index distribution for features in both the baselineResNet-50 and AFI-ResNet-50 various building blocks in the Conv3 stage of their architectures.
