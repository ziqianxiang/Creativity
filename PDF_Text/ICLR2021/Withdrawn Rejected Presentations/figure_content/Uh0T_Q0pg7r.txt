Figure 1: Left: DEIMOS acquisition function and batch query for simulated 1D data. Model pre-dictions ±1 standard deviation are shaded light blue. Points selected to be queried in a batch of size5 are indicated on the x-axis (batch construction order: darker to lighter markers). Right: Modelpredictions after acquisition. The queried points from 1(a) are labeled and added to the training setand a new model is retrained from scratch. A substantially improved fit is obtained.
Figure 2: Test performance across AL iterations with ±1 standard deviation of average performanceshaded. Left: 5’ splicing (batch size 1) MSE; DEIMOS outperforms benchmarks (p = 2.1 × 10-278for maximum variance acquisition and p = 6.9 × 10-34 for random acquisition) (Appendix C).
Figure 3: (a) MNIST 7 vs. 9 classification accuracy (±1 standard deviation shaded) across ALiterations for batch size 25. DEIMOS outperforms random and robust k-Center acquisition (p-values4.4 × 10-11 and 1.9 × 10-11, respectively (Appendix C) (b) MNIST 0-9 classification accuracy (±1standard deviation shaded) across AL iterations for batch size 25. DEIMOS outperforms random(p = 9 × 10-3) and maximum entropy (p = 3 × 10-3) acquisition (Appendix C) (c) Images 1-3 and999-1000 (order: top to bottom) queried by DEIMOS in MNIST 7 vs. 9 classification with batchsize 25; each column corresponds to one experiment (order: left to right). (d,e) Batch diversity,defined as average symmetric KL divergence of predicted class probabilities for queried points ineach batch, across AL iterations in MNIST 7 vs. 9 classification with batch size 25 and MNIST 0-9classification with batch size 25, respectively. DEIMOS has higher batch diversity than Batchbaldand maximum entropy acquisition (p < 0.01) in almost all AL iterations in both tasks (f) DEIMOSMNIST 7 vs. 9 classification accuracy across AL iterations (batch size 25) for several representativesample sizes |Xsamp |. There is no statistically significant difference in DEIMOS AL performanceacross the |Xsamp | shown (Appendix C).
