Figure 1: Average accuracies of each topology in NAS-bench-201 (Dong & Yang) among differentnumber of edges on CIFAR-10 (left) and ImageNet (right). Details can be found in Appendix A.4.
Figure 2: An overview of TopoNAS: (a) a cell represented by directed acyclic graph. The edges be-tween nodes denote the operations to be learned. (b) Following DARTS (Liu et al.), the operation oneach edge is replaced by a mixture of all candidate operations parameterized by operation variablesα. (c) DARTS selects operation with the largest α for each edge. (d) TopoNAS introduces addi-tional topological variables β to explicitly learn topologies, which decouples operation selection (c)and topology learning (d).
