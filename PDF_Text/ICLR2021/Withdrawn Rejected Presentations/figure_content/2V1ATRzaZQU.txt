Figure 1: The spectral contraction effect of Lookahead dynamics in Equation 8. λ± are the eigen-values of each base dynamics, and 1 - α + αλk± are the eigenvalues of the associated Lookaheaddynamics. k forward steps of a Lookahead procedure first rotate the eigenvalues λ± of the dynam-ics’ Jacobian matrix. Then, a synchronization backward step pulls them into a circle with a radiussmaller than their maximal modulus. This results in a reduced spectral radius of the Jacobian matrix,which improves stability and convergence to an equilibrium.
