Figure 1: Model architecture. Contains preprocessing form and model details.
Figure 2: The influence of noise preprocessing strategy on the change of loss and the trendof accuracy during training. The figure shows the two most intuitive training indicators,training loss and accuracy rate during 20*10,000 iterations. Note that because the networkstructure of the baseline system Transformer_basic is different from other baseline systemsand our system in this paper, the model efficiency in terms of training efficiency is notcomparable.
Figure 3: An example of a heat map after decoding and reordering: left-with noise prepro-cessing, right-without noise preprocessing.
