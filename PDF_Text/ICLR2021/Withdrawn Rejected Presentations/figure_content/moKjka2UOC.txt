Figure 1: Illustration of the proposed PACL framework. PACL includes three alignment modules:UDA performs domain alignment using labeled source and unlabeled target samples, exactly thesame way as existing UDA methods. PA conducts class-level alignment by explicitly pushing closecross-domain samples that are from the same class. CA generates a pseudo label for each unla-beled target sample from its weakly augmented version and applies the pseudo label on its stronglyaugmented version with supervised learning.
