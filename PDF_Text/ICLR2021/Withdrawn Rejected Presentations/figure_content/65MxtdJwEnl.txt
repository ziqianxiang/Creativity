Figure 1: Left: The original Neural CDE formulation. The path X is quickly varying, meaning a lotof integration steps are needed to resolve it. Right: The log-ODE method. The log-signature path ismore slowly varying (in a higher dimensional space), and needs fewer integration steps to resolve.
Figure 2: Geometric intuition for the first two levels of the log-signature for a 2-dimensional path.
