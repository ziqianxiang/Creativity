Figure 2: Comparison of the strongly weakly augmented images. The left is the original image,the middle is the weakly augmented image, and the right is the strongly augmented one with over-contrastive details.
Figure 3: Diagram of distributional divergence minimization. Here the representation bank consistsof K stored features zk in the negative pool and online features zi from the key encoder. They willbe used to calculate the conditional probability of current weakly and strongly augmented images.
