Figure 1: The optimal number of tasks increases as the square root of the budget in mixed linearregression. a) Average test loss as a function of number of tasks for different values of the budget:magenta - 256, cyan - 512, green - 1024, red - 2048. Circles: average over 100 experiments; Lines:theoretical predictions from equation 8; Diamonds: minima of the loss predicted by theory. b)Optimal number of tasks as a function of the budget, the four minima from panel a are replottedhere (diamonds). Full line: theoretical prediction from equation 9; Dashed line: square root law.
Figure 2: Experimental results on the sinusoid regression dataset. Left: The loss has a uniqueoptimum for the number of tasks, and the optimum increases with the budget size. The SDM al-gorithm recovers the optimum. Full lines show the loss evaluated by grid search, crosses show thecorresponding SDM clusters. Grid search curves are an average over multiple runs. SDM clustercentroids are marked by diamonds. Right: Power law fits for the SDM cluster centroids, optimalnumber of tasks as a function of budget. The exponent of the power law is 0.466, close to thepredicted square root law.
Figure 3: The optimal allocation favours more tasks as the learning rate Î±, which controls thestrength of the adaptation step, decreases. Correspondingly, performance of the algorithm worsens.
