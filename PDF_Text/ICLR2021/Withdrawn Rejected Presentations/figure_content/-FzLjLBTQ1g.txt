Figure 1: The learned temperature trajectories of the tokens during the course of training.
Figure 2: The architecture of the proposed CT-MoS model. Black components are those the sameas the MoS model, while the blue ones are the newly added ones in the proposed approach.
Figure 3: Gradients of loss With respect to (a) logit z0 and (b) logit z1. In each figure, the x-axis isthe probability pi of class i, y-axis is the temperature value τi of class i, and z-axis is the gradient∂L. The colorful mesh represents the gradients when the context-aware temperature is applied,While the red mesh represents the case Without temperature.
Figure 4: Gradients of loss with respect to zτi. The x-axis is the probability pi of class i, y-axis isthe temperature value Ti of class i, and z-axis is the gradient ∂∣L.
Figure 5: Means of the temperature vectors over positions in a sentence. The average temperature islow at the beginning of a sentence and gradually increases towards latter positions.
