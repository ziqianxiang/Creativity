Figure 2: Performance analysis for CapsNets on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. Left: Convergenceplots for different routing mechanisms on CIFAR-10 validation sets. Right: number of trainableparameters, memory usage, and number of FLOPs on CIFAR-10 (top) and CIFAR-100 (bottom).
Figure 3: The learned IMoG overlayed with the familiar and novel outputs of the ClassCaps layerfor the novel azimuth (top) and elevation (bottom) experiments on SmallNORB. Each shade of theGaussians represents one standard deviation, while each axis represents one of the 16 total poses.
