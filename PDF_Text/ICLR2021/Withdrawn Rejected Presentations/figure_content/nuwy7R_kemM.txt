Figure 1: Uncertainty measure comparisons using the same-domain test set newstest2014 (left)and out-of-training-domain test set Europarl (right). The Transformer model was trained for DEto EN tasks with the news-commentary-v13 EN-DE training set (size 284k) using 350k steps.
Figure 2: Uncertainty measure comparisons using the in-distribution DE-EN test set (a), out-of-distribution NL-EN test set (b) and the combined DE+NL to EN test set (c). The Referenceline in (c) corresponds to the BS plot from (a), which only has 3k test data. Therefore it onlyreaches the fraction 0.5 in this graph. The model was trained for DE to EN task with the fullEN-DE training set (size 4.6m) using 350k steps.
Figure 3: Histograms show uncertainty value for DE-EN (green) and NL-EN (red). Note howBLEUVar-10 is able to clearly separate the in-distribution (green) from out-of-distribution (red).
Figure 4: Uncertainty estimator comparisons for different number of samples. The model istrained for EN to DE tasks with 4.6m training data using 350k steps.

Figure 8:	The density of individual BLEU score versus uncertainty (BLEUVar-10) for allsentences in the same test set newstest2014 produced by models trained with various size ofdata set. The sentences are ordered by their uncertainty from low (left) to high (right) usingBLEUVar-10. Following the calculation of BLEUVar, since we have 10 samples, the uncertaintyestimate BLEUVar-10 has the value in range [0, 90]. And we scale it up by Ã—100, which resultsin the x-axis has the range [0, 9000]. The models were trained for EN to DE tasks with 50k,100k and 4.6m training data using 350k steps.
Figure 9: Uncertainty measure comparisons using the in-distribution FR-EN test set (a), out-of-distribution DE-EN test set (b) and the combined FR+DE to EN test set (c). The Referenceline in (c) corresponds to the BS plot from (a), which only has 3k test data. Therefore it onlyreaches the fraction 0.5 in this graph. The model was trained for FR to EN task with the WMT2014 English-French training set (size 36m) using 350k steps.
