Figure 3: Hessian norm vs. β on a ran-dom correctly classified image. The plotclearly shows a concave behaviour. swould affect the singular values of the input-output Jacobian (β J), we know that they are finite andnot zero. How Hessian norm is influenced by β is illustrated in Fig. 3.
Figure 4: Adversarial accuracy usingPGD attack under L∞ bound (8/255)with varying step size (η) on ResNet-18trained on CIFAR-10. Notice, PGD at-tack is unable to reach zero adversarialaccuacy for BNNs with any step size.
Figure 5: Plots to show how variation in β affects (a) norm of input gradient, i.e., k∂'(β)∕∂x0∣∣2,(b) norm of sign of input gradient, i.e., k sign (∂'(β )∕∂ x0)k2 on a random correctly classified image.
