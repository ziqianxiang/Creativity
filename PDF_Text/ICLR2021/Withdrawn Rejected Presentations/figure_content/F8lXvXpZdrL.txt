Figure 1: Comparison of the training performance and gradient estimation accuracy for a stochasticautoencoder with different number of latent Bernoulli units (bits). Training Loss: each estimatoris applied for 100 epochs and then switched to arm-10 in order to correct the accumulated bias.
Figure 2: Schematic explanation of the optimization process using a biased estimator followed bya correction with an unbiased estimator. The figure applies more directly to estimators that do havea relaxed objective, e.g. Gumbel-Softmax. Initially, the biased estimator makes good progress, butthen the value of the true loss function may start growing while the optimization steps neverthelesscome closer to the optimal location in the parameter space.
