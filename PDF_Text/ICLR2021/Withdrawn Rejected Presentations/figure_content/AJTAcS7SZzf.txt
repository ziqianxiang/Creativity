Figure 1: Overview of AutoSamPling illustrated through one multi-eXPloitation-and-eXPloration cycle.
Figure 2: The comparison between histograms estimated from the sampling schedules of Epoch80, 160 and 240 from CIFAR-100 with ResNet-18. We divide the 50000 training images into 500segments of 100 images, and calculate the histograms of total data counts of all segments. We reorderthe x-axis based on the ranking of data counts for epoch 240 for easier comparison.
Figure 3: Example images on the head and tail of the sampling spectrum. The images on the left arethe ones with low sampling probability, while the images on the right more likely to be sampled. Weobtain these images using AutoSampling with the ResNet-18 model on CIFAR-100.
Figure 4: The comparison between the sampling frequency of each training image and its loss valuesof Epoch 80, 160 and 240 from CIFAR-100 with ResNet-18. We randomly selected 500 trainingimages, and calculate their sampling frequency and loss values. The x-axis is the indexes of 500training images, while the left y-axis denotes loss values and the right y-axis denotes the samplingfrequency. The blue line represents the sampling frequencies and the red lines represents the lossvalues of all 500 images. As we can see from the figure, the two lines are not obviously correlated.
