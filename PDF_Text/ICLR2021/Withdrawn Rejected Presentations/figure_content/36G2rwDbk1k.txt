Figure 1: Scatter plot and importance distributions detected by FIBLR (our approach) over classes Setosa (red“+” in the scatter plot), Versicolor (green “x”) and Virginca (blue “.”) in Iris dataset.
Figure 2: Scatter plot and importance distributions detected by LR, GNB and FIBLR (over class Parkinson’s,green “x” in the scatter plot) in Parkinson’s dataset.
Figure 3: Importance distributions (over class Parkinson’s) detected by FIBLR in Parkinson’s dataset. Featuresin columns 1 to 5 are measures of variation in fundamental frequency, and features in the other columns aremeasures of variation in amplitude.
Figure 4: Importance distributions (over class Never Used) for 7 drugs detected by FIBLR in Drug consump-tion dataset. The title in each panel (e.g., Heroin) is the drug name.
Figure 5: Scatter plot and importance distributions detected by LR, GNB and FIBLR (over class Never Usedof Heroin, green “x” in the scatter plot) in Drug consumption dataset.
Figure 6: Scatter plot and importance distributions detected by LR, GNB and FIBLR (over class Active, green“x” in the scatter plot) in Drosophila enhancers dataset.
Figure 7: Importance distributions (over class Active) detected by FIBLR in Drosophila enhancers dataset.
