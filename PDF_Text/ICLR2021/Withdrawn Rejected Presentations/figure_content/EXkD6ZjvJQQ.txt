Figure 12: According to the first-order limit, given a fixed dimension p = 100, the prediction risks atsample size n = 90 and n = 98 are about 10.20 and 49.02. More data hurt seems true. However, the95% confidence interval of the prediction risks with sample size 98 is [4.91, 142.12], which containsthe risk for n = 90. Then more data hurt is not statistically significant.
