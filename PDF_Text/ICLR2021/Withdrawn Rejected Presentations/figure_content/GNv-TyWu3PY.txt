Figure 1: the experimental performance of Algorithm 1. The x-axis in each plots is the time step,and the y-axis is the cumulative regret. There are eight plots, each consisting of four curves, eachwith different noise levels. Each curve is a single run of the algorithm. The upper four plots havetime horizons of 100,000, and the bottom four have time horizons of 1,000,000. All plots in the leftcolumn use Graph 1, and all plots in the right column use Graph 2. Finally, since we tested sevenvalues of β, we separated them into two different plots to avoid overcrowding a single plot. Forexample, the top two plots in the left column have the same time horizon of 100,000 and both useGraph 1. The top left plot contains the lower noise levels (0, .01, .02, .05), and the second-from-the-top left contains the higher noise levels (.05, .1, .2, .5). Note that β = .05 is included in both toallow visual comparison between the plots.
