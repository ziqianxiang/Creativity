Figure 1: The ARs and SDs in the training process of the experiment using the synthetic dataset.
Figure 2: Higher AR and loWer Varmethods are Pareto efficient.
Figure 3: The AR and Var on the test environment. Higher AR and lower Var methods are Paretoefficient.
Figure 4: The ARs and SDs in the training process of the experiment using the synthetic dataset.
Figure 5: Sensitivity analysis regarding ψ. The upper two graphs are the results using the SPG-basedmethod and the lower two graphs are the results using the AC-based algorithms. The average rewardof the SPG result with ψ = 0.1 is lower than 80, and we do not show the result here.
