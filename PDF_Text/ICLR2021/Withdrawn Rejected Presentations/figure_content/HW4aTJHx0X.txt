Figure 1: Model diagram. Left: CONTROLCODE model, in which inputs are prefixed with a prompt symboland passed to a shared model to control the output mode. Right: MultiHead model, which shares all of themodelâ€™s parameters apart from the last decoder layer for different output modes, and chooses the final decoderlayer accordingly to control the output mode.
