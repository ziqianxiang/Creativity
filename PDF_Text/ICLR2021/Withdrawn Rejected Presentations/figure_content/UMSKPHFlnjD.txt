Figure 1: Examples of potential relationship between global context and local information, top row:some kitchen utensils such as knives, forks, bowls and cups often appear on the table with food;bottom row: computer, keyboard and mouse often appear together.
Figure 2: Network architecture of Feature Pyramid Network(FPN). In this figure, the upward redarrow represents the down-sampling process, the downward blue arrow represents the up-samplingprocess, the black dashed line represents the data flow, and ㊉ represents the element-wise sum.
Figure 3: Network architecture of DGCA RCNN. In this figure, {p2, p3, p4, p5} represents the fea-ture pyramid used to generate RoI from the corresponding feature map and the channel dimensionsare all 256, {g0, g1, g2, g3} represents the global context feature map obtained by down-sampling{p2,p3, p4, p5} through the corresponding 3 X 3 convolutional layer, 0 represents the concatenationfunction and ㊉ represents the element-wise sum.
Figure 4: Network architecture of context aware module. It contains two sub-modules: attention andtask decoupling, the attention module is in charge of mappings global context information to high-dimensional space and the task decoupling module outputs the prediction results of classificationand positioning.
