Figure 1: Multi-path v.s. single-path compression scheme. (a) Multi-path search scheme (Wu et al.,2018): represents each candidate configuration as a separate path and formulates the compressionproblem as a path selection problem, which gives rise to huge numbers of trainable parameters andhigh computational overhead when the search space becomes combinatorially large. Here, Zk isthe k-bit quantized version of z and αqk is the architecture parameters corresponding to the path ofk-bit quantization. (b) Single-path search scheme (Ours): represents each candidate configurationas a subset of a “super-bit” and formulates the compression problem as a subset selection problem,which greatly reduces the computational costs and optimization difficulty from the discontinuity ofquantization. Here, the super-bit denotes the highest bitwidth in the search space, gkq is a binary gatethat controls the decision of bitwidth, and k is the re-assignment offset (quantized residual error).
