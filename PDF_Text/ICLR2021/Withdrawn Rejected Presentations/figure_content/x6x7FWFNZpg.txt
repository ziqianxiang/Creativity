Figure 1: Convergence and Scalability on the Transformer/WMT Task With multiplier = 1.
Figure 2: Convergence results and performance breakdown for ResNet18/ImageNet.
Figure 3: Additional convergence results for ImageNet dataset.
Figure 4: Average time per batch for previous methods, compared to SwarmSGD, onResNet18/ImageNet, across 1000 repetitions with warm-up. Notice that 1) the time per batch ofSwarmSGD stays constant relative to the number of nodes; 2) it is lower than any other method.
Figure 5: Convergence versus time for ResNet18/Imagenet for the SGD baseline vs Swarm, execut-ing at 32 nodes. We note that Swarm iterates for 2.7Ã— more epochs for convergence, which explainsthe similar runtime despite the better scalability of Swarm.
Figure 6: Additional convergence results for CIFAR-10 dataset, versus number of nodes (left), andlocal steps (right).
Figure 7: Objective loss versus time for the Transformer-XL/WMT experiment, for various methods,executing at 16 nodes.
