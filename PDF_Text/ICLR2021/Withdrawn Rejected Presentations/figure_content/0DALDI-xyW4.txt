Figure 1: Iterations of original Nesterov’s method (Nesterov) and the new method (New method)for quodratic and linear regression objective function. Y-axis represents the gap ∣F(xn) — F(x^)|.
Figure 2: The largest modulu of eigenvalues of Qn, where S ∙ V2F is chosen to be 1, 2 and 3.
Figure 3: Iterations of FISTA, accelerated proximal gradient descent (Nesterov) and modifiedFISTA (Modified FISTA) for matrix completion objective function. Y-axis represents the gap∣F(Xn) — F(x")|. In Figure 3(a), step size is 1.3 for FISTA and accelerated proximal gradientdescent, and 4.1 for modified FISTA. In the other three figures, step sizes are reduced from 1.3 and4.1 in the proportion marked below the figures.
Figure 4: Iterations of FISTA, accelerated proximal gradient descent (Nesterov) and modifiedFISTA (Modified FISTA) for matrix completion objective function. Y-axis represents the gap∣F(Xn) - F(x^) |. Step sizes are chosen by backtracking.
