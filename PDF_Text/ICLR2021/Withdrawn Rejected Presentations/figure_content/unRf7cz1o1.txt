Figure 1: Overall architecture of the proposed attack algorithm. Step 1. Build an inversion-specificGAN to distill private information. Step 2. Recover the distribution of private domain. Note thatboth the generator and discriminator are fixed at Step 2.
Figure 2: Qualitative comparison for attacking a face recognition model. The first row shows theground truth image for a target identity. The second and third rows demonstrate the reconstructionsproduced by the GMI attack and our attack, respectively.
