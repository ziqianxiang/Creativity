Figure 1: (Best viewed in color). Neural network training follows two very different pathways basedon the choices of hyperparameters. These are training graphs of two Resnet50 models trained onrelabeled CIFAR-10 adversarial examples. See Section 4 for more details.
Figure 2: Clean accuracy of a Resnet50model trained on subsets of relabeledadversarial examplesConstruct a Ddet dataset for the first network using Equation 3 where t is chosen deterministicallyaccording to y using the transformation t = (y + 1)%10. We use Projected Gradient Descent (PGD)(Madry et al., 2018) to solve the optimization problem in Equation 3. Split the adversarial examplesinto two categories - those that transfer to the second network with their target labels, and those thatdo not. Relabel all adversarial examples xadv with their target label t, and train a Resnet50 modelon (xadv , t) pairs from each category.
Figure 3: Train a model on dogs with light eyes labeled as cats, and cats with dark eyes labeled asdogs. If the model classifies a clean dog image as a cat, then it must have learned the predictiverobust feature (snout), and if it classifies a dog as a dog, it must have learned the predictive non-robust feature (dark eyes).

We also take the case of aResnet18 trained on Ddet CIFAR-10 and look at which hyperparameters lead to Pathway 1 andwhich lead to Pathway 2. As we note in Section 4, there is a sharp transition between the twopathways in the space of hyperparameters.
