Figure 1: Example (10, 10)Sokoban board with 4 boxes.
Figure 2: Learning curve for Sokoban domain. Left figure shows full results, right one inspects thesame data for limited interval of values on the y axis. The results are averaged over 10 runs, shadedareas shoWs 95% confidence intervals. The x axis is the number of collected samples.
