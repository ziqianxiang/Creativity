Figure 1: The data collection is split into two tasks. In the navigation instructions task (top) annota-tors see a rendered map and write instructions to follow the route. The navigation run task (bottom)is used to validate navigation instructions. A different annotator tries to find the goal location inStreet View.

Figure 3: Graph representation of the route in Figure 2. The encircled middle part is magnifiedfor readability. Some nodes are left out for sake of clear visualization. Also, node colors are forvisualization only and not encoded in the graph. Green nodes are part of the route. Blue nodes areneighboring street segments. Orange nodes belong to OSM points of interest. Angles are relative toroute direction and start clockwise at 0Â° which is facing forward.
