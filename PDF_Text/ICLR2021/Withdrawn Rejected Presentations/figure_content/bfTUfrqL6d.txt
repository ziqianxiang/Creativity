Figure 1: Dependency graph of a given sentence. Blue words are the aspects. Green and red are“positive” and “negative” sentiment respectively. The dependency graph effectively reduces thedistances between aspects and sentimental descriptions and avoids polysemy words (e.g., “like”). Inour approach, an agent is deployed to walk from the aspect word to the sentimental regions, whichavoids task-irrelevant information and achieves more effective and efficient performance.
Figure 2: Framework of our SentRL method. A dependency graph is first obtained. The related sen-timent clues could be more close in dependency graph compared with the original sentence space.
Figure 3: t-SNE visualization of the learned sentimental representations, where (a) is AS-GCN (Zhang et al., 2019) method and (b) is our approach. Different color denotes different sen-timental categories.
Figure 4: A case study demonstrating traces from aspect words to their related sentimental words:Case 1 is a sample correctly predicted by SentRL, while case 2 is an incorrect prediction. Greyedges denote extracted syntactic dependencies, and red ones denote traces generated by a learnedagent. For example, in case 1, the agent trace is Food→Food→ is→fresh.
