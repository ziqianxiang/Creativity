Figure 1: An overview of the target modelâ€™s configuration with the benign behaviour (Figure 1a)and the backdoor activated (Figure 1b).
Figure 2: Evaluation of the triggerless backdoor attack When setting the number of queries to 5,000,on the MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CelebA datasets. The x-axis represents the different datasets andthe y-axis represents the attack success rate (Figure 2a), label consistency (Figure 2b), posteriorsimilarity (Figure 2c), and accuracy on the clean testing dataset (Figure 2d).
Figure 3: Evaluation of varying the number of queries on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The x-axis repre-sents the number of queries and the y-axis represents the different metrics values.
Figure 4: Evaluation of varying the number of target neurons using the CelebA dataset. The x-axisrepresents the number of quries and the y-axis represents the attack success rate (Figure 4a) andlabel consistency (Figure 4b).
Figure 5: Evaluation of varying the dropoutrate while prediction using the MNISTdataset. The x-axis represents the dropoutrate, and the y-axis represents the differentmetrics scores.
Figure 6: Evaluation of using different lay-ers for the target neuron using the CIFAR-10dataset. The x-axis represents the number ofqueries, and the y-axis represents the differ-ent metrics.
