Figure 1: Qualitative feature space study. Evaluation of feature space changes caused by imposing a uni-formity prior and producing a 2-d feature map using UMAP McInnes et al. (2020). The left two plots arethe baseline and baseline with uniformity distribution on the training data; the right two plots are the baselineand baseline with uniformity distribution on the testing data. We see that visually, the density increases withuniformity regularization, especially notable on the test data. Such embedding space density improvement canbe linked to generalization Roth et al. (2020b), which we also quantitatively support in section 4.6.
