Figure 1: Our interpretation of zeroth-order attack behavior in the context ofboundary tilting (Tanay & Griffin, 2016):a) zeroth-order attack targeting low-levelfeatures, leaving the manifold, b) anefficient zeroth-order attack targetingmostly high-level features, floating alongthe manifold, and c) manifold-basedzeroth-order attack next to the manifold,but sacrificing similarity.
