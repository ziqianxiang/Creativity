The input data (for training or validation) are from weeks before 34, and we startthe prediction from week 34, labeled by the vertical dash line. It can be observed that Deep modelfails to predict the dynamics of COVID-19 evolution. We quantitively compare the accuracy amongDeepGLEAM (DCRNN), DeepGLEAM (SG-MCMC), Deep (DCRNN), and GLEAM models usingRMSE. DeepGLEAM (DCRNN) and Deep (DCRNN) are deterministic models while DeepGLEAM(SG-MCMC) is the statistical model with the best accuracy. Table 4 shows both DeepGLEAMmodels outperform GLEAM while the Deep model is much worse than GLEAM. By calculation,there is a 6.6% improvement for DeepGLEAM (DCRNN) and 17% improvement for DeepGLEAM(SG-MCMC) on average from GLEAM.
