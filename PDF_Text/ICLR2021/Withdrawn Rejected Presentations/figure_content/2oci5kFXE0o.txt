Figure 1: SCL learned a “size neuron” that is highly predictive of the input object size. From top to bottom:input images from RAVEN, the neuron’s activations of each image, the labels of symbolic representation of “size”of each image. The neuron learned to represent “size” by an approximate linear transformation: y ≈ - 2X + 5.
Figure 2: An illustration of the proposed architecture SCL with the scattering transformation.
Figure 3: Visualization of compositional structure learning.
Figure 4: Examples of 7 different figure configurations in the RAVEN dataset (taken from Zhanget al. (2019a)).
Figure 5: t-SNE plots on the output of the relationship neural network Nr, in the order: Center,L-R, U-D, O-IC, O-IG, 2Grid, 3Grid.
