Figure 1: Sampling weights and test performance of three methods with different sampling strategieson long-tailed CIFAR-10 with imbalance ratio 50. Left: instance-balanced, class-balanced and class-reversed sampling. Right: standard cross entropy, BBN and our switching.
Figure 3: Cumulative learned events and forgetting events of each sample of Long-tailed CIFAR-10with imbalance ratio 50. The regularity of one class will be higher with more samples gathering inthe lower right corner of the picture.
