Figure 1: Frameworks of: (a) the proposed causal inference Q-network (CIQ) training and testframework, where the latent state is an unobserved (hidden) ConfoUnder;(b) a 3D navigation task,banana collector (Juliani et al., 2018), and (c) a video game, LunarLander (Brockman et al., 2016).
Figure 2: (a) Causal graphical model (CGM). (b) CIQ architecture. The notation ittrain denotes theinference label available during training, whereas it is sampled during inference as it is unknown.
Figure 3: Performance of DQNs under potential (20%) adversarial and black-out interference.
Figure 4: Perturbation-based saliency map on Pixel Cartpole under adversarial perturbation: (a) DQN,(b) CIQ, (c) DQN-CF, and (d) DVRLQ-CF. The black arrows are correct actions and blue arrows areagents, actions. The neural saliency of CIQ makes more correct actions responding to ground actions.
