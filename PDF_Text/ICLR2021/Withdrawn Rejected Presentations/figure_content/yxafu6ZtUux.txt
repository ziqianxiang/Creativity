Figure 1: Plots demonstrating QTE. X denotes the observed covariates, A denotes the received treatment andY denotes the associated reward. In the ride-hailing example, X is a feature vector describing the characteristicsof a passenger, A is a binary strategy indicator and Y is the passenger’s number of rides in the following twoweeks. In the left panel, the treatment effect does not depend on X . Neither HTE nor QTE exists in this case.
