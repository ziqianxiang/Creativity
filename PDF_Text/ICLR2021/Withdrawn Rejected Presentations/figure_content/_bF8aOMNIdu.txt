Figure 1: Loss distributions for clean labels versus corrupt labels on CIFAR-10 with 40% label noise(left) and 80% label noise (right). All losses are computed with respect to the labels used duringtraining, which mimics a realistic setting (no access to clean labels).
Figure 2: RTE ablation study using CIFAR-10 with uniform symmetric noise ratio of 80%. Left: theECR batch entries are shared with the task loss and the batch size is fixed at 128, while the numberof ECR terms (N*) is varied. Right: 1 ECR term is used With varying ECR batch size, usingbatch entries that are distinct from the task loss (analogous to a more traditional semi-supervisedapproach). The dashed red line on the right is the ECR baseline established using N* = 8.
Figure 3: Parameter schedules for lr, weight decay, JSD weight λJSD , ECR weight λECR, q andN* for CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 With 40% and 80% uniform symmetric noise rates.
Figure 4: Reliability diagrams for RTE training models on CIFAR-10 with 40% uniform label noise(left) and 80% label noise (right). Perfectly calibrated models follow the black line, whereas over-confident models lie below and under-confident models lie above. This figure indicates our RTEtrained model is well calibrated when trained with 40% label noise, while (perhaps justifiably) con-servative when trained with a more extreme level of 80% label noise.
