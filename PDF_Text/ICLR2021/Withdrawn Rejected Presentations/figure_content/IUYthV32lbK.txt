Figure 2: Signed certified robust radius difference between MME and WE by λ∖∕λ? under differentnumbers of base models N. Here we fix λ2 to be 0.95 and uniformly sample λ1 ∈ [0.8, 0.95). Theconfidence score for the true class on each base model is uniformly sampled from [a, b], where ais sampled from [0.3, 1.0) and b is sampled from [a, 1.0) uniformly for each instance. Blue pointscorrespond to the negative radius difference (i.e., WE has larger radius than MME) and Red pointscorrespond to the positive radius difference (i.e., MME has larger radius than WE).
Figure 3: Comparison of certified robustness (in terms of certified robust radius) of Max-MarginEnsemble, Weighted Ensemble, and single model under concrete numerical settings. The y-axisis the certified robustness and the x-axis is the number of base models. The confidence score forthe true class is uniformly distributed in [a, b]. The Weighted Ensemble (shown by blue line) is(, λ1, 0.01)-WE confident; the Max-Margin Ensemble (shown by green line) is (, λ2, 0.01)-MMEconfident; and the single model (shown by red line) is (, λ3, 0.01)-MME confident.
