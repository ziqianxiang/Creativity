Figure 1: Visualisation of (a) the inducing weight augmentation, and compare (b) the original Math-eron’s rule to (c) our extended version. The white blocks represent random noises from the joint.
Figure 2: Showing the U variables in pre-activation spaces. To simplify we set σc = 1 w.l.o.g.
Figure 3: Toy regression results, with observations in red dots and the ground truth function in black.
Figure 4: Resnet-18 run-times and model sizes.
Figure 5: Averaged CIFAR-10 accuracy (↑) and ECE Q) results for the inducing weight methodswith different hyper-parameters. Models reported in the first two-columns uses M = 128 for Udimensions. For λmax = 0 (and σmax = 0) we use point estimates for the corresponding variables.
Figure 6: Accuracy (↑) and ECE ⑷ on corrupted CIFAR. We show the mean and two standarderrors for each metric on the 19 perturbations provided in (Hendrycks & Dietterich, 2019).
