Figure 1: Private gradientdescent repeated 100 timeson two differently-curved lossfunctions. Solid lines areoptimization trajectories anddashed horizontal lines are theaveraged final losses.
Figure 2: Comparison of dynamic schedule and uniform schedule on different data scale. Left paneis the influence by iteration estimated by retraining. The rest two are the relative loss by varyingdata scale (left axis with solid lines) and the variance of influence (right axis with dashed lines). Themiddle is on the MNIST35 dataset consisting of 1000 digit 3 and 5 images using quadratic regression.
