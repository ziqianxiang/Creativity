Figure 1: Example track pointcloud of a vehicle moving towards ego vehicle where pseudo-labels arerecovered through extrapolation, interpolation, and smoothing. Pseudo-labels gained are instanceswhere estimated bounding box (blue) is observed, while the original detection (orange) was missingor poorly aligned with ground truth (green). Better viewed in color. Zoom in for details.
Figure 2: False positive rates above detection confidence for a model trained on Argoverse and testedon KITTI.
Figure 3: Qualitative Results. We compare the detection results on several scenes from the KITTIvalidation set by the PointRCNN detectors that are trained on 1) Argoverse dataset (No Re-training),2) Argoverse dataset and fine-tuned using self-training on KITTI (Self Training), and 3) Argoversedataset and fine-tuned using dreaming on KITTI (Dreaming). We visualize them from both frontal-view images and bird’s-eye view point maps. Ground-truth boxes are in green and detected boundingboxes are in blue. The ego vehicle is on the left side of the BEV map and looking to the right. Onefloor square is 10m×10m. Best viewed in color. Zoom in for details.
Figure 4: Qualitative Results. The setups are the same as those in Figure 3, but the models arepre-trained in nuScenes dataset and tested on KITTI dataset.
Figure 5: Qualitative Results. The setups are the same as those in Figure 3, but the models arepre-trained in nuScenes dataset and tested on Argoverse dataset.
