Figure 1: Illustrating our TRIPS framework: the large joint space and tackled challenges.
Figure 2: (a) GPU memory consumption comparison between soft Gumbel Softmax (GS) and hardGS sampling (two active choices) for precision search. Probability of each precision choice duringthe search process in the 4-th block when searching with: (b) hard GS sampling for updating bothweights ω and precision choices β (result in the lowest 4-bit), and (c) the proposed heterogeneoussampling for updating ω and β (result in the highest 12-bit).

Figure 4: Benchmark TRIPS w/ and w/o precision search (denoted as TRIPS-Mixed and TRIPS-16bit,respectively) with SOTA network/accelerator co-exploration methods (Jiang et al., 2020b; Abdelfattahet al., 2020) on CIFAR-10/100/ImageNet.
Figure 5: Accuracy vs. FPS trade-off of TRIPS,TRIPS w/o heterogeneous sampling, and the se-quential optimization baseline on CIFAR-100.
Figure 6: Visualization of the searched network, precision, and accelerator that achieves a 72.2% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet and 110 FPS on ZC706 FPGA. The block definition follows (Wu et al.,2019).
