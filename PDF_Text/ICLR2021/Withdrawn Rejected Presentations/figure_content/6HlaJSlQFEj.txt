Figure 1: Illustrations of our intuitions. (a) Small noise can effectively disturb gradient estimationof query-based attacks which use finite difference (b) Compared to large noise, small noise hardlyaffects predictions on clean images.
Figure 2: Illustration of how small noise can defend against decision-based attacks (left) An adver-sary wants to reach the optimal adversarial example from an initial misclassifed point. (middle) Tofind the direction of the next update, it evaluates Xt + U (right) Small noise can disturb this gradientestimation.
