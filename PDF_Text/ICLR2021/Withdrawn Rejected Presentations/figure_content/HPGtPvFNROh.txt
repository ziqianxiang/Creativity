Figure 1: (a) Uniform weighting between each representation and CPs in the same class results in thecollapse of CPs to a single point. (b) Proposed modulated weighting introduces some desirable CPintra-class separation. (c) Modulated weighting in addition to the regularization term exhibits healthyinter and intra-class separation in addition to reflecting the semantic relationships between CPs.
Figure 2: (Left) Visualization of the attractive and repulsive forces present between an instancerepresentation and clinical prototypes that belong to two different clusters/classes. The clinicalprototypes are coloured according to sex and shaded in ascending order of age. All repulsive forcesare treated equally whereas attractive forces are weighted according to the degree of attribute matchingbetween the instance and the respective clinical prototype. (Right) Matrix D âˆˆ R1M |X|M | illustratingthe Euclidean distance between each pair of clinical prototypes. The mean-squared error between theobserved intra-cluster distances, DC, and the ground-truth intra-cluster distances, Dc, is minimized.
Figure 3: Top 5 retrieved instances based on query CPs from the (a) Chapman and (b) PTB-XLdatasets. Green and red borders indicate retrieved instances whose ground-truth class attributematches that of the CPs and those whose ground-truth class attribute does not match, respectively.
Figure 4: (Top Row) t-SNE projection of the representations in Chapman and PTB-XL, respectively.
