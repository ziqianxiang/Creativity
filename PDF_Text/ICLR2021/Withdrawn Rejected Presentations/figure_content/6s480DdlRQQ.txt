Figure 1: A comparison between staticand dynamic backdoors on CelebA.
Figure 3: An overview of the BaN and c-BaN techniques.
Figure 4: The result of our dynamic backdoor techniques for single and multiple target label on theclean testing dataset.
Figure 6: Visualization result of our techniques for the first four labels of the CIFAR-10 dataset.
Figure 5: Visualisation of thedynamic behaviour for our tech-niques for a single target.
Figure 7: Visualisation of triggersgenerated for the same target.
Figure 8: Visualization of attention maps for all our techniques using the Grad-CAM technique.
Figure 9: The histogram of the entropyof the backdoored vs clean input.
Figure 10: The result of trying different trigger sizes for the c-BaN technique on the MNIST dataset.
Figure 11: An illustration of the effect of using different transparency scales (from 0 to 1 with stepof 0.25) when adding the trigger. Scale 0 (the most left image) shows the original input, and scale 1(the most right image) the original backdoored input without any transparency.
