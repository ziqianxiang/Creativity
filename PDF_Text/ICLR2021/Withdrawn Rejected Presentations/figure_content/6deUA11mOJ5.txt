Figure 1: Histogram of memorization distance for private (left) and public (right) leaderboards(using NASNet and Inception). As shown in the figure, the two classes (legitimate models andmemorizing/cheating models) are well separated.
Figure 2: Distribution of FID (left) and memorization distances (right) for public vs private scoreswith manual labels. The better (lower) FIDs are the ones using various memorization techniques.
Figure 3: Public FID Inception vs private FID NASNet (left) and FID vs memorization distancedistribution with non-memorized submissions (right). It shows that FID is highly correlated tomemorization.
Figure 4: Submissions from ranks 1 (first row), 2, 3, 5, 10, 50, 100 (last row) on the privateleaderboard. Each row is a random sample of 10 images from the same team. Visually, the quality ofthe generated images gets lower as the ranks get higher.
