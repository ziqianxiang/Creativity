Figure 1: ROC feasible area illustrations. Panels (a)-(b): Attainability of Equalized Odds for bi-nary classifiers with discrete or continuous protected feature. Panels (c)-(d): ROC feasible areas,入、comparison between Ω(Y⅛), Ω(Yp∩st), Ω(Y0pt), and Ω(YJ*).
Figure 2: Illustration of unattainable Equalized Odds for regression tasks. Panel (a)-(b): Linear re-gression on the data generated with linear transformations and non-Gaussian distributed exogenousterms (following Laplace, Uniform distribution respectively). Panel (c)-(d): Nonlinear regressionwith a neural net regressor (Mary et al., 2019) on the data generated with nonlinear transforma-tions and Gaussian exogenous terms. We can observe obvious dependencies between Y and A on asmall interval of Y . This indicates the conditional dependency between Y and A given Y , i.e., theEqualized Odds is not achieved.
