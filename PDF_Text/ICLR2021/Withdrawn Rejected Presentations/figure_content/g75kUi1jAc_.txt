Figure 1: In WAFFLe, the clients share a global dictionary of rank-1 weight factors {W∕, W'}^ Eachclient uses a sparse diagonal matrix A', specifying the combination of weight factors that constituteits own personalized model. Neither the client data Di nor factor selections Λ' leave the local device.

Figure 4: Example data allocation process to N clients for MNIST and Z = 2 in the unimodali.i.d. (left) and multimodal i.i.d. (right) settings. Notice that the primary difference is the grouping ofthe data into two subpopulations (here referred to as “Majority” and “Minority”) before sharding andallocating Z shards to each client.
