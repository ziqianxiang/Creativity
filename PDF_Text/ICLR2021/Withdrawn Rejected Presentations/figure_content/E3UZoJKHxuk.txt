Figure 1: The DAG for LaCIM.
Figure 2: Visualization of Z. From left to right are: estimated posterior by pool-LaCIM, LaCIM-ds,LaCIM-d and the ground-truth. As shown, the LaCIM-ds (Fig.(b)) and LaCIM-d (Fig.(c)) can identifythe ground truth distribution of Z (i.e., pφ? (z∖ds)) up to permutation and point-wise transformation,which validates the claim in theorem 4.3.
Figure 3: Visualization via gradient Simonyan et al. (2013). From the left to right: original image,CEX → Y,CE(X,ds) → Y and LaCIM-ds.
Figure 4: Visualization of S. From left to right are: estimated posterior by pool-LaCIM:ppool-LaCIM (S∖x, y), by LaCIM with c as input: pLaCIM(S∖x, y, de), by LaCIM with D as input:pLaCIM(S∖x, y,d); the ground-truth pφ? (S∖de).
