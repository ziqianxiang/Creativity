Figure 1: Models with one auxiliary reflection attains similar validation error to models with manyreflections. Lower error means better performance. See Section 3 for details.
Figure 3: MNIST validation classification error in % over epochs (left) and over time (right). Lowererror mean better performance.
Figure 4: MNIST validation classification error for RNNs performing classification as done in(Mhammedi et al., 2017). To improve readability, the right plot magnifies the first 20 epochs ofthe left. Lower error means better performance.
Figure 5: (Left) Validation negative log-likelihood (NLL) of three Normalizing Flows on CIFAR10.
