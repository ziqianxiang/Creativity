Figure 1: An overview of the proposed semi-supervised learning method.
Figure 2: An overview of MixConf and its comparison with Mixup. MixConf basically followsthe scheme of Mixup, but it carefully sets the interpolation ratios (位a , 位b) so that training with theinterpolated data leads to better calibrated models. Unlike Mixup, 位b is not necessarily equal to 位a .
