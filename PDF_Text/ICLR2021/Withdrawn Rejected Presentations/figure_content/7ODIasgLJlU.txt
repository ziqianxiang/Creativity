Figure 1: Results on GYMIC, “Step” meansthe number of steps of the environment. Weshow the learning curve of 1.5 million steps.
Figure 2: The results on the Atari games, we compare different switching criteria on six Atarigames. “Step” means the number of steps of the environment. We constrain this 3.5 million stepsfor all environments. In each environment, we display the reward over the steps on the top and theswitching cost in a log scale at the bottom. “None” means no switching criterion under which thedeployed policy always keeps sync with the online policy. We evaluate a feature-based criterion,three fixed interval criteria covering a vast range, and an adaptive criteria increasing the deployinginterval from 100 to 10,000. Curves of reward are smoothed with a moving average over 5 points.
