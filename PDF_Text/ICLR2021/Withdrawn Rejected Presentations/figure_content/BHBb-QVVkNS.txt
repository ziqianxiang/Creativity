Figure 1: The graph of our locally-contextual CRE Shaded nodes indicate observed variables andpartially shaded nodes indicate variables which may be either observed or unobserved.
Figure 2: The character-level LSTM used to encode each word. xt,l denotes the lth character ofword xt .
Figure 3: Active learning performance of the NC-CRF, LC-CRF and CNN-CNN-LSTM (Shen et al.,2018) on the test set of each task. The x-axes show the number of sentences which have been labelledso far, and the y-axes show the model performance at that amount of labelled training data. For alltasks/metrics, higher is better.
