Figure 1: Long-range forecasting via observation/synthetic data window and prediction horizon.
Figure 2: (left) cWGAN-GEP generates synthetic data for the next time step of training data Pandtest data Q. The modified training data P is used to train the predictor to perform predictions for themodified test data	Q. (right) Training of cWGAN-GEP via training data	G.
Figure 3: Performance comparison between three variants of GenF (GenF-1, GenF-2, GenF-3) anditerative/direct forecasting ((a), (c), (e), (g)), three selected baselines ((b), (d), (f), (h)). In eachsubfigure, we highlight the prediction target and the benchmark method used. Each plot is averagedover 10 runs and the error-bar is the standard derivation. Moreover, the performance of GenF in theleft and right columns looks different due to the different scales, but the values are the same.
Figure 4: The synthetic data generated by cWGAN-GEP and its variants during the experiment ofpredicting heart rate using MIMIC-III Vital Signs dataset. As a comparison, we also show the truevalue (solid line) and the synthetic data generated by the iterative forecasting strategy via the fourclassical models. The value in parentheses is the mean squared error with respected to the true value.
