Figure 1: The classification accuracy of 11 ResNet56s both on clean CIFAR10 images and threekinds of adversarial CIFAR10 images(on the log scale). The adversarial CIFAR10 images are gen-erated by Fast Gradient Sign Method with = 0.1, 0.3, 0.5 on another neural network which hasthree residual blocks.
Figure 2: The evaluation of ResNet and Neural ODEs under DI2-FGSM. = 0 represents the accu-racy of ResNet and Neural ODEs without the adversarial attack applied. For MNIST, the maximumperturbation is set to 0.5 among all experiments, with pixel value in [0,1]. For CIFAR10, themaximum perturbation is set to 50 among all experiments, with pixel value in [0,255].
Figure 3: The evaluation of ResNet and Neural ODEs under Boundary Attack. For Boundary Attack,the number of queries is fixed at 1,000. The initial step size and orthogonal step size are set to 0.1.
