Figure 1: Schematic diagram of a protease with a substrate sample, graph generation and proteingraph convolutional network (PGCN).(a) Protease - substrate diagram with a sequence logo plot forthe specificity landscape of P2-P6 sites. Here, the substrate labeled in blue is 11-amino-acid long,from P7 at N-terminus to P4’ at C-terminus and it is cleaved between P1 and P1’. The site labeledin yellow represents all neighbor residues which are 6 angstrom around the substrate. (b) Graphgeneration from the substrate residues (blue dots) and its neighbor residues (yellow dots). Greylines denote edges. (c) PGCN training scheme. In the node matrix, residues are listed in the orderof residues starting from substrate residues followed by neighboring residues. In the node matrix,residues are listed in the order of residues from N-terminus to C-terminus, with substrate residuesfollowed by protease residues.
Figure 2: Accuracy of different models based on differentfeatures for binary classification. The length of an orangebar denote the closeness of accuracy.
Figure 3: (a) Parts of the importance diagram for wild type HCV, binary classification and D183AHCV, ternary classification. Sizes of nodes, widths of edges are proportional to importance scores.
