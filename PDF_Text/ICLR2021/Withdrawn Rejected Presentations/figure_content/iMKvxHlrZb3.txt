Figure 1: Neighbor Averaging over Relation Subgraphs on heterogeneous graph G. G has three node types:Paper (P), Author (A), and Field (F), and three relation types: Paper cites Paper (P→ P), Paper belongs-to Field(P→F), Author writes Paper (A→P).
Figure 2: SIGN Model. A(l) is the l-thpower of adjacency matrix A. Θ and Ωare transformation parameters in MLP, andσ and ξ are non-linear operators.
Figure 3: Training speed of NARS (sampling 8subgraphs) and baseline models on the OGB-MAGdataset. NARS leads to higher final accuracy in lesstraining time. NARS training is much faster whenfeatures can be stored on GPU (dashed line).
Figure 4: Accuracy of sampling different num-bers of relation subgraphs on the OGB-MAG dataset.
Figure 5: Training with different numbers of sub-graphs in each stage (§4) on OGB-MAG dataset, toimprove memory efficiency. Good test accuracy isachieved with even a single subgraph sampled per train-ing stage.
