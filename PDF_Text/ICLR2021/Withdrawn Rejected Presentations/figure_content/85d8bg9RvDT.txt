Figure 1: (a) Consider a structure with width K = 100 and depth D =3. Assuming an item isencoded by length-D vector [36, 27, 20], which is called a “path”. The path denotes that the itemis assigned to the (1, 36), (2, 27), (3, 20) indices of the K × D matrix. In the figure, arrows withthe same color form a path. Different paths could intersect with each other by sharing the sameindex at some layer. (b) Flow chart showing the process for constructing the probability of pathc =[c1,c2,c3] given input x, p(c|x, θ).
Figure 2: Relationship between recall@200 in Amazon Books experiment and model width K,number of paths J, beam size B and penalty factor α, respectively.
