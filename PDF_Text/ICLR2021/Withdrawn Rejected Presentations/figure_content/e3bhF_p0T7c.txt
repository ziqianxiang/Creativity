Figure 1: The weight vectors of teacher neurons (dotted lines) and student neurons (solid lines) inepoch 0, 10, 1000, 5000, 50000 respectively.
Figure 2: We fix θ1 = 1, 2, 3. θ2 and θ3 are variables. Also, z = min{det M1, det M2, det M3}.
Figure 3:	We fix (θ1, θ4) = (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 4). z = min{det M1, det M2, det M3 det M4}.
Figure 4:	For m = 6 and m = 9, we randomly choose θ1,∙∙∙ ,θm and compute Z =min{det M1, ∙ ∙ ∙ , det Mm} for 100000 times respectively. For visualization, Z is clipped.
