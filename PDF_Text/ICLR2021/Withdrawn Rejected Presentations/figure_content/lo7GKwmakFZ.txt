Figure 1: Learning curves comparing ATRPO and TRPO with different discount factors. The solidlines represent the average reward of trajectories of fixed length of 10,000 time steps averaged over thelast 50 trajectories. The results are averaged over 10 random seeds and the shaded region representsone standard deviation.
Figure 2: Comparing performance on evaluation trajectories of length 10,000. For each random seedused in training, we use a different unseen random seed to run 10 test trajectories after every 1 millionsamples of training. The solid line is averaged over these unseen random seeds. The shaded area isone standard deviation.
