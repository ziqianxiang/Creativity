Figure 1: An illustrative example of the linear threshold model on the derived directed bipartitegraph. To simplify the visualization, the GNN is assumed to have 1 layer, and therefore the deriveddirected bipartite graph have links from its zero-th (itself) and first order neighbors in the originalgraph. For a GNN with k layers, the derived directed bipartite graph will have links from all its l-thorder neighbors in the original graph, for any 0 ≤ l ≤ k. Each target node i has its own threshold θito be influenced (mis-classified). The edge weight depends on the random walk transition from theseed node to the target node.
Figure 2: Each figure shows a histogram of θj for a fixed node j over 1000 independent trials ofGCN on Cora. The 3 nodes are randomly selected from the union of the validation set and test set.
Figure 3:	The attack performances with varying perturbation strengths (from 0 to 1). Each figurecorresponds to a dataset-model combination. The x-axis indicates the value of λ and the y-axisindicates the classification accuracy after attack. The threshold is set as 10% and all other experimentsetups are the same as those in Section 5.2.
Figure 4:	Sensitivity analysis of the hyper-parameters a and σ. The experiment setups are thesame as those in Section 5.2. Each figure corresponds to a dataset-model combination. The x-axisindicates the value of a or σ while the y-axis indicates the classification accuracy after attack. Theresults under the threshold 10% are plotted in green while the results under the threshold 30% areplotted in blue. In addition to the proposed InfMax-Unif and InfMax-Norm, we also plot the resultsof GC-RWCS as the constant dashed lines for references. The plots are made in log-scale for thex-axis.
Figure 5:	Each figure shows a histogram of θj for a fixed node j over 1000 independent trials ofGCN on Cora. The 15 nodes are randomly selected from the union of the validation set and test set.
