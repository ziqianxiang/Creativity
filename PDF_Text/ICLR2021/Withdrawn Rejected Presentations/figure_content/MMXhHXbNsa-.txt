Figure 1: Left figure illustrates Lemma 33 by comparing worst case risk with known and unknown partitions.
Figure 2: Risk trade-off between low and high group risks in the BPF algorithm over the UCI adult Dua& Graff (2017) dataset as a function of game rounds. Left figure indicates worst group cross-entropy, rightcorresponds to low risk groups. Tra∞s are shown for several p values. Small p values make the risk of theworst group converge to that of the random classifier, as expected from Lennna 3.2, larger values show a morestratified behaviour. We observe how perfαrmance between worst and best groups is traded off between gamerounds.
