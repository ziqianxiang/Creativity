Figure 1: Illustration of the localized meta-learning framework. Instead of using globalmeta-knowledge for all tasks, we tailor themeta-knowledge for various specific task.
Figure 2: Comparison between PAC-Bayes regular meta-learning (left) and LML (right) . Inregular meta-learning, the mean of prior wP is sampled from a global hyperposterior distributionQ = N (wQ, σw2 Idw). In LML, wP is produced by a prior predictor Φv(Dnmew).
