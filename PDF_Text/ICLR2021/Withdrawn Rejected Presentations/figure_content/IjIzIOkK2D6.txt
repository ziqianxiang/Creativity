Figure 1: An illustrative example of a GNN model and the propsed EGAN (Best view in color). (a)An example graph with five nodes. The gray rectangle represents the input features of each node;(b) A typical 3-layer GNN model following the message passing neighborhood aggregation schema,which computes the embeddings of node “2”; (c) The DAG represents the search space for a 3-layerGNN, and αn , αl , αs represent, respectively, weight vectors for node aggregators, layer aggrega-tors, and skip-connections in the corresponding edges. The rectangles denote the representations,out of which three green ones represent the hidden embeddings, gray (hv0) and yellow (h5v) ones rep-resent the input and output embeddings, respectively, and blue one (h4v) represent the set of outputembeddings of three node aggregators for the layer aggregator. (d) At the t-th epoch, an architectureis sampled from p(Zn), p(Zs), p(Zl), whose rows Zi,j are one-hot random variable vector indicat-ing masks multipled to edges (i, j) in the DAG. Columns of these matrices represent the operationsfromOn,Os,Ol.
