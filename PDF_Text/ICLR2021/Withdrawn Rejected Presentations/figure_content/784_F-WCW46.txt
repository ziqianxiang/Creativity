Figure 1: We visualize the behavior of different discriminators when judging four different chair pointclouds. (a) and (b) are generated results, (c) and (d) are point clouds sampled using FPS and uniformsampling from a real chair surface. When training the discriminators on data like (d), differentdiscriminators make distinct decisions on the point cloud realness forming a sampling spectrumranging from sampling-insensitive, sampling-aware to sampling-oversensitive. We advocate sampling-aware discriminators in the middle of the spectrum, which provide good guidance for fixing geometricflaws (a) and big sample artifacts (b) and tolerate subtle sampling differences between (c) and (d).
Figure 2: Visualization of point clouds generated by different methods. We show generated pointclouds in few exemplar shapes for a fair and easier comparison regarding their sampling quality andgeometry quality. We color-code the local point density that ranges from sparse (dark blue) to dense(light yellow).
Figure 3: The diagnostic "no generator" experiment results. On the left, we show exemplarpoint clouds generated by different discriminators. On the right, we plot the training curves for theexperiments. The x- and y-axis respectively represent training iterations and Wasserstein estimates.
