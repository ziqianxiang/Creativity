Figure 1: This is a diagram of the proposed pruning method PfQ. As mentioned in subsection 3.1,the filters with a very small running variance can approximate its output by βi . At this time, bypruning the filters and correcting the bias of the next convolution using βi as described above, theDNN can be pruned without affecting the output as far as possible.
Figure 2: This is a figure comparing the dynamic range of the weights after folding BN with re-spect to using or not using PfQ. The left figure is about MobileNetV1 and the right one is aboutMobileNetV2. The blue bin is not using PfQ and the red one is using PfQ. The vertical axis is thedynamic range value (i.e. weight max - weight min), and the horizontal axis is the layer. In eachfigure of MobileNetV1 and MobileNetV2, the left side on the horizontal axis is the layer on theinput side.
Figure 3: This is the visualized channels of the first BN outputs after the first convolution in Mo-bileNetV2. The input images are apple and orange, respectively. The running variance of the channel3,5,6 are close to zero and that of the channel 0,1,2 are not close to zero.
