Figure 1: Overview ofIGSD. Illustration of ourframework in the case where we augment inputgraphs G once to get G0 for only one forwardpass. Blue and red arrows denote contrast onpositive and negative pairs respectively.
Figure 2: Semi-supervised molecular property prediction results in terms of mean absoluteerror (MAE) ratio. The hiStogram ShowS error ratio with reSpect to SuperViSed reSultS (1.0) of eVerySemi-SuperViSed modelS. Lower ScoreS are better and a model outperformS the SuperViSed baSelinewhen the Score iS leSS than 1.0.
