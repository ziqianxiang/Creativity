Figure 1: The architecture of our Transferable Feature Learning on Graphs (TFLG), which integratescross-domain graph convolution with domain adversarial learning. TFLG adopts ResNet-50 as featureextractor, and exploits both sample-level and class-level structure information by using the proposedcross-domain graph convolutional operation. CNN features and graph ebmeddings are concatenatedtogether, which are fed into label classifier and domain discriminator.
