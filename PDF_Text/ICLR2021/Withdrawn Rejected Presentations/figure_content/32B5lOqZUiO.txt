Figure 1: Illustration of the search strategy and applications of PFNAS. (a) Instead of finding a singlePareto optimal architecture, PFNAS seeks to learn the Pareto frontier. (b) PFNAS takes arbitrarybudget constraint as input and output the architecture satisfied the budget constraint.
Figure 2: The overview of the proposed PFNAS. Our PFNAS takes a budget constraint as input andproduces promising architectures that satisfy the budget constraints. The orange and green boxes in(c) denote the embeddings of the architecture Î±T and the budget w.r.t. T .
Figure 3:	Latency histograms and Pareto curves of the architectures on mobile devices. (a) Ground-truth latency histogram of 16, 000 architectures that are uniformly sampled from the search space. (b)The latency histogram of 1, 000 architectures sampled by different methods given T =110ms. (c) ThePareto frontier of the architectures sampled by different methods.
Figure 4:	Comparisons of the architectures obtained by different methods on three hardware devices.
