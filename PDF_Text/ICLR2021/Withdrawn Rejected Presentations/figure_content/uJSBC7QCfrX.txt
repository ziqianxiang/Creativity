Figure 1: Illustration of why DiCGAN can learn the user-desired data distribution. (a) DiCGAN’scritic pushes fake data towards the real desired data while WGAN’s critic pushes fake data towardsthe entire real data. (b) The change of DiCGAN’s critic direction is driven by the preference direction.
Figure 2: (a-c) Comparison of the critic in DiCGAN and WGAN. DiCGAN’s critic can assign highercritic values for real desired data than real undesired data while WGAN’s critic cannot. (d-e) Thevisualization of the generated samples from DiCGAN and WGAN. Learning the desired distributionmeans that the fake data should overlap with the real desired data only.

Figure 4:	(a) Comparison between DiCGAN and FBGAN w.r.t. #EP per epoch on MNIST inSection 5.1. (b) The generated results of FBGAN in Section 5.1.2. (c) The generated results ofFBGAN in Section 5.1.2. (d) % of desired digits (D/W) of FBGAN and DiCGAN in Section 5.1.2.
Figure 5:	Generated images by WGAN, CWGAN, FBGAN and DiCGAN. The green boxes refer tothe images which are classified as old images by a trained classifier.
Figure 6: Comparison of DiCGAN and FBGAN. (a) plots the ratio of generated zero digit to thewhole generated data (D/W) versus the training epoch for FBGAN and DiCGAN, respectively. (b)plots the ratio of generated zero digit to the whole generated data (D/W) versus the number ofsupervision for FBGAN and DiCGAN, respectively.
Figure 7: (a-b) The percentage of desired samples (D/W) versus epoch in DiCGAN (λ = 0), DiCGAN(ng = 0) and DiCGAN. (a) plots the D/W of the digit zero. (b) plots the D/W of the digit zero to four.
