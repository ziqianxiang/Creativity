Figure 1: The figure depicts the overall approachthat consists of two steps. The first step is depictedwith dotted arrows and starts from the deployednetwork weights w. In Q steps, the network is op-timized which results in weights wf . Based on thecollected information, amaskm is determined thatcharacterizes the set of weights that are rewoundto the ones of w. Therefore, the initial solutionfor the second step has weights w + δwf m.
Figure 2:	DPU is compared with other baselines on different benchmarks in terms of the test accuracy.
Figure 3:	Comparison w.r.t. the mean accuracy difference (full updating as the reference) underdifferent {∣D1∣, ∣δDr ∣} (representing the available data samples along rounds, see in Section 4) andupdating ratio (k = 0.1, 0.01) settings.
