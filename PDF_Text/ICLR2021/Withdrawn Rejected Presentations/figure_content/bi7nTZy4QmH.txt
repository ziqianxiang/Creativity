Figure 1: A flowchart of training a certifiably robust network with a perturbation budget generator.
Figure 2:	Visualization of learned perturbation budget distributions on MNIST with 0 = 0.6. Thebudget images have pixels ranging from 0 to 1 representing a per-pixel, per-example . Lighter colorsindicate larger perturbations and darker colors indicate smaller perturbations.
Figure 3:	Visualization of learned perturbation budget distributions on CIFAR-10 with 0 = 16/255.
Figure 4:	Images in the artificial Watermarked MNIST dataset and the visualization of our learnedperturbation budget distributions. The watermarked pixels must use a smaller perturbation to becorrectly recognized, and our learned perturbation correctly chooses a smaller perturbation budgetfor these pixels.
Figure 5: Images in the synthetic Doubled CIFAR-10 dataset and the visualization of our learnedperturbation budget distributions. The visualized budgets are normalized by 1.5 Ã— 16/255 similarlyas Figure 3. The generated perturbations correctly correlate with border colors.
