Figure 1: A comparison between weakly supervised object detector and our detector. Weaklysupervised object detector only detects the most discriminating part of an object, e.g., focus on headof a person when detecting a person; or being distracted by co-occurring instances, e.g., distractedby the person on the horse when detecting a horse. Our detector can address these issues.
Figure 2: Our Detection-Recognition Network (DRN) without the spatial correlation module.
Figure 3: Our spatial correlation module (SCM). Our SCM learns to capture spatial correlationamong high-confidence bounding boxes, generating a class-agnostic heatmap for the whole image.
Figure 4: Detection results on novel objects. The results are from our proposed model but withdifferent heads. The first row shows the results of the recognition head. The second row lists theresults from SCM. The third row displays the results from the detection head.
