Figure 1: (a) We sample some neurons from the first layer and list the parameters w together withsome input data on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST. It can be seen that on both tasks, the parameters(first row) look very similar to the data (second row) in some categories. This shows that the neuroncaptures the shape information, which is a meaningful feature and useful for classification. (b) Theradius-(certified accuracy) curve of our trained model on MNIST dataset.
