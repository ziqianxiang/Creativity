Figure 1: Overview of task aware multi-task learning. Task Characteristics Network (TCN) producesa task embedding to modulate the parameters of base network. Inputs to the TCN are chosen basedon type of TCN.
Figure 2: t-SNE plot of the task modulation output shows a clear demarcation between various tasksand datasets.
