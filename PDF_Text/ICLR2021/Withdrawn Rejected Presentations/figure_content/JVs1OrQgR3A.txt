Figure 1: The ACODE model with CDE-RNN encoder and CDE decoder. The CDE-RNN en-coder first runs backwards-in-time to produce an approximate posterior over the initial latent stateq (zo∣{χi,ti}N=ι,a≤t). Given a sample of zo and intervention process a(t), we can generate latentstate at any point of interest, and further generate augmented time series observations.
