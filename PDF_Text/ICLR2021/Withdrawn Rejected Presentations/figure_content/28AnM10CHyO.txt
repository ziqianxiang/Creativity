Figure 1: Squared Frobenius norm of the network Jacobian matrix, averaged over CIFAR-10 trainingdata, for various noise rates, when the network is fitted to the noisy data.
Figure 2: A network φ - dk is fitted to training data generated from f - Ck with label noisee - rk added to 10% of the labels. The original mapping (blue), the network output (red) and thenoisy training samples (*) are presented in the input domain (left) and Fourier domain (right). Thenetwork “ignores” the high frequencies stemming from the noise.
