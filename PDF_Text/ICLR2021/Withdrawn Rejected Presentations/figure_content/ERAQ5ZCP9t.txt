Figure 1: This is the outline of the Robust Multi-view AutoEncoder for 5 views. Each bottom arrowrepresents the encoder for its respective view, and each upper arrow represents the decoder. Li isthe encoding for view i and LS is the global latent representation. The bottom arrows are dotted torepresent potential drop-out during training time.
Figure 2: Train and test reconstruction error vs. number of views for different AE competitors. Thisplot also shows the 1-sigma confidence interval for different choices of available views.

Figure 4: This figure shows samples as generated from the simple gaussian and AR base distributionsas they compare with test samples from the true distribution.
