Figure 1: Diagrams that describe the methods of sampling the weight parameters for (a) withadversarial-BNN and (b) the proposed method. The weight parameters in (a) are sampled fromthe Gaussian distribution q(w) as an approximate posterior through variational inference, and thosein (b) are sampled from the Normal-Inverse Gamma distribution q(μ, σ2) as an approximate conju-gate prior through hierarchical variational inference. Red circles denote the learning parameters inthe BNN, black circles denote the random variables sampled from the described probability distri-butions, and the black arrows indicate the sampling order.
Figure 2: Comparison of classification accuracy under PGD attack (first row) and EOT-PGD attack(second row) to the L∞ perturbation magnitude on different datasets: CIFAR-10, STL-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet.
Figure 3: Comparison of classification accuracy for two ablation studies: (a) attacking with higherperturbation magnitude (δ > 0.03) than the maximum magnitude described in Fig. 2 on baselinenetworks (VGG, Model A) for CIFAR-10 and STL-10, (b) adversarial training with large perturba-tion magnitude (δ = 0.06) on WideResNet for CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. These graphs are underPGD attack (first row) and EOT-PGD attack (second row) to the L∞ perturbation magnitude.
