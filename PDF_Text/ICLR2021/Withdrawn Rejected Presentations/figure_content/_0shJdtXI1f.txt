Figure 1: Empirical comparison of training dynamics between the optimization objectives of two frameworks.
Figure 2: Risk-controlled face recognition on IJB-A, IJB-B and IJB-C.
Figure 3: Identity versus concentration value. Each row corresponds to one single identity sorted from left toright with concentration values decreasing.
Figure 4: Empirical correlation (bottom)between cosine value CoS hμ(x), Wχ∈ciand concentration value κ and its marginal-ized empirical density of cosine value (top)on two backbones.
Figure 5: False negative examples made by PFE while being true positive by HypersFace, where cos θ is thecosine distance of a verification pair xι, x2, s(∙, ∙) is mutual likelihood score and κι, κ2 are the CorresPond-ing concentration values. Thresholds are set to -1254.677 and -1364.735 for PFE (accuracy: 88.210) andHypersFace (accuracy: 88.883), respectively, on the CPLFW benchmark.
