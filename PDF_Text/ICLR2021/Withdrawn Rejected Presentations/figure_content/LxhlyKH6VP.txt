Figure 1: Architecture of our network, ProGAE, that generates protein conformations via separateencoding of data related to coarse intrinsic and extrinsic geometries. These geometries are capturedvia the orientation of the backbone bonds (extrinsic) and length of Cα - Cα pseudobonds (intrinsic).
Figure 2: Reconstructions of protein frames from S protein and hACE2 test data using ProGAE.
Figure 3: The embedding of the data in the projection of the latent space to the first two canonicalvectors between the intrinsic and extrinsic latent space. Color indicates the identity of the drug thatthe protein is bound to within that frame. Clustering by drug identity is apparent in the extrinsiclatent space, but not the intrinsic latent space. This aligns with results in Table 2.
Figure 4: Error of the non-bonded distance between the backbone atoms for generated structurescompared to the protein at its initiation. Each point corresponds to a structure generated by samplingthe latent space via the plane of the two specified principal components of the latent spaces. Theintrinsic latent code hardly affects the non-bonded distance error, unlike the extrinsic latent code.
Figure 5: RMSD of proteins generated along the latent interpolation between two proteins fromdifferent trajectories. The RMSDs are computed with respect to the endpoint proteins, with meanand standard error shown. We see a smooth interpolation between the RMSD errors as desired.
