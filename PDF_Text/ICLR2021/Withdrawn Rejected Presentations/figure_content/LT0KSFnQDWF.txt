Figure 1: Node (left) and edge (right) in-duced subgraph counting for a 3-cycle anda 3-path. Counts are reported for the bluenode on the left and for the blue edge on theright. Different colors depict orbits.
Figure 2: (Left) Decalin and Bicyclopentyl: Non-isomorphic molecular graphs than can be distin-guished by GSN, but not the by the WL test (Sato, 2020) (nodes represent carbon atoms and edgeschemical bonds). (Right) Rook’s 4x4 graph and the Shrikhande graph: the smallest pair of stronglyregular non-isomorphic graphs with the same parameters SR(16,6,2,2). GSN can distinguish themwith 4-clique counts, while 2-FWL fails.
Figure 3: Empirical (solid) vs worst case (dashed) runtime for different graph distributions (inseconds, log scale). For each distribution we count the best performing (and frequent) substructuresof increasing sizes k.
Figure 4: Train (dashed) and test (solid) MAEsfor Path- and Cycle-GSN-EF as a function of thesubstructure maximum size k. Vertical bars in-dicate standard deviation; horizontal bars depictdisambiguation/uniqueness scores δ.
Figure 5: SR graphs isomorphism test (log scale,smaller values are better). Different colours indi-cate different substructure sizes.
Figure 6: Train (dashed) and test (solid) MAEs for GSN-EF(blue) and MPNN-EF(red) as a functionof the dataset fraction employed in training.
