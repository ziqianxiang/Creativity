Figure 1: updating scheme for centraldifference method3.1	Mathematical MotivationRecurrent neural network including LSTM is an artificialneural network structure of the form (Lipton et al., 2015):ht = σ(Whxxt + Whhht-I + bh) ≡ σ0,(xt, ht-1) ≡ σb(x0, x1, x2,…,xt) ,	(3.1.1)where xt ∈ Rd is the input data of the tth state and ht-1 ∈ Rh denotes the processed value in itsprevious state by the hidden layers. The output yt of the current state is updated by the current statevalue ht:yt =σ(Whyht+by)	(3.1.2)≡ σc(ht) ≡ σd(x0, x1, x2,…，Xt) .	(3.1.3)Here WhX ∈ Rh×d, Whh ∈ Rh×h, Why ∈ Rh×h are the matrix of weights, vectors bh, by ∈ Rhare the coefficients of bias, and σ, o。，σb, σc, σd are corresponded activation and mapping functions.
Figure 3: Neural-PDE3.2	Neural-PDEIn particular, We use the bidirectional LSTM (Hochreiter &SChmidhuber, 1997; Graves & Schmidhuber, 2005) to betterretain the state information from data on grid points whichare neighbourhoods in the mesh but far away in input matrix.

Figure 7: Predicted data by Neural-PDE (first row) and the exact data (second row) of volume fractionφ (column 1-3) and pressure p (column 4-6). The graphs of each columns 1-3 and 4-6 represent thetime states of t1, t2, t3, where 0 ≤ t1 < t2 < t3 ≤ 1.
Figure 8: δx = 1 × 10-2, δt = 1 × 10-3, MSE: 7.4444 × 10-5, the whole time period length isnt = 2000 and the mesh grid size is 101, the test dataset size is 14 and thus the total discrete testingtime period is 140, figure (a) and figure(b) are the heat map for the exact test data and our predictedtest data. Figire(c) shows both training and cross-validation errors of Neural-PDE convergent within10 epochs.
Figure 9: We selected the final states for computation and the results indicate that Neural-PDE isrobust in capturing the physical laws of wave equation and predicting the sequence time period.
Figure 10: δx = 0.02, δy = 0.02, δt = 10-4, MSE: 7.0741 × 10-6, the size of the test data is 10and the test time period is 140.
Figure 11: figure (a) is the exact solution u(x, y, t = 0.15) at the final state and figure (b) is themodel’s prediction. Figure (c) is the error map.
