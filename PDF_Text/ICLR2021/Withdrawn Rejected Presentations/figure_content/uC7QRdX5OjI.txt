Figure 1: Setting and character information for both self and partner characters as taken from LIGHT.
Figure 2: Motivations with different levels of abstractions and corresponding sequence of timelineactions in chronological order for the self character in LIGHT-Quests. There are 7486 quests in total.
Figure 3: Example of a demonstration of a human (blue shaded) completing the above quest whilerole-playing as the self character with a partner agent (grey shaded). There are 2111 such humandemonstrations of average sequence length 12.92, consisting of 22672 dialogues in total.
