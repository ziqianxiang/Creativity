Figure 1: Schematic diagram of the proposed graph autoencoder framework. We plot graphs inspatial domain together with their signal coefficients in spectral domain. In the encoding stage, werun a GCN model to derive smoothed node representations and obtain coarse-grained graph via apool layer. In the decoding stage, we upscale the coarsened graph back and reconstruct the graphsignal via a GDN model.

Figure 3: Illustration of road occupancy rates decoded by different approaches at 5pm on JUne 24,2020 in District 7 of California. A darker color implies a higher road occupancy rate. In eachfigure above, We plot the reconstructed signal in spatial domain together with coefficients in spectraldomain. (a) the original, (b) inverse GCN (RMSE = 0.11), (c) GDN/our model (RMSE = 0.07), (d)GCN (RMSE = 0.09).
