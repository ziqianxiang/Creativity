Figure 2: Targeted adversarial attacks on encoder trained on MNIST (top) and CelebA (bottom).
Figure 3: Reconstruction of images from the standard test set from a model trained on (xs + δ, xt)pairs.
Figure 4: Sample input and reconstructions for autoencoder trained on (δt , xt) pairs. Targetedperturbation computed using samples from the test set as targets xt (top row) and correspondingdecoder output (second row). Original target image (third row) with corresponding decoder output(last row). An autoencoder trained on (δt, xt) pairs learns to reconstruct target images xt fromcorresponding perturbations δt yet fails to decode images from the standard test set.
Figure 5: The perturbation δ0 added to the input X induces a perturbation δ1 on the hidden repre-sentation Γ.
