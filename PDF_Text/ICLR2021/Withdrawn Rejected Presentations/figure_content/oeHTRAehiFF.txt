Figure 1: The structure of Extractor plus Graph Search Based Solver pipeline3.2 Extractor plus Graph Search Based SolverAs the second baseline, We build an extractor plus solver pipeline. First, We employ the extractor toextract the target variable and conditions from the question text. The target variable and conditionsare represented as triplets as described in the above Data Annotation Section. Second, we employa graph search based solver to take triplets as input and execute pre-defined functions in chemistrydomain to get the final answer. Figure 1 shows the structure of the extractor plus solver pipeline.

For a chemical calculation problem, there is only one target variable but probablymore than one conditions. Thus, annotators are free to add condition block. Usually, the interface forquestion variables and conditions are different even for the same type of annotations. For a variableor condition block will be first ask to choose a type of annotation, and then the page will show theinterface of it. Table 8 shows interfaces for all types of annotations.
