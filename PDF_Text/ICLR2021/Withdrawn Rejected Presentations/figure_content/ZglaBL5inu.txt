Figure 2: (Left) AiO are pairwise parallel lines in the sense of Gauss (Bonola, 2012); (Middle) Afamily of horocycles tangential to O ; (Right) Each Horocycle is a locus of corresponding points(Bonola, 2012)[p.73] of parallel lines. This fact justifies that horocycles are analogs of hyperplanes.
Figure 3: (Left) Horocycle decision hypersurface. Colored points form a Poincare embedding ofWordNet nouns in H2. The yellow point is group.n.01. Points from the subtree rooted at group.n.01are in red, and the rest are in blue. The green horocycle separates the blue and the red. (Right)End-based clustering and geodesic decision hypersurfaces. It is an embedding of CIFAR-10 in H2 .
Figure 4: Prediction probabilities of classifiers. Suppose the classification task has 10classes. Let NNθ : RD →R2 be the feature descriptor, X the input, and x=NNθ (X). LetWi=(Cos ((i-1)π∕5),sin ((i-1)π∕5))(1≤i≤10). (Left) pθ(Y = C1 |x) on R2 when score functionsare Poisson neurons SCj(X) = BatchNorm(Pρw ,-1,0(x)). (Right) pθ(Y = C1 |x) on R2 when scorefunctions are SCj (X) = (x, wj )E .
Figure 5: End-based clusters of MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10. Test error rates from theleft to the right: 0.63%, 9.98%, 8.42%. The performance for CIFAR-10 is better than Fashion-MNISTbecause NN0θ is of a ResNet-32 structure for CIFAR-10 but of only four convolutional layers forFashion-MNIST. Thin diamonds are prototypes, and shallow areas are decision regions.
Figure 6: Keras’MLR and our Poisson MLR on the task of flowers. Figure 4 explains this experiment.
Figure 7: Poisson neuron Pt(1a,n0h),-1/3,0. The level sets of a Poisson neuron Pρw,λ,b are horocycles ofthe ball {x : |x| < |w|} that are tangential to {x : |x| = |w|} at w and their inverses with respect to{x : |x| = |w|}.
