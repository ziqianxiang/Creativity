Figure 1: The accuracy-complexity trade-off of differentiable NAS methods. GOLD-NAS achieves better Pareto-fronts comparedto other methods.
Figure 2: The first (with the highest efficiency) and last (with the highest accuracy) architecturesfound by two search procedures with μ = 1 (left) and μ = 0 (right). The red thin, blue thick, andblack dashed arrows indicate skip-connect, sep-conv-3x3, and concatenation, respectively. Thisfigure is best viewed in a colored and zoomed-in document.
Figure 3: Three architecturesfound on ImageNet. The redthin, blue thick, and blackdashed arrows indicate skip-connect, sep-conv-3x3, andconcatenation, respectively.
Figure 4: Visualization of two search pro-cedures on CIFAR10 with η = 0 (blue) andη = 1 (red), respectively. λ zigzags from0 to a large value, and the FLOPs of thesuper-network goes down.
Figure 5: All architectures searched on CIFAR10 during two pruning procedures, η = 1 on theleft side, η = 0 on the right side. The red thin, blue thick, and black dashed arrows indicate skip-connect, sep-conv-3x3, and concatenation, respectively. This figure is best viewed in a coloredand zoomed-in document.
Figure 6: All architectures searched on CIFAR10 in S1-S5. The red thin, blue thick, and black dashedarrows indicate skip-connect, sep-conv-3x3, and concatenation, respectively. Other operators arepresented using solid arrows: bright orange for max-pool-3x3, light blue for sep-conv-5x5, darkorange for avg-pool-3x3, bright purple for dil-conv-3x3, dark purple (magenta) for dil-conv-5x5.
Figure 7: All architectures searched on ImageNet. The red thin, blue thick, and black dashed arrowsindicate skip-connect, sep-conv-3x3, and concatenation, respectively. This figure is best viewedin a colored and zoomed-in document.
