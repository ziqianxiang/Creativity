Figure 1: Divide-and-Conquer Monte Carlo Tree Search (DC-MCTS).
Figure 2: Left: Two grid-world maze examples for wall density d = 0.75 and 0.95. In light blue, the distributionover sub-goals induced by the policy prior p that guides the DC-MCTS planner. Right group: The first sub-goal,i.e. at depth 0 of the solution tree, approximately splits the problem in half. Next, the two sub-goals at depth 1.
Figure 4: The ‘ant’, i.e. the agent,should navigate to the green target.
Figure 5: Fraction of solved mazesvs. planning budget.
Figure 6: Only colored nodes are part of the final plan: a sub-tree for DC-MCTS, a chain for MCTS.
Figure 7: Divide and conquer Tree search is strictly more general than both forward and backwardsearch.
Figure 8: Solved mazes with Divide and Conquer MCTS. ■ = start, ■ = goal, ■ = wall, ■=walkable. Overlapping numbers are due to the agent back-tracking while refining finer sub-goals.
