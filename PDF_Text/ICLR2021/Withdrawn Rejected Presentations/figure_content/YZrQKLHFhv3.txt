Figure 2: Training (dotted) and test accuracyon ImageNet using suggested regimes (224evaluation size). All regimes required similarresources per step. B+ regime required ≈2.7× less steps per epoch.
Figure 3: (a): Test accuracy on validation set per image size, all models trained using the samecomputational and memory resources (regime D+). (b): Test accuracy per Gflop (at evaluation).

Figure 5: Training (dotted) and test accuracy vs optimization step (ResNet44, CIFAR10). We com-pare vanilla training with two computationally equivalent stochastic regimes: increased duplicates(D+) and increased batch (B+). B+ regime achieves better test accuracy at a reduced numberof iterations, while D+ improves accuracy further at a similar computational cost.
Figure 6: Impact of gradient smoothing on CIFAR10, ResNet-44. The training regime includestwo image sizes: 32 × 32 and 16 × 16 (average size is S = 24). Using a B+ regime createstwo batch sizes: 256 and 2, 048 respectively. Gradient norm values are shown with and withoutGrad-smoothing. Solid lines are gradients for S = 32 while dotted lines are for S = 16. Gradientsmoothing helps to reduce gap between gradient norms at difference batch sizes.
Figure 7: Impact of gradient smoothing on ImageNet, ResNet50. Shown are the validation andtraining (dashed) top-1 accuracy using gradient smoothing and without it. The training regime usedis B+ using an average size of 144 × 144 (s(144)•	Increase image size from small to large (progressive resizing), where each image size isused for number of epochs Ei = piEtotal, where Etotal is the total number training epochsrequired.
Figure 8: Test accuracy vs step (ResNet44 on CIFAR10, B+ with s(28)) for 3 size sampling regimes:(1) From small to large (2) Sample each Epoch (3) Sample each step. All methods reached a similaraccuracy, but sampling each epoch was less noisy and did not require hyper-parameter tuning.
