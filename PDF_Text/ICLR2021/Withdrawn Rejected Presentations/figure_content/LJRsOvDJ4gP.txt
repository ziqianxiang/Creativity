Figure 1: The relation between an assumed target rank and the corresponding self-rank. (a) Reconstructionerror of the truncated SVD for 52,000 images from the CMU Multi-PIE face dataset. In order to reach belowFigure 2: (a) The set of first 9 spectral components a.k.a. Eigen (Fisher) faces for 52,000 images from CMUMulti-PIE dataset. Linear combination of these components is able to reconstruct all 52,000 images with anaverage error less than 25%. (b) A subset of dataset with 15 images is found such that their span is as accurate asthe span of the first 9 spectral components.

Figure 3: A synthetic dataset is generated With Self-rank equal to 20 with EK = 0.1. There are 20 basesamples in the dataset Which are unknoWn. This figureshoWs the probability of capturing the base samplesin the sampled subset.
Figure 4: The averaged cost function of CSSP for selecting K samples from each class of Multi-pie face datasetwith 130,000 images. The projection error is normalized by the projection error of the best rank-K approximation.
Figure 5: Comparison between the accuracy ofMNIST classification task when a portion of each classis sampled. In this scenario, K-mediods performs evenworse than random selection and the performance ofSMRS and dual volume sampling are close to thatof random selection. The vertical lines show a 95%confidence interval.
