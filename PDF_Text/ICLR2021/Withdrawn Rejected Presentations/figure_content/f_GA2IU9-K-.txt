Figure 1: Quantile estimates obtained by (a) IQN, (b) mere incremental structure and (c) NDQFNunder 50M training on Breakout. τ and τ0 denote two sets of sampled quantile fractions from twodifferent training iterations.
Figure 2: The network architecture of NDQFN.
Figure 3: Training curve on Atari games for NDQFN and IQN.
Figure 4: Comparison between NDQFN+DPE and IQN+DPE.
Figure 5: Comparison between DPE and DLTV.
Figure 6: Cumulative rewards performance comparison between our method and IQN with 200Mtraining frames. The bars represent relative gain/loss of NDQFN+DPE over IQN.
