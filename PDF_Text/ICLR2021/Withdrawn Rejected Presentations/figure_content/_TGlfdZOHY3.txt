Figure 1: Batch exploitation during training for Prototypical Networks (Snell et al., 2017) (left) vs. Neigh-borhood Component Analysis (Goldberger et al., 2005) (right) on a toy few-shot problem of3 “ways”, 3 “shots”and 1 “query” per class. By dividing batches between support set S and query set Q, Prototypical Networksdisregards many of the distances between labelled examples that would constitute useful training signal. Detailsin Sec. 3.3.
Figure 2: 1-shot (left) and 5-shot accuracies (right) on the val. set of CIFAR-FS. Models trained using NCA,or Proto-nets with different configurations: 1-shot with a=8 and 5-shot with a=8, 16 or 32. Values correspondto the mean accuracy of five models trained with different random seeds. Please see Sec. 4.2 for details.
Figure 3: 1-shot and 5-shot accuracies on the miniImageNet test set for models trained with a batch size of256 while only sampling a % of the total number of available pairs. Reported values correspond to the meanaccuracy of five models trained with different random seeds. Individual points contain models trained usingPNs which are plotted on the x-axis based on the relative percentage of distance pairs that are used in theircomputation compared to NCA on the same batch size. Please see Sec. 4.2 for details.

Figure 5: 1-shot (left) and 5-shot accuracies (right) on the validation set of miniImageNet for different batchsizes. Models are trained using NCA or Proto-nets with different configurations: 1-shot with a = 8 and 5-shotwith a = 8, 16 or 32. Reported values correspond to the mean accuracy of five models trained with differentrandom seeds. Please see Sec. 4.2 for details.
