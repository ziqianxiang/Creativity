Figure 1: Illustration of TOMA. We will pick up some states as landmarks (colored triangles) in thestate space of the original MDP M . Each landmark li is a one-to-one correspondence to a vertex vi(colored circles) in graph G and covers some areas in S. Embedding φθ is trained by self-supervisedlearning. We will label each state on a trajectory with a corresponding vertex and use it to generatethe graph dynamically.
Figure 2: (a) 2D world observations (above) and maps (below). (b) The generated graph of different2D world environments under different types of observation. Each connected colored segmentindicates a vertex with its state coverage. The blue line connecting two segments denotes an edgeconnecting the corresponding two vertices.

Figure 5: Reached distance of TOMA-VM, TOMA and HER. We also plot the mean of the reacheddistance for Snake maze experiments. TOMA-VM consistently performs better than the baselinemethod HER which gets stuck at local minima due to the lack of graph guidance.
