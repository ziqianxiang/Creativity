Figure 1: The idea of “smoothing” a piece-wise linear low-dimensional embedding model: (a)The piece-wise linear low-dimensional embedding model built from LPP; (b) The regularized low-dimensional embedding by taking Stiefel/Grassmann manifold center-of-mass among adjacent lin-ear pieces.
Figure 2: There are I = 3 nearby subsets C1, C2, C3 with means m1, m2, m3 in the training set.
Figure 3: Comparison of the PCA Recovery Errors: Blue = benchmark case using closest subsetPCA recovery, with the error sorted from low to high; Red = using SIM-I based on Stiefel center-of-mass and d(W1, W2) = kW1 - W2 kF.
Figure 4: Differences Errojc — Error_bm in descending order.
