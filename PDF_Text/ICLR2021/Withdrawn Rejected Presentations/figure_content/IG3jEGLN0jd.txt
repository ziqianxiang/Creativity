Figure 1:	Topic modeling simulations. Left: Average total variation distance between topics. Right:Topic recovery accuracy for contrastive models. Total number of documents sampled = 6M Ã— rate.
Figure 2:	Experiments with AG news dataset. Top left: test accuracy of methods as we increase thenumber of supervised training examples. Bottom left: Landmark-NCE performance as we varynumber of landmarks. Top middle: Direct-NCE performance as we vary network depth. Bottommiddle: Relationship between contrastive error and test accuracy for Direct-NCE. Right: t-SNEvisualizations of Direct-NCE and word2vec embeddings.
