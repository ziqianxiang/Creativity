Figure 1: The epoch number whereoverfitting happens for FastAdv withthe piecewise learning rate schedule,versus the best clean (orange) and ro-bust (green) accuracy before overfit-ting. The solid lines and dashed linesare the clean and robust accuracy forFastAdv with cyclic learning rates andPGD adversarial training with piece-wise learning rates.
Figure 2: Comparison of a success mode (orange) and afailure mode (green) of fast adversarial training for 30 epochs.
Figure 3: Validation clean and robust accuracy evaluated for every 20 batches. (a) Fast adversarialtraining. (b) FGSM with no randomized initialization but using PGD to mitigate overfitting. (c)FGSM with randomized initialization and PGD to mitigate overfitting. All training uses the samepiecewise learning rate schedule.
Figure 4: Robust accuracy on a validation set,evaluated for FastAdv+, PGD adversarial train-ing, FastAdvW with a constant perturbation size= 8/255, and with = 4/255 and 8/255 intwo stages.
Figure 5: Robust accuracy under 10-step PGD with step sizes from 0 to 12/255. The evaluations areperformed on (a) PreAct ResNet-18 and (b) Wide-ResNet 34-10 for classifying CIFAR-10. We alsoinclude results for PGD-AT, FastAdv for comparison.
