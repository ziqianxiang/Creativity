Figure 1: The general architecture of Neural ODEs. We assume a classification task in this figure.
Figure 2: The overall workflow of our proposed method. We note that the Neural ODE and theauxiliary integrator selection network cooperate with each other.
Figure 3: Visualization of the transformation process from the Gaussian noise to the target distribu-tion. (a-e) are by our regularization, (g-k) are by the L1 regularization, (m-q) are with the kineticenergy regularization.
