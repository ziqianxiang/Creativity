Figure 1: INS-DS With symptom-inquiry and introspection module. In the SymPtom-inquiry module, thecurrent dialogue state St is fed to the policy network to choose a candidate symptom i. Then, in the introspectivemodule, St is further intervened by setting the value of symptom i with all possible values to generate multipleone-step-look-ahead s0t+1 s. These s0t+1 s are forwarded to the disease classifier to predict the diseases. Theintrospection module will choose to inform the disease if all predicted diseases are the same, otherwise, theagent will continue to inquire about the symptom i.
