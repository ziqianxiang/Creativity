Figure 3: Ablation studies of temperature T on DDNet performance (FloWQA, SDNet, BERT, AL-BERT). Red and blue denote the results on CoQA dev and SPoken-CoQA test set, respectively.
Figure 4: Examples of the log-mel spectrograms and the corresponding MFCC feature embedding. Itcan see that the log-mel spectrograms corresponds to different example sentences from the Spoken-CoQA dataset.
