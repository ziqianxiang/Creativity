Figure 1: Visualization of inverted CIFAR-10 Krizhevsky (2009) inputs from the thirdbottleneck of ResNet-18 He et al. (2016) using the inversion algorithm in Section 5.2. Weprune the network with different kâ€™s, the fraction of remained weights. Inverted images fromnetworks with fewer weights are visually more different from the original image.
Figure 2: Recovered MNIST digits (a) and CIFAR-10 samples (b) by running the modelinversion attack in Section 5.2 on LeNet-5 and ResNet-18 models trained with pruning. Wetest different layers (different rows) and fractions of remained weights (k, different columns).
