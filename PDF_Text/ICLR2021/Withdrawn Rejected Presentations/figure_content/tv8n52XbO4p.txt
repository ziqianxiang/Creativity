Figure 1: Overview of Meta-Noise Generator with Adversarial Consistency (MNG-AC). First,we stochastically sample a perturbation to generate the adversarial examples Xadv . The generator gφtakes stochastic noise and input X clean to generate the noise-augmented sample Xaug . The classifierfθ then minimizes the stochastic adversarial classification loss and the adversarial consistency loss.
