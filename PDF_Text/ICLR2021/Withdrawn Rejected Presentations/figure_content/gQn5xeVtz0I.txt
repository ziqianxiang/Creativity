Figure 3: Face (Batch reconstruction): Mini-batch contains 5 images, and we show partial recon-struction for 10 (col.1), 30 (col.2), 50(col.3), 90 (col.4) and final (col.5) iteration for Zhu et al.
Figure 1: ECG: Leftmost one is final reconstruction by our method, whereas the middle one isproduced by Zhu et al. (2019). Rightmost plot shows that our method converges much faster thanZhu et al. (2019).
Figure 2: FMRI: The plots (first row) are produced by Zhu et al. (2019), and it shows the reconstruc-tions after 20, 40, 80, and final iteration accordingly, whereas the second row is our reconstruction.
Figure 4: MNIST (Batch reconstruction): 4a shows the final reconstruction without any regularizer;as a comparison, with regularizer is shown in 4b. Moreover, the full reconstructions of 4b are shownin 4c, 4d, 4e and 4f. We plot every 5k iterations.

Numerical comparison sees Table 6f. One-layer CNN: Distance decreases withincreasing number of filters (kernels). First row is the number of filters, and second row is the sizeof filtered images, which is decided by the number of filters with the fixed kernel, padding and stridesize. When the size of filtered image is exactly equal to original input size (12 filters), we can almostperfectly reconstruct it (L1 distance is 0.09, with λ starts from 0.1)Filters Params.

Figure 7: CIFAR100 reconstruction with batch size 4 with 12 and 48 filters. λ starts from 0.1, andgradually decays.
Figure 8: CELL: The first row corresponds to the reconstruction by Zhu et al. (2019), for 10, 20,30,and final iteration, whereas the second row is produced by our method.
Figure 9: Cifar100: We show partial reconstruction for 10 (col.1), 30 (col.2), 90 (col.3) and final(col.4) iteration. The odd number of rows (1,3) are produced by Zhu et al. (2019) and even numberof rows (2,4) are produced by our method. The corresponding log-scale loss is shown under thereconstruction procedure.
