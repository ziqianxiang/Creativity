Figure 1: The architecture of the multivariate symbolic function learner (MSFL). Top: The neuralrepresentation of a single operator (interior) node in the symbolic parse tree. The operator functionp takes in two child node as input and applies all available operators on their values. The discretizedsoftmax function s0 is a gate that allows exactly one of these operators to pass through, determinedby learnable weight Ï‰. This output is then scaled by learnable weight w. (Note: bias scalars b areomitted from the diagram to save space.) Bottom: After an initial layer of leaf nodes which combinein a fully connected fashion, a series of operator nodes form the template of a balanced binary parsetree. The weight parameters determine how to interpret this tree as a single, well-formed symbolicmathematical expression f over multiple variables.
