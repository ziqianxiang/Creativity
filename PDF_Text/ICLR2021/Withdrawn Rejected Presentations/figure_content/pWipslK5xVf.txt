Figure 1: Accuracy begins to drop when the uncertain measure μ begins to diverge from V. Inclassification models with vanilla cross entropy losses, the uncertain measure μ can easily divergefrom V in the Wasserstein space (the red dotted line in (a)), which induces an accuracy drop (the reddotted line in (b)). By contrast, the proposed WDN can prevent such divergence by normalizing μonto Wasserstein ambiguity set BW2 (V, ε) (the black dotted line in (a)) and can consistently enhanceaccuracy as iteration proceeds (the black line in (b)). Please note that d1 and d2 denote the first andsecond terms in equation 5, respectively, and ε = d1 + d2 .
