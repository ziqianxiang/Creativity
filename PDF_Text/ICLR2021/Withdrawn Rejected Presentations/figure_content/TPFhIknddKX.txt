Figure 1: The perplexity of the routing policy in each layer during training.
Figure 2: Pairwise cosine similarities of the policy layer for the 20 tasks of CIFAR-100 when usingthe “warm up” strategy. Light orange pixels denote similarity of 1 (policy layers are the same), whileon the other end of the spectrum dark purple denote similarity of 0 (policy layers are orthogonal).
