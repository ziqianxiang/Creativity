Figure 1: Learned density visualization. We randomly sample test states s and multiple test actionsas per test state, both from a uniform distribution, then visualize the log marginal log qφ(s) =log P qφ (s, as) projected onto two state dimensions: one corresponding to forward velocity andthe other a random selection. Much like true reward function in Mujoco environments, we found thatthe log marginal positively correlates with forward velocity on 4/5 tasks.
