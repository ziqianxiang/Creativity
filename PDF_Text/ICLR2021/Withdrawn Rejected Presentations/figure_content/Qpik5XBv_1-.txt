Figure 1: Overview of our model.
Figure 2: Some correct predictions of our model on UNC validation set. First column shows theinput images and others show the predictions for the given referring expressions.
Figure 3: Some incorrect predictions of our model on UNC validation set. Each group (a-d) showsone pattern we observed within the predictions. In each group, the first column shows the originalimage, the second one is the ground truth mask and the third one is the prediction of our model.
