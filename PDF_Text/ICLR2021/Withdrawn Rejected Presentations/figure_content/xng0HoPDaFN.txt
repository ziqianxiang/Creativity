Figure 3: Comparison of perturbations and adversarial examples crafted by PGD, C&W and FCRsattack on the two datasets. Obviously, our proposed method only destroys critical semantics andreduces image distortion. (Our constraint on the `2 norm of the three methods is 2 and 45.)these two methods. On the CIFAR-10, the performance of JSMA is lower than the FCRs attack(ASR: 90.33% vs 100.00%); and its `2 distortion is very large. On the ILSVRC2012, our methodoutperforms it in all metrics. We choose to attack 5 pixels for the one-pixel attack. On the CIFAR-10, one-pixel attack is not only large in `2 distortion, but also has poor attack performance. On theILSVRC2012, although the `2 distortion of the one-pixel attack is the smallest, its attack successrate is only 40.56% and we observe that the one-pixel attack requires a lot of memory during the ex-periments. Thus we observe that the reduction of attack semantics does not reduce the performanceof FCRs attack.
