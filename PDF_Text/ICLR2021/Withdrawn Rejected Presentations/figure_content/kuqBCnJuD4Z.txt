Figure 1: FedMes: the proposed federated learning algorithm leveraging multiple edge servers (ESs). The devicesin the overlapping areas can act as bridges for sharing the trained models between ESs. When a specific ESis given a biased dataset within its coverage, giving more weights to the devices located in the overlappingregions (in each aggregation step at the ESs) can further speed up training. Our design targets latency-sensitiveapplications where edge-based federated learning is essential, e.g., when a number of cars/drones should quicklyadapt to the current situation by cooperation (federated learning) and make the right decision.

Figure 5: Test accuracy versus tc. The test accuracies are computed at a specific time slot. 1) IID: time 30, 80, 80for MNIST, FMNIST, CIFAR10. 2) (device nonIID, cell IID): time 40, 80, 400 for MNIST, FMNIST, CIFAR10.
