Figure 1: Geometric illustration of the difference between loss filtering and gradient norm filtering.
Figure 2: CelebA Testing Curve During Training. X axis represents the epoch number, Y axisrepresents the testing r-square. In some experiment, there is no cure for Standard and NormClipsince they gave negative r-square, which will effect the plotting scale. The shadow represents theconfidence interval, which is calculated across 5 random seed. As we see, PRL(G), PRL(L), andCo-PRL(L) are robust against different types of corruptions.
Figure 3: CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 Testing Curve During Training. X axis represents the epochnumber, Y axis represents the testing accuracy. The shadow represents the confidence interval,which is calculated across 3 random seed. As we see, IGFilter(L), and Co-IGFilter(L) are robustagainst different types of corruptions.
