Figure 2: Example of how one can make a decision amonggood cluster similarity indices.
Figure 3: The reference clustering of Appendix F.3 (n = 924 and kA = 431) is compared to randomclusterings. Each clustering consists of k approximately equally-sized clusters, where k is variedbetween 2 and 512. For each k, 200 random clusterings are generated. For each index, we plot theaverage score, along with a 90% confidence band.
Figure 4: The reference clustering of Appendix F.3 (n = 924 and kA = 431) is compared to randomclusterings. Each clustering consists of 31 “small” clusters of size s while the last cluster has size924 - 31 ∙ s, where S is varied between 1 and 28. For each s, 200 random clusterings are generated.
Figure 5: Inconsistency of indices: each row corresponds to a triplet of partitions, shapes denote thereference partitions, the captions indicate which indices favor the corresponding candidate.
