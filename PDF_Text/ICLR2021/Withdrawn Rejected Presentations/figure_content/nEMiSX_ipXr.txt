Figure 1: Examples of confusing near image pairs with different classes of MNIST training dataset(LeCun et al., 2010). The l2 norms of the pairs are 2.399, 3.100 and 3.131 from left to right. Fromthese examples, we can say the exclusive class assumption in the problem setting can be violated.
Figure 2: Plots of p(x|c = -1): red and p(x|c = 1): blue for first toy example.
Figure 3: Plots of three classifiers. Top: f1(x) = step(x - 1). Middle: f2(x) = 1 - step(x + 4) +step(x). Bottom: f3(x) = step(x) where step(x) = 1 for x â‰¥ 0 and step(x) = -1 for x < 0.
Figure 4: Change of standard adversarial accuracy for f1(x), f2 (x) and f3(x) from top to bottom.
Figure 5: Two-dimensional sunset dataset class A: red and class B: blue. The colored figure showsthat the points on class A resemble the shape of the sun and the points on class B resemble the shapeof the horizon.
Figure 6: Change of genuine adversarial accuracy agen; exact(e) for f1(X), f2(X), and f3(X) byexact perturbation norm e from top to bottom. Details for calculation is explained in Section A ofthe appendix.
