Figure 1: (a) Traditional homoge-neous model transfer. It requiresthat source and target models sharean identical backbone. For exam-ple, the first five layers, weights canbe copied from the source model tothe target model. (b) Heterogeneousmodel transfer. It focuses on trans-ferring inconsistent weights from asource model to a target model (Bestviewed in color).
Figure 2: Illustration of the coupled relation-ship in a chain. (a) Before weight permuta-tion. W1 = [0.5, 0.3,0.1;0.2,0.7, 0.4], W2 =[0.6,0.4; 0.1,0.8; 0.9,0.3].	(b) After permuta-tion. W*1 = [0.3,0.5, 0.1;0.7, 0.2,0.4], W*2 =[0.1,0.8; 0.6,0.4; 0.9,0.3]. We observe that if Wepermute the columns of W1 and want to preservethe input-output mapping, we need to permutethe corresponding rows of W2. (Best viewed incolor).

Figure 4: (a) Longest chain. In this example, L； → L →L3 → L4 is the longest chain. (b) Cyclic stack. A 3-channelsource filter is recursively stacked, which is used to select thefirst five channels for a 5-channel target filter (Best viewed incolor).
