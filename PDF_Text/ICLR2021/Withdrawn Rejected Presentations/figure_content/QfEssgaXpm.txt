Figure 1: Phase trajectories of the agents trained by L-REINFORCE, REINFORCE, and SAC. TheX-axis denotes the position x and the Y-axis denotes the angle Î¸ in rads. The trajectories are of 500timesteps and the states at different instants are indicated by respective colors, corresponding to thecolor-bar to the right.
Figure 2: Visualization of the probabilistic stability bound. The X-axis indicates the length oftrajectories T and Y-axis indicates the number of episodes M. The Z-axis indicates the probability ofstability and the values are colored differently according to the color-bar.
Figure 3:	State trajectories of the agents trained by L-REINFORCE (b) and SAC (c). The X-axisdenotes the time t and the Y-axis denotes the forward speed of the robot. The task is to control therobot to run forward at the reference speed 1m/s.
Figure 4:	State trajectories of the agents trained by L-REINFORCE (b) and SAC (c). (a) shows theuncontrolled dynamic of the GRN with additive uniform noises. The X-axis denotes the time t andthe Y-axis denotes the concentration of each component. The task is to control the concentration ofProtein 1 to track a reference signal, which is a sine signal.
Figure 5:	State trajectories of the agents trained by L-REINFORCE (b) and SAC (c). (a) shows theuncontrolled dynamic of the GRN with multiplicative uniform noises. The X-axis denotes the time tand the Y-axis denotes the concentration of each component. The task is to control the concentrationof Protein 1 to track a reference signal, which is a sine signal.
