Figure 1: Comparison of VSMC-PRC with IWAE (Burda et al., 2015) and FIVO (Maddison et al., 2017) (a)The blue arrows represent the resampling step, We then generate multiple samples from parametrized proposalzti |z1i :t-1 out of which one sample is accepted via PRC, depicted via green arrows. (b) In IWAE, there is noresampling step and no PRC step (c). In FIVO, there is a resampling step (blue arrows) but no PRC step.
Figure 2: (Left) The figures compares the bound value for VSMC-PRC with full gradient and biased gradi-ent (equation 12) as a function of iterations. (Left) The Table compares the bound value for VSMC (Naessethet al., 2017) and VSMC-PRC for 80% and 40% acceptance rate. (Right) We compare VSMC, VSMC-PRC(40% acceptance rate), and logpθ (xi：T) as a function of iterations.
Figure 3: Convergence rate for biased gradient vs. unbiased gradient on toy Gaussian SSM. We compared grep(blue), grep + gPRC (orange), and unbiased gradient (green) for optimization.
