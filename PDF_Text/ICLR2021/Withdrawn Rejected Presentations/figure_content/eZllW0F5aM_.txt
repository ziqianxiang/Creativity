Figure 1: Random architectures aggregate ensembles of paths. This creates a variety of receptivefields (effective neighborhood sizes on the domain graph) that are combined to compute the output.
Figure 2: An architecturenode is equiValent to a GNNlayer.
Figure 3: Distribution of receptive field radius(p = 0.4, ωij = 1 for unweighted, ωij = 0.5for weighted).
Figure 4: Path distribution as function of archi-tecture edge probability.
