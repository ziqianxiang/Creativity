Figure 1: CalciumGAN trained on the dichotomized Gaussian dataset with known ground-truth.
Figure 2: Calcium signals and inferred spike trains (in gray) of randomly selected neurons. (a) showsthe recorded data (in blue) and (b) shows synthetic data (in orange) generated by CalciumGANtrained on recorded data. Note: the generated data should not be identical with the recorded data,because CalciumGAN should not replicate the signals.
Figure 3: Raster plot of inferred real and synthetic spike trains of a randomly selected sample gen-erated by CalciumGAN trained on recorded data. Blue markers indicate recorded data and orangemarkers indicate generated data. The histograms on the x and y axis indicate number of spikes overthe temporal dimension and neuron population respectively.
Figure 4: First and second order statistics of data generated from CalciumGAN trained on therecorded data. Shown neurons and samples were randomly selected. (a) Mean firing rate distribu-tion over 1000 samples per neuron. (b) Pearson correlation coefficient distribution. (c) van-Rossumdistance between recorded and generated spike trains over 45 samples. Heatmaps were sorted wherethe pair with the smallest distance value was placed at the top left corner, followed by the pair withthe second smallest distance at the second row second column, and so on.
Figure 5: KL divergence of the (a) mean firing rate, (b) pairwise correlation and (c) pairwise van-Rossum distance between 1,000 recorded and generated samples.
