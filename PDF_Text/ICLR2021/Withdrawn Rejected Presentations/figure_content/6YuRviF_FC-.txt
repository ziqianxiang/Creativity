Figure 2: Observation proceduresSeveral different approaches are employed in machine learning regression. These approaches learnthe relationship between the input and output by fitting a model directly from the data. In thisstudy, we consider tree-based approaches: Decision tree, random forest, extremely randomized tree,and the neighborhood search approach: (K-nearest neighbor) to tackle our problem. We call ourapproach ZCal model which is multi-output regression. We formulate our regression estimationproblem as follows:Suppose we have a feature matrix of sensor datax11 x12 x13X21 X22 X23...
Figure 3: Root mean square error for each learning algorithm in predicting the H and V polarizationphase and amplitude gain solutions for each antenna. The blue, green, red and purple lines representthe different learning algorithms used in the experiment.
Figure 4: This figure shows the response of the extremely randomized tree learning algorithm inpredicting the phase gain solutions for the calibrator PKS1613-586 from the validation data. Ineach subplot we compare the predicted phase gain solutions (where H polarization is representedby red and V-polarization is represented by yellow) with the CASA generated phase gain solutions(where H polarization is represented by blue and V-polarization is represented by green). The ex-tremely randomized tree algorithm is failing to predict the gain phase solutions for some antennasand performing well in others with few outliers.
Figure 5: This figure shows the response of the extremely randomized tree learning algorithm inpredicting the amplitude gain solutions for the calibrator PKS1613-586 from the validation data.
