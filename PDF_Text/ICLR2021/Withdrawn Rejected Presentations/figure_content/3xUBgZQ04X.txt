Figure 1:	Figure accompanying Table 1, the progress of Alt-BuresGAN on the synthetic examples.
Figure 2:	Generated samples from a trained Alt-BuresGAN, with a DCGAN architecture.
Figure 3: Images generated by BuresGAN with a ResNet architecture for CIFAR-10 (left) and STL-10 (right) datasets. The STL-10 samples are full-sized 96 Ã— 96 images.
Figure 4: The progress of different GANs on the synthetic ring example. Each column show 3000samples from the training generator in blue with 3000 samples from the true distribution in green.
Figure 5: The progress of different GANs on the synthetic grid example. Each column show 3000samples from the training generator in blue with 3000 samples from the true distribution in green.
Figure 6: Generated images for the Stacked MNIST dataset. Each model is trained with 3 layersand mini-batch size 256. Each square shows 64 samples from the trained generator.
Figure 7:	Generated images for CIFAR-10 using a DCGAN architecture. Each square shows 64samples from the trained generator.
Figure 8:	Generated images for CIFAR-100 using a DCGAN architecture. Each square shows 64samples from the trained generator.
Figure 9:	Generated images for STL-10 using a DCGAN architecture. Each square shows 64 sam-ples from the trained generator.
