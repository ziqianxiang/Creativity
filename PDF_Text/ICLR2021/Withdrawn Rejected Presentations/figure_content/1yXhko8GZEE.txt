Figure 1: Evolution of the 5 smallest singular values of (a) SN-GAN, FID 147.9 and (b) APC-GAN, FID 34.08when generating STL-10 images with a ResNet trained with Dit =1for 200k iterations. The max singularvalue is around 1 due to SN, thus not shown here.

Figure 3: Left: Different piecewise linear functions; Right: the corresponding fitted preconditioning polyno-mials. The smaller the cutoff, the more aggressive the preconditioner. For instance, when the cutoff is 0.3, thepreconditioner pushes all singular values above 0.3 to 1. We show the fitting polynomials of degree 3, 5, 7, 9for PL0.8, PL0.6, PL0.4, PL0.3 respectively. More details are in Sec. C.2may hurt the representation power. Therefore, we do not want the target function to have value 1 in[λmin(A), γU]. In practice, the value of λmin(A) varies for different problems, therefore we permita flexible target function f, to be chosen by a user.
