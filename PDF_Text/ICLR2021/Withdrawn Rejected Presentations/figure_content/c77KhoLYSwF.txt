Figure 2: Scaling the dataset size while fixing thepoison budget.
Figure 3: We show the fragility of poisoning methods to experimental design. This figure depictsbaselines along with the results of ablation studies. Different methods respond differently to thesetesting scenarios, supporting the need for consistent and thorough testing. Horizontal lines denoteperformance on baselines described in Section 3, and bars represent the results of changing a specificfeature in an individual methodâ€™s baseline. Tables of these results with confidence intervals can befound in the appendices.
