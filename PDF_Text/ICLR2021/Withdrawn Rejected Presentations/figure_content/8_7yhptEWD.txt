Figure 1: Finite depth NTK vs. finite depth iteration of DEQ-NTK. In all experiments, the NTKis initialized with σW and σb in the title. For DEQ-NTK we set σU =琮—0.1 in the title, andthe actual σb = 0.1. All models are trained on 1000 CIFAR-10 data and tested on 100 test datafor 20 random draws. The error bar represents the 95% confidence interval (CI). As expected, asthe depth increases, the performance of NTKs drop, eventually their 95% CI becomes a singleton,yet the performance of DEQs stabilize. Also note with larger σW, the freezing of NTK takes moredepths to happen.
