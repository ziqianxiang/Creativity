Figure 1: Comparison of trends in occupation bias across various models trained on original MNLIdataset. We compare the distribution of occupational-bias predicted by our models on in-distributionevaluation dataset (MNLI (I)) with the actual gender-domination statistics from CPS 2019. Modelstrained on SNLI also showed similar trends (Appendix A.2).
Figure 2: Difference in âˆ†P and B in MNLI and SNLI in-distribution evaluation sets before andafter de-biasing. Similar results are observed for out-of-distribution evaluation sets (Appendix A.1).
