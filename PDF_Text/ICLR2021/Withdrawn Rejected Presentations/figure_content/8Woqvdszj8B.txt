Figure 1: Theoretical prediction (black curve) for the distribution of eigenvalues of Hγ vs. theobserved historgram for a resnet8 student trained on CIFAR 100. The shaded region is the result ofa kernel density estimator. Note that the theoretical curve is symmetric. This is an artifact of thesmall correlation coefficient that occurs in this particular problem.
Figure 2: The generalization accuracy of a resnet8 student (〜89k parameters) trained on CIFAR100 in the “vanilla” case and distilled from a resnet18 (1.1M parameters). The teacher’s baselineperformance on CIFAR100 is 0.62. The figure shows empirical results of50 experimental runs withvarious choices for T and α(T) superimposed against the predictions from the calculations detailedabove.
