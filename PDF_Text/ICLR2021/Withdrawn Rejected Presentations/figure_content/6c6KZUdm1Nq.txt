Figure 1: One-side regression problem, where, due to missing observations, data are correctly labeledonly above regression line, i.e., upper one-side. Regression function must be learned in unbiasedand consistent manner to ordinary regression, where data are labeled correctly in both upper- andlower-side.
Figure 2: Comparison of estimation results of proposed method and those of MSE. Orange linerepresents estimation results of each method, and blue line represents true label values.
