Figure 1: Comparing our analysis to asymptotic/non-asymptotic NTK analysis.
Figure 2: Convergence of gradient descent with different initial level of imbalance, c :=σn+m-1(U1T(0)U1(0) -VT(0)V(0)).
Figure 3: Implicit regularization of wide single-hidden-layer linear network. ∣U2 (0)V T (0)∣2F is theinitial distance between the end-to-end function to the desired manifold discussed in Section 4.1.
