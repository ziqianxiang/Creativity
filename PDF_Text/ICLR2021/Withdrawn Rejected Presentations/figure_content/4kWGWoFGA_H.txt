Figure 1: An overview of the video machine learning pipeline under bit-level corruptions, which can arise dueto file storage and network transmission. We explore various defenses against network and file corruptions.
Figure 2: Depiction of corrupted bits (or-ange) affected by packet loss (top) and ran-dom file corruption (bottom).
Figure 3: The impact of various file corruption types on model performance (left); average pixel-space Eu-clidean distance measurements (right) on incorrectly classified examples (red), correctly classified examples(green), and the entire dataset (yellow) organized by corruption proportion and type (right).
Figure 4: Frames from a clip (class TableTennisShot) at varying corruption levels. Color showscorrectclassification. Videos become visually more distorted as the corruption level increases.
Figure 5: Frames fromcorrectlyandincorrectlyWalkingDogclassified examples, with both clean (1st and 3rd rows)and corrupted (2nd and 4th rows) versions shown. Each pair of corrupted clips were subjected to the samecorruption proportion p and mode (packet loss and random corruption).
Figure 6: AUROC (left), in-distribution accuracy(right) of OOD detection under packet loss (top)and random file corruption (bottom).
Figure 7: Comparison of ODIN and energy-based OOD detection methods.
Figure 8: Frame #8 from the PETS09-S2L1 sequence, showing model predictions on clean data (left), p “0.01 packet loss (center), and p “ 0.1 packet loss (right).
Figure 9: The impact of various file corruption types on model accuracy, false positive count, and false negativecount for the multi-object tracking task. Error bars denote standard deviation over 5 random seeds.
