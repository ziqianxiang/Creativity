Figure 1: Reconstruction and latent regularization terms as functions of β for the NoisydSprites dataset. (a): reconstruction error. (b): latent regularization term (MMD for WAE, KL for TCWAE). (c):reconstruction error against latent regularization. (d): reconstruction error against MMD. Shadedregions show ± one standard deviation.
Figure 2: Latent traversals for each model on smallNORB. The parameters are the same thanthe ones reported in Tables 1 and 7. Each row i corresponds to the traversal of the latent ziwhile the columns correspond to a step in the that traversal. The rows are order by increasingKL 1/Ntest Ptestset q(zi|x) k p(zi) and the traversal range is [-2, 2].
Figure 3: Disentanglement versus reconstruction on the ScreamdSprites data set. Annotations at eachpoint are values of β . Points with low reconstruction error and high scores (top-left corner) representbetter models.
Figure 4: Latent traverSalS for TCWAE-MWS and TCWAE-GAN. Each line correSpondS to one inputdata point while each Subplot correSpondS to one latent factor. We vary evenly the encoded latentcodeS in the interval [-4, 4].
