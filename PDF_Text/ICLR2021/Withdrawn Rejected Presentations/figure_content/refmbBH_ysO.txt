Figure 1: Illustrative synthetic examples of our spreadsheet formula prediction setup. (a): Theformula manipulates cell values in the same row. (b): The formula is executed on the rows above. (c)and (d): Formulas involve cells in different rows and columns. The data value in the target cell isexcluded from the input. All of these formulas can be correctly predicted by our model.

Figure 4: Examples of wrong formula predictions by our full model. (a) The sketch prediction iscorrect, but the range is wrong. (b) The range prediction is correct, but the sketch is wrong. These aresynthetic examples for illustrative purposes.

Figure 6: Examples of formulas that are correctly predicted by our full model with the full context,but wrongly predicted with missing context. (a) The wrong prediction when the model input does notinclude headers. Note that the model with headers predicts it correctly even if only one data row isprovided. (b) The wrong prediction when the model input only includes headers and one data row.
