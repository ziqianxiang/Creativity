Figure 1: a) Comparing the GP-VAE’s predictive performance to that of the SVAE, SIN, an LDSand independent GPs (IGP). b) Top: sequence of images representing two bouncing balls. Middle:mean of the SGP-VAE’s predictive distribution conditioned on partial observations up to the redline. Bottom: latent approximate GPs posterior, alongside the inducing point locations (crosses).
Figure 2: Variation in performance of the SGP-VAE on the large-scale EEG experiment as thenumber of inducing points, M, varies.
Figure 3: An illustration of the Japanese weather experiment. The dotted red lines highlight themissing data, with the SGP-VAE’s predictive mean shown below.
Figure 4: A unifying perspective on multi-output GPs.
Figure 5: A comparison between the mean of the GP-VAE’s posterior predictive distribution (mid-dle) and the ground truth (top) conditioned on noisy observations up to the red line. The latentapproximate GP posterior is also shown (bottom).
Figure 6: An illustration of the three different partial inference network specifications discuss inSection 2.4. η denotes the vector of natural parameters of the multi-variate Gaussian being parame-terised.
