Figure 1: Sparse network without (left) / with (right) overlapping filters in the first layer.
Figure 2: Left: spurious local minimum exists in sparse linear network with dy = 3 shown in above,that is the global minimum of a sub-network. Right: one simple weight assignment for obtainingthe global minimum in deep sparse linear network with scalar output.
Figure 3: An example of sparse network with no bias. Lines are connections of original sparsenetwork, dotted lines are useless connections that can be removed, and solid lines are effectiveconnections.
