Figure 1: Energy-based out-of-distribution detection for multi-label classification. During inference time,input X is passed through classifier f, and label-wise scores are computed for each label. OOD indicator scoresare either the maximum-valued score (denoted by green outlines) or the sum of all scores. Taking the sumresults in a larger difference in scores and more separation between in-distribution and OOD inputs (denotedby red lines), resulting in better OOD detection. Plots in the bottom right depict the probability densities ofmaximum-valued versus summed scores.

Figure 3: Label-wise energy scores -Eyi(X) for in-distribution example from PASCAL-VOC (left), and OODinput from ImageNet (right). The OOD input is misclassified using MaXLogit score since the dominant outputhas a high activation, making it indistinguishable from an in-distribution data,s MaxLogit score. In contrast,SumEnergy correctly classifies both images since it results in larger differences in scores between in-distributionand OOD inputs.
