Figure 1: Mutual information estimation between multivariate Gaussian variables (left column) andbetween multivariate Gaussian variables with a cubic transformation (right column). Closer toZero is better. The estimation error (I (x, y) - I(x, y)) versus the true underlying MI are reported.
Figure 2: Results of the three self-consistency tests for SMILE (τ = 1, 5, ∞), InfoNCE, and DEMI.
Figure 3: Long-run behavior of SMILE and DEMI for 10 (top row), 20 (middle row), and 30(bottom row) Nats. Analytically SMILE converges to the MINE objective for τ → ∞. Smoothedtrajectories are plotted in bold, exact trajectories are the semi-translucent curve, and the actual Mu-tual information is the black constant line.
