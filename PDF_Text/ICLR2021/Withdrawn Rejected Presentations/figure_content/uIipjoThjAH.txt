Figure 1: Visualization of the average number of spikes in each layer with respect to time-steps.
Figure 3: The average value of γ at each layer over all time-steps. Early exit time can be calculated ast = 20 since γ values at every layer have lower value than threshold 0.1 after time-step 20 (yellowdotted line). Here, we use a VGG9 architecture on CIFAR-10.
Figure 4: (a) Visualization layer-wise spike activity (log scale) in VGG9 on CIFAR-10 dataset. (b)Performance change with respect to the standard deviation of the Gaussian noise.
Figure 5: Histogram visualization of γ at conv1 (row1), conv4 (row2), and conv7 (row3) layers inVGG9 across all time-steps. The experiments are conducted on CIFAR-10 with 25 time-steps.
Figure 6: Visualization of accuracy and early exit time with respect to the threshold value for γ.
