Figure 1: Wavelet transformation consists of a low-pass and a high-pass filter, followed by a down-sampling step that splits the image into two equal-sized patches. Each of these two patches undergothe same operation again resulting in four equal-sized patches, TL, TR, BL and BR.
Figure 2: The above images are the original, down-sampled version using wavelet encoding, anddown-sampled version using pixel-based interpolation (bilinear) in the column-wise order. Pleasenote that the pixel-based interpolation loses key structural information in the images - face of theperson, structure of the boat, and accordion keyboard - whereas wavelet encoding does not.

Figure 29: Unlike SPN, nsb-GAN slices the images in the frequency domain. As a result eachpatch contains the entire global structure of the input image. This helps alleviate any long-termdependency issues.

Figure 31: The left column consists of images from the ImageNet dataset at 512 × 512 and the rightcolumn consists of super-resolved version of the same images using our decoder (from 128 × 128to 512 × 512. Clearly, the ImageNet dataset at 512 × 512 is blurrier than super-resolved images.
