Figure 1: Illustration of one BiGCN layer. In the feature graph, di indicates each dimension offeatures with a row vector of the input feature matrix as its “feature vector”. We use a learnablematrix to capture feature correlations.
Figure 3: Node classification (Top) and link prediction (Bottom) results of models in noise rate case.
Figure 4: Node classification accuracy of models in structure mistakes case.
Figure 5: Sensitivity analysis of iteration, λ2, λ and p on node classification. For iteration and λ2, weconduct experiments on clean data and three noise cases with 0.2 noise rate, 0.2 noise level and 0.1%structure mistakes respectively. For p and λ, we provide the performance of BiGCN on Cora with 0.2noise rate.
