Figure 1: Overview of the retrosynthesis problem.
Figure 2: Relationships between Training iterations and Train/Test scores. For all panels, thehorizontal axis denotes the training iterations. First row: Single model, Second row: joint training,Third row: Self-training, Fourth row: Pre-training plus Fine-tuning. The left column shows thetraining perplexities. The middle column shows the 1-best test accuracy scores. The right columnshows the 20-best test accuracy scores.
Figure 3: Examples of being able to make predictions with pre-training and fine-tuning. Thetop-1 predictions for the single model are reasonable but the model does not predict reactants forconstructing a ring. The 1st row (a) An example of heterocycle formation (RX_4). Synthesis N -substituted pyrrole from 1,4-diketone and alkylamine. Single model does not correctly proposereactants built a pyrrole ring. The 2nd row (b) An example of C-C bond formation (RX_3). Syntheticorganic chemists easily come up with the Diels-Alder reaction when they see bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-enering system but single model does not predict any Diels-Alder reaction within the top-50.
Figure 4: Examples of failed predictions. The 1st row (a). The model fails when there are multiplesimilar substituents like long chain hydrocarbons. The 2nd row(b) Our model can predict Clem-mensen reduction reactions, but outputs incorrect SMILES substrings corresponding to the coronenesubstructure.
