Figure 2: Representation of SGNS and HOSGNS with embedding matrices and operations onembedding vectors. Starting from a random walk realization on a static graph G = (V, E), SGNS takesas input nodes i and j within a context window of size T, and maximizes σ (wi ∙ Cj). HOSGNS startsfrom a random walk realization on a higher-order representation of time-varying graph H = (V, E, T),takes as input nodes i(k) (node i at time k) and j (l) (node j at time l) within a context window ofsize T and maximizes σ([[wi, cj, tk, sl]]). In both cases, for each input sample, we fix i and drawK combinations of j or j, k,l from a noise distribution, and we maximize σ(-Wi ∙ Cj) (SGNS) orσ(-[[wi, cj, tk, sl]]) (HOSGNS) with their corresponding embedding vectors (negative sampling).
