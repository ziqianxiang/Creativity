Figure 2: Latent Space Traversal of ICM model on MNISTLemma 2. Let G be the space of smooth invertable functions with smooth inverse (i.e., a diffeomor-phism) that map Z to X, and h : Z -→ Z is a smooth invertable function. Then, any function g ∈ GCan be represented as g = g* ◦ h, where g* : Z → X is the assumed ground-truth disentangledgenerative model in the function space G. Formally, we have g 〜h g*, ∀g ∈ G and the model g is〜h-identifiable.
