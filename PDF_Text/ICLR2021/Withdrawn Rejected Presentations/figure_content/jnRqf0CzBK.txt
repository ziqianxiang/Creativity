Figure 1: An example of our sample space.
Figure 2: First-order interaction experiment.
Figure 3: Third-order interaction experiment.
Figure 4: Time series signal experiment.
Figure 5: 2-dimensional point cloud experiment.
Figure 6: Experimental analysis of the scalability of number of parameters and higher-order featuresin the model for both natural gradient approach and gradient descentFigure 7: Six different runs of FastICA with the same experimental input experimental dataset asexp1 with first order interactions. The different results can demonstrate that the FastICA model isnon-convex leading to potential problemic results such as the sign inversion.
