Figure 1: Inner loop steps of Reptile, Eigen-Reptile. Reptile updates meta-parameters towards thelast task-specific parameters, which is biased. Eigen-Reptile considers all samples more fair. Notethat the main direction is the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue.
Figure 2: Randomly sample examples to builddifferent prior models.
Figure 3: Eigen-Reptile and Reptile training process on the regression toy test. (a), (b), (c) and (d),(e), (f) show that after the gradient update 0, 8, 16, 24, 32 times based on initialization learned byEigen-Reptile and Reptile respectively.
