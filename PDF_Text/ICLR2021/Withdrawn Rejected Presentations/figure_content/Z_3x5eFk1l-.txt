Figure 1: Illustration of design philosophy of ADMLis favorable for clean samples (marked with the red color) to reach two points θa0 dv and θc0 respec-tively (i.e., Line 10). Then in the meta-update, based on θa0 dv and θc0i, ADML further optimizes θto its antithetic subspaces respectively (i.e., Line 14), and hopefully θ can reach the optimal pointθi, which is supposed to fall into the intersection of the subspace pair and is able to achieve a goodtrade-off between clean and adversarial samples to boost the overall performance on both samples.
