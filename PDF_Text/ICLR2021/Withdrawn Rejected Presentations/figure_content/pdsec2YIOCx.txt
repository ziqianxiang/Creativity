Figure 1: Untangle model is trained in twophases: Disentangling phase: Input to en-coder is a one hot representation of an item(green dotted line). Obtained representationis disentangled across A attributes. Recom-mendation phase: Input to encoder is theitems user interacted with (solid red line) andrecommends new items.
Figure 2: Control over recommendations when factor-value ca , is adjusted by multiplicativefactor g âˆˆ [-150, 150]. Recommendation lists are evaluated by recall@(5,10,20). Relevanceis determined by the presence of attribute a in the retrieved items. We compare Multi-VAE(top) with Untangle model (bottom) for sad, romantic, suspense and violence on ML-20m.
Figure 3: We compare Multi-VAE (top) with Untangle model (bottom) for adventure, sci-fi,mystery and humor attributes for Goodreads-Comics for the same analysis done in Figure 2.
Figure 4: Correlation between learnt dimension valueca to the true relevance score across 500 movies forMovielens-20mvalue to and the true relevance score for attributeCorrelation between RelevanceScores and ca : We observe thatdisentangling across item representa-tions leads to a fine-grained controlfor critiquing. We further verify, if theachieved controllability is an outcomeof high correlation between factor ca ,and the true relevance score acrossmovies for attribute a for Movielens-20m dataset. We randomly sample500 movies, and obtain their latentrepresentation from the encoder. InFigure 4, we plot the obtained caaction. We can infer from the Fig-ure 4 that the representations obtained from Untangle have a high Pearson correlation of0.53 as compared to MultiVAE model (Pearson Correlation: -0.03). The graphs for other
