Figure 1: Parameters of an episodic signal of the rewards in HalfCheetah environment, estimated over N =10000 episodes of T = 1000 time-steps: (a) distribution of rewards per time-step; (b) variance per time-step;(c) correlation(t1, t2) vs. t2 - t1. The estimations were done in resolution of 25 time-steps, i.e., every episodewas split into 40 intervals of 25 consecutive rewards, and each sample is the average over an interval.
Figure 2: Rewards degradation of a fixedagent in HalfCheetah following changes ingravity, mass, and control-cost, over N =5000 episodes per scenario.
Figure 3: A summary of the sequential degradation-test procedure described in Section 6.1.
Figure 4: Bottom: percent of sequential tests (among M = 100 runs with different seeds) that ended withdegradation detection, for various degradation-tests (corresponding to different colors), in a sample of scenariosin Pendulum, HalfCheetah and Humanoid. Top: the distribution of time until detection - for the runs that endedwith detection. High detection rates usually go along with short detection times.
