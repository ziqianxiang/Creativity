Figure 1: The overview of AutoHAS method. LEFT: Each candidate architecture,s weights areshared with a super model, where each candidate is a sub model within this super model. RIGHT:During the search, AUtoHAS alternates between optimizing the shared weights of super model W andupdating the controller. It also creates temporary weights W * by optimizing the sampled candidatearchitecture using the sampled candidate hyperparameter (HP). This W * will be used to compute thevalidation accuracy as a reward so as to update the AutoHAS controller to select better candidates.
Figure 2: Comparison between AutoHAS andprevious HPO methods on ImageNet. AutoHASachieves better accuracy than HGD, and uses muchless search time cost than others.
Figure 3: AUtoHAS improves accuracy by 1%for EfficientNet-B0 on Places365.
