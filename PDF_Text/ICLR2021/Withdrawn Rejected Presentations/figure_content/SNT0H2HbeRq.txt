Figure 1: Structure of the push-pull layer. Aninput image x is convolved with a push anda pull kernel. The pull kernel is derived fromthe push one by negation and upsampling (bya factor h). Their responses are rectified andcombined linearly.
Figure 2: Illustration of robustness to noise. (Top left) An image from the CIFAR-10 test set andits corrupted Versions with Gaussian noise of increasing seVerity. (Bottom left) The response mapsof the conVolutional kernel are affected by high frequency noise. (Right) The response maps of thepush-pull kernel are less sensitiVe to the image corruption.
Figure 3: Results achieved by combining thepush-pull layer with the anti-aliasing filtersproposed by Zhang (2019). We group by col-ors the results achieved by a certain modelwith different anti-aliasing filter configura-tions. The closer the points are to the bottom-left the better the robustness is.
Figure 4: Histograms of the weights learned in push-pull and convolutional layers of (a) ResNet, (b)WideResNet and (c) DenseNet. Networks with push-pull layers (orange) learn sparser representa-tions than networks with only convolutional layers (blue).
Figure 5: Modified residual and dense layers. In the (a) push-pull residual layer and (b) push-pulldense layer we replace the convolutions with our push-pull layer.
