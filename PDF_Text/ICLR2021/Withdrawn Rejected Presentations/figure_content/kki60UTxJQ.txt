Figure 4: FID vs HYPE-C Scores■ ProGAN• Con-StyIeGAN♦ Con-ProGAN▲ PixeICNN+ +I--1 32X32[--1 64x64[ΞΞ] 128×128■■ FFHQStanford CarsCUBLSUN-BedroomLSUN-CatIt is clear from the figure that the evaluations of model performance using FID and HYPE-C donot coincide. This is not entirely unexpected, as HYPEtime and HYPE∞ scores were shown tobe uncorrelated with FID by Zhour et al. (Zhou et al., 2019). However, FID measures both imagequality and diversity, while HYPEtime and HYPE∞ only measure image quality, making it somewhatof an unfair comparison. Since HYPE-C evaluates models based on their ability to complete a set ofimages representative of the target distribution, it is sensitive to image diversity, and we can muchmore directly compare our results with FID.
