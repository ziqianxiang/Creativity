Figure 1: Mean Â± standard deviation, for accuracy and the number of function evaluations (NFE)for the backward pass, during training, for Neural CDEs.
Figure 2: Frames from controlling the fully-actuated double pendulum to the full-upright position.
Figure 3: Evolution of the state Z = (q, q, U) whilst controlling the fully-actuated double pendulumfrom the full-down to the full-upright position. q1 denotes the angle of the first joint, and q2 denotesthe angle of the second joint.
Figure 4: Location of function evaluations for the adjoint equations, during training for the fully-actuated double pendulum problem. All evaluations over five runs are shown.
Figure 5: Location of rejected steps during training for the fully-actuated double pendulum problem.
Figure 6: Parameter-state ratio againstimprovement, as given by the relativedecrease in backWard NFE. Only oneneural CDE experiment (RTOL=10-3,ATOL=10-6) is shoWn as the others usedifferent tolerances. CNFs are averagedover their different blocks.
