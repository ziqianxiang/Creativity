Figure 1: Architecture of our model. HIRE denotes HIdden Representation Extractor, in which theBi-GRUs share the same parameters for each layerâ€™s output.
Figure 2: Left: Distribution of importance scores over different layers when computing the com-plementary representation for various NLU tasks. The numbers on the abscissa axis indicate thecorresponding layer with 0 being the first layer and 24 being the last layer. Right: Distributionof importance scores over different layers for each example of SST-2 dataset. The number on theordinate axis denotes the index of the example.
