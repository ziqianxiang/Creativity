Figure 2: The raycast information. The range of the game camera is 60 degrees of vertical view, 90degrees of horizontal view, and the interval of each ray is 5 degrees. Therefore, a total of 247 = (60 /5 + 1) * (90/5 + 1) rays are emitted. The raycast return {object, distance, object, distance,â€¦} as asequence. The object is represented by {0: none, 1: player itself, 2: mesh, 3: blood bag, 4: enemy},and the distance representation is direct transmission value. When there is no object touched, thedistance is also 0.
