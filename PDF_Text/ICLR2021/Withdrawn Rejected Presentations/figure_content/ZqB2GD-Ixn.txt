Figure 1: The challenges of generalization. In the presence of unobserved confounders, there is an inherenttrade-off in performance - causal and correlation-based solutions are both optimal in different regimes, dependingon the shift from which new data is generated. The proposed approach, DIRM, is a relaxation of the causalsolution that naturally interpolates between the causal solution and Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), and isdescribed in Section 3. The data generating mechanism, methods, and a discussion of the results are given in theparagraphs above our contributions.

Figure 5: Sensitivity of solutions to hyperparameter λ. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and the causal solution,with coefficients (0, 1) for (X1, X2) are two extremes (λ = 0 and λ → ∞ respectively) of the spectrum ofsolutions that can be attained with the proposed approach. Positive values of λ interpolate in some sense betweenOLS and causal solutions in this case. Here DRO corresponds to DIRM with λ = 2, approximately.
