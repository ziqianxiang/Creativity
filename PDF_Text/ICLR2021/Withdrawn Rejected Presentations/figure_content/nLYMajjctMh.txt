Figure 3: L2SGD+, vs L2SGD vs L2SGD2 with identical stepsize (details in the Appendix).
Figure 4: Variance reduced local SGD (Algorithm 3), shifted local SGD (Algorithm 7) and localSGD (Algorithm 6) applied on LibSVM problems for both homogeneous split of data and Hetero-geneous split of the data. Stepsize for non-variance reduced method was chosen the same as for theanalogous variance reduced method.
Figure 5: Effect of the aggregation probability p (legend of the plots) on the convergence rate ofAlgorithm 3. Choice p = p? corresponds to red dotted line with triangle marker. Parameter λ waschosen in each case as Table 1 indicates.
Figure 6: Effect of parameter λ (legend of the plot) on the convergence rate of Algorithm 3. Thechoice λ = λ? corresponds to borwn dash-dotted line with diamond marker (the third one from thelegend). Aggregation probability p was chosen in each case as Table 1 indicates.
