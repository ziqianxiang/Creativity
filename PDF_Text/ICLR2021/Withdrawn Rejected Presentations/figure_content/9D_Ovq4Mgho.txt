Figure 1: Pseudo mask to target breast lesions in images (converted to grayscale) from PASCALVOC2012. The top row is original images and the second row is pseudo masks. The first columnpresents an example with few target pixels. The second column is an example with high gray-levelentropy of pseudo mask. The third column shows an example with salient target.
Figure 2: Example for each datasets. From left to right, the top row presents the images from XXXBreast Lesion-1, XXX Breast Lesion-2, Baheya Breast Lesion, and Thyroid Nodule; the second rowpresents the images from Nerve Structure, Skin Lesion, and PASCAL VOC2012.
Figure 3: Image distribution with respect to the entropy. From left to right, the top row presents theresult for Baheya Breast Lesion, Thyroid Nodule, and Nerve Structure; the second row presents theexamples for Skin Lesion and PASCAL VOC2012.
