Figure 1: An example Neural Dynamical System. Here, blue boxes are fully connected neuralnetworks, gray boxes are problem data and output, the green box is the prior knowledge dynamicalsystem, the purple box is data output by ODE solver to query derivatives, and the black box isan ODE solver. The ODEs and system parameters are problem dependent, but here we consider theLorenz system (defined in Example 1) as an example. Our notation for x is unfortunately overloadedby our method and the Lorenz system—the x from our method is bolded in the figure.
Figure 2: L2 loss between predicted and real trajectory as we train on more samples. The NDSmodels learn with much fewer samples and converge to much lower errors on both systems. Shadedregions are standard errors.
Figure 3: L2 loss between predicted and realtrajectories on the fusion problem as we trainon more samples. The Fusion NDS outperformsother models, including a fixed version of theprior knowledge model and a fully connectedNeural ODE.
Figure 4: A typical learning curve for NDS.
Figure 5: L2 distance between φ and φ. As the NDS are trained under the usual L2 supervision,the parameters φ of the system approach the correct values.
Figure 6: Change in performance when data are irregularly sampled in time. The Full NDSperforms better than any comparison model under addedjitter.
