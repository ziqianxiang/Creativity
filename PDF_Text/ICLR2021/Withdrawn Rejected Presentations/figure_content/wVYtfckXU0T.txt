Figure 1: Warp-based image animation warps the source image based on the motion of the drivingimage and recovers the warping artifacts by inpainting. PriorityCut utilizes the occlusion informationin image animation indicating the locations of warping artifacts to regularize discriminator predictionson inpainting. The augmented image has smooth transitions without loss or mixture of context.
