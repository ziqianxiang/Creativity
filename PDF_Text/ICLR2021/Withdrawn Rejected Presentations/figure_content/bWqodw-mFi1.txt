Figure 1: Proposed architecture. The highlighted box highlights the additional proposed moduletasked with regressing the parameters of an affine transformation or homography.
Figure 2: Graph of the linear evaluation accuracy at various points during training for both Sim-CLR and BYOL with and without our proposed module. The shaded region indicates one standarddeviation from the mean.
