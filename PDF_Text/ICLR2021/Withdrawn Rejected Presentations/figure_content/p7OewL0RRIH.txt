Figure 1: Overall procedure for Sself at the server. At global round t, the received models belongto one of the following t + 1 sets: U(O), U(I),…，U(t). After entropy-based filtering, the serverperforms loss-weighted averaging for the results that belong to Ut(i) to obtain vt(+i)1. Now by taking(i)the weighted averaging of v；，］ for all i = 0,1,..., t and combining with Wt, we finally obtain wt+ιand move on to the next round t + 1.
