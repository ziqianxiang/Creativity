Figure 1: SCONE conditions the feature extractor fθ on an episode’s shot distribution.
Figure 2: Test accuracy on three different evaluation shots. Fine-tuning exclusively on a particularshot leads to the best test accuracy on that shot but poor accuracy on different shots. Fine-tuning ona range of shots is a reasonable general solution, but its performance can be improved when usingSCONE , thanks to its conditioning mechanism that offers a compact form of shot specialization.

Figure 4: The shot distribution s produced according to our smoothing procedure for a hypothetical4-way episode where the shots for the four classes are: 1, 10, 23, and 103.
Figure 5:	Additional evaluation shot settings to complement those in Figure 2 in the main paper. Werefer the reader to Section 5.1 for a detailed description of these plots.
Figure 6:	Break down of the performance in Table 1 in different evaluation shot ranges. We find thatwhile the ‘Best k-shot, baseline performs well for large shots (the third subplot), it performs poorlyon low shots (first two subplots).
