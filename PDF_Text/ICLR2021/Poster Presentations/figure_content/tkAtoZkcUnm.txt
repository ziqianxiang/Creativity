Figure 1: Comparison of Neural Thompson Sampling and baselines on UCI datasets and MNISTdataset. The total regret measures cumulative classification errors made by an algorithm. Resultsare averaged over 8 runs with standard errors shown as shaded areas.
Figure 2: Comparison of Neural Thompson Sampling and Neural UCB on UCI datasets and MNISTdataset under different scale of delay. The total regret measures cumulative classification errors madeby an algorithm. Results are averaged over 8 runs with standard errors shown as error bar.
Figure 3:	Comparison of Neural Thompson Sampling and baselines on UCI datasets and MNISTdataset. The total regret measures cumulative classification errors made by an algorithm. Resultsare averaged over multiple runs with standard errors shown as shaded areas.
Figure 4:	Comparison of Neural Thompson Sampling and Neural UCB on UCI datasets and MNISTdataset under different scale of delay. The total regret measures cumulative classification errors madeby an algorithm. Results are averaged over multiple runs with standard errors shown as error bar.
Figure 5:	Comparison of the running time for Neural TS, Neural UCB and -greedy for neuralnetworks on UCI datasets and MNIST dataset.
