Figure 1: Visualization of the spherical deterministic relational regularized autoencoder (s-DRAE).
Figure 2: Each dot represents the computational time per minibatch and FID score. For DRAE, wevary the number of projections L ∈ {1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000}; for s-DRAE we set κ = 10,L ∈ {1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100}; for ps-DRAE we set κ = 50,L ∈ {1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100}; and for m(p)s-DRAE we set L = 50, the number of vMF components k ∈ {2, 5, 10, 50} (for each k, we find the bestκ ∈ {1, 5, 10, 50, 100}).
