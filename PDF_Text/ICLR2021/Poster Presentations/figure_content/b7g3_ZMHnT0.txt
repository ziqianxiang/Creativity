Figure 1: Proposed KG Perturbation Framework. Our pro-cedure consists of three main steps: (1) train the KG-augmentedmodel on the original KG, then freeze the model; (2) obtain theperturbed KG by applying N = |T| perturbations to the full orig-inal KG; and (3) compare the perturbed KGâ€™s downstream perfor-mance to that of the original KG.
Figure 2: Proposed KG Perturbation Methods. We propose four heuristic-based perturbation methods andone RL-based perturbation method. In this diagram, we consider example edge (Child, AtLocation,Classroom) within a subgraph of the original ConceptNet KG (shown in blue). We illustrate how this edge(and possibly other edges) changes in response to different perturbation methods (shown in red). Unlike theheuristic-based methods (RS, RR, ER, ED), the RL-based method (RL-RR) is trained to maximize downstreamperformance and minimize original-perturbed KG semantic similarity.
