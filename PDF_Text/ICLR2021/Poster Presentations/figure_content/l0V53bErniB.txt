Figure 2:	Scatter plots with true (x) and predicted (y) flows for two approaches on each dataset. Theresults are consistent with Table 1 and show that our methods are more accurate than the baselines.
Figure 3:	Edge regularizer learned by Bil-MLP vs. features values (a-c) and visualization of regular-izers on the Traffic topology (d). Our model is able to learn the effect of the resistance for Power. InTraffic, a higher number of lanes is correlated to less regularization and lower speed roads (45mph)are less regularized. The regularization is also correlated with congested areas in Los Angeles, CA.
