Figure 1: Viewmaker networks generate complex and diverse input-dependent views for unsu-pervised learning. Examples shown are for CIFAR-10. Original image in center with pink border.
Figure 2: Diagram of our method. The viewmaker network is trained to produce stochastic adver-sarial views restricted to an `1 sphere around the input.
Figure 3: Our learned views are still able to yield useful information even when the inter-patchmutual information in a dataset is low, as in Figure 3b.
Figure 4: Performance of different views on CIFAR-10-C corruptions. Our learned vieWs enablesolid performance in the face of unseen corruptions despite not explicitly including any blurring,contrast, or brightness transformations during training, unlike the expert vieWs. Adding our learnedvieWs on top of SimCLR yields additional gains in robust accuracy, especially on different kinds ofnoise corruptions and glass blurring.
