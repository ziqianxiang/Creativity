Figure 1: Training of BGNN, steps for oneepoch are numbered.
Figure 2: Relative difference for Res-GNN (yellow, diagonal) and BGNN (red, squared) for differentGNN architectures w.r.t. GNN RMSE (the smaller the better).
Figure 3: RMSE on the test set during training for two node regression datasets.
Figure 4: House dataset. True labels and predictions by trained GBDT, GNN, Res-GNN, andBGNN models (training points only). Point coordinates correspond to BGNN learned representationsin the first hidden layer. Color represents the final predictions made by each model.
