Figure 1: Factors in the dSprites dataset displaying topological similarity and semantic correspon-dence to respective latent dimensions in a disentangled generative model, as shown through Wasser-stein RLT distributions—vectorizations of the persistent homology of submanifolds conditioned on alatent dimension—and latent interpolations along respective latent dimensions.
Figure 2: Illustration of obtaining Wasserstein Relative Living Times (W. RLTs) from a manifold.
Figure 3: Consider a set of images of a spinning heart with different sizes. We can embed theseimages on any group that combines a rotational and a scalar invariance (i.e. a group with the SO(2,1)symmetry), visualizing this as a conical shell. The submanifolds conditioned on a given rotationhave no holes, while those conditioned on scale have a 1D hole. Notably, the topology of thesubmanifold when holding scale fixed is different from the topology when holding rotation fixed.
Figure 4: Wasserstein RLTs from factors in theCelebA dataset, based on the same cluster above,and in distinct clusters below. As one can see, theW. RLTs within a cluster (above) are more similarto each other than to those outside of that cluster(below). Additional examples are in Appendix D.
Figure 5: Topological similarity matrices across experimental conditions. Dark clusters alongthe diagonal indicate homeomorphic clusters. Darker values indicate greater similarity (lower W.
