Figure 1: Illustration of the relationship among Aι,k, A2,k, A3,k, ek+「ek+ι, and ®k. Here {θk,ωk}and {θk+1, ωk+1} are two consecutive iterates of actor-critic. The red arrow from Qωk to Qωk+1represents the critic update and the red arrow from Qπθk to Qπθk+1 represents the action-valuefunctions associated with the two policies in any actor update. Here Iok given in (D.7) quantifies thedifference between ∏θk and ∏θk+ι in terms of their KL distances to ∏*. In addition, the cyan arrowsrepresent quantities Aι,k, A2,k, and A3,k introduced in (D.2)-(D.4), which are intermediate termsused for analyzing the error Q* - Qπk+1. Finally, the blue arrows represent εk+ι and ek+1 definedin (D.5) and (D.6), respectively. Here εck+1 corresponds to the statistical error due to having finitedata whereas ek+1 essentially quantifies the difference between πθk and πθk+1 .
