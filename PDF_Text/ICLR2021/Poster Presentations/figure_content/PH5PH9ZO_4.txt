Figure 1: The advantage of our formulationwhen compared to the state-of-the-art.
Figure 2: (a) A sample program P containing a function foo (b) P contains five sites which Can be trans-formed -two replace sites corresponding to local variables [ɪl and [-r-[, and three insert sites at locations I1,I2, I3. Ω is a vocabulary of tokens which can be used for the transformations. (c) This is a perturbed programwith the tokens world and set from Ω used to replace tokens b and at location I3. These transformationsdo not change the original functionality of P, but cause an incorrect prediction delete (d) Examples of twosite selection vectors zi , zii selecting different components. zi = 1 for a location i signifies that the ith tokenin P is selected to be optimally transformed. zi corresponds to the perturbed program in (c).
Figure 3: The original loss landscape for a sample program(3a). Randomized smoothing produces a flatter and smoother losslandscape (3b). We plot the loss along the space determined bythe vector (α.sgn(Vχf (x)) + β.Rademacher(0.5)) for α, β ∈[-0.05, 0.05] (Engstrom et al., 2018)performance. We hence perturb only u to further save computation time.
