Figure 1: A conceptual view for adaptive temporal fusion. At time t, the 2D Conv layer computesfor those “keep” channels (blue) in feature map xt, and fuses the "reuse" channels (yellow) fromthe history feature map yt-1. The downstream 2D Conv layer (not shown here) will process those“reuse” and “keep” channels in yt. Best viewed in color.
Figure 2: FLOPS vs Accuracy on Something-V1Dataset. The diameter of each data point is propor-tional to the total number of parameters. AdaFuse(blue points) achieves the best trade-off at a com-parable model size to 2D CNN approaches.
