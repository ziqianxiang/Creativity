Figure 1: Toy causal models with one hidden confounder. In 1a and 1c, the observed covariates arex1, x2. In 1b and 1d, the observed covariates are xf1, x2. In all cases, y denotes the label.
Figure 2:	Change in classifier accuracy as noise is injected on rationales/non-rationales for IMDbreviews from Kaushik et al. (2020).
Figure 3:	Change in classifier accuracy as noise is injected on rationales/non-rationales for IMDbreviews from Zaidan et al. (2007). In both Figures 2 and 3, the vertical dashed line indicates thefraction of median length of non-rationales equal to the median length of rationales.
Figure 4:	Change in classifier accuracy as noise is injected on rationales (in blue) or non-rationales(in red) for IMDb reviews from Kaushik et al. (2020). The vertical dashed line indicates the fractionof median length of non-rationales equal to the median length of rationales.
