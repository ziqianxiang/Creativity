Figure 1: Illustration of our wireframe modelling architecture.
Figure 2: Positive and negative samples for edge verification during training. (a) Positive edge samples(green lines) between ground truth vertices (black dots). (b) "spurious" (left) and "inaccurate" (right)connections between ground truth vertices. (c) positive samples (blue lines) between predictedvertices (blue dots). (d) "wrong links" (left) and "near misses" (right) between predicted vertices.
Figure 3: Illustration of WED. (a) First match vertices to (e) ground truth; (b) move matched vertices,insert missing ones and compute the cost; (d) delete and insert edges and compute the cost.
