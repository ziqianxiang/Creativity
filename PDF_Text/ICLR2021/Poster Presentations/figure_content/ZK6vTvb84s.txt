Figure 1: The input point cloud x is transported onto the reference z = (z1, . . . , zp) (left), yieldingthe optimal transport plan Pκ(x, z) used to aggregate the embedded features and form Φz(x) (right).
Figure 2: ROC and PR curves for all the chromatin profiles (first row) and stratified by transcrip-tion factors (left column), DNase I-hypersensitive sites (middle column) and histone-marks (rightcolumn). The profiles with positive samples fewer than 50 on the test set are not taken into account.
