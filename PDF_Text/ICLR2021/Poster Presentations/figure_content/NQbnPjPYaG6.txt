Figure 1: Algorithms in A fail to converge in M with α = γ = 0.01. Single run with standardnormal initialisation, 3000 iterations. The behavior of SGA is slightly different, explained by thepresence of a non-continuous parameter λ jumping between ±1 according to an alignment criterion.
Figure 2: Algorithms in A fail to converge in Mσ with σ = α = γ = 0.01. Single run with standardnormal initialisation, 3000 iterations.
Figure 3: Algorithms in A fail to converge in N with α = γ = 0.01. Single run with standardnormal initialisation, 3000 iterations.
