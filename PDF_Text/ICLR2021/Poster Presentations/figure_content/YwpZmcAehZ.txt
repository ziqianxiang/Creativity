Figure 1: Dynamic convolution via matrix decomposition. Left: Reformulating the vanilla dynamicconvolution by matrix decomposition (see Eq. 3). It applies dynamic attention Π(x) over channelgroups in a high dimensional space (SV T x ∈ RKC). Right: proposed dynamic convolutiondecomposition, which applies dynamic channel fusion Φ(x) in a low dimensional space (QT x ∈RL, L C), resulting in a more compact model.
Figure 2: Dynamic convolution decompositionlayer. The input x first goes through a dynamicbranch to generate Λ(x) and Φ(x), and then to gen-erate the convolution matrix W (x) using Eq. 6.
Figure 3: Sparse dynamic residual, whichis represented as a diagonal block matrix.
