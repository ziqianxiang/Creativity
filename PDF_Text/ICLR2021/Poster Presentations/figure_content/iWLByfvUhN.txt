Figure 1: Examples of the switch operation, which switches the global representations of two imagesfrom four datasets: (a) CIFAR-10, (b) ImageNet, (c) LSUN Bedroom and (d) CelebA-HQ.
Figure 2: Diagram to illustrate the process of decoupling an image X into the global representation Zand local representation υ . The key insight is the architecture design of the compression encoder andthe invertible decoder.
Figure 3: The refined architecture of Glow that used in our decoder. (a) The architecture of onere-organized step. (b) The visualization of four split patterns for coupling layers, where the red colordenotes xa and the blue color denotes xb . (c) The fine-grained version of multi-scale architecture.
