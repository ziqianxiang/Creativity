Figure 1: Results on Inverted-Pendulum. (a) The confidence interval (significance level δ = 0.1) of our method(green) and that of Feng et al. (2020) (blue) when varying the data size n. (b) The length of the confidenceintervals (δ = 0.1) of our method scaling with the data size n. (c) The confidence intervals when we vary thesignificance level δ (data size n = 5000). (d) The significance level δ vs. the empirical failure rate δ of capturingthe true expected reward by our confidence intervals (data size n = 5000). We average over 50 random trials foreach experiment.
Figure 2: Results on different environments when we use a significance level of δ = 0.1. The colored barsrepresent the ConfidenCe intervals of different methods (averaged over 50 random trials); the blaCk error barrepresents the stand derivation of the end points of the intervals over the 50 random trials.
Figure 3: Ablation study on the radius rQ of the function class Q. The default collecting procedureuses a horizon length of H = 50. The discounted factor is γ = 0.95 by default.
Figure 4: Ablation studies on Inverted-Pendulum. We change the temperature τ of the behavior policies in (a),and change the bandwidth of the kernel k of Wo and the kernel k of Q (denoted by h吞 in (b)).
Figure 5: Ablation studies on the data collection procedure, as we (a) change the behavior policies, and (b)-(c)change the trajectory lengths. The other settings are the same as that in Figure 3.
