Figure 1: The coefficient of determination R2 (the higher the better) of GNNs and MLP whenthe graph plays (a) the representational role or (b) the correlational role. For each configuration,the results are aggregated from 100 trials. In (a), all GNNs outperform MLP; in (b), all GNNsunderperform MLP.
Figure 2: Density functions of two-dimensional distributions constructed using copulas. Themarginal distributions are all standard normal. See Joe (2014) for the definitions of these parametriccopulas.
