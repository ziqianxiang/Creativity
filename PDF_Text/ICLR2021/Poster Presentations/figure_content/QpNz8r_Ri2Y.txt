Figure 1: The OPE results of different model learning algorithms with varying off-policyness on thex-axis. The y-axis plots the normalized individual MSE on test trajectories where the performance ofthe baseline model is set to 1. The tasks used are infinite-horizon discounted environments (γ = 0.98(HIV), γ = 0.99 (others)), where we truncated att = 1000. The experiments are repeated 200 times,and the error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals.
Figure 2: The OPE results compared to other model-free baselines. All experiments are repeated200 times and the error bars denote 95% confidence interval.
