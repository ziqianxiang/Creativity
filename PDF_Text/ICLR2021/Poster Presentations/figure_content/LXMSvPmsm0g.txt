Figure 1: Basic CIL Setting.
Figure 2: Framework of our proposed bottom-up (BU) lifelong pruning which is based on sparse modelconsolidation. Tickets founded by BU pruning keep expanding for each newly added task.
Figure 3: Evaluation performance (standard accuracy)of top-down lifelong tickets on CIFAR-10.
Figure 4: Performance and sparsity comparison between TR-BU tickets and TD tickets when training modelsincrementally. Left: CIFAR-10. Right: CIFAR-100. Upper: Comparison of SA. Bottom: Comparison ofremaining weights in tickets. Above all, tickets located by TD pruning continue to shrink with the growth ofincremental tasks. On the contrary, tickets founded by BU pruning keep expanding for each newly added task.
Figure 5: Left: the results of TD Tickets with/without lottery teaching. Right: the comparison of TD tickets(10.74%) obtained from uniform and curriculum pruning schedule. Experiments are conducted on CIFAR-10.
Figure A6: Evaluation performance (standard accuracy) of top-down lifelong tickets. The rightfigure zooms in the red dash-line box in the left figure.
Figure A7: Left: the results of TD Tickets with/without lottery teaching. Right: the comparisonof TD tickets (10.74%) obtained from uniform and curriculum pruning schedule. Experiments areconducted on CIFAR-10.
Figure A8: Framework of our proposed top-down lifelong pruning algorithms. The top-down (TD) lifelongpruning performs like iterative magnitude pruning (IMP) by unrolling the sequential tasks. Tickets located byTD pruning continue to shrink with the growth of incremental tasks.
