Figure 1: We plot [zn]K(z)/n-3/2 versus n for the Laplace kernel KLap(u) = e- 2(1-u) andNTKs N1, . . . ,N4 with β = 0, 1.
Figure 2: Bromwich contour that circumvents the branch cut (-∞, 0]which impliesx0 +iTlim	exp(ts — sa)ds = lim exp(ts — sa)dsT→∞ x0-iT	T→∞ Γ0= — lim + . . . +exp(ts - sa)ds, - lim(I1 + . . . + I5 ) ,where the last two limits are taken as R → ∞, r → 0, and Γ2, Γ4 tend to (-∞, 0]. We then calculateeach part separately.
