Figure 3: RoWS from top: original im-ages, images with missing, not-MIWAEimputationS, MIWAE imputationSTable 2: SVHN: Imputation RMSE and test-Set log-likelihood eStimate. ConStant imputationWith 1â€™s has a RMSE of 0.1757.
Figure 4: Histograms over rating values for the Yahoo! R3 dataset from (a) the MNAR training setand (b) the MCAR test set. (c) and (d) show histograms over imputations of missing values in thetest set, when encoding the corresponding training set. The not-MIWAE imputations (d) are muchmore faithful to the shape of the test set (b) than the MIWAE imputations (c).
Figure 5:	PPCA agnostic: Imputation RMSE at varying missing rates on UCI datasets. The vari-ation in missing rate is obtained by changing the cutoff point using an offset, so that an offset = 0corresponds to using the mean as the cutoff point while an offset = 1 corresponds to using the meanplus one standard deviation as the cutoff point. Results are averages over 2 runs.

Figure 7:	Self-masking known: Imputation RMSE at varying missing rates on UCI datasets. Thevariation in missing rate is obtained by changing the cutoff point using an offset, so that an offset = 0corresponds to using the mean as the cutoff point while an offset = 1 corresponds to using the meanplus one standard deviation as the cutoff point.
