Figure 1: Demonstration of our proposed attack against a deployed DNN in the memory. By flippingcritical bits (marked in red), our method can mislead a specific sample into the target class withoutany sample modification while not significantly reduce the prediction accuracy of other samples.
Figure 2: Results of TA-LBF with different parameters λ, k, and the number of auxiliary samplesN on CIFAR-10. Regions in shadow indicate the standard deviation of attacking the 1,000 images.
Figure 3: Visualization of decision boundaries of the original model and the post attack models. Theattacked sample from Class 3 is misclassified into the Class 1 by FSA, GDA, and our method.
