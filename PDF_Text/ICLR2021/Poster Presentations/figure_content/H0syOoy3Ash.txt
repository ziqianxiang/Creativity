Figure 1: Benchmarks and spectral density for different games. Top row: spectral density asso-ciated with bilinear games for varying values of the ratio parameter r = n/d (the x-axis representsthe imaginary line). Second row: Benchmarks. Average-case optimal methods always outperformother methods, and the largest gain is in the ill-conditioned regime (r â‰ˆ 1). Third row. Bench-marks (columns 1 and 3) and eigenvalue distribution of a design matrix generated with iid entriesfor two different degrees of conditioning. Depite the normality assumption not being satisfied, westill observe an improvement of average-case optimal methods vs worst-case optimal ones.
