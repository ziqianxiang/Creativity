Figure 2: Curves of strength of interaction components with different orders during the learn-ing process. All interactions were computed between activation units before dropout. ∆I(S)=llW2opoutl - lIWstLopout1 denotes the Change of interaction strength.
Figure 3: (left) The decrease of interactions caused by the dropout operation. (right) Close relation-ship between the target interaction Eimage[E(i,j)∈image∣I(i, j)|] and the interaction based on the Banzhafvalue Eimage[E(i,j)∈imagelIBanzhaf(i, j) ∣]. We show the change of the two types of interactions during thelearning process. The target interaction is highly related to the interaction based on Banzhaf value.
Figure 4: Curves of interaction strength encoded by DNNs trained using different weights of theinteraction loss. The interaction strength decreases along with the increase of the weight λ. Forfair comparison, we computed the interaction between activation units before the layer, in which weused the interaction loss or the dropout operation.
Figure 5: Curves of interactions when we set f = DNN output and when we set f = Loss,respectively. The interaction with f = Loss had similar behaviors with the interaction with f =DNN output.
Figure 6: Instability of the interaction approximatedwith different sampling numbers. The instability of theapproximated interaction decreased along with the in-crease of the sampling number.
