Figure 1: Comparison of certified accuracy to label-flipping poison attacks for our defense (SS-DPAalgorithm) vs. Rosenfeld et al. (2020) on MNIST. Solid lines represent certified accuracy as a func-tion of attack size; dashed lines show the clean accuracies of each model. Our algorithm producessubstantially higher certified accuracies. Curves for Rosenfeld et al. (2020) are adapted from Figure1 in that work. The parameter q is a hyperparameter of Rosenfeld et al. (2020)â€™s algorithm, and k isa hyperparameter of our algorithm: the number of base classifiers in an ensemble.
