Figure 1: The architecture of our Dual-Contrast Network (DCNet). The number in the boxes denotesthe corresponding image and the encoder module consists of a CNN layer (with ReLU and batchnormalization (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015)), a maxpooling layer and a residual block (He et al., 2016).
Figure 4: Two examples in RAVEN dataset (Zhang et al., 2019a). The correct answer is 16 (the leftpanel) and 11 (the right panel).
Figure 5: Two examples in PGM dataset (Santoro et al., 2018). The correct answer is 16 (the leftpanel) and 15 (the right panel).
