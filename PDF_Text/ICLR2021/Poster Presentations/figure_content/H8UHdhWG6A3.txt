Figure 1: We report on the highest measured top-1 cross-accuracy while training under eitherof the two studied, state-of-the-art attacks. [a, b]: a convolutional model (Section 4.1) forCIFAR-10 under the attack from Baruch et al. (2019), and [c, d]: a fully connected modelfor Fashion-MNIST (Xiao et al., 2017) under the attack from Xie et al. (2019a). Roughlyhalf the workers implements the attack in [a, c], and a quarter does in [b, d]; see Section4.1. Each experiment is run 5 times. The dotted blue line is the median of the maximumtop-1 cross-accuracy of the 5 runs without attack, and the boxes aggregate the maximumtop-1 cross-accuracy obtained under attack with each 5 runs of the 6 studied defenses. Over736 different combinations of attacks, defenses, datasets, etc (totalling of 3680 runs), ourmethod consistently obtain at least similar, if not substantially better performances (lowerminimal loss, higher maximal top-1 cross-accuracy) than the standard formulation. Notably,our formulation obtains these results with no additional computational complexity.
Figure 2: A parameter server setupwith n = 8 workers, among whichf = 3 are Byzantine (i.e., adversarial)workers. A black line represents abidirectional communication channel.
Figure 3: CIFAR-10 and the convolutional model (Section 4.1), with n = 25, f = 5 and αt =0.01 if t < 1500 else αt = 0.001, under attack from (Baruch et al., 2019). Each line and coloredsurface correspond to respectively the average and standard deviation of the top-1 cross-accuracy over 5 seeded runs. Only two parameters change between graphs: where momentumis computed (at the server or at the workers), and which flavor of momentum is employed.
