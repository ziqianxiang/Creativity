Figure 3: Comparison of FC layers in input spaces Bcn . The values at a certain dimension of outputspaces are illustrated as contour plots. Black arrows depict the orientation parameters, and they arefixed for the comparison. Their orthogonal curves show discriminative hyperplanes where the valuesare zeros. As a bias parameter b or rk changes, the outline of the contour landscape in (a) remainsunchanged, whereas in (b) the focused regions are dynamically squeezed according to the geodesics.
