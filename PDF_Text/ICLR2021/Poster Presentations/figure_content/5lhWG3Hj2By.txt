Figure 1: Test performance over training epochs for all learning methods employed in our experi-ments. For each training epoch (10 updates for the MBP model and 18 for PPO), we report averagequadratic loss over 50 episodes, and use “X” to indicate cases where the relevant method becameunstable. (Lower loss is better.) Our robust methods (denoted by *), unlike the non-robust methodsand RARL, remain stable under adversarial dynamics throughout training.
