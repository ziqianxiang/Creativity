Figure 1: Illustration of the proposed framework. Given the molecular graph, We 1) first draw latent variablesfrom a Gaussian prior, and transform them to the desired distance matrix through the Conditional Graph Con-tinuous Flow (CGCF); 2) search the possible 3D coordinates according to the generated distances and 3) furtheroptimize the generated conformation via a MCMC procedure with the Energy-based Tilting Model (ETM).
Figure 2: Visualization of generated conformations from the state-of-the-art baseline (GraphDG), our methodand the ground-truth, based on four random molecular graphs from the test set of GEOM-Drugs. C, O, H, Sand Cl are colored gray, red, white, yellow and green respectively.
Figure 3: Visualizations of generated graphs from our proposed method. In each row, we show multiplegenerated conformations for one molecular graph. For the top 5 rows, the graphs are chosen from the smallmolecules in GEOM-QM9 test dataset; and for the bottom 4 rows, graphs are chosen from the larger moleculesin GEOM-Drugs test dataset. C, O, H, S and CI are colored gray, red, white, yellow and green respectively.
Figure 4: Curves of the averaged coverage score with different RMSD thresholds on GEOM-QM9 (left two)and GEOM-Drugs (right two) datasets. The first and third curves are results of only the generative models,while the other two are results when further optimized with rule-based force fields.
Figure 5: Marginal distributions p(duv |G) of ground-truth and generated conformations between C and Oatoms given a molecular graph from the test set of ISO17. In each subplot, the annotation (U â€” V) indicates theatoms connected by the corresponding bond duv. We concentrate on the heavy atoms (C and O) and omit theH atoms for clarity.
