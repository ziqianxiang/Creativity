Figure 1: (a) Visualization of the path constructed Via mixup interpolations between groups thathave distribution P0 and P1, respectively. (b) Fair mixup penalizes the changes in model's expectedprediction with respect to the interpolated distributions. The regularized model (blue curve) hassmaller slopes comparing to the unregularized one (orange curve) along the path from P0 to P1,which eventually leads to smaller demographic parity ∆DP.
Figure 2: The expected output μf (t)gradually changes as t → L Even when∆DP is small, ∣dt μf (t)| could still belarge along the path.
Figure 3: Adult Dataset. (a,b) The tradeoff between AP and ∆DP∕∆EO. (C) Visualization of themixup path for models that regularize ∆DP with different algorithms. We plot the calibrated curveμf (t) := μf (t) - μf (0) for a better visualization. In this case, μf (0) = 0 and ∣μf (1)| = ∆DP forall the calibrated curves μf. Therefore, We can compare the ∆DP of each method with the absolutevalue of the last points (t = 1). The flatness of the path is highly correlated with the ∆DP.
Figure 4: CelebA Dataset. The tradeoff between AP and ∆DP∕∆EO are shown in the first/secondrow for each task. Manifold mixup consistently outperforms the baseline across tasks.

Interestingly, fairmixup presents a nearly linear Curve with small slope, while the baselines introduCe “inverted-U”shaped Curves.
