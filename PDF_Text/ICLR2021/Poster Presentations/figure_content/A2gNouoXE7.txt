Figure 1: FIPP alignment of source and target em-beddings, XS and Xt, to a common representationspace. Note XS is modified using information fromXt and mapped to Rd2 while Xt is unchanged.
Figure 2: Spectrum of Aligned EN Embeddings∈ R200 and DE Embeddings ∈ R300 . Spectrumsof Original, RCSLS and Linear EN embeddingsare all approx. equivalent.
Figure 3: Comparison of FIPP Objective Loss for(FI-FR) for solutions obtained using SGD vs LRAbe calculated either using Low Rank Approxi-mations or Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).
Figure 4: Gram matrix entries - unprocessed fast-Figure 5: Gram matrix entries - fastText embed-Text embeddings	dings with preprocessingH Complexity AnalysisIn this section, we provide the computational and space complexity of the FIPP method as describedin the paper for computing Xs . We split the complexity for each step in the method. We leaveout steps (i.e. preprocessing) which do not contribute significantly to the runtime or memoryfootprint. The computational complexity of matrix multiplication between two matrices A1A2, whereA1 ∈ Rm×nA2 ∈ Rn×p, is denoted as MM(m, n,p) which is upper bounded by 2mnp operations.
