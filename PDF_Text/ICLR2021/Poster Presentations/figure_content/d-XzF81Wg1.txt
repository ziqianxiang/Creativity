Figure 1: Diagram of a neu-ral network showing where themechanisms operate.
Figure 2:	Statistics of models with and without BatchNorm on CIFAR-10 (top) and Imagenet(bottom) showing the accuracy (left), feature embedding norm (middle), mean output norm (right).
Figure 3:	Effect of increasing the penalty coefficient for Imagenet on the accuracy (left), featureembedding norm (middle), and output norm (right). We see that embedding and function L2 recovermost of BatchNormâ€™s generalization boost when the embedding norm matches that of BatchNormnetworks.
