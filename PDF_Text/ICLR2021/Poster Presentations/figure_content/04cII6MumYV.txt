Figure 1: Illustration of how a single-head URT layer uses a universal representation to producea task-specific representation. This example assumes the use of four backbones, with each colorillustrating their domain-specific sub-vector representation in the universal representation.
Figure 2: Average attention scores generated by URT with two heads. Rows correspond to thedomain of the test tasks and the columns correspond to the pre-trained backbones ri (x) trained onthe eight training domains.
