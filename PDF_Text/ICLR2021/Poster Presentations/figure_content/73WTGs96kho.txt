Figure 1: V CDim(DTnr) and the upperbound on V CDim(DNFnk) (log scale)as a function of the input dimensionTheorem 2 (DNF VC-dimension bound). Let DNFnkbe the class of DNF formulas with k conjunc-tions on n Boolean variables. Then it holds thatV CDim(DNFnk) ≤ 2(n + 1)k log(3k).
Figure 2: The results on the six synthetic experiments. For each experiment we present the testaccuracy (with an error bar of the standard error of the mean) as a function of the input dimension d.
Figure 3: An example of a decision tree with rank 1, which is equivalent to the conjunction x0 ∧ x1 ∧x2 ∧ x3 ∧ x4.
