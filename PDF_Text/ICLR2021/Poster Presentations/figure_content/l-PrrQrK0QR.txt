Figure 1: (a) Learned samples of CIFAR-10 using KIP and its variant KIPρ, for which ρ fraction ofthe pixels are uniform noise. Using 1000 such images to train a 1 hidden layer fully connected net-work results in 49.2% and 45.0% CIFAR-10 test accuracy, respectively, whereas using 1000 originalCIFAR-10 images results in 35.4% test accuracy. (b) Example of labels obtained by label solving(LS ) (left two) and the covariance matrix between original labels and learned labels (right). Here,500 labels were distilled from the CIFAR-10 train dataset using the the Myrtle 10-layer convolu-tional network. A test accuracy of 69.7% is achieved using these labels for kernel ridge-regression.

Figure 3: KIP learned images transfers well to finite neural networks. Test accuracy on CIFAR-10 comparing natural images (x-axis) and KIP -learned images (y-axis). Each scatter point cor-responds to varying hyperparameters for training (e.g. learning rate). Top row are clean images,bottom row are 90% corrupted images. KIP images were trained using FC1-3, Conv1-2 kernels.

Figure A2: Label Solve transfer between Myrtle-10 and FC for CIFAR10. Top row: LS labelsusing Myrtle-10 applied to FC1. Bottom row: LS labels using FC1 applied to Myrtle-10. Resultsaveraged over 3 samples per support set size. In all these plots, NNGP kernels were used andMyrtle-10 used regularized ZCA preprocessing.
Figure A3: KIP Vs natural images, FC1. Data plotted from Tables A7-A10, showing naturalimages vs. KIP images for FC1 neural networks across dataset size, corruption type, dataset type,and loss type. For instance, the upper right figure shows that on MNIST using cross entropy loss,1k KIP + aug learned images with 90% corruption achieves 90.9% test accuracy, comparable to 1knatural images (acc: 91.3%) and far exceeding 1k natural images with 90% corruption (acc: 75.0%).

Figure A5: KIP learned images (left) vs natural CIFAR-10 images (right). Samples from 100learned images. Top row: 0% corruption. Bottom row: 90% noise corruption.
