Figure 1: Both options are equally plausi-ble and fluent, but a response with effectivepragmatic strategies leads to a better deal.
Figure 2: Overview of DIALOGRAPH. At time t, utterance ut is encoded using BERT and thenpassed to the Dialogue Context Encoder to generate the dialogue representation. This representationis enriched with the encodings of explicit strategy and dialogue act sequences using the structureencoders which is then used to condition the Utterance decoder. Please refer to ยง2 for details.
Figure 3: Visualization of the learnt latent strategy sequences in DialoGraph where bolder edgesrepresent higher influence. Here we present only a few edges for brevity and visualize min-max nor-malized attention values as edge weights to analyze the relative ranking of strategies. For example,for family at u7, informal of u5 has the most influence followed by propose. We present the fullattention map for this example in Figure 5 in the Appendix.
Figure 4: Visualization of a strategy sequence graph. The graph connects each strategy with allpreviously occurring strategies. Here we present only a few edges for brevity. For example, therewould be two more additional edges from u4 to the strategies of u5 .
Figure 5: Visualization of the attention map learned by DialoGraph for the example depicted inFigure 3 in the main paper. We only show it for a few turns for brevity. Here the axis labels representthe turn and the strategy. Refer to the Figure 3 in the main paper for description.
