Figure 1: Analyzing detection error using the detection toolbox (Hoiem et al., 2012) on PASCALVOC. Distribution of top-ranked false positive (FP) types for finetuning with supervised and unsu-pervised methods. Supervised pretraining models more frequently result in localization errors thanunsupervised pretraining models. Each FP is categorized into 1 of 4 types: Loc—poor localization;Sim—confusion with a similar category; Oth—confusion with a dissimilar object category; BG—aFP that fires on background.
Figure 2: Image reconstruction by feature inversion. We use the method of deep image prior (Ulyanovet al., 2018) to reconstruct images by a pretrained network. Contrastive models allow for holisticreconstruction over the entire image, while supervised models lose information in many regions.
