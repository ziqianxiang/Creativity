Figure 1: Overview of the proposed Auto Seg-Loss framework. The surfaces of hAND and hORshown in the ”Optimal Parameterization” illustrate the searched optimal parameterization for mIoU.
Figure 2: Parameterization of g(y; θ)using Piecewise Bezier curve with foursegments. The red points are controlpoints. The purple point is on the curve,which shows the relationship among y,g(y; θ) and the transversal parameter s.
Figure 3: Ablation on loss parameter search. Each curve presents the highest average evaluationscore up to the t-th step in one search process. The search process is repeated four times.
