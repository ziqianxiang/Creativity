Figure 2: Complementary results to Figure 1 with K = 4. Average success rate and iteration growth over 100trials, as a function of the number of entries per subspace | Ωk | (which in turn is a proxy of the ambient dimensiond), the subspaces dimensions r, the gap Y := ∣Ωk∣ — (r + 1), and the noise level σ.
