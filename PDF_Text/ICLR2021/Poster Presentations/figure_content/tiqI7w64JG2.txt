Figure 1: A pair of graphs that can be distinguished by 2 iterations of the WL test but not by GA-MLPs withΩ ⊆ {Ak : k ∈ N},as proved in Appendix K.
Figure 2: A pair of rooted graphs, G[1] (left) and G0[1] (right), in which blue nodes have node feature 0and green nodes have node feature 1. They belong to the same equivalence class induced by any GA-MLPwith operators that only depend on the graph structure, but different equivalence classes induced by GNNs.
Figure 3: Community detection on binary SBM with 5 choices ofin- and out-group connectivities, each yielding to a different SNR.
Figure 4: An illustration of rooted graphs and rooted aggregation trees. Left: a pair of graphs, G andG0. Center: the rooted graphs of 1 in G and G0, G[1] and G0[1] . Right: the rooted aggregation treethat both G[1] and G0[1] correspond to.
Figure 5: A pair of graphs with identical node features, G (left) and G0 (right), which can be distin-guished by 2 iterations of the WL testbut not by the GA-MLP with Ω ⊆ {Ak }k∈N.
