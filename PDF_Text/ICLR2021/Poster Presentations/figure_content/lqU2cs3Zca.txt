Figure 2: Time taken on benchmark computations to backpropagate through the signature transform.
Figure 1: Time taken on benchmark computations to compute the signature transform. esig is onlyshown for small operations as it is incapable of larger operations. Note the logarithmic scale.
Figure 3: Loss against wall-clock time for a deep signature model. Both plots are identical; thesecond plot uses a log-scaled x-axis.
Figure 4: Time taken on benchmark computations to compute the specified operation. In all casesthe input was a batch of 32 sequences of data, each of length 128. For varying channels, the depthwas fixed at 7. For varying depths, the channels was fixed at 4. Every test case was repeated 50 timesand the fastest time taken. Note that esig is only shown for certain operations as it is incapable ofcomputing large operations or of computing backward operations. Note the logarithmic scale.
Figure 5: Time taken on benchmark computations to compute the specified operation. In all casesthe input was a “batch” of 1 sequence, of length 128. For varying channels, the depth was fixed at 7.
Figure 6: Time taken on benchmark computations to compute the specified operation. In all casesthe input was a “batch” of 1 sequence, of length 128. For varying channels, the depth was fixed at 7.
