Figure 1: Gradient descent trajectories of linear coefficients of linear fully-connected, diagonal, andconvolutional networks on a regression task, initialized with different initial scales α = 0.01, 1.
Figure 2: Gradient descent trajectories of linear coefficients of linear fully-connected, diagonal, andconvolutional networks on a regression task with initial scale α = 0.5 (top left), and networks ona classification task with initial scales α = 0.01, 0.5, 1 (rest). Networks are initialized at the samecoefficients (circles on purple lines), but follow different trajectories due to different implicit biasesof networks induced from their architecture. The top left figure shows that our theoretical predictionson limit points (circles on yellow line, the set of global minima) agree with the solution found byGD. For details of the experimental setup, please refer to Section 6.
