Figure 1: Visual illustration of Ring Discrimination. Black: view of example xi ; gray: secondview of xi; red: negative samples; gray area: distribution q(x|t(xi)). In subfigure (c), the negativesamples are annealed to be closer to t(xi) through training. In other words, the support of q shrinks.
Figure 2: Defining the CNCE distribution q(x|t(xi)). By choosing a lower and upper percentile `and u, we implicitly define similarity thresholds ωg and ωu to construct a support of valid negativeexamples, SB, which in turn, defines the distribution q(x|t(xi)).
