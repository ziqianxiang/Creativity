Figure 1: Overview of the Contextual Transformation Networks (CTN). CTN consists of a controllerθ that modifies the features of the base model φ. The base model is trained using experience replayon the episodic memory while the controller is trained to generalize to the semantic memory, whichaddresses both alleviating forgetting and facilitating knowledge transfer. Best viewed in colors.
Figure 2: ACC(↑) as a function of the episodic memory size on the Split CIFAR-100 and SplitminiIMN benchmarks. Best viewed in colors.
Figure 3: Effect of memory size on CTN’s performance. For every semantic memory size m × 50,the corresponding episodic memory size is (1 - m) × 50.
