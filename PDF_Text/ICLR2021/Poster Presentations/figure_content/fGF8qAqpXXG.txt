Figure 1: As the number of neurons increases, the solution of SGD approaches the optimal value.
Figure 2: The maximum-margin SVD from Theorem 2 provides the closed-form solution for theoptimal value of the neural network training problem for whitened CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.
Figure 3: Spiral classification: SGD (1000 neurons), Algorithm 1, and copositive relaxation (19).
Figure 4: The copositive relaxation (20) and solution found by SGD nearly correspond for almostall β.
Figure 5: Comparing train and test accuracy of linear and ReLU two-layer networks on generatedcontinuous labels on CIFAR-10. We note that for β ≥ 1.0, the optimal solution for both networksis to simply set all weights to zero. The best-case test loss for the ReLU network is nearly half thebest-case test loss for the linear network.
