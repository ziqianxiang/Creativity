Figure 1: An illustration of (a) classic LISTA; (b) connection injection with learnable weightedaverage. We only plot one layer for illustration.
Figure 2: Visualization of our searched “averaged architecture”. The vertical and horizontal axesdenote the “destination” and “origin” layer indices for a skip connection. Note that every layer isalways taken as input for its immediate preceding layer, therefore the diagonal line is all one.
Figure 3: Connectivity visualization for LFISTA and Dense-LISTA. The vertical and horizontal ax-esdenote the “destination” and “origin” layer indices for a skip connection. 1 means the connectionis activated.
Figure 4: An illustration of connection injection with Momentum.
Figure 5: The NMSE distribution of sampled architectures, using NA, LWA and MM to inject extraskip connections, in synthetic experiments under different SNRs. The red star marks the originalLISTA. x-axis from left to right denotes the number of added extra connections from low to high.
Figure 6: Distribution of sampled architectures in non-exactly sparse vector case and limited trainingdata case.
Figure 7: Pruning from original unrolled LISTA.
Figure 8: Pruning from LWA architectures.
Figure 9: The connection difference between the default top-50 average and top-30 average.
