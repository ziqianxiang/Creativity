Figure 1: Standard deviation during idealized sampling using a perfect score function s*. The blackcurve in (a) corresponds to the true geometric progression, as demonstrated in Proposition 2.
Figure 2: Langevin sampling on synthetic 2D experiments. Circles are real data points, crosses aregenerated data points. On both datasets, taking the EDS brings the samples much closer to the realdata manifold.
Figure 3: Partial estimate of FID (lower is better) as a function of the sampling step size on CIFAR-10,with nÏƒ = 1. The interactions between consistent sampling and denoising are shown.
