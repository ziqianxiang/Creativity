Figure 1: Clairvoyance and the Patient Journey. The healthcare lifecycle revolves around asking (1) What out-comes are most likely, (2) which treatments may best improve them, and (3) when taking additional measurementsis most informative. Utilizing both static and temporal data, Clairvoyance provides corresponding pathways forpersonalized prediction of outcomes, personalized estimation of treatment-effects, and personalized monitoring.
Figure 2: Clairvoyance Pipeline Overview. (Dashed) purple cells denote pipeline inputs/outputs, and (solid) graycells denote pipeline components. Orange options give main pathway models, and blue options give surroundingcomponents. (Solid) gray arrows indicates pipeline workflow, and (dashed) orange the optimization interface.
Figure 3:	Illustrative Usage. A prototypical structure of API calls for constructing a prediction pathway model.
Figure 4:	Optimization Interface. Example code using the optimization interface to conduct stepwise (i.e. acrosstime steps) and componentwise (i.e. across the pipeline) configuration. Each interface is implementable by anychoice of new/existing algorithms. The DKL implementation of SMS is provided for use the Section 4 examples.
