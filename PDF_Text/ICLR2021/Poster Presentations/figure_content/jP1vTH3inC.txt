Figure 1: Computational Graph for Variational Order InferenceStarting from just the original data y in natural order, We can use variational inference to create anobjective (2) that alloWs us to recover latent order z, parametrized by tWo neural netWorks θ and φ.
Figure 2: Runtime performance improvement. We compare the runtime performance of VOI(K = 4) with SAO on a single Tesla P100 GPU, in terms of time per training iteration and orderingsearch time. VOI outputs latent orderings in a single forward pass, and we observe a significantruntime improvement over SAO that searches orderings sequentially. The speedup factor linearlyincreases with respect to the sequence length.
Figure 3: Global statistics for learned orders. We compare metrics as a function of the sequencelength of generated captions on the COCO 2017 validation set. On the left, we compare orderslearned with Variational Order Inference to a set of predefined orders (solid lines) using Order RankCorrelation. As a reference, we provide the Order Rank Correlation between L2R and the same setof predefined orders (dashed lines). In the right plot, with identical setup, we measure NormalizedLevenshtein Distance. We observe that Variational Order Inference favors left-to-right decodingabove the other predefined orders—this corresponds to the blue lines. However, with a max OrderRank Correlation of 0.6, it appears left-to-right is not a perfect explanation. The comparably highOrder Rank Correlation of 0.3 with rare-tokens-first order suggests a complex strategy.
Figure 4: Local statistics for learned orders. In this figure, we evaluate the normalized generationindices for different parts of speech in model-predicted captions on the COCO 2017 validation set.
Figure 5: This figure demonstrates our algorithm for an image captioning task. The model on theleft is the Permutation Transformer, which maps training examples to permutation matrices. Themodel on the right is an autoregressive model that learns to predict tokens and positions.
Figure 6:	Generation order inferred by Variational Order Inference. Without supervision over itsgeneration order, nor a domain-specific initialization, nor a prior to aid learning, the model learns anadaptive strategy that prioritizes object names—in this case, people and snow.
