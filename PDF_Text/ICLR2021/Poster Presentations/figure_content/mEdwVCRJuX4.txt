Figure 1: Histogram of the distributions oflosses on an imbalanced and noisy CIFAR-10dataset. Clean but rare examples tend to havelarger losses, similar to the noisy examples infrequent classes.
Figure 2: Real-world datasets have various sourcesof heterogeneity and it could be hard to distin-guish one from another. They require mutually-exclusive reweighting strategy, but they all benefitfrom stronger regularization.
Figure 3: A one-dimensional example with athree-layer neural network in heteroskedastic andimbalanced regression setting. The curve in blueis the underlying ground truth and the dots areobservations with heteroskedastic noise. This ex-ample shows that uniformly weak regularizationoverfits on noisy and rare data (on the right half),whereas uniformly strong regularization causesunderfitting on the frequent and oscillating data(on the left half). The adaptive regularization doesnot underfit the oscillating data but still denoisethe noisy data. We note that standard nonparamet-ric methods such as cubic spline do not work herebecause they also use uniform regularization.
