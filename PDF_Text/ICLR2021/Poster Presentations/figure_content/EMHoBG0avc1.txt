Figure 1: An overview of the multi-hop dense retrieval approach.
Figure 2: The retrieval performance gap be-tween comparison and bridge questions. Left:recall of groundtruth passage sequences with-out reranking. Right: Top-1 chain exactmatch after reranking.
Figure 3: Efficiency-performance trade-off com-parison with published HotpotQA systems. Thecurve is plotted with different number of top k(k=1,5,10,20,50,100,200) passage sequences wefeed into the reader model. seq/Q denotes the timerequired for each query.
Figure 4: Performance gap between retrieval-free and retrieval-based methods on different QAdatasets.
