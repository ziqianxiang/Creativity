Figure 1: Overview of the TNC framework components. For each sample window Wt (indicatedwith the dashed black box), We first define the neighborhood distribution. The encoder learns thedistribution of windows sampled from Nt and Nt, in the representation space. Then samples fromthese distributions are fed into the discriminator alongside Zt, to predict the probability of thewindows being in the same neighborhood.

Figure 3: Trajectory of a signal encoding from the simulated dataset. The top plot shows the originaltime series with shaded regions indicating the underlying state. The bottom plot shows the 10dimensional encoding of the sliding windows Wt where Î´ = 50.
