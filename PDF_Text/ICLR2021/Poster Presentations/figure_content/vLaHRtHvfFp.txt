Figure 1: Computational graph of the proposed model. ES and ET take contiguous observationsas input; time invariance is enforced on S ; the evolution of Tt is modeled with an ODE and isconstrained to coincide with ET; Tt0 is regularized; forecasting amounts to decoding from S and Tt.
Figure 2: Example of predictions ofcompared models on SST. Content swappreserves the location of extreme temper-ature regions which determine the move-ment while modifying the magnitude ofall regions, especially in temperate areas.
