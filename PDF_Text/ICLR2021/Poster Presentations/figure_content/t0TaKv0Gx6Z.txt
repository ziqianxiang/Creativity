Figure 1: (Left) The connections between SD, KSD and the proposed SSD family. (Right) Theintuition of SSD. The rectangular boxes indicate what statistics the discrepancy wants to test. Thecircle represents the dimension of the test function required for such test. The double arrow meansequivalence relations or invertable operations.

Figure 3: Each column reports GOF test results for a different alternative hypothesis, with the upperpanel showing the rejection rate of the Null hypothesis and the lower panel showing the discrepancyvalue averaged over all trials. Both quantities are plotted w.r.t. the number of dimensions.
