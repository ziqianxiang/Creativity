Figure 1: The INTERPOLE Model. Here, S= {K, L,M} and A={1, 2, 3, 4}. (a) Beliefs are updated rec-ursively (Equation 1). (b) Actions are chosen with res-pect to relative locations of mean vectors (Equation 2).
Figure 2: The INTERPOLE Objective. Inputs (demon-stration data) are fed into Interpole through dashedlines, and outputs (estimates) are issued in bold lines.
Figure 3: Decision Trajectories. Examples of real patients, including: (a) A typical normally-functioning patient,where the decision-maker’s beliefs remain mostly on the decision boundary. (b) A typical patient who is believedto be deteriorating towards dementia. (c) A patient who—apparently—could have been diagnosed much earlierthan they actually were. (d) A patient with a (seemingly redundant) MRI test that is actually highly informative.
Figure 4: Explaining Subjective Behavior. Markersshow the evolution of beliefs that explain ground-truthand learned policies in BIAS, for an example sce-nario where two consecutive negative (z- ) observa-tions are made. While all policies display similar ef-fective behavior, only Interpole correctly identifiesthe ground-truth decision boundary. This underscoresthe significance of distinguishing between decisiondynamics (which help explain an agent’s behavior)and “true” dynamics (which we do not care about).
Figure 5: Two Different Descriptions of the Same Policy: (a) in the form of a decision tree and (b) interms of an equivalent IOHMM. For the IOHMM in (b), arrows denote possible transitions, wherethe probability of a transition is proportional to the quantity written above the corresponding arrow.
