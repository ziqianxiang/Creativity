Figure 1: An MNIST digit, a coalition of pixels in a Shapley calculation, and 5 off-manifold splices.
Figure 2: (a) Vulnerability of off-manifold explanations to hidden model dependence. (b) Explana-tions of a fixed model compared to a model that is retrained on each Shapley coalition of features.
Figure 3: An individual outlier (a), its off- and on-manifold explanations (b & c), the error rate inexplanations (d), and the distribution of model outputs on Shapley coalitions (e & f).
Figure 4: Negative global Shapley values arise off-manifold, in both (a) synthetic and (b) real data.
Figure 5: Validation of unsupervised and supervised techniques for computing on-manifold Shapleyvalues. Comparison against empirical ground truth, which appeared as “On manifold” in Fig. 2(b).
Figure 6: (a) Randomly drawn MNIST digits explained on/off manifold. Red/blue pixels indi-cate positive / negative Shapley values, and the colour scale in each column is fixed. (b) Shapleysummand as a function of coalition size - averaged over coalitions, pixels, and the MNIST test set.
