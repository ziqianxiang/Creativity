Figure 1: A toy example showing values of NLL (Blue), ES (Green) and DMM (Orange) plottedagainst the parameter σ of an isotropic covariance matrix σI, when assigned to low error (SolidLines) and high error (Dashed Lines) detection outputs from DETR.
Figure 2: Average over 80 classification categories of NLL, ES, and MSE for bounding box pre-dictive distributions estimates from probabilistic detectors with DETR, RetinaNet, and FasterRCNNbackends on in-distribution (COCO), artificially shifted (C1-C5), and naturally shifted (OpenIm)datasets. Error bars represent the 95% confidence intervals around the mean.
Figure 3: Average over 80 classification categories of NLL and Brier score for classification predic-tive distributions generated using DETR. Error bars represent the 95% confidence intervals aroundthe mean. Similar trends are seen for RetinaNet and FasterRCNN backends in Figures F.2, F.3.
Figure 4: Left: Differential Entropy vs IOU with ground truth plots for bounding box predictivedistribution estimates on in-distribution data. Right: Histograms of the IOU of ground truth boxeswith boxes assigned as regression targets during network training, plotted at 0%, 50%, and a 100%of the training process. The red dashed line signifies the 0.5 IOU level on both plots.
