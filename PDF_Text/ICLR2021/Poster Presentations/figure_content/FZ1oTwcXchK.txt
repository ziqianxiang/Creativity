Figure 1: Schematics on the conversion pipeline. (A) The SNN propagates spiking frequencies withthe activation sequence xl0 = {xl0(1), ..., xl0(T)} and averaged output al0 for l = 1, ..., L through Llayers. (B) Activation functions of regular and threshold ReLUs for ANNs, and the step functionfor SNNs. (C) The error between ReLU and step function with Vth /2T shift. See Section 5 for thedetailed discussion.
