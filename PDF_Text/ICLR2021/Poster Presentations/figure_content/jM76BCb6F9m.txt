Figure 1: Breakdown of the computation of mel-filterbanks, Time-Domain filterbanks, SincNet,and the proposed LEAF frontend. Orange boxes are fixed, while computations in blue boxes arelearnable. Grey boxes represent activation functions.
Figure 2: Frequency response of filters at convergence for two parametrizations: normalized 1Dfilters and Gabor filters, both initialized on a mel scale. We highlight two filters among the 40 of thefilterbank: one in yellow in the low frequency range and one in pink at high frequencies.
