Figure 1: Example final state of a traditional heap allocator (Marlow et al., 2008) (Left) vs. K++(Right); final state created by sequential operations listed on the left. K++ uses a key distributionto stochastically point to a memory sub-region while Marlow et al. (2008) uses a direct pointer.
Figure 2: (a): Generative model (§3.4). (b): Read inference model (§3.5). (c): Iterative readinference model (§3.5). (d): Write inference model (§3.3). Dashed lines represent approximateinference, while solid lines represent computing of a conditional distribution. Double sided arrowin (c) represents the KL divergence between qφ(ZIX) and Pθ(ZIM, Y) from Equation 4. Squaresrepresent deterministic nodes. Standard plate notation is used to depict a repetitive operation.
