Figure 1: Top: Semantic parse tree of the utterance “Driving directions to the Eagles game”. Bot-tom: Serialized tree. IN: stands for intents while SL: stands for slots (See Gupta et al., 2018).
Figure 2: A sub-matrix of the noise distribution matrix learned from the target domains on: (left)the TOPv2 data in the few-shot setting, (right) the Overnight data set in the transfer learning setting.
Figure 3: Calibration plots for model trained on hard targets (no label smoothing), standard labelsmoothing, and LORAS on the test set of target domains in the TOPv2 data set.
Figure 4: A sub-matrix of noise distribution matrix learned over the SNIPS data set. The top tenrows shows labels with the lowest entropy noise distribution while the bottom ten rows shows labelswith the highest entropy noise distributions.
