Figure 2: A multi-layer GNN model with a global readout unfolded over an exam-ple molecule of methane. Colors are used to distinguish the weight sharing, as well as different nodetypes categorized w.r.t. the associated activation functions, denoted as input (I), convolution (C), andaggregation (A) nodes, respectively.
Figure 3: A compressed version of the GNN from Fig. 2, with the compressed parts dotted.
Figure 4: Compression of a scalar-parameterized graphlets model on a molecular dataset. Wedisplay progression of the selected metrics w.r.t. increasing number of significant digits (inits=1) usedin the value comparisons (left), and number of non-equivalent subgraph value clashes detected by theexact algorithm w.r.t. the digits, weight re-initializations, and increased weight dimension (right).
