Figure 1: Pictorial depiction of the two layers underlying a Fourier flow. Here, we consider an exemplary in-stance of a time-series with D = 5 and T = 6, to which we apply a 10-point Fourier flow (N = 10). In alldisplays, the x-axis corresponds to either the time or frequency indexes, the y-axis corresponds to the featuredimension, and the red dots correspond to the value associated with a given time (frequency) index in a givenfeature dimension. (Darker shades of red correspond to higher values.) (a) DFT layer. In this example, weassume the sampling periods to be r1 = 2, and rd = 1, âˆ€d 6= 1. In the first step of the flow, we set all missingvalues in the under-sampled feature dimension to 0, and padd N - T = 4 zeros to all features. (Padded zerosare depicted as white dotted circles), which results in a padded time-series X in the form of a D X N matrix.
Figure 2: Performance of FF, RealNVP and TimeGAN in learning to generate random sinusoidal time-series withrandom frequencies. (a) Here, we estimate the dominant frequency of the sinusoidal signals generated by eachbaseline and plot the histogram for the estimated frequencies across that of the ground-truth distribution of thetrue frequency f . We plot a kernel density estimate of the histogram in each plot. Note that the ranges of the x-and y-axes in each plot change according to the estimated distributions. (b) Assessment of the time-series datagenerated by the different baselines in terms of exact data likelihood, spectral properties and predictive utility.
