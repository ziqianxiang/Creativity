Figure 1: Tasks for evaluating MPQ(λ). Left to right - cartpole, peg insertion with 7DOF arm, and in-handmanipulation to orient align pen(blue) with target(green) with 24DOF dexterous hand.
Figure 2: CARTPOLESWINGUP experiments. Solid lines show average rewards over 30 validation episodes (fixedstart states) with length of 100 steps and 3 runs with different seeds. The dashed lines are average reward of MPPI forthe same validation episodes. Shaded region depicts the standard error of the mean that denotes the confidence on theaverage reward estimated from finite samples. Training is performed for 100k steps with validation after every 4k steps.
Figure 3: Robustness and sample efficiency of MPQ(λ). (a),(b) Varying bias factor over mass, inertia and frictionof pen (c),(d) Peg insertion with noisy perception. Total episode length is 75 steps for both. Same bias factor b isused for all altered properties per task. Curves depict average reward over 30 validation episodes with multiple seedsand shaded areas are the standard error of the mean. Validation done after every 3k steps and λ is decayed to 0.85at end of 75k training steps in both. Asymptotic performance of PPO is average of last 10 validation iterations. Referto Appendix A.2 for details on tasks and success metrics.
