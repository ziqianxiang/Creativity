Figure 1: While most existing models (e.g., Sub-figures (a) (Kingma et al., 2014; Kulkarni et al., 2015) and(b) (Creswell et al., 2017)) do not explicitly learn the correspondence between latent dimensions and dataproperties, some recent work (Sub-figures (c) (Klys et al., 2018) and (d)) has started to explore this. Thegenerative model (right) and its model inference (left) are shown in each sub-figure. Dotted arrows representthe enforcement of independence and double arrows represent the invertible dependence between two variables.
