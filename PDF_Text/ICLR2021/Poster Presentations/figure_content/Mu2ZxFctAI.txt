Figure 5: Classification error rate compari-son on UCI User Knowledge datasetβi = 10 in2 if the true frequency of High orparameters αi and βi . We present the results with the uncertainty class by setting αieight randomly chosen bins and for the other bins, αi = 5, βiMedium in the i-th bin is lower than 0.5 and αi = 2, βi = 5 otherwise. We have randomly drawn150 samples from each class as the candidate pool and perform the five different active learning al-gorithms. We repeat the whole procedure 150 times and the average error rates are shown in Fig. 5.
