Figure 1: There is a resemblance between meta-learning and identifying the physical laws of Hamil-tonian. A hypothesized governing equation of Hamiltonian, usually corrected and established byevaluating many related systems, could be learned using meta-learning as a data-driven method(left). Then, a well-established Hamiltonian can be utilized to predict new system dynamics, whichcould be viewed as a meta-transfer process by a well-trained meta-learner (right).
Figure 2: Predicted vector fields (gray streamlines) by adapting the learners to observations of newpendulum systems given as point dynamics (red arrows) or trajectories (red dots) after the corre-sponding gradient steps. The x-axis and y-axis denote q and p, respectively.
Figure 3: Predicted state trajectories (or position coordinates for Kepler problem) and the corre-sponding energies, and the corresponding MSEs at each time step. Note that the MSEs of spring-mass and pendulum are represented as log-scaled.
Figure 4: Ablation studies conducted on 10 new pendulum systems by comparing (a) Learningcurves during task-adaptation, and (b) the effects of the size of the meta-train sets.
Figure 5: Predicted vector fields (gray streamlines) by adapting the learners to observations of newspring-mass systems given as point dynamics (red arrows) or trajectories (red dots) after the corre-sponding gradient steps. The x-axis and y-axis denote q and p, respectively.
