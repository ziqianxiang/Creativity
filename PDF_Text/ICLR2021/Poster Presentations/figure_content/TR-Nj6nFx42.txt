Figure 1: Bound evaluations on real-world datasets. The maximum node degrees (i.e., d- 1) of fourdataSetS from left to right are: 25 (PROTEINS), 88 (IMDB-M), 135 (IMDB-B), and 491 (COLLAB).
Figure 2: Bound evaluations on synthetic datasets. The maximum node degrees (i.e., d - 1) ofdatasets from left to right are: 25 (ER-1), 48 (ER-2), 69 (ER-3), 87 (ER-4), 25 (SBM-1), and 36(SBM-2). ‘ER-X' and 'SBM-X' denote the ErdoS-Renyi model and the stochastic block model withthe ‘X’-th setting respectively. Please refer to the appendix for more details.
