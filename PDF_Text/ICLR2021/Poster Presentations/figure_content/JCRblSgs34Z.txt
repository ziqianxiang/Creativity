Figure 1: We plot the effect of increasing β on the sum of the bounds (computed using our methodi.e ∖∕hW∣∣R∣∣2) and sum of true spectral norms (J(I) ∣∣2 computed using Sedghi et al. (2019)) for aResnet-32 neural network trained on CIFAR-10 dataset (without any weight decay). We observe thatthe gap between the two decreases as we increase β . In Table 6, we show the effect of increasing βon the bounds of individual layers of the same network.)Y	MNIST			CIFAR-10			Standard Accuracy	Empirical Robust Accuracy	Certified Robust Accuracy	Standard Accuracy	Empirical Robust Accuracy	Certified Robust Accuracy^0	98.68%	87.81%	0.00%	56.22%	14.88%	0.00%0.01	97.08%	92.92%	91.25%	53.52%	31.82%	17.39%0.02	96.36%	90.98%	89.58%	49.55%	31.80%	25.93%0.03	95.54%	89.99%	88.75%	46.56%	31.98%	29.26%Table 7: Comparison between certified robust accuracy for different values of the regularizationparameter γ for a single hidden layer convolutional neural network with softplus activation function.
