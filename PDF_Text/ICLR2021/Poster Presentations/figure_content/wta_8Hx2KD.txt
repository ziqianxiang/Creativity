Figure 5: Theoretical turbulence energyspectrum plotC Heat diffusion2D Heat Equation. Let H(t, x, y) be a scalar field representing temperature. Then H satisfies∂H=α∆H.
Figure 6: Five snapshots in heat diffusion dynamics. The spatial resolution is 50×50 pixels.
Figure 7: A snapshot of the Rayleigh-Benard convection flow, the velocity fields along x direction(left) and y direction (right) [8]. The spatial resolution is 1792×256 pixels.
Figure 8: The ground truth and the predicted velocity norm fields (√u2 + v2) at time step 1, 5and 10 by the U-net and four Equ-Unet on the four transformed test samples. From left toright, the transformed test samples are the original test samples uniform-motion-shifted by (1, -0.5),magnitude-scaled by 1.5, rotated by 90 degrees and upscaled by 3 respectively. The first row is thetarget, the second row is Equ-Unets predictions, and the third row is predictions by U-net.
