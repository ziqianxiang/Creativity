Figure 1: Vector fields of hidden states that are governed by Eq. (1) trained for simple pendulumdynamics. In (a), an unstable model is shown. In (b) and (c), it can be seen that we yield modelsthat are asymptotically stable,i.e., all trajectories are attracted by an equilibrium point. In contrast,in (d), a skew-symmetric parameterization leads to a stable model without an attracting equilibrium.
Figure 2: Sensitivity with respect to different input perturbations.
Figure 3: The ablation study examines the effect of the linear term Ah (in (a)) and the importanceof the Skew-Symmetric Decomposition for constructing the hidden-to-hidden matrices (in (b)).
Figure 4:	Empirical evaluation of the theoretical bounds (16). The red lines track the largest realpart and the blue lines track the smallest real part of the eigenvalues of the hidden-to-hidden matrixAβ . Each line corresponds to a different hidden-to-hidden matrix of dimension N = 64 in (a) andN = 128 in (b). The dashed black lines indicate the theoretical bound for each trial.
Figure 5:	The red lines track the largest real part of the eigenvalues of the hidden-to-hidden matrixAβ,γ and the blue lines track the largest real part of the eigenvalues of Wβ,γ. We show results fortwo models trained on the ordered MNIST task with varying β.
