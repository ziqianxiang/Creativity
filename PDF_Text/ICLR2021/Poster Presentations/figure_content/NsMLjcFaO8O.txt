Figure 1: A visualization of the WaveGrad inference process. Starting from Gaussian noise (n = 0),gradient-based sampling is applied using as few as 6 iterations to achieve high fidelity audio (n = 6).
Figure 2: WaveGrad directed graphical model for training, conditioned on iteration index.
Figure 3: WaveGrad network architecture. The in-puts consists of the mel-spectrogram conditioningsignal x, the noisy waveform generated from theprevious iteration yn, and the noise level √a. ThSmodel produces en at each iteration, which can beinterpreted as the direction to update yn .
