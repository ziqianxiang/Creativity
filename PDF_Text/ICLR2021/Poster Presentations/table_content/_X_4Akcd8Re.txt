Table 1: We compare our method with different baselines on all four datasets. The left part showsthe prediction error when rollout timesteps is the same as training time. The right part shows thegeneralization ability to longer horizon unseen during training. The error is scaled by 1,000. Ourmethod has significantly improvements on all of the datasetsmethod	visual encoder	PHYRE-C SS-4 SimB-5VIN	Global Encoding	N.A. N.A. N.A.
Table 2: The ability to generalize to novel environments. We show the average prediction error fort ∈ [0, 2 × Ttrain]. Our method achieves significantly better results compared to previous methods.
Table 3: PHYRE Planning results. RANDstands for a score function with random policy.
Table 4: Simulation Billiards planning results. Tomake a fair comparison, all of baselines and ourmethods are using the original interaction networkand only the visual encoding method is changing.
