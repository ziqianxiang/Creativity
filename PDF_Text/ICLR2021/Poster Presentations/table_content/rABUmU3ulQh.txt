Table 1: Quantitative comparison of probabilistic shape completion results on PartNet (top) andPartNet-Scan (bottom). The best results trained in single class are in bold. Note that MMD (quality),TMD (diversity) and UHD (fidelity) presented in the tables are multiplied by 103, 102 and 102,respectively. GCA (joint) denotes GCA trained on all categories combined, but evaluated individually.
