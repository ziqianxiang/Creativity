Table 1: Left: Average success rates (in %) of agents trained on different numbers of axiom orders.
Table 2: The behavior cloning (BC) agents versus the MCTS-assisted (search) agents. Left: Theaverage success rates (in %) of agents with and without MCTS over 1000 test theorems. Right: Theaverage length of successful proofs by agents with and without MCTS over 1000 test theorems. Kdenotes the cardinality of the axiom combination of a proof, L denotes the length of the proof.
Table 7: Success rates of agents trained and tested on problems of different parameters (mean Â± std)in percentage.
Table 8: Top: Proof success rates (in %) of agents trained on different numbers of axiom orders.
