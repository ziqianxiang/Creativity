Table 1: Distribution of bitrate for different rate-distortion tradeoffs β , averaged over the videos inthe Xiph-5N 2fps dataset. The number of bits are distributed over the latent rate R and the modelrate M, which is computed using the quantized model prior p[δ].
Table 2: Characteristics of the five selected videos in Xiph-5N 2fps.
Table 3: Model architecture and parameter count for the adopted hyperprior model. As suggestedby Balle et al. (2018), a distinct architecture is used for the low and high bitrate regime. We reportthe number of output channels per layer, for the exact model architecture we refer to Bane et al.
