Table 1: Comparison of the performance of R-GAP, DLG and H-GAP. MSE has been used to mea-sure the quality of the reconstruction.
Table 2: Comparison of R-GAP and DLG on LeNet benchmarked in DLG(Zhu et al., 2019).
Table 3: Mean square error of the reconstruction over test set of CIFAR10. The correspondingnetwork architecture has been shown in Figure 2 in the same order. Rank analysis index (RA-i)clearly predicts the reconstruction error. We can also regard RA-i as the security level of a network.
Table 4: Training 200 epochs on CIFAR10 and saving the model with the best performance on thevalidation set, ResNet101 with base width 16 and its two variants achieve similar accuracy on theclassification task. The two modified variants which are designed to introduce rank deficiency per-form almost as well as the original, but better protect the training data. We conduct a gradient attackwith the state-of-the-art approach proposed by Geiping et al. (2020). MSE of the reconstructionsof the two rank-deficient variants is significantly higher, which indicates that for deep networks, wecan also improve the defendability by decreasing local redundancy or even making layers locallyrank-deficient.
