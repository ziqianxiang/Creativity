Table 1: Loss Ablation Study. Weturn off one loss at a time. Valuesindicating mask collapse are red.
Table 2: MNISTs Classification. In the test set, colors andtextures are randomized, only the digit’s shape corresponds tothe class label. Random performance is at 10%.
Table 3: Shape vs. Texture. We can controlthe classifier’s shape or texture preference.
Table 4: Accuracies on IN-9. The reported accu-racies are all obtained using a Resnet-50.
Table 5: Test Accuracy on double-colored MNIST. We report the mean and standard deviationover three random seeds.
