Table 1: Df s, optimal variational g (g*), conjugate functions (f *). A more complete table, includingJeffrey, Squared Hellinger, Neyman X2, Reverse KL, is provided in the Appendix.
Table 2: Experiment results comparison on clean datasets: We report the maximum accuracy of CEand each Df measures along with (mean ± standard deviation); Gap: mean performance comparisonw.r.t. CE. Numbers highlighted in blue indicate the gap is less than 1%.
Table 3: Experiment results comparison (w/o bias correction): The best performance in each settingis highlighted in blue. We report the maximum accuracy of each Df measures along with (mean± standard deviation). All f -divergences will be highlighted if their mean performances are better(or no worse) than all baselines we compare to. A supplementary table including Pearson X2 andJeffrey (JF) is attached in Table 7 (Appendix).
Table 4: Df measures with bias correction on CIFAR-10: Numbers highlighted in blue indicatebetter than all baseline methods; Gap: relative performance w.r.t. their version w/o bias correction(Table 3); those in red indicate better than w/o bias correction.
