Table 1: Equivariant linear maps for K(0, 0). Trainable weights arec ∈ R and κ : S1 → R, where S1 is the manifold underlying SO(2).
Table 2: Parameter efficiency and accuracy comparison. Number of parameters for each modeland their detailed forecasting accuracy at DE@ts. CtsConv(Aug.) is CtsConv trained with rotationaugmented data.
Table 3: Ablation study on encoders for Argoverse and TrajNet++. Markovian: Use the velocityfrom the most recent time step as input feature. LSTM: Used LSTM to encode velocities of 20timestamps. CtsConvLSTM: Instead of dense layer, the gate functions in LSTM are replaced byCtsConv. CtsConvDLSTM: Replaced gate functions by CtsConv + Dense. D-Concat (20t feats):Stacked velocities of 20 time steps as input.
Table 4: Ablative study on HD maps for Argoverse. Prediction accuracy comparison with andwithout HD Maps.
Table 5: Ablative study on features for Traj++. Acceleration means whether we used acceleration tomake numerically extrapolated position.
