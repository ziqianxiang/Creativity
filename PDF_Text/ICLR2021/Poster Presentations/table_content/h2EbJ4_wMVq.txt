Table 1: Wall-clock time (sec) of various encryption methods with a batch size of1. We vary themodulus range, P, which denotes the max value of a given plain text number. Note that the GPU isslower than the CPU because of the mini-batch with a single data item and data transfer overhead toand from the GPU. We use the CryptoNet-ReLU model provided by HE-transformer (Boemer, 2020).
