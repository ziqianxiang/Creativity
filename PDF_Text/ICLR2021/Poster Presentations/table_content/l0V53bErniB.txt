Table 1: Average flow estimation accuracy for the baselines (Div, MLP and GCN) and our methods(Bil-MLP, Bil-GCN and Bil-GCN-Prior) using the Traffic and Power datasets. RMSE, MAE andMAPE are errors (the lower the better) and CORR is a correlation (the higher the better). Values ofcorrelation for MLP and GCN using Traffic were undefined. Bil-GCN (ours) outperforms the bestbaseline for all the metrics, with up to 20% lower RMSE than Div using Power.
