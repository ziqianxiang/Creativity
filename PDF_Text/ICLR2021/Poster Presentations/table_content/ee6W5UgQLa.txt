Table 1: A comparison of MultiModalQA to Many-ModalQA and HybridQA. We compare dataset size,use of images, and whether the dataset supports multi-hop questions and an open-domain full-wiki setup.
Table 2: All 16 compositional templates in MMQA with an example and their relative frequency.
Table 3: Key statistics for MMQA.
Table 4: Test set resultssubstantially improves performance compared to AutoRouting (38.2 â†’ 51.7), emphasizing thesuperiority of our approach on multi-hop questions, while on single-hop questions this gap is smaller.
Table 5: Examples where ImplicitDecomp correctly answers both the intermediate and the entire question, and a					breakdown of the 1st-hop F1 and final F1 for the three logical operations: Compose, Compare, and Intersect.					answer, effectively performing multi-hop reasoning. Last, our question type classifier obtains a highaccuracy of 91.5% on the test set.
