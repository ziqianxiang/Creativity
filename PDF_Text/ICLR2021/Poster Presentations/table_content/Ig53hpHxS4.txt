Table 1: Mean Opinion Scores5Published as a conference paper at ICLR 20213.3	Sampling the priorThe simplest approach to generating sampleswith FloWtron is to sample from a prior distribution Z 〜N(0, σ2) and adjust σ2 to control theamount of variation. Whereas σ2 = 0 completely removes variation and produces outputs based onthe model bias, increasing σ2 will increase the amount of variation in speech.
Table 2: Values closer to the Reference are better. Comparison between pitch (MIDI number)summary statistics from Reference providing the style, Flowtron with standard Gaussian prior (FTABaseline) and samples after style transfer with Flowtron (FTA Posterior) and Tacotron 2 GST. Ourresults show that FTA Posterior is overall more effective than Tacotron 2 GST in emulating theReference by better matching its pitch summary statistics.
