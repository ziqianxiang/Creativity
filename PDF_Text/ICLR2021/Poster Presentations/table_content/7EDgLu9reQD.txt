Table 1: shapeNet quantitative results. We log the mean and median of the Chamfer distances (dC)between the reconstructed 3D surfaces and the ground truth meshes. Numbers are reported *103.
Table 2: D-Faust quantitative results. We log mean and median of the one-sided Chamfer and normaldistances between registration meshes (reg), reconstructions (recon) and raw input scans (scan). ThedC numbers are reported *102.
