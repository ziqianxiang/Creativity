Table 1: Averaged attention weight over the trajectory at time step k6	ConclusionIn this paper, we proposed the IS scheme, a new communication protocol, based on sharing intentionamong multiple agents for MARL. The message-generation network in the proposed IS schemeconsists of ITGM, which is used for producing predicted future trajectories, and AM, which learnsthe importance of imagined steps based on the received messages. The message in the proposedscheme is encoded imagined trajectory capturing the agent’s intention so that the communicationmessage includes the future information as well as the current information, and their weights areadaptively determined depending on the environment. We studied examples of imagined trajectoriesand attention weights. It is observed that the proposed IS scheme generates meaningful imaginedtrajectories and attention weights. Numerical results show that the proposed IS scheme outperformsother communication algorithms including state-of-the-art algorithms. Furthermore, we expect thatthe key idea of the proposed IS scheme combining with other communication algorithms such asATOC and TarMAC would yield even better performance.
