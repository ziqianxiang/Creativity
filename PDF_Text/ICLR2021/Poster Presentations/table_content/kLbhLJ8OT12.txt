Table 1: The table shows the main results on MultiWoz 2.0 and MultiWoz 2.1 evaluated with theautomatic evaluation metrics. The results of HDNO are from the models trained with the proposedreward shape in Section 5, where α = 0.0001 for MultiWoz 2.0 and α = 0.01 for MultiWoz 2.1.
Table 2: The table shows the results of different reward shapes for HDNO on MultiWoz 2.0.
Table 3: The table shows the results of HDNO (Async.) with beam search on MultiWoz 2.0 andMultiWoz 2.1.
Table 4: The table shows the pretraining results with beam search on MultiWoz 2.0 and MultiWoz2.1.
Table 5: The table shows the results of HDNO (Sync.) with beam search on MultiWoz 2.0 andMultiWoz 2.1. The reward shape is the one we proposed in Section 5, with α = 0.0001 for MultiWoz2.0 and α = 0.01 for MultiWoz 2.1 respectively.
Table 6: The table shows the full benchmark results on MultiWoz 2.0, compared with HDNO.
Table 7: The table shows some delexicalized system utterances generated by the baselines andHDNO on MultiWoz 2.0.
