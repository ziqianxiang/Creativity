Table 1: Quantitative results of conformation prediction on QM9.
Table 2: Quantitative results on various datasets of baselines, HamNet, and its variants. Baselinesusing 3D conformations of test molecules are marked italic. For different metrics, “↑" indicatesthat the higher is better, "]" Contrarily. We directly take reported performances from correspondingreferences, and leave unreported entries blank ("一").
