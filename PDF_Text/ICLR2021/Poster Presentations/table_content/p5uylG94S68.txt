Table 1: Summary of the different models satisfying (or not) the various requirements from Sec-tion 2.1. (R1): efficient simulation; (R2): explicit likelihood; (R3): y-interdependence (yellow means“partially”); (R4): heteroscedasticity (yellow means “at training”); (R5): multimodality (yellow means“in principle, yes, in practice, no”); (R6): ability to model different feature types; (R7): robustness anddebuggability. The last two columns indicate whether the model is among the optimal ones on theAcrobot sincos and raw angles systems (Section 2.3 and Table 2; yellow means significantly worsethan the best model but within 5% of the optimum).
