Table 1: Summary of datasets we used in our experiments.
Table 2: Summary of our results on MultiDomain dataset (Narayanan et al., 2018). We report WERon Voice Search test set. Compared with standalone ContextNet and Conformer models, Dual-modeASR models have slightly higher accuracy and much better streaming latency. ASR models thatcapture stronger contexts can emit the full hypothesis even slightly before they are spoken, leadingto a negative latency.
Table 3: Summary of our results on Librispeech dataset (Panayotov et al., 2015). We report WER onTestClean and TestOther (noisy) set. Compared with standalone ContextNet and Conformer models,Dual-mode ASR models have both higher accuracy in average and better streaming latency.
Table 4: Ablation studies of weight sharing, joint training and inplace distillation. We report WERon TestOther (noisy) set (Panayotov et al., 2015) using ConteXtNet with same training settings.
