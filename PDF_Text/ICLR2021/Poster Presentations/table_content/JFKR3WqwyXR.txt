Table 1: The minimal, last and average value of the evaluation metric throughout the 100 epochsof training are shown for GRU-ODE-Bayes and our method, together with the number of trainableparameters.
Table 2: Mean and standard deviation of MSE on the test sets of USHCN. Result of baselines werereported by Brouwer et al. (2019). Where known, the number of trainable parameters is reported.
Table 3: Mean and standard deviation of MSE on the test set of physionet. Result of baselines werereported by RUbanoVa et al. (2019). Where known, the number of trainable parameters is reported.
Table 4: The minimal, last and average value of the evaluation metric (smaller is better) on the Hestondataset throughout the 100 epochs of training, together with the number of trainable parameters.
