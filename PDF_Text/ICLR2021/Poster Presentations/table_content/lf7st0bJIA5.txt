Table 1: Average IoU of segmentations on the ADEPT dataset and the proportion of objects detected, where onesegmentation mask has greater than 0.5 IoU, as well as average 3D IoU and recall. Standard error in parentheses.
Table A1: Overall Model Architectures used in POD-NetWe detail the architecture of our Backprojection and Projection Models in Table A2.
Table A2: Overall Model Architectures used in POD-NetA.5 Comparison on Partially Occluded ObjectsWe further explicitly compare the performance of POD-Net on segmenting objects that occludeeach other. We evaluate on the ADEPT dataset, but only consider objects such that the boundingboxes intersect. We find that in this dataset of objects, POD-Net (multi-scale, physics) obtains has adetection rate of 0.734, with the an average IoU of 0.701 while POD-Net (multi-scale, no physics)obtains a detection rate of 0.601 (IoU threshold 0.5) with an average IoU of 0.576. This indicates ourapproach in incorporating physics is able to learn to effectively separate objects that partially occludeeach other.
