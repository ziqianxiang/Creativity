Table 1: The verified, standard (clean), and PGD attack errors for models trained on MNIST and CIFAR-10. IBP with detection is to be compared with IBP (without detection capability) to emphasize the suc-cessful utilization of the detection capability of the network in increasing its verifiable as well as empiricalperformance. For a more detailed decomposition of the standard and robust error terms see Fig. 1.
Table 2: Network architecture. Similar to the Large network used in (Gowal et al., 2018)Similarly, it can be shown that for Thus, for Z ∈ ZL-ι the loss term is now upperbounded byLaobuaitn(x,y; θ) ≤ 'xent∖y(-Je,θ(x,"),α)∙The equality of 'χen∖y(-Je,θ(x, y), a) = 'xent∖a(-J∈,θ(x, y), y) trivially follows from the fact that[J,θ (x, y)]i = 0 for i = a, y.
