The first two columns show theprediction of the models trained on the RBF kernel and the last two columns show the prediction ofthe model trained on the Matern-2 kernel. The target function and sampled data points are the samebetween the top row and bottom row except for the context. At the top row, the context is within thevertical dash line that is sampled from the same range during the training (black circle). In the bottomrow, the new context located out of the training range (white circle) is appended.
