Table 1: Statistics of the dataset.
Table 2: Automatic metrics of different methods. FID (lower is better) evaluates the quality andrealism of dances by measuring the distance between the distributions of the real dances and thegenerated dances. ACC evaluates the style consistency between generated dances and music. BeatCoverage measures the ratio of total kinematic beats to total musical beats. The higher the beatcoverage is, the stronger the rhythm of dance is. Beat Hit Rate measures the ratio of kinematic beatsaligned with musical beats to total kinematic beats. Diversity denotes the variations among a set ofgenerated dances while Multimodality refers to the variations of generated dances for the same music.
