Table 1: Computational Cost for Three Methods: Computation time is measured on a GTX1060 GPU. The iterative method has a variable runtime which depends on the number of eigenpairsrequired. In this table, we all use one half of the full dimension as the eigenpaired required, which isthe largest we can require using ARPACK implementation of Lanczos. Thus these numbers shouldbe seen as an upper limit of time for Backward and Forward Iteration method. A shallower ornarrower network will result in faster computation time. For StyleGAN2 which has configurabledepth and width, we use the config-f.

Table 3: Comparison of Hessian Computed with Different Sample Dissimilarity Metric d Weexperimented with BigGAN, PGGAN and StyleGAN2 (FFHQ 256 resolution), we compared theHessian computed by LPIPS and that by MSE or SSIM at 100 latent vectors. The statistics weshowed are: element-wise Hessian correlation (H corr), eigen spectra correlation (eigval corr), theHessian consistency measure CHlin and CHlog . The linear regression between the log spectra ofLPIPS the and that of the alternative (SSIM or MSE) yields the slope (slope) and intercept (inter-cept). The mean and standard deviation (in parenthesis) of the the 100 statistics are shown. In thelast row, WaveGANf is an audio generating GAN. We measured the similarity of the Hessian Us-ing MSE of wave forms (MSE) and MSE of spectrogram (STFT) as dissimilarity metric. Hessiancomputed using these two measures are less similar to each other.

Table 5: Hessian preconditioning improves GAN inversion The mean and standard error of fittingscore (minimum LPIPS distance to target using 4 random initial vectors) are presented in the table,which is the same data generating Fig. 5. For each GAN, target dataset pair, 200-300 different targetimages are used.
