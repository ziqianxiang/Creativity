Table 1: For MNIST and CIFAR-10, the first row gives the logistic classification error and thesecond row the Fisher ratio (1), for different signal representations Φ(x). Results are evaluated withan absolute value ρa, a soft-thresholding ρt, and a ReLU with threshold ρrt .
Table 2: Linear classification error and Fisher ratios (1) of several scattering representations,on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet. For SC, results are evaluated with a soft-thresholding ρt and athresholded rectifier ρrt. The last column gives the error of ResNet-20 for CIFAR-10 (He et al.,2016) and ResNet-18 for ImageNet, taken from https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/models.html.
