Table 1: We study these datasets from Liu et al. (2015); Borkan et al. (2019); Sagawa et al. (2020);Irvin et al. (2019); Williams et al. (2018) respectively. For each dataset, we form a group for eachcombination of label y ∈ Y and spuriously-correlated attribute a ∈ A, and evaluate the accuracy ofselective classifiers on average and on each group. Dataset details in Appendix C.1.
