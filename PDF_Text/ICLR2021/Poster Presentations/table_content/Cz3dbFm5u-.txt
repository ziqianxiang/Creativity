Table 2: The CNN-7 result on CIFAR-10. Delphi-Fast approximates more activation than Delphi,but losses more accuracy.
Table 3: The VGG-16 result on CIFAR-10. Delphi-Fast approximates more activation than Delphi,but losses more accuracy.
Table 4: CIFAR-100 results using ResNet-32. Delphi-Fast approximates more activation than Del-phi, but losses more accuracy.
