Table 1: Side channels derived from a memory access made by victim software using address addr.
Table 2: Discriminability evaluation. We present success rates of random guess (RG) for the comparison.
Table 3: Generalizability evaluation.

Table 5: The trace encoder Enctrace architecture.
Table 6: The generator G architecture.
Table 7: The discriminator D architecture.
Table 8: Discriminability evaluation results on outputs using VAE-LP (higher is better). We alsopresent the baseline, random guess (RG), for comparison.
Table 9: Discriminability evaluation results on the outputs using VAE-LP & GAN modules (higheris better). We have already reported these results in Table 2.
