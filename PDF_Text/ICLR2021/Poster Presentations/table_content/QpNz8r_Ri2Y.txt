Table 1: Normalized scores on D4RL MuJoCo benchmark datasets (Fu et al., 2020) where the scoreof 0 corresponds to a random policy and 100 corresponds to a converged SAC policy. All results(except MF, which is taken from Fu et al. (2020) and Kumar et al. (2020)) are averaged over 5 runs,where Â± denotes the standard error. The highest scores are highlighted with boldface.
