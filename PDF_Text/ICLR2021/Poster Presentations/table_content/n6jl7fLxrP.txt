Table 3: Efficiency on selected real world benchmark datasets: Average running time perepoch(ms)/average total running time(s). Note that Geom-GCN requires a preprocessing proce-dure so we do not include it in the table. Complete efficiency table for all benchmark datasets is inSupplementary due to space limit.

Table 8: Additional experiments illustrating that GPR-GNN escapes over-smoothing. We initializethe GPR weights γk = δkK as described in Section 5. We report the mean accuracy at Epoch 0 andafter training (Final epoch). The over-smoothing ratio indicates how many time out of the 100 runsthat GPR-GNN started with lead to the same label for all nodes. For an illustration of how GPRweights change over different epochs, please check Figure 9.
