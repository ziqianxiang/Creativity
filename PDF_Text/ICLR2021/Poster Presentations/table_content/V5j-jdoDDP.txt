Table 1: ImageNet. We report the median LSC score (J lower is better) along with the 75th (top) and25th percentile (bottom) values, and the mean Win% score in percentage (↑ higher is better) withbinomial proportion confidence interval (normal approximation) on 3304 images in the validationset. The Win% values don’t sum to 100 due to overlap when methods achieve identical scores.
Table 2: Solver Runtime and SAT instances. We report the average solver runtime and instancessolved per digit with a timeout set at 60 mins.
