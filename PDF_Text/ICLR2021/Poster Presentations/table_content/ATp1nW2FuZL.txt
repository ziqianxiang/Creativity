Table 1: Statistics of datasets. ‘Train’, ‘Test’ and task names are abbreviated. Devset similar to test.
Table 2: Mean (Max) test accuracy over three runs for multiplicity aware methods compared withbaselines. OS: test queries with only one solution, MS: queries with more than one solution.
Table 3: Mean test accuracy (±standard error) over three runs for multiplicity aware methodscompared with baselines. OS: test queries with only one solution, MS: queries with more than onesolution.
Table 4: Seed wise gains of SelectR over MinLoss across different random seeds and experimentsSeed	Sudoku	NQueens	Futoshiki42	3.12%	3.40%	0.69%1729	2.75%	2.53%	1.21%3120	1.98%	1.39%	1.77%Avg. Gain	2.61%	2.44%	1.22%Details of the Analysis Depicted in Figure 3The large variation in the size of solution set (|Yx |) in Sudoku allows us to assess its effect on theoverall performance. To do so, we divide the test data into different bins based on the number ofpossible solutions for each test input (xi) and compare the performance of the best model obtained inthe three settings: Unique, MINLOSS and SELECTR.
