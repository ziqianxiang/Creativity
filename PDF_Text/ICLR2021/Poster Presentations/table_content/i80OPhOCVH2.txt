Table 1: Average error rates (5 runs ± stdev for each property) on the QM9 dataset. The best resultfor every property in every GNN type is highlighted in bold. Results marked with f were previouslyreported by Brockschmidt (2020) and reproduced by us.
Table 2: Average accuracy (30 runs±stdev) onthe biological datasets. f - previously reportedby Errica et al. (2020).
