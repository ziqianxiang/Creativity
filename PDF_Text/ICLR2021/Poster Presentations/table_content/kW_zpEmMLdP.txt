Table 1: Continuous-time switch-ing linear dynamical system.
Table 2: Test results on the physics prediction task. @N notates evaluating on a sequence length ofN discretized steps. As a proxy for the complexity of ODE models, we also report the number offunction evaluations (NFE) for the ODE dynamics and the event function.
