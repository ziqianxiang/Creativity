Table 1: We compare average solving time, average number of solved sub-problems and the percentage oftimed out properties on data from Lu & Kumar (2020). The best dual iterative method is highlighted in bold.
Table 2: For each complete verification experiment, the network architecture used and the number of verifica-tion properties tested, a subset of the dataset by Lu & Kumar (2020). Each layer but the last is followed by aReLU activation function.
