Table 1: Performances for all environments for APEX and APEX policy. Enviroments are abbreviatedfor space reasons: HC-Run: Halfcheetah Running, Hum-Up: Humanoid Standup, and FPP:Fetch Pick&Place. We report the cumulative reward (marked with 1) and the success rate (markedwith 2). SAC and iCEM baseline performances are provided for reference. For an explanation aboutthe budget, see Pinneri et al. (2020).
