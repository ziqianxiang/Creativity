Table 1: Accuracy (%) of various models using auxiliary information as input, output, or both.
Table 2: Ablation study on the use of in-distribution vs. OOD unlabeled data inpre-training models on Landcover, where unla-beled sample size is standardized (much smallerthan Table 1). Using OOD unlabeled examples areimportant for gains in OOD accuracy (%). Resultsare shown with 90% error intervals over 5 trials.
