Table 1: Condensed evaluation of CVAE perturbation sets trained to produce rotation, translation,ans skew transformations on MNIST (MNIST-RTS), CIFAR10 common corruptions (CIFAR10-C)and multi-illumination perturbations (MI). The approximation error measures the necessary subsetproperty, and the expected approximation error measures the sufficient likelihood property.

We omit the three noise corruptions due to similarity to unstructured `p noise, leaving uswith the following 12 corruptions for each example:1.	Blurs: defocus blur, glass blur, motion blur, zoom blur2.	Weather: snow, frost, fog3.	Digital: brightness, contrast, elastic, pixelate, jpegThe dataset comes with different corruption levels, so we focus on the highest severity, corruptionlevel five, so the total training set has 600,000 perturbations (12 for each of 50,000 examples) and thetest set has 120,000 perturbations. The dataset also comes with several additional corruptions meantto be used as a validation set, however for our purposes will serve as a way to measure performanceon out-of-distribution corruptions. These are Gaussian blur, spatter, and saturate which correspond tothe blur, weather, and digital categories respectively. We generate a validation set from the training setby randomly setting aside 1/50 of the CIFAR10 training set and all of their corresponding corruptedvariants. These experiments were run on a single GeForce RTX 2080 Ti graphics card, taking 22
