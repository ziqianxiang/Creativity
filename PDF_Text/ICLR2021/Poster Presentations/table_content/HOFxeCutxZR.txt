Table 1: Quantitative evaluation of numerical changes on the other semantically independentattributes (lower is better). (first row) edited attributes; (second row) the absolute changing rangeof the edited attributes; (bottom three rows) averages (up) and standard deviations (down) in eachrow.
Table 2: Quantitative evaluation on image identity preservation (higher is better). Notation isidentical to Tab. 1.
Table 3: Averaged MSE loss of reconstructing 20 real face images. The GAN inversionmethod (Abdal et al., 2019) was trained and terminated at 4k and 500 iterations with averagedMSE loss in the right column.
Table 4: Quantitative evaluation of identity preservation (ID) and attribute changes (Attr). Weedited two attributes for the real face images, i.e., “Smile” (col.2-7) and “Blond hair” (col.8-13).
