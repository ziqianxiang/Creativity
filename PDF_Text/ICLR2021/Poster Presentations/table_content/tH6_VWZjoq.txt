Table 1: Lowest test error for any rank in the matrix completion problem of Section 4.2, and associ-ated rank returned by each algorithm. In the form error/rank.
Table 2: Mean RMSE and standard error among 5 random splits for 100K and 1M with standarderrors < 0.01, and 3 random splits for 10M with standard errors < 0.001. The rank of the predictionis set to 100 except for NMF where it is 15 and Fast Greedy in the 10M dataset where it is chosento be 35 by cross-validation. Alternating Minimization is a well known algorithm (e.g. Srebroet al. (2004)) that alternatively minimizes the left and right subspace, and also uses Frobenius normregularization. For SoftImpute and Alternating Minimization we have found the best choice ofparameters by performing a grid search over the rank and the multiplier of the regularization term.
