Sharing early-features is one solu-tion. We experiment another one by using only the M-th branch at test time. We combine DICE withOKDDip (Chen et al., 2020b): the M-th branch (= the student) learns to mimic the soft predictionsfrom the M-1 first branches (= the teacher), among which we enforce diversity. Our teacher haslower internal temperature (as shown in Experiment 4.c): DICE performs best when soft predictionsare generated with lower T. We improve state-of-the-art by {+0.42, +0.53} for {3,4}-branches.
Table 5: Ensemble Accuracy on different setups. Concurrent approaches’ accuracies are thosereported in recent papers. DICE outperforms co-distillation and snapshot-based ensembles collectedon the training trajectory, which fail to capture the different modes of the data (Ashukha et al., 2019).
