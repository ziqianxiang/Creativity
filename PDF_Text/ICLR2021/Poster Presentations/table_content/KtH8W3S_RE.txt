Table 1: Run times for SPG, NBR, BR, and RF for five region sizes and multi-scale search. Reported times arefor a single train-validation-test split per model over 8 CPUs and 1 GPU machine. For SPG, parameters wereinferred using the CNN+GP estimation method at 10kb, running the CNN and GP one time each; hence SPGâ€™sincreased run time at 10kb relative to other region sizes. Bolded is the best multi-scale search time. PresentedRF times are high due to the need for O(n) trees to estimate variance using the Jackknife method.
