Table A.1: Mean absolute error for time series prediction of the regular scenario of Case 1. Weunderline the best results for each neural architecture, and the overall best results are highlighted inbold-font. The reported results are averaged over five repetitions, with the standard errors provided.
Table A.2: Accuracy and discounted cumulative gain (DCG) for the domain-specific models on thetemporal recommendation tasks. See Appendix B for detail. We underline the best results for eachneural architecture, and the overall best results are highlighted in bold-font.
Table A.3: The ablation study on parameterizing the spectral density with Gaussian distribution, orwith INN, when composing the recommendation models with temporal kernel. The reported arethe accuracy and discounted cumulative gain (DCG) for the domain-specific models on temporalrecommendation tasks.
