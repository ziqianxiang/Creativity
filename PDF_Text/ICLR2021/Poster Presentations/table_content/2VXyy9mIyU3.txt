Table 1: Comparison of test accuracies on clean datasets under instance-based label noise.
Table 2: Comparison of test accuracies on clean datasets under symmetric/asymmetric label noise.
Table 3: The best epoch (clean) test accuracy for each method on Clothing1M.
Table 4: Comparing 'cr With ER on CIFAR-10.
Table 5: Comparison with the results reported by DivideMix (Li et al., 2020) on CIFAR-10. Allmethods use Pre-ResNet18 as the backbone. The last epoch test accuracy for each method is re-ported. The noise rate is defined as the probability of replacing the label with other labels includingthe true label.
