Table 1: Accuracy (in %) under linear evaluation on Ima-geNet for different self-supervised representation learningmethods. Methods with * use SimCLR augmentations.
Table 2: Top-1 error rates for different self-supervised representation learning methods on ImageNet-R. All models are trained only on clean ImageNet images and ReLICT refers to ReLIC using aResNet-50 with target network as in BYOL (Grill et al., 2020).
Table 3: Mean Corruption Error (mCE), mean relative Corruption Error (mrCE) and CorruptionErrors for the “Noise” class of corruptions (Gaussian, Shot, Impulse) on ImageNet-C. The mCE valueis the average across 75 different corruptions. Methods are trained only on clean ImageNet images.
