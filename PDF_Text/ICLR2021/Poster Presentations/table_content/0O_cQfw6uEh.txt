Table 1: Validation reconstruction loss (summed squared error) over 500 epochs. For GLO, latentsare assigned to data points and jointly optimised with the network. GONs significantly outperformother single step methods and achieve the lowest reconstruction error on four of the five datasets.
Table 2: Validation ELBO in bits/dim over 1000 epochs (CelebA is trained over 150 epochs).
