Table 1: Ï‡2-distance between color/texture histograms of source and target images (lower is better).
Table 2: (Left) Shape disentanglement results: higher IoU means better shape disentanglement fromappearance. (Right) AMT experiment results: how often our method is preferred over the baseline.
Table 3: Assessing hybrid image properties through image classification. A high dist(I, Ia) scoreimplies better transfer of semantic properties through appearance transfer. A low dist(I, Is) scoreimplies that appearance transfer on the same shape resulted in a shift away from the original distri-bution.
