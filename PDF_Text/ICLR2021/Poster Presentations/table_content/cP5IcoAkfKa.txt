Table 1: System performance. Average frames per second (FPS, measured as samples of expe-rience processed per second) achieved by each system. BPS achieves a speedup of 110× overWIJMANS 20 on Depth experiments (19,900 vs. 180 FPS) and 95× on RGB experiments (13,300 vs.
Table 2: Policy performance. SPL and Success of agents produced by BPS and WIJMANS20. Theperformance of the bps agent is within the margin of error of the wijmans20 agent for Depth exper-iments on the validation set, and within five percent on RGB. bps agents are trained on eight GPUswith aggregate batch size N =1024.
Table A1: Impact of Visual Encoder Input Resolution on Performance. Resolution has thelargest impact on performance when increased memory usage forces bps’ batch size to be de-creased. For example, on a single Tesla V100, BPS’ Depth performance drops by 2.2× after in-creasing the resolution, because batch size decreases from N =1024 to N =512. Conversely, theeight-GPU Tesla V100 results only show a 12% decrease in performance, since batch size is fixed atN =128. Experiments with 128×128 pixel resolution are rendered at 256×256 and downsampled.
Table A2: Runtime breakdown across systems. Microseconds per frame for each RL componenton a RTX 3090. SE-ResNet9 uses an input resolution of 64x64, while ResNet50 uses an inputresolution of 128x128. Note the large amount of time spent by wijmans20 on policy inference,caused by GPU memory constraints that force a small number of rollouts per iteration. bps-r50’sperformance is dominated by the DNN workload due to the large ResNet50 visual encoder.
Table A3: Task and FPS results for Flee and Explore tasks with Depth agents (on a RTX 3090),where the Training / Validation Score is measured in meters for the Flee task and number of cellsvisited on the navigation mesh for the Explore task. These tasks achieve higher throughput thanPointGoal navigation due to the lower complexity AI2-THOR meshes used. The relatively lowscores are a result of the small spatial size of the AI2-THOR assets.
