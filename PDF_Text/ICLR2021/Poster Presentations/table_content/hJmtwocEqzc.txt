Table 1: An evaluation of Amazon Rekognition and Microsoft Azure Face on FaceScrub data withLowKey and Fawkes protection (a small number, and lighter color, indicates a successful attack).
Table 2: Rank-50 accuracy of the LowKey and Fawkes attacks. After the first two rows, each rowrepresents LowKey attacks generated from the same model. Each column represents inference on asingle model. The first two letters in the model’s name denote the type of backbone: IR or ResNet(RN). The last letter in the model’s name indicates the type of head; “A” denotes ArcFace, and “C”denotes CosFace. Smaller numbers, and lighter colors, indicate more successful attacks.

Table 4: Evaluation of LowKey on full-size images. Rows indicate levels of magnitude of LowKey(denoted by the number of attack steps).
Table 5: Rank-1 accuracy of the LowKey and Fawkes attacks on the FaceScrub dataset. After thefirst two rows, each row represents LowKey attacks generated from the same model. Each columnrepresents inference on a single model. The first two letters in the model’s name denote the type ofbackbone: IR or ResNet (RN). The last letter in the model’s name indicates the type of head; “A”denotes ArcFace, and “C” denotes CosFace. Smaller numbers, and lighter colors, indicate moresuccessful attacks.
Table 6: Rank-50 accuracy of LowKey attacks on the UMDFaces dataset. After the first row, eachrow represents LowKey attacks generated from the same model. Each column represents inference ona single model. The first two letters in the model’s name denote the type of backbone: IR or ResNet(RN). The last letter in the model’s name indicates the type of head; “A” denotes ArcFace, and “C”denotes CosFace. Smaller numbers, and lighter colors, indicate more successful attacks.
Table 7: Rank-1 accuracy of LowKey attack attacks on the UMDFaces dataset. After the first row,each row represents LowKey attacks generated from the same model. Each column representsinference on a single model. The first two letters in the model’s name denote the type of backbone: IRor ResNet (RN). The last letter in the model’s name indicates the type of head; “A” denotes ArcFace,and “C” denotes CosFace. Smaller numbers, and lighter colors, indicate more successful attacks.
Table 8: Rank-50 accuracy of LowKey small attacks on the UMDFaces dataset. After the first row,each row represents LowKey small attacks generated from the same model. Each column representsinference on a single model. The first two letters in the model’s name denote the type of backbone: IRor ResNet (RN). The last letter in the model’s name indicates the type of head; “A” denotes ArcFace,and “C” denotes CosFace. Smaller numbers, and lighter colors, indicate more successful attacks.

Table 10: Rank-1 accuracy of FR models tested on blurred images attacked without and with theGaussian smoothing term. The first two letters in the model’s name denote the type of backbone: IRor ResNet (RN). The last letter in the model’s name indicates the type of head; “A” denotes ArcFace,and “C” denotes CosFace. Smaller numbers, and lighter colors, indicate more successful attacks.
