Table 1: Classification performance (average of five runs) of SOTA data augmentation methods onCIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets using popular standard architectures. An additional ”+” signafter the dataset name indicates that the traditional data augmentation techniques have also beenused during training.
