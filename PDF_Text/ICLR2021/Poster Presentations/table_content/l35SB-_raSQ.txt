Table 1: Experiment results on MOT.
Table 2: Pairwise comparisons between RS alone and the com-bination of RS and ROBOT. The relative error ratio is the ra-tio of the relative errors of RS alone and RS+ROBOT combina-tion. Ratios larger than 1 suggest that RS performs worse thanRS+ROBOT combination.
