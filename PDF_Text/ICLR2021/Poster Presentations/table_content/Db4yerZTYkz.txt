Table 1: The performance of the vanilla training, the shape-biased (S-biased) training, the texture-biased (T-biased) training, and our shape-texture debiased training on ImageNet. For all ResNetmodels, our debiased training shows the best performance among others.
Table 2: The model robustness on ImageNet-A (IN-A), ImageNet-C (IN-C), Stylized-ImageNet (S-IN), and on defending against FGSM adversarial attacker on ImageNet. Our shape-texture debiasedneural network training significantly boosts the model robustness over the vanilla training baseline.
Table 3: Compare with state-of-the-art methods using ResNet-50 on ImageNet (IN), ImageNet-A(IN-A), ImageNet-C (IN-C), Stylized-ImageNet (S-IN), and on defending against FGSM on Ima-geNet. We use green to denote significant improvement, red to denote performance drop, and grayto denote similar performance. We observe our shape-texture debiased training is the only methodthat successfully leads to improvements over the vanilla baseline on all benchmarks.
Table 4: The performance comparison between Vanilla, Shape-biased, Texture-biased, and Shape-Texture Debiased models on ImageNet-Sketch, ImageNet-R, Kylberg Texture, and Flicker Mate-rial datasets. We note the shape-biased and the shape-texture debiased models perform better onshape datasets (ImageNet-Sketch and ImageNet-R); the texture-biased and the shape-texture debi-ased models perform better on texture datasets (Kylberg Texture and Flicker Material).
