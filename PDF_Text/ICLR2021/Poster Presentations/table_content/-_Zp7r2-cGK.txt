RiPley is a synthetic dataset that is generated from a two-dimensional(D = 2) Gaussian mixture model, and 250 and 1,000 samples are provided for training and test,respectively. The number of classes is two (C = 2), and each class comprises two components. Theremaining four datasets are all two-class (C = 2) datasets, which comprise different data sizes anddimensionality. Since they contain 100 training/test splits, we repeated experiments 100 times andthen calculated average statistics.
