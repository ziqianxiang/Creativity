Table 1: Comparison of Causal World with RLBench (James et al., 2020), MetaWorld (Yu et al.,2019), IKEA (Lee et al., 2019), BabyAI (Chevalier-Boisvert et al., 2018), CoinRun (Cobbe et al.,2018), AtariArcade (Bellemare et al., 2013), MuJoBan etc. (Mirza et al., 2020),Finally, by releasing this benchmark we hope to facilitate research in causal structure learning, i.e.
Table 2: Description of a subset of the high level variables, exposed in CausalWorld, and theircorresponding spaces, h refers to the height of the block.
Table 3: Example of task generators’ specific high level variables, exposed in CausalWorld, andtheir corresponding spaces. For a full list of each task generators’ variables and their correspondingspaces, please refer to the documentation at (https://sites.google.com/view/causal-world/home).
Table 4: Description of the dense rewards applied in our experiments. The following notation wasapplied: vt ∈ R3 joint velocities, eit ∈ R3 i-th end-effector positions, oit ∈ R3 i-th block position,git ∈ R3 i-th goal block position, dt(o, e) = Pi ||eit-ot|| the distance between end-effectors and theblock, ∆to,e = dt(o, e) - dt-1 (o, e) the distance difference w.r.t. the previous timestep. The targetheight parameter t for pick and place is 0.15 if block and goal are of different height. Otherwise, tis half the goal height.
