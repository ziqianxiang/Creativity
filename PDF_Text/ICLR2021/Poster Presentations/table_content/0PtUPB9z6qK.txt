Table 1: FID scores for two versions of SNGAN from (Miyato et al., 2018) on Cifar10 and ImageNet. GEBM:training using Algorithm 1 and sampling using Algorithm 3. KALE-GAN: Only the base ofa GEBM is retainedfor sampling. GAN: training as in (Miyato et al., 2018) with q= 128 for the latent dimension as it worked best.
Table 2: FID scores for different sampling methods using the sametrained SNGAN (ConvNet): KALE-GAN as a baseline w/o criticinformation.
Table 3: UCI datasets: Negative log-likelihood computed on the test set and corresponding to the bestperformance on the validation set. Best method in boldface.
