Table 1: PSNR of each model’s recon-struction in image and video representa-tion tasks after 10,000 training iterations.
Table 2: Image generalization results (mean ±standard deviation of PSNR).
Table 3: Total training loss after training for differential equations, where the iterations columnrefers to the number of iterations for which the networks were trained. PLI and PGI refer to Poissonequation based image reconstruction using Laplacians and gradients respectively. Helmholtz andwave refer to the single source inversion task.
