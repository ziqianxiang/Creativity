Table 1: Density estimation results. Negative test log-likelihood is measured in bits per dimension(BPD) - lower is better. As in previous works, only the most successful runs are reported. Circledare the best runs among non-autoregressive models and bolded are the best runs overall.
Table 3: Experimental configurations for the density estimation tests. DML is the discretizedmixture of logistics (Salimans et al., 2017). Weight normalization, mixed-precision, free bits andAdamax are documented by Salimans & Kingma (2016); Micikevicius et al. (2018); Kingma et al.
Table 4: The comparison of ResSDN layer to the baselines from Figure 8. We replaced CNNlayers in the IAF-VAE+ architecture (from Section 4) with baseline blocks and compared the densityestimation performance in terms of ELBO. The experiments were conducted on CIFAR-10 dataset.
