Table 1: Mirostat generated text data for human evaluationsthe generation process whereas the average value is rather smooth and does not give a good feedbackof the current state of the generation process, hence, making it difficult to control the cross-entropyrate. However, we leave any theoretical result on the performance this algorithm to future work.
