We provide an intuitive explanation onthe potential robustness of Meta-RKHS-II, as we find current theories of both robustness machinelearning and NTK are insufficient for a formal explanation. Our explanation is based on someproperties of both the meta-learning framework and NTK: 1) Strong initialization (meta model): ForNTK to generalize well, we argue that it is necessary to start the model with a good initialization.
