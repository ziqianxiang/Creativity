Table 1: Examples of non-terminals and production rules in our SCFG. Each production rule root→ hα, βi is built from some (x, y) ∈ D by replacing all terminal phrases with non-terminals. ti, ci,and vi stand for any table name, column name, entry value respectively.
Table 2: Overview of four table-based semantic parsing and question answering datasets in fully-supervised (top) and weakly-supervised (bottom) setting used in this paper. More details in Section33.1	Supervised Semantic ParsingWe first evaluate Grappa on two supervised semantic parsing tasks. In a supervised semantic parsingscenario, given a question and a table or database schema, a model is expected to generate thecorresponding program.
Table 3: Performance on Spider. We run each Table 4: Performance on fully-sup. WIKISQL.
Table 5: Performance on WikiTableQuestions.
Table 6: Performance on weakly-sup. Wik-iSQL. We use (Wang et al., 2019) as our basemodel.
Table 7: Examples of the inputs and annotations for four semantic parsing tasks. Spider andFully-sup. WikiSQL require full annotation of SQL programs, whereas WikiTableQuestionsand Weakly-sup. WikiSQL only requires annotation of answers (or denotations) of questions.
Table 8: Aggregated datasets for table-and-language tasks.
