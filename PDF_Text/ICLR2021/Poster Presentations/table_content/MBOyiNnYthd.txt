Table 1: Compression results in bits per dimension (bpd) for IDF++, hand-designed codecs and otherdeep density estimators based on normalizing flows, super resolution and variational auto-encoders.
Table 2: Architecture and training settings for IDF. Table adapted from Hoogeboom et al. (2019a).
Table 3: Ablation study of the modifications of IDF for the CIFAR-10 dataset. The second columnindicates the percentage of the datasetâ€™s original train set that was used to train the model. EMA =exponential moving average. The reported numbers are theoretically achievable bits per dimension.
