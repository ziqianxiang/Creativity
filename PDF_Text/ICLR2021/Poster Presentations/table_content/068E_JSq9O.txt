Table 1: Different contrastive learning objectives, grouped by measurements of distribution divergence. PXYrepresents the distribution of related samples (positively-paired), and PXPY represents the distribution of un-related samples (negatively-paired). f (x, y) ∈ F for F being any class of functions f : X × Y → R.
Table 2: Top-1 accuracy (%) for visual object recognition results. JDV and JNWJ are not reported on ImageNetdue to numerical instability. ResNet depth, width and Selective Kernel (SK) configuration for each setting areprovided in ResNet depth+width+SK column. A slight drop of JCPC performance compared to Chen et al.
Table 3: Accuracy (%) for LibriSpeech-100h phoneme and speaker classification results. We also provide theresults from fully supervised model as a comparison (Oord et al., 2018).
Table 4: Confidence Intervals of performances of JRPC and JCPC on CIFAR-10/-100 and ImageNet.
