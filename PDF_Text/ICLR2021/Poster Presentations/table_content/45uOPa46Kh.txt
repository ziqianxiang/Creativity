Table 1: Performance of generative policies (Gen.) and discriminative policies (Disc.) on the R2Rdataset. +Aug. represents policies trained with the augmented dataset by Fried et al. (2018). Weuse (A) Disc.+Aug. and (B) Gen.+Aug. for the combination of the generative and discriminativepolicies as of (A+B). * represents the use of backtracking ofFAST. Bold fonts are used for the bestresult as a single model in major metrics.
Table 2: Comparison of baselines and the proposed policy under single run experimental setting onthe R2R dataset. Bold fonts for the first and second best values in SR and SPL. * represents the useof backtracking of FAST.
Table 3: Performance of generative and discriminative policies on the R4R validation-seen and-unseen splits. We use bold-face to indicate the best models according to CLS and SDTW in thevalidation-unseen split.
