Table B.1: Accuracy of examined neural networks on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.
Table F.1: AIC for models A, B, and C, described aboveModel	AICA:	Example + Model	3011367B:	Example + Class * Model 3006889C:	Example * Model	2969410F.4 Performance Differences Among ImageNet SynsetsTable F.2: Differeces between wide and deep architectures on ImageNet synsets with many classes. Com-parison of accuracy of wide (ResNet-50 with 2.8× width in 3rd stage) and deep (ResNet-83) ImageNet modelson synsets with >50 classes. Note that some synsets are descendants (hyponyms) of others. p-values are com-puted using a t-test with multiple testing (Holm-Sidak) correction. Results are for the sets of models used togenerate blue dots in Figures F.4 and 7. Post-selection effect sizes and testing in the main text use a disjoint setof models.
