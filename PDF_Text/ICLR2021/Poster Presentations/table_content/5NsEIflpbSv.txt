Table 1: Test set frame accuracy (FA) and semantic accuracy (SA) on ATIS and SNIPS data set of ourseq2seq models with copying mechanism. Numbers in bold represent the best performing methodfor a given metric and pre-trained model. *Refers to the BERT based joint intent classification andslot tagging model of Chen et al. (2019) where frame accuracy is the sentence level exact matchaccuracy.
Table 3: Logical form exact match accuracy on target domains in the Overnight data set (Wang et al.,2015). The numbers for the neural transition-based parser of Damonte et al. (2019) are obtained fromtheir paper (Table 3).
Table 4: Statistics of the Overnight data set (Wang et al., 2015). The top four domains are chosen assource domains while the bottom four are chosen as target domains. Average depth is the average ofthe maximum depth of logical forms (trees) in the test set.
