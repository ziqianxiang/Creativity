Table 1: The average precision and recall values (± std.) across five repeats for all edit types on thegraph dynamical systems.
Table 2: Summary statistics for all synthetic datasets, in particular the number of unique graphs,the average time series length T (± standard deviation) and the average graph size N (± standarddeviation). The number of unique undirected graphs with 8 nodes for degree rules was computedusing the nauty-geng function, all averages were obtained via 1000 samples from the dataset.
Table 3: The average precision and recall values (± std.) across five repeats fro all edit types on themax degree dataset.
Table 4: The mean RMSEs (± std.) for the constant baseline, Gaussian process regression (GP) ofPaaβen et al. (2018), and graph edit networks on all syntax tree datasets.
