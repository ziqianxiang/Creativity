Table 1: Mean opinion scores (MOS) of various models and their confidence intervals. All modelsexcept WaveRNN are non-autoregressive. WaveGrad, Parallel WaveGAN, MelGAN, and Multi-band MelGAN were conditioned on the mel-spectrograms computed from ground truth audio duringtraining. WaveRNN and GAN-TTS used predicted features for training.
Table 2: Objective and subjective metrics of the WaveGrad Base models. When conditioning on thediscrete index, a separate model needs to be trained for each noise schedule. In contrast, a singlemodel can be used with different noise schedules when conditioning on the noise level directly. Thisvariant yields high fidelity samples using as few as six iterations.
