Table 1: Different formulations of dynamic convolution decomposition on ImageNet classification.
Table 2: Dimension of the latent space L eval-uated on ImageNet classification (MobileNetV2×0.5 is used).
Table 3: Extensions of dynamic convolution decompostion (DCD) evaluated on ImageNet classification (MobileNetV2 ×0.5 is used).
Table 4: Comparing DCD with the vanilla dynamic convolution CondConv (Yang et al., 2019) andDY-Conv (Chen et al., 2020c). Vindicates the dynamic model with the fewest parameters (staticmodel is not included). CondConv contains K = 8 kernels and DY-Conv contains K = 4 kernels.
