Table 1: Dimensionality estimation of semantic factors |zk | for the stage-5 latent representation.
Table 2: Comparing dimensionality estimations forthe texture factor between two methods. Both meth-ods show that more texture neurons are found in rep-resentations with smaller receptive fields.
Table 3: Percentage of neurons (|zk|/|z|) encoding differentsemantic concepts, k, for different stages of ResNet50 trainedfor various levels of shape bias. While a moderate percentage ofneurons encode shape in stages f1, f2, and f3, the majority ofshape neurons are found in stage f5 . Networks with shape biaslearn additional shape information in stage f5 .
Table 4: Left: We measure the amount of shape encoded in frozen CNN by training a read-out moduleon either binary (Bin) or semantic segmentation (Sem) under different training settings. ‘None’:random initialization, ‘End-to-End’: network is not frozen and trained with the read-out module, ‘IN’:pre-trained on ImageNet. Right: Shape information contained in various shape biased models.
Table 5: Shape encoding results for dif-ferent stages of ResNet networks trainedon ImageNet. Combining features fromearly stages increases shape encoding.

Table 7: Shape encoding results for ResNet50’s trained on ImageNet (IN) and stylized ImageNet(SIN) based read-out modules when the top N shape or texture-specific neurons are removed fromthe latent representation during inference. Removing the top N shape specific neurons from theSIN-read-out hurts the network’s shape-recognition abilities more compared to the IN-read-out model.
