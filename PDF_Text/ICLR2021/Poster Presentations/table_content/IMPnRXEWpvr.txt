Table 1: Comparison between IMTL and previous methods on Cityscapes, semantic segmentation,instance segmentation and disparity/depth estimation are considered. The first group of columnsshows the regular results of different methods. The second group shows the results by manuallymultiply the semantic segmentation loss with 10 before applying these methods. The subscriptnumbers show the absolute change after scaling the loss to demonstrate the robustness of variousmethods. The arrows indicate the values are the higher the better (↑) or the lower the better ⑷.Thebest and runner up results for each task are bold and underlined, respectively.
Table 2: Experimental results on the NYUv2 and CelebA datasets, semantic segmentation, surfacenormal estimation, depth estimation and multi-class classification are considered. Arrows indicatethe values are the higher the better (↑) or the lower the better (J). The best and runner UP results ineach column are bold and underlined, respectively.
