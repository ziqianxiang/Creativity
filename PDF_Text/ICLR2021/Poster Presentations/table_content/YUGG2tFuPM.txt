Table 1: Summary statistics for DPA and SS-DPA algorithms on MNIST, CIFAR, and GTSRB.
Table 2: Comparison of SS-DPA with hashing (‘Hash’ columns, described in Appendix E) to theSS-DPA algorithm with partitions determined by sorting (‘Sort’ columns, described in the maintext). Note that partitioning via sorting consistently results in higher base classifier accuracies, andcan increase (and never decreases) median certified robustness. These effects seem to be larger onMNIST than on CIFAR-10.
Table 3: Comparison of DPA and SS-DPA algorithms using the same random seed for each partition(‘Same’ columns, described in Appendix F) to the DPA and SS-DPA algorithms using the distinctrandom seeds for each partition (‘Distinct’ columns, described in the main text). Note that usingdistinct random seeds usually results in higher smoothed classifier clean accuracies, and always doesso when using DPA.
Table 4: Comparison of DPA algorithm with and without using histogram equalization as prepro-cessing on the GTSRB dataset. We find that histogram equalization substantially improves perfor-mance when k = 100, although the effect is more modest at k = 50.
