Table 1: Atari-57 final performance. H-Gap denotes the human-gap, defined fully in the Appendix.
Table 2: Hyper-parameters values used in Rainbow-based agents (deviations from Hessel et al. (2018)highlighted in boldface).
Table 3: Hyper-parameters values used in R2D2-based agents (deviations from Kapturowski et al.
Table 4: Settings for experiments used to generate average first-visit visualizations found in maintext.
Table 5: Sticky-action Atari-57 final performance summaries for Rainbow-based agents after 200Menvironment frames.
Table 6: Atari-57 final performance summaries. R2D2 results are after 30B environment frames,and Rainbow results are after 200M environment frames. We also include median and mean human-normalized scores obtained by using best (instead of final) evaluation scores for each training run, toallow comparison with past publications which often used this metric (e.g. Hessel et al. (2018)).
