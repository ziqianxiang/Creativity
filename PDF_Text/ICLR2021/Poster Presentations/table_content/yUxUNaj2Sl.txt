Table 1: Comparison of different feature space style augmentation methods on 4 Ã— 4 shuffled imagepatches and number of shape based predictions in texture-shape cue conflict images. Evaluation ofshuffled patches is conducted on 598 correctly classified validation images by all the networks.
Table 2: Comparison of models trained on different datasets on shuffled image patches and numberof texture-shape cue conflict predictions based on shape and texture labels. Evaluation of shuffledimage patches is conducted on 644 validation images that are correctly classified by all the networks.
Table 3: Mean corruption accuracy (mCA) and texture/shape results on texture-shape cue conflictdataset of different networks. mCA is the mean accuracy over 15 ImageNet-C corruption and sever-ities ranging from 1 to 5. Networks trained with style transfer augmentation perform better thanthose without and network trained on superpositioned images (SE+IN) yield best mCA.
Table 4: Mean corruption accuracy, SIN and cue conflict results of networks with & without ad-ditional fine-tuning of the affine parameters of normalization layers on the respective corruptions.
