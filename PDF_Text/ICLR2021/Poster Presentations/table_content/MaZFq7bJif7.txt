Table 1: CATER Snitch Localization results (on the test set). The top 3 performance scores are highlighted as:First?, Second, Third*. Hopper outperforms existing methods under only 1 FPS.
Table 2: CATER-h Snitch Localization results (on the test set). The top 3 performance scores are highlightedas: First ?, Second, Third *. Hopper outperforms existing methods under only 1 FPS.
Table 3: Ablation Study of Hopper training methods. We gradually add training methods described inSection 4, i.e., dynamic hop stride, minimal 5 hops of reasoning, auxiliary hop 1 object loss, auxiliary hop2 object loss, auxiliary frame loss, teacher forcing, and contrastive debias loss via masking out, onto the baseHopper-multihop model. The results are obtained from the CATER-h test set.
