Table 1: Results on Places365, VOC and COCO. AP50 is the default metric for VOC, while APbb and APmkdenote the bounding-box and mask AP for COCO respectively. Black / gray numbers correspond to results ofthe representation models trained on ImageNet-LT / ImageNet respectively. See appendix for complete results.
