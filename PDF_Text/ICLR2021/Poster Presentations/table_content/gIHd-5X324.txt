Table 1: We count the number of regularization samples with different distillation settings onCIFAR-100. The teacher-student network pair is WRN-40-2 (Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2017) andWRN-16-2. Results are averaged over 5 repeated runs. The temperature column means the temper-ature for distillation and the label smoothing column means whether the teacher network is trainedwith label smoothing trick.
Table 2: Study of the impact on distillation for regularization samples. Loss function presented hereis for the loss on a specific sample. Results are classification Top-1 accuracy. We follow the settingsused in Tab. 1 and set τ = 4. Results are averaged over 5 runs.
Table 3: Top-1 classification accuracy results on CIFAR-100. Comparison results are quoted fromTian et al. (2020). We report our results over 5 repeated runs.
Table 4: Top-1 and Top-5 classification accuracy results on ImageNet validation set. All traininghyperparameter like learning rate and training epochs are in accordance with (Heo et al., 2019).

It is no longer sample-independent, which is different from theweighted soft labels applied to KD which can assign the weights sample-wisely. We currently takethe averaged weighting factors of the involved sample pairs when calculating the distance/angle ma-trix. The results on CIFAR-100 are presented in Tab. 8 (averaged over 5 runs). As can be observedfrom the table, the weighted soft label applied to RKD still brings improvements, though not thatbig compared with WSL applied to KD. Also, we believe that it is an important future direction toexplore the applications to more variants of KD.
