Table 1: Results for binarized ResNet VAE and Flow++ model on CIFAR and ImageNet(32 Ã— 32) test sets. Loss values are reported in bits per dimension. We give the percentageof the model parameters that are binary and the overall size of the model parameters. Theweights and activations refer to those within the residual layers of the model, which are thetargets for binarization.
