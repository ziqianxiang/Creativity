Table 1: Performance of various methods on different models. We compare each methodâ€™s avg. solving time,the avg. number of branches required, and the percentage of timed out (TO) properties.
Table 2: Ablation study for different components of our algorithm. The speedup rate is computed based onrunning time of BABSR baseline: speedup = Time of BaBSR/Time of our method.
