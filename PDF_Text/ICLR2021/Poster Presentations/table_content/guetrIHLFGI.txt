Table 1: ResNet18 on CIFAR-10∕5m			Table 2: WRN28-10 + cutout on CIFAR-10/5m		E.2 Imagenet: DogBirdThe ImageNet-DogBird task is constructed by collapsing classes from ImageNet. The task is todistinguish dogs from birds. The dogs are all ImageNet classes under the WordNet synset “huntingdog” (including 63 ImageNet classes) and birds are all classes under synset “bird” (including 59ImageNet classes). This is a relatively easy task compared to full ImageNet: A ResNet-18 trainedon 10K samples from ImageNet-DogBird, with standard ImageNet data augmentation, can achievetest accuracy 95%. The listing of the ImageNet wnids included in each class is provided below.
