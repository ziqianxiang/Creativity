Table 1: Results on 1-shot and 5-shot classification on the CUB and Tabula Muris datasets. We reportaverage accuracy and standard deviation over 600 randomly sampled episodes.
Table 2: Comparison to the ensemble of prototypical networks and COMET with shared weightsacross concepts. On the CUB dataset weights are always shared.
Table 3: Results on 1-shot and 5-shot classification with automatically extracted concepts. We reportaverage accuracy and standard deviation over 600 randomly sampled episodes. We show the averagerelative improvement of COMET over the best and ProtoNet baselines.
Table 4: The effect of distance metric on COMET’s performance.				Distance	CUB		Tabula Muris		1-shot	5-shot	1-shot	5-shotCosine	65.7 ± 1.0	82.2 ± 0.6	77.1 ± 0.9	90.1 ± 0.6Euclidean	67.9 ± 0.9	85.3 ± 0.5	79.4 ± 0.9	91.7 ± 0.5C Ablation study on backb one networkWe compare performance of COMET to baselines methods using deeper Conv-6 backbone instead ofConv-4 backbone on the CUB dataset. We use part based annotations to define concepts. The resultsare reported in Table 5. COMET outperforms all baselines even with deeper backbone. Additionally,by adding just one most frequent concept corresponding to a bird’s beak on top of the whole imageconcept, COMET improves ProtoNet’s performance by 3.8% on 1-shot task and 2.2% on 5-shot task.
