We can see that optimalfixed threshold is around 0.4 or 0.5 for Dial, and our threshold selection algorithm could producecompetitive results. We demonstrate more expanding positions in Figure 11. We also show thefailure cases, where our selected threshold fails to recover the skill boundary. Nevertheless, we cansee that the peak pattern exists. We show the task alignment curves for different thresholds as wellas the auto-selected threshold in Figure 12.
