Table 1: The MOS and SMOS scores with 95% confidence intervals when adapting the sourceAdaSpeech model (trained on LibriTTS) to LJSpeech, VCTK and LibriTTS datasets. The thirdcolumn shows the number of additional parameters for each custom voice during adaptation (thenumber in bracket shows the number of parameters in inference following the practice in Section 2.3).
