Table 1: We report the numerical values of 鼠。-K/z) for the Laplace kernel KLaP(U) = e-V2(1-u)and NTKs N1 , . . . , N4 with β = 0, 1. These numerical values are the final values of the curves inFig. 1. We present the theoretical prediction by the asymptotic of [zn]K(z)/n-3/2 alongside eachnumerical value. The choice of β does not apply to the Laplace kernel. Therefore, we only show theresults of the Laplace kernel in the columns for β = 1 and leave blank the columns for β = 0.
