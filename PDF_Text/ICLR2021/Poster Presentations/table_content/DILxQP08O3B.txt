Table 1: Comparison with the state-of-the-art. We report the average success rate (%) and SPL aswell as their variances in parentheses by repeating experiments five times. L > 5 represents theepisodes which require at least 5 steps.
Table 2: Impacts of different components on navigation performances. Faster R-CNN and FasterR-CNNt represent instance features extracted by Faster R-CNN following Du et al. (2020) andAnderson et al. (2018a), respectively.
Table 3: Comparison of visual transformer architectures. We report the pre-training accuracy on thevalidation dataset, navigation success rate and SPL on the test dataset.
