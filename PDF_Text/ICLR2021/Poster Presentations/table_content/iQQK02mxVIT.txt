Table 1: The loss takes the binary cross-entropy with a 3-layer neural network. We see that inaverage of 10 trials, the resampling method (oversampling) achieves the lowest training loss andhighest ROC-AUC score over testing data among all tested cases.
Table 2: Mean squared errors (MSE) for nonlinear regression problems. RS stands for resamplingand RW for reweighting. The weights used in reweighting are a1 and a2, respectively. For eachcase, we run experiments for 10 times and compute the corresponding mean and standard deviation.
