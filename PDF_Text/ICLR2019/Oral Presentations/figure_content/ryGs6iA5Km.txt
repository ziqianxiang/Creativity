Figure 1: An overview of our theoretical framework. Middle panel: rooted subtree structures(at the blue node) that the WL test uses to distinguish different graphs. Right panel: if a GNNâ€™saggregation function captures the full multiset of node neighbors, the GNN can capture the rootedsubtrees in a recursive manner and be as powerful as the WL test.
Figure 2: Ranking by expressive power for sum, mean and max aggregators over a multiset.
Figure 3: Examples of graph structures that mean and max aggregators fail to distinguish.
Figure 4: Training set performance of GINs, less powerful GNN variants, and the WL subtree kernel.
