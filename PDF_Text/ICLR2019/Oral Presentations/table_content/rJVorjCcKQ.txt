Enclaves can produce remote attestations—digitalsignatures over an enclave’s code—that a remote party can verify using the manufacturer’s public key. Ourexperiments with Slalom use hardware enclaves provided by Intel SGX (see Appendix A for details).2TEEs offer an efficient solution for ML outsourcing: The server runs an enclave that initiates a secure communi-cation with C and evaluates a model F on C ’s input data. This simple scheme (which we implemented in SGX,see Section 4) outperforms cryptographic ML outsourcing protocols by 2-3 orders of magnitude (albeit under adifferent trust model). See Table 1 and Appendix C for a comparison to two representative works.
Table 2: Complexity (number of multiplications) for evaluating and verifying linear functions. The layersare “Fully Connected”, ”Convolution”, ”Depthwise Convolution” and ”Pointwise Convolution”, defined inAppendix D. Each layer f has an input x, output y and kernel W. We assume a batch size of B ≥ 1.
