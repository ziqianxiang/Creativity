Table 1: List of initialization schemes for each pair of φ and σ, for α = 1. Here “-” indicates apositive finite value that depends on the choice of 夕L (for which we choose the ReLU), but its exactvalue is irrelevant for our purpose. “EOC” indicates whether the scheme is an EOC initializationwith respect to σ , and “xx” indicates an EOC scheme that is found to be the better one amongall EOC initializations with Gaussian weights (Pennington et al. (2017)). “Trainable” indicatesbetter trainability in the beginning as predicted by our theory. “Slowed” indicates γ = ρ = 0 in aneighborhood. “Inf” indicates either Y → ∞ or P → ∞. The schemes with 夕=tanh should bereflected against Fig. 3.
