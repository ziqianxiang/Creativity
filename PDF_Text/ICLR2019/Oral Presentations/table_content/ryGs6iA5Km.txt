Table 1: Test set classification accuracies (%). The best-performing GNNs are highlighted withboldface. On datasets where GINsâ€™ accuracy is not strictly the highest among GNN variants, wesee that GINs are still comparable to the best GNN because a paired t-test at significance level 10%does not distinguish GINs from the best; thus, GINs are also highlighted with boldface. If a baselineperforms significantly better than all GNNs, we highlight it with boldface and asterisk.
