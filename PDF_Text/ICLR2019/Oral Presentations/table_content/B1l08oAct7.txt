Table 1: Forms for the components of the approximation in equation 6 for Heaviside and ReLUnon-linearities. Φ is the CDF of a standard Gaussian, SR is a “soft ReLU" that We define as SR(X)=φ(x) + xΦ(x) where φ is a standard Gaussian, P =，1 - ρ2, gh = arcsin P and gr = gh + 1++^Where We have used the Gaussian form of a0 parameterized by mean ha0i and covariance Σ0, andfor brevity we have omitted the normalizing constants. Closed form solutions for the integral inequation 4 exist for Heaviside or ReLU choices of non-linearity f (see appendix A). Furthermore, forthese non-linearities, the a0j → ±∞ and ha0li → ±∞ asymptotes of the integral in equation 5 haveclosed form. Figure 2 shows schematically how these asymptotes can be used as a first approximationfor equation 5. This approximation is improved by considering that (by definition) the residual decaysto zero far from the origin in the ( a0j , ha0li) plane, and so is well modelled by a decaying functionexp[-Q( a0j , ha0li , Σ0)], where Q is a polynomial in ha0i with a dominant positive even term. Inpractice we truncate Q at the quadratic term, and calculate the polynomial coefficients by matchingthe moments of the resulting Gaussian with the analytic moments of the residual. Specifically, usingdimensionless variables μi =(4)/∖∕∑ii and Pij = ∑j∕∖ Σ[i∑jj, this improved approximationtakes the formhhjhl i = Sj1 {4μj,μl, PjI) + eχp [-Q(μj , μi, PjI)]},(6)where the expressions for the dimensionless asymptote Aand quadratic Q are given in table table 1 and derived inappendix A.2.1 and A.2.2.
