Table 1: Statistics of the MAESTRO dataset.
Table 2: Comparison with other datasets.
Table 3: Audio augmentation parameters.
Table 4: Transcription Precision, Recall, and F1 Results on MAPS configuration 2 test dataset(ENSTDkCl and ENSTDkAm full-length .wav files). Training was done on the MAESTRO trianingset with audio augmentation. Scores are calculated using the same method as in Hawthorne et al.
Table 5: Results from training the modified Onsets and Frames model on the MAESTRO trainsplit without audio augmentation. Precision, Recall, and F1 Results on the splits of the MAESTROdataset. Calculations done in the same manner as table 4.
Table 6: Comparisons between results of training the same model with the same number of steps(670k) with and without audio augmentation. Training was done on the MAESTRO training setand evaluation was on either the MAPS configuration 2 test set as in table 4 or the MAESTRO testset as in table 5.
Table 7: Validation Negative Log-Likelihood, with event-based representation.
