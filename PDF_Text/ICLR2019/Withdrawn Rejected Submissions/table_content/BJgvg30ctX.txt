Table 1: Performance comparison on CIFAR100, Best Accuracy (%, test set) and the average val-ues of the constrain I(X; Y ) - I(Y ; Y ) throughout the training process are provided in the tables.
Table 2: The performance statistics for ResNet-32 and PlainNet-32 without or under various regu-larizations. For regularized models we hold α1 = 1e-5 and take α2 = [0.01, 0.05, 0.09, 0.15, 0.3].
