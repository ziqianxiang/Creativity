In the disjoint CIFAR10 tasks, we cannot achieve ahigh initial accuracy because we only use a fully connected structure and do not have a convolutionalstructure at all. But the overall result is the same as with the MINST tasks. The sigmoid cross entropyloss converges slower than the SoftMax cross entropy loss and has a lower initial accuracy than theSoftMax cross entropy loss in disjoint CIFAR10 tasks. However, from Fig. 4 c), we can see that,in more complicated tasks such as disjoint CIFAR10, where tasks do not share similar low-levelfeatures, the sigmoid function may be able to pass gradients only through the active tasks since thetarget vector is in one-hot expression. Thus, it gives us a better accuracy for task 1 after training
