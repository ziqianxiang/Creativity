Table 1: Ablation for spherical SAE: Sinkhorn vs. Hungarian, fixed targets vs. sampling. MMDare scaled up by 1000. We compute a baseline for the MMD between two independent set of 10Ksamples (same as the test set size) from the prior. The baseline is 0.2 for both datasets.
Table 2: SAE vs. prior work. In boldface the best two FID per dataset. Note that MMD are notcomparable if the prior is different. *The â€˜spherical, AE amounts to normalizing the encoder output.
