Table 1:	Mean and Variance of Inception Scores in previoUs GANswe Used cropped images of size 32 × 32 so that the dense layer of oUr neUral networks does notbecome too large. For each training, We generated 50,000 fake images and Used these images tocalcUlate the inception score.
Table 2:	Mean and variance of inceptions scores of Deli-Fisher GAN. Here the we used followingset of parameters: learning rate σ = 0.00005. Latent space family: mixture Gaussian. In the table,each inception score has two values: the mean value and the standard deviation.
