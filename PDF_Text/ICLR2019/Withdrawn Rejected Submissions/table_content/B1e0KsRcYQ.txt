Table 1: Summary of second order methods. C. and F. columns are respectively for ”Codebook”and "Factorization”. Numbers in brackets are typical values. Methods marked * used the originalpaper values. Other methods use the following parameters: h = w = 28 are the height and width ofthe feature map, d = 512 is the feature dimension, D is the output representation, and is set to 512if possible. Our proposed method uses a codebook N = 32 and a projection set of size R = 8.

Table 3: Recall@1 for different combination of JCF factorization.
Table 4: Evaluation of our proposed factorization scheme. We compare our method to the state-of-the-art on Bilinear factorization and similar methods. We evaluate them with small representationdimension to attest our dimensionality reduction efficiency. * denotes our re-implementation.
