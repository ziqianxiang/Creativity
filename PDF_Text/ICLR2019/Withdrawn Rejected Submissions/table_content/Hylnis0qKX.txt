Table 1: Datasets informationused the feature matching adversarial loss Salimans et al. (2016). f (x) denote activations on anintermediate layer of the discriminator.
Table 2: Image quality metrics on the ultra-low-dose Amyloid PET datasets, Multi-contrast MRdatasets (T1 sequence), and LFW-a datasets, with the comparison of the GAN without and with theproposed task-GAN feature.
Table 3: Radiologists and Task-net’s performance (Amyloid status) on standard-dose ground truthimages, synthesized images by GAN, and synthesized images by task-GAN. Radiologist’s patholog-ical decision was based on the whole volume. The table shows the error rate over 2 radiologists’ 20decisions on 10 testing datasets. Amyloid status network was slice-wise, whose accuracy is shownin the table by the mean absolute error (MAE). The volume-wise decision was based on the middle40 slices in each volume, which is shown in the bracket.
