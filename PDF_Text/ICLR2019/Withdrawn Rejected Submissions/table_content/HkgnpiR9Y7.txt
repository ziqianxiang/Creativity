Table 1: Comparison of reconstruction performance using PSNR (mean and std) and SSIM (meanand standard deviation) between test images and their reconstructed images from each model onFashion MNIST, CIFAR10, and CelebA dataset. To verify the validity of the proposed metric, wecompare our scores with the existing metrics; Inception score on CIFAR10 and MS-SSIM on CelebA.
