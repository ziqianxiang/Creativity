Thus, M' = 5000 is determined for Re-TD3 by tuning, whereasM = 250 is used for IPE-TD3. Since all N policies collapse as one point in Re-TD3 at the begin-ning of each period, we expect that a larger period is required for Re-TD3 to have sufficiently spreadpolicies at the end of the best policy selection period.
