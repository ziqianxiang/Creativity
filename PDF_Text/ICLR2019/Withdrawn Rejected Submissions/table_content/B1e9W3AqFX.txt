Table 1: Typical read-opts with their basic model frameworks, constituent parameters, and relatedinstantiations. The second column illustrates the sketch of each read-op, which takes as input twotasks A and B . Solid lines show the information flowing of tasks A. Cyan boxes denote privateencoders while red boxes represent shared encoders. Blue circles denote output layers. The thirdcolumn shows the different types of parameters each read-op consists of with respect to the task A.
Table 2: Performances of our models on three groups of multi-task learning datasets against typicalbaselines. ∆ denotes the improvement value compared with the base model under single task setting.
Table 3: Top-10 word features in share space with high values of q on two parts of vocabularies. Theshared spaces are constructed by SR and LGP-SR models respectively. TiK 5i denotes the intersectionof five sub-vocabularies and Ti5 Vi represents its complement.
