Table 1: Localization evaluation using OM and LEscores. We report the better accuracy between thosereported in the original papers or by Fong & Vedaldi(2017).
Table 2: Ablation study. S refers to the choice of ascore function (E: entropy, C: classification loss), Shrto whether the encoder and classifier are shared (Y: yes,N: no) and Thin to the thinning strategies.
Table 3: Localization errors (LE in %, 1) of the models trained on a subset of classes. Each row corresponds tothe training subset of classes and each column to the test subset of classes. Error rates on the previously unseenclasses are marked with gray shade.
