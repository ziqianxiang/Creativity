Table 1: The main results of different methods. The architecture is ResNet18, and the dataset isCIFAR-10. This table shows the top-1 and top-5 accuracies on the validation dataset. iRDA achievesthe highest top-1 accuracy and sparsity. See figure 1 for the corresponding loss curves.
Table 2: iRDA on different Architectures. This table shows the top-1 and top-5 accuracies on thevalidation dataset. The results from SGD with momentum are in the brackets. iRDA works well ondifferent CNN architectures.
Table 3: iRDA on different datasets. The architecture is ResNet18. This table shows the top-1and top-5 accuracies on the validation dataset. The results from SGD with momentum are in thebrackets. iRDA works well on different datasets.
Table 4: iRDA and different state-of-the-art compression methods on CIFAR-10. This table showsthe top-1 accuracies on the validation dataset. Due to different standards, σ is referred to directly orcomputed approximately. iRDA achieves almost the same accuracy and sparsity on VGG16, whilethe sparsity on ResNet18 is much better.
Table 6: Different initialization scalars onCIFAR-100 with iRDA. The architecture isResNet18. λ = 10-8 and γ = 0.1. Thistable shows the top-1 accuracies on the vali-dation dataset. All models are trained for 120epochs.
Table 5: Different initialization scalars onCIFAR-10 with iRDA. The architecture isResNet18. λ = 10-6 and γ = 1.0. Thistable shows the top-1 accuracies on the vali-dation dataset. All models are trained for 120epochs.
Table 7: Fix γ = 1.0 and test different λ with different methods on CIFAR-10. The architectureis ResNet18. All models are trained for 120 epochs. This table shows the top-1 accuracies on thevalidation dataset. We have shown why Prox-SGD will give poor sparsity, and although √t-prox-SGD may introduce greater sparsity, it is not convergent. Finally, iRDA gives the best result, onboth the top-1 accuracy and the sparsity.
Table 8: Different λ and γ with iRDA on CIFAR-10. The architecture is ResNet18. All models aretrained for 120 epochs. This table shows the top-1 accuracies on the validation dataset. The highestaccuracy is 92.07% with sparsity 0.84, and with a lower accuracy 90.67% we get a sparsity of 0.94.
