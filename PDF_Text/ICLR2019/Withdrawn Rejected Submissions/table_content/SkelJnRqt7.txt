Al-though supervision for both human speech and natural noises can generally be obtained, we use thistask as a benchmark to evaluate our methodâ€™s performance on audio signals where X and B are notdependent. This benchmark is a proxy for tasks for which a clean training set of X sounds cannot beobtained e.g. for animal sounds in the wild, background sounds training without animal noises caneasily be obtained, but clean sounds made by the animal with no background sounds are unlikely tobe available.

GLOM can result inmodels that are too loose (i.e. that also encode samPles oUtside of X). BUt as an initialization forNES finetUning, it is better to have a model that is too loose than a model which is too tight.
