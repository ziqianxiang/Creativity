(2018). Quality of generated sentences is evaluated by BLEU score(Papineni et al., 2002). Since BLEU-b measures the overlap of b consecutive words between thegenerated sentences and ground-truth references, higher BLEU scores indicate better fluency. SelfBLEU uses the generated sentences themselves as references; lower values indicate higher diversity.
