Table 1: Performance of DDPG and DDPG-AP variants on different test tracks.
Table 2: Average test scores over 50 games (episodes) of DDQN, DDQN-AP2 and DDQN-(AP1+AP2) onhard difficulty level (pipe gap = 100) of the Flappy bird game. The 50 games consists of five test experimentsconducted with five different random seeds (10 games have been played in each test experiment by the modeltrained on a given random seed).
