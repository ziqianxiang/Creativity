For the incremental learning framework, we keepon updating the model parameters for each round with the augmented feature space, where minimaldrift is present. We then test the models on the rounds, where the feature space corresponding toonly phase or the magnitude would perform poorly, and use our proposed stable feature space forthe multi-class classification problem.
