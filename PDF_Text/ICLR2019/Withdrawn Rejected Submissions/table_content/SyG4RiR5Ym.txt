We created the Linux commit log dataset, which contains all commits from13k active contributors since 2011. 2For each dataset, we discretized the resolution from millisecond to daily measurements. In doingso, a day with multiple events is considered a day with event hence its discrete time to event is zero.
Table 3: Highest achieved AUC results on predicting events within 10,30,90 and 300 days after theend of training set with baselines and HazardNet. Bin is the baseline, Bin* is the baseline trainedwithout the last τ time steps of the training set, Haz for HazardNet. Bold numbers indicate the bestresult per model and dataset.
