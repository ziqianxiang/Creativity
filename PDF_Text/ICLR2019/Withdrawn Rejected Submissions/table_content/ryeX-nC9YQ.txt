Table 1: Summary of our dimension-free results compared with prior work. The values reportthe number of bits needed, according to the theoretical bound, for the LP-SGD (Li et al., 2017)algorithm to achieve an expected objective gap (f (W) - f (w*)) of E when We let step size ɑ → 0,epoch length T → ∞. Here we let R denote the radius of the range of numbers representable in thelow-precision format and assume ∣∣w*∣∣2 = Θ(R). The rest of the parameters can be found in theassumptions to be introduced later.
