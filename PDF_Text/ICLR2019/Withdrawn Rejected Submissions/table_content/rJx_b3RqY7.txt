Table 1: MSE (lower is better) and Inception scores (higher is better) on MNIST and CIFAR-10. ALI andALICE results are from the experiments in Li et al. (2017).
Table 2: Degree of mode collapse, measured by modes captured (higher is better) and % high quality sam-ples (higher is better) on 2D grid data. The baseline results are reported in Srivastava et al. (2017).
Table 3: MNIST model hyperparameters.
Table 4: CIFAR-10 and CelebA model hyperparameters.
