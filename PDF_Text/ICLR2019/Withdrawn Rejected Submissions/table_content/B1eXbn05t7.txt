Table 1: Average query accuracy for the one-shot learning task with the Omniglot data set, withk = 1 samples per class in the support set and n = 20 classes per episode.
Table 2: Results for training standard classifiers on un-augmented and on augmented data. Thecolumns, from left to right: the tested data set, the number of classes in the training/test data sets(n), the number of samples per class in the support set (k), the baseline (un-augmented) test accuracy,the accuracy of a model with standard data augmentation, and the accuracy of a model with bothstandard data augmentation and stoc augmentation. We have also listed the test accuracy fromAntoniou et al. (2017), where appropriate.
