Table 1: Comparisons for Inception Score (IS) and Classification Accuracy (CA)For the second test, We randomly sample ten pairs of the translated images from two different models(e.g., LOMIT / DRIT or LOMIT / MUNIT) with corresponding inputs. Given specific questions suchas Q1 or Q2 as shown in Fig. 7 (b), users confirm that LOMIT does not only apply exemplar stylesbetter, but also maintains the background region unaffected. Both (a) and (b) verify the effectivenessof the algorithms of LOMIT, such as HAdaIN and the disentangled style encoders, because weextract the relevant style and apply it to the relevant area (foreground) of the content code whilemaintaining the rest.
