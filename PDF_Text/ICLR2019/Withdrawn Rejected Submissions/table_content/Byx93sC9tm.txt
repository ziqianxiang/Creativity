Table 1 contains a summary of the results,with the acquisition size containing the initial training set with the batch size for one iteration upto the maximum number of points acquired. At each acquisition step, a fixed sample set from theunlabelled pool is added to the initial balanced labelled data set and models are re-trained from theentire training set. We evaluate the model on the dataset’s standard test set. The CNN model archi-tecture is the same as in the Keras CNN implementation for MNIST and CIFAR-10 (Chollet et al.,2015). We use Glorot initialization for weights, Adam optimizer and early stopping with patience
