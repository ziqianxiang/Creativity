Table 1: Evaluation of models modifying the presence of halogen moieties and the number of aro-matic rings. Success rate is the fraction of times when a desired modification occurs. Non-identityis the fraction of times when the generated molecule is different from the starting one. Uniquenessis the fraction of unique molecules in the set of generated molecules.
