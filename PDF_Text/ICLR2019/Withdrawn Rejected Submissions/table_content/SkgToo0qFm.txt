Table 1: Dataset Sizes. By training on complexes from Cr (PDB), as opposed to restricting ourselvesto complexes with unbound data available such as those from Cp (DB5), we can access over twoorders of magnitude more training data than would otherwise be available.
Table 2: Cptest CAUROC performance. For each method we report best replicate (as selectedby Cpval performance for competitors, and by Crval for SASNet) as well as mean and standarddeviation across replicates. While competing methods have used all available training data, dueto computational limitations SASNet is trained on less than 3% of Cr, hinting at the possibility ofsubstantial performance improvements.
Table 3: Cptest CAUROC performance for leading methods trained on Tr task. Competing methodswith hand-engineered features experience a dramatic drop in performance as compared to theirperformance in Table 2. The features learned by SASNet exhibit a higher degree of transferrability.
Table 4: Cptest CAUROC performance for methods trained on structure and sequence. SASNet addsin sequence by training a linear model, followed by a sigmoid activation, on the concatenation ofthe sequence conservation features used in Fout et al. (2017) and the final layer of the best learnedstructural SASNet model.
