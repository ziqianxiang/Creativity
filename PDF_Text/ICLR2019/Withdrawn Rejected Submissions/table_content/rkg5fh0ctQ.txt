To evaluate the effectiveness of“intent2slot” mechanism, we compare the TSSM with its ablation variant without “intent2slot”, andthe result is shown in Table 3. The results demonstrate that the “intent2slot” mechanism helps toimprove intent classification performance. The parameters in intent bi-LSTMs layer might haveobtained additional supervision from the upper slot filling task. The improvements for transferringfrom Restaurant, Laptop, TV, Atis to Hotel is not obvious and the reason needs further experiments.
