Table 1: MSE for multi-step prediction on PhysVideos (test). All models were trained with 1 step prediction loss.
Table 2: Average scores (along with standard deviation) obtained in PhysWorld environments after 10 millionframes of training. Scores are rewards over 100 episodes, averaged over runs with 3 different random seeds. IPA+ SpatialNet consistently outperforms the other approaches. Both RCNet, SpatialNet, ConvLSTM are pretrainedon PhysVideos. PPO+VF = PPO with Value Function Expansion.
Table 3: Scores (and standard deviation) obtained on Stochastic Atari Environments with sticky actions (actionsrepeated with 50% probability at each step). Scores are average performance over 100 episodes after 10Mtraining frames, over 5 different random seeds with included standard deviations.
Table 4: Effects of model initialization and transfer on training policies in PhysShooter. Topmost section showsbaseline PPO, random initialization of dynamics for IPA, and pre-trained IPA using PhysVideos. The bottomtwo sections demonstrate results while transferring different models from two other games - direct policy (PPO),transfer dynamics model and fix it (Fixed SpatialNet), transfer dynamics and finetune (Finetune SpatialNet),and transfer both dynamics+policy and finetune (Model+Policy). IPA allows decoupling of policy transfer frommodel transfer, allowing better transfer in cases of environment similarity but task dissimilarity. Scores obtainedon the PhysWorld environments after training for 10M frames and evaluated by taking average rewards of thelast 100 training episodes.
Table 5: MSE loss on physics prediction data-set on on single-step prediction with test inputs corrupted withGaussian noise of magnitude (model trained with no corruption). Due to its local nature, SpatialNet suffers lessform errors in inputs and is able to maintain object numbers/dynamics more consistently even with domain shift.
Table 6: Scores obtained on Stochastic Atari Environments with sticky actions (actions repeated with 50%probability at each step). Scores are average performance over 100 episodes after 10M training frames, over 5different random seeds.
Table 7: MSE on Stochastic Atari Environments (a action is repeated with a geometric distribution with p=0.5)at 1 million training frames. MSE PD is trained with a model from physics dataset while MSE DN is trainedwith a model from scratch. We evaluate percentage advantage for initializing with a physics dataset as comparedto from scratch. We average 12.9% decrease in MSE error using a initialization from pretraining on a physicsdataset. The most negative environment, Enduro, involves a 3D landspace which initializing from model trainedon a physics data set may be detrimental.
