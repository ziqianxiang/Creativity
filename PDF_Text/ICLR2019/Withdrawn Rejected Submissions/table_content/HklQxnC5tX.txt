Table 1: Dataset statistics. K stands for 1000.
Table 2: Recovery of ground-truth communities, as measured by normalized mutual information (in%). All results are averaged over 10 initializations. Best result for each row in bold, second bestunderlined. N/A - method not applicable to this attribute type. D.N.F. - did not finish in 24 hours.
Table 3: Comparison of graph neural network (GNN) based model against simpler baselines inthe ground-truth community recovery task. Multilayer perceptron (MLP) and Free Variable (FV)models are optimizing the same objective (Equation 5), but represent the community affiliations Fdifferently.
