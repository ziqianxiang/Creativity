Table 1: Mixed Precision Quantization for ResNet on CIFAR10 dataset. We report results onResNet{20, 56, 110}. In the table, we abbreviate accuracy as “Acc” and compression as “Comp”.
Table 2: Layer-wise bit-widths for the most accurate vs. the most efficient architecture of ResNet20.
Table 3: Mixed Precision Quantization for ResNet on ImageNet for model size compression. Inthe table, we abbreviate accuracy as “Acc” and compression as “Comp”. “MA” denotes the mostaccurate model from architecture search and “ME” denotes the most efficient model.
Table 4: Mixed Precision Quantization for ResNet on ImageNet for computational cost compression.
