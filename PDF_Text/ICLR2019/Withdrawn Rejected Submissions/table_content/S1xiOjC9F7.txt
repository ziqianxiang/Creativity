Table 1: Comparing the graph embedding (GNN) and matching (GMN) models trained on graphsfrom different distributions with the baseline, measuring pair AUC / triplet accuracy (× 100).
Table 2: More results on the function similarity search task and the extra COIL-DEL dataset.
Table 3: Generalization performance on large graphs for the GSL models trained on small graphswith 20 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 0.2 ≤ p ≤ 0.5.
