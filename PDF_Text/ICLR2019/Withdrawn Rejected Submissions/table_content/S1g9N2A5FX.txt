Table 1: Average test classification accuracy of 4 and 5 tasks for the Split MNIST, Split notMNISTand Split Fashion-MNIST experiments, and for 9 and 10 tasks of Permuted MNIST. A bold entry inTable 1 denotes that the classification accuracy of an algorithm is significantly higher than its com-petitors. Significant results are identified using a paired t-test with p = 0.05. Average classificationaccuracy resulting from ICL is significantly higher than its competitors in 6 out of the 8 cases (3 outof 4 after the completion of all the tasks required per experiment).
Table 2: Values of the proposed saliency metric FSM for the Split MNIST, Split notMNIST andSplit Fashion-MNIST experiments. A result in bold refers to an FSM value that is significantlylower (better) than the other competitors. FSM values resulting from using ICL with VCL aresignificantly better in all of the 6 cases.
