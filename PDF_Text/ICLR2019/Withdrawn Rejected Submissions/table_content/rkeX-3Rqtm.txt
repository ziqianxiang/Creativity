Table 1: Final test accuracies obtained after training each network for 150, 300, or 200 epochs(GRAPHS/MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, respectively) on the corresponding dataset.
Table 2: Validation Accuracies of Method Variations4.1	Method variationsWe performed an ablation study measuring the validation accuracies for variations of the methodsconsidered in this paper. For SSTE, FTPROP, and GRLS we considered the effect of dropping LossWeighting (LW) from the methods. For GRLS we also considered removing Gradient Guiding (GG),Gradient Seeding (GS), and Criterion Weighting (CW) (weighting the target choosing criterion (loss)by the next layerâ€™s loss gradient). We ran experiments on the 2-layer feedforward network and the4-layer convolutional network, and tested two distinct datasets on each network. The results aresummarized in Table 2.
Table 3: Mean Loss of Target Setting Methods7Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2019Figure 3: Effect of Varying Dimension on Validation Accuracy4.3	Method suboptimalityWe seek to compare the quality of target setting procedures considered in our study. We consideredrandom instances of Problem (3) (i.e randomly generated weight matrix and output targets, with 10possible output classes) and tasked GRLS, RLS, and FTPROP to set targets. We performed 1024independent trials and collected the data in Table 3. We show there the loss mean and standard errorof each given target setting method.
