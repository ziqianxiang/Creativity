Table 1: Accuracy and attack success rate against different models on pristine data (p) and dversarialexamples generated by meshAdv with PASCAL3D+ renderings. We show the average distance(mean) and the attack success probabitliy (prob) under different settings.
Table 2: Untargeted attack success rate against Mitsuba by transferring adversarial meshes generatedby attacking a differentible rendering targeting on different classes.
