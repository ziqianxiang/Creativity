Table 2: Model StudyPPrGraphSAGE	0.502BIGSAGE-ba	0.521BIGSAGE-sg	0.518BIGSAGE-cb	0.523BIGSAGE	0.572From Table 2, we observe the three variant of BIGSAGE still show certain advance to the originGraphSAGE, but reasonably less accurate than the origin BIGSAGE. The result of using only bi-attention layer proves the effect of bi-attended sampling. And the comparison between BIGSAGE-sgand BIGSAGE shows the high efficiency of applying global bias through all layers. From the resultof BIGSAGE-cb, we find that even after training with global-bias, itâ€™s critical to have the memoryof the known nodes, which is stored in the learnt global embedding biases.
