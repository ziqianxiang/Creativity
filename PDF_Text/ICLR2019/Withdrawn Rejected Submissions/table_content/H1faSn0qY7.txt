Table 1: Results for queries: (#✓) number of completed instances (out of 10), @ is the averagerunning time in seconds, and ©✓the average running time of successful runs (in seconds).
Table 2: Hyperparameters used for supervised learning experimentHere we describe implementation details (including hyperaparameters) used during our experiments.
Table 3: The datasets and networks used to evaluate DL2. The reported accuracy is top-1 accuracyand it was either computed by the authors (*), users that implemented the work (#), or by Us (*).
Table 4: RUn times for additional constraints on adversarial perturbation. #/is the number of suc-cessful runs out of 9 and ©✓is the average run time over the successful runs in seconds. k row orcolumn constraints corresponds to 27 individual constraints in DL2 each. So the right most columnadds 756 constraints for the first two settings and 1512 for the last.
