Table 1: The performance of the models we considered under various noise distributions, togetherwith our measurements of those models’ robustness to small lp perturbations. For all the robustnesstests we used PGD with 100 steps and a step size of /25. The adversarially trained CIFAR-10 modelis the open sourced model from Madry et al. (2017).
Table 2: Wide ResNet-28-10 (Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2016) trained and tested on CIFAR-10 withGaussian noise with standard deviation σ .
Table 3: The models from Section 1 trained and tested on ImageNet with Gaussian noise with standarddeviation σ; the column labeled 0 refers to a model trained only on clean images.
Table 4: The performance of ordinarily and adversarially trained MNIST models on various noisedistributions.
