Table 1: Top-1 image classification accuracy onCIFAR datasets. VGG-small means VGG modelwith only one FC layer. VGG-ATT means themodel proposed in (Jetley et al., 2018), VGG-LR-2 means the ”rethinking” one-FC-layer VGGmodel with 2 unrolling times proposed in (Liet al., 2018). CRCN-n means our 2-recurrent-connection model with n unrolling times.
