Table 1: Test accuracy on MNIST and CIFAR-10 for Binarized NN (Hubara et al., 2016), PBNet,and a full precission network (FPNet). PBNet-map refers to a deterministic PBNet using the mapestimate, PBNet-Ternary is a ternary deterministic network obtained from qÎ¸ , and PBNet-X refersto an ensemble of X networks, each sampled from the same weight distribution. For the ensembleresults both mean and standard deviation are presented. The propagate column contains resultsobtained using the stochastic network whereas results in the binarized column are obtained using adeterministic binary Neural Network.
