Table 1: Average query count for untargeted (left) and targeted (right) attacks. Both SimBA andSimBA-DCT have comparable success rate to other algorithms, but require a significantly fewernumber of model queries. This effect is especially dramatic for untargeted attack, where the numberof queries made by SimBA-DCT is 24 times fewer than all other methods.
