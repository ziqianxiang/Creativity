Table 3: Detection Rates ComparisonMethod Detection Rate(fps)YOLO	90.72Trational	0.0537Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2019We evaluated the processing rate of YOLO and traditional method with 1500 testing images. Table3 shows the detection rates for the two methods. The traditional method is executed with a Desk-top equipped with RAM: 16GB; CPU: Intel Core i5-2400 @ 3.1 Ghz; GPU: NVIDEA GeForceGTS 450. We perform our data processing, model training, and detection on a machine equippedwith RAM: 128GB; CPU: 2×Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2637 v3 @ 3.50GHz; GPU: NVIDIA Cor-poration GP102 [TITAN X]. Although our method is operated by a machine with much strongercomputational ability, our method’s significant advantage in speed is still obvious.
