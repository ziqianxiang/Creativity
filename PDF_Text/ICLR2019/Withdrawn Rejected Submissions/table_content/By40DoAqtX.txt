Table 1: The comparison of F1 score between our method and other state-of-the-art methods onBibtex and Bookmarks datasets. In the table, SPM denotes the structured prediction model.
Table 2: The comparison of IOU between our LDRSP and other adversarial learning methods on theWeizmann horses dataset. FCN is adopted as our structured prediction model.
Table 3: The comparison of superpixel accuracy (SP Acc) between our LDRSP and other adversariallearning methods on the LFW dataset.
