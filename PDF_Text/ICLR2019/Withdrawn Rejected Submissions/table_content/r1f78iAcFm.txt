Table 1: Statistics of USPTO-15k and USPTO datasets. “changes” means bond changes, “molecules”means reactants and reagents in a reaction; “atoms” and “bonds” are defined for a molecule. Apartfrom “#reactions”, other columns are presented in the format “min | max | mean”.
Table 2: Results for reaction atom pair prediction. C@k is coverage at k. Best results are highlightedin bold. WLN? is the original model from (Jin et al., 2017) while WLN is our re-implemented version.
Table 3: Results for reaction prediction. P@k is precision at k. State-of-the-art results from (Jinet al., 2017) are written in italic. Results from (Schwaller et al., 2018) are marked with ? and they arecomputed on a slightly different version of USPTO that contains only single-product reactions. Bestresults are highlighted in bold. ♦: With beam search (beam width = 20), ♦: Invalid product removal,*: Duplicated product removal.

Table 6: Proportion of reactions containing reagents and proportion of reagents over input moleculeson USPTO-15k and USPTO.
Table 7: Results for the reaction prediction task. P@k is the precision at k. Best results are highlightedin bold. Meanings of markers in our model: ♦: With beam search (beam width = 20), ■: Invalidproduct removal, *: Duplicate product removal.
