Table 1: To validate the method, we compare against a pure seq2seq with attention baseline, alongwith a tuned (“+ Priors”) version and a Copynet with the same improvements except for beam search.
Table 2: Methods allowing the model to keep track of past attention (Coverage, Scratchpad) sig-nificantly improve performance when combined with a copy mechanism. The Scratchpad Encoderachieves the best performance.
Table 3: Example instances from the test set of the copy-mechanism of copynet over-firing wherethe scratchpad model copies correctly.
Table 4: Human evaluations show that theScratchpad Encoder delivers a large im-provement in both fluency and adequacy overCopynet and Coverage.
Table 5: The percentage of times judges preferredone result over the other. In a Head-to-Head eval-uation the output of Scratchpad Encoder is 9 and2 times as likely to be chosen vs. Copynet andCoverage, respectively. Win rate is the percentageof times Scratchpad was picked when the judgeschose a single winner (not a tie).
Table 6: Methods allowing the model to keep track of past attention (Coverage, Scratchpad) sig-nificantly improve performance when combined with a copy mechanism. The Scratchpad Encoderachieves the best performance.
Table 7: Example instances from the test set of the copy-mechanism of copynet over-firing wherethe scratchpad model copies correctly.
Table 8: Example questions from the training set of WebQuestionsSP dataset, with tokensthat also appear in the sparql in bold. Nearly half (47.36%) of tokens in questions appearin the corresponding sparql, suggesting that the ability to copy can improve performanceon this task.
