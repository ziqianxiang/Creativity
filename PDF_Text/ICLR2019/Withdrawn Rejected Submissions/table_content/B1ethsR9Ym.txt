Since we have validated that our predicted trait scores align well withhuman judgment, we know the putative “correct answers” for these pairs. The overall ground truthresults are between 85 and 96%, so we didn’t discard any subjects.

By examining the distribution closely, we find that StarGAN is less consistent.
