Table 1: PSPNet-based semantic segmentation IoU and accuracy scores using generated imagesfrom different discriminators. Our results outperform concatenation-based methods by a large mar-gin and is close to the accuracy and IoU on actual images (GT/Oracle).
Table 2: GAN-based semantic segmentation using different discriminators. Tested with cityscapesdataset rescaled to 256 Ã— 256 images.
