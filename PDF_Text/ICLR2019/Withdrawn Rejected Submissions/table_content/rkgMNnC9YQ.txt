Table 1: R2 for different values of Î»awlearning of temporal embeddings with regularization terms constraining the production of explainablemodels, according to metrics that we have defined. Experimental results on a real patient data setfrom MIMICIII has demonstrated the applicability of the proposed metrics for the generation ofexplainable models trading explanation complexity for overall accuracy. In the future, we plan torun further experiments on larger EHR data sets for other predictive tasks, with prior knowledgeextracted from medical guidelines and ontologies. Furthermore, we plan to extend these concepts toreinforcement learning, in a policy-based setting where we constrain the learning of optimal policieswith knowledge aware explainability metrics to produce explainable policies.
