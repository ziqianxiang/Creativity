We use traditional CNN for CNNSAT, and construct amatrix based on CNF. However, it is clear that the matrix is sparse. In fact, for 3-SAT problems, thematrices are very sparse and most elements in these matrices are zero. However, we have not foundsparse CNNs that best fit our scenario. Graham & van der Maaten (2017) present the SubmanifoldSparse Convolutional Networks but since the matrices in our setting is not submanifold, it does not fitour representation.
