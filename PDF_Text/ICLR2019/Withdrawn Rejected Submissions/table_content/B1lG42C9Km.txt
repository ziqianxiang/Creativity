Table 1: Optimal hyperparameter settings for the models in the centralised controller experiment.
Table 2: Optimal hyperparameter settings for the models in the communication experiment.
Table 3: Optimal hyperparameter settings for the models in the model of other agents (MOA) experiment.
Table 4: Final collective reward over the last 50 agent steps for each of the models considered. Boldedentries represent experiments in which the influence models significantly outperformed the scores reportedin previous work on inequity aversion(Hughes et al., 2018). This is impressive, considering the inequityaverse agents are able to view all other agentsâ€™ rewards. We make no such assumption, and yet are able toachieve similar or superior performance.
