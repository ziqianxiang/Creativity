Table 1: Inception Score and Frechet Inception Distance for different methods. IS and FID for othermethods were taken from literature (if possible). For AGE we got FID using a pretrained model.

Table 3: Reconstruction Inception Dissimilarity, Inception Score and Frechet Inception Distancecalculated for three setups: 1) the proposed model, PAGAN; 2) PAGAN with L1 for reconstructionloss; 3) PAGAN with augmentation removed. Model without adversarial loss or without augmentationperformed worse in both generation and reconstruction tasks.
