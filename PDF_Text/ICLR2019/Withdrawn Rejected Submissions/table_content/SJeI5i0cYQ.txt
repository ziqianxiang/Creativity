Table 1: Patch Ordering and Reconstruction (POR) Algorithm. The function Generate-Patche s generatesequal sized patches of the input image. Compute-Individual-Index calculates the index of a given patchwhen the MeasureType is of type standalone while Compute-Mutual-Index computes an index ofsimilarity between two patches. Sort-Pachtes sorts the patches according to indices and Reconstruct-Sample constructs a sample using sorted patches. For computational efficiency PatChSfZe is taken from(4x4, 8x8, 16x16) and all samples are resized to 32x32 prior to preprocessing. Since the dataset consistsof color (RGB) images the algorithm computes the index of each channels and returns the average.
