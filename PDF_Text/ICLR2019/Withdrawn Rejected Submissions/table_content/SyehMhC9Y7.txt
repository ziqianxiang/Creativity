Table 1: We evaluate different path planning methods based on two CARLA environments:Town01, which each method was trained on; and Town02: a test environment.
Table 2: Incorporating a pothole cost enables our method to avoid potholesApproach	Successes	Pothole hits	Wrong lane	Off roadOur method without pothole cost, Town01	9/10	177/230	0.06%	0.00%Our method with pothole cost, Town01	9/10	10/230	1.53%	0.06%Our method without pothole cost, Town02	8/10	82/154	1.03%	0.30%Our method with pothole cost, Town02	7/10	35/154	1.53%	0.11%in the data. Our method performs the best under all metrics, far exceeding the success and comfortmetrics of imitation learning, and far exceeding the lane-obeyance and comfort metrics of MBRL.
Table 3: Our method is able to ignore decoy waypoints in most planning rounds: it can executedozens to hundreds of planning rounds without decoy waypoints derailing it. Our method is alsorobust to waypoints on the wrong side of the road.
