Table 1: Comparison between methods with the dis-entanglement metrics in (Kim & Mnih, 2018; East-wood & Williams, 2018). Our modelâ€™s scores areobtained from 32 random seeds, with a peak scoreof (0.91, 0.78). The baseline scores except InfoGANare referred to (Esmaeili et al., 2018).

Table 3: The hyperparameter settings for IB-GAN in all experiments.
Table 4: The base architecture for IB-GAN. See Table 3 for hyperparameter setting.
Table 5: The base architecture for InfoGAN. All hyperparameters are the same with those of IB-GAN except that z_dim=10.
