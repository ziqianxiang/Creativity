Table 1: Classification accuracy (%) of the baselines and our method on the test split of MNIST 5-9.
Table 2: Results of GradMix using different β and γ when k = 3. Numbers indicate the test accuracy(%) on MNIST 5-9 (averaged across 10 runs). The ensemble of the top three models is used to createpseudo-labels.
Table 3: Results of GradMix w/ hard label using different number of pre-trained models for ensemble.
Table 4: Classification accuracy (%) of the baselines and our method on the test split of UCF101. Wereport the mean accuracy of each method across two runs with different randomly sampled V .
