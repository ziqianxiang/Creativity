Table 1: RQ1: Validation of the semantic hypothesis by comparing video modelings on semanticrelatedness. We use model Mp (0,1,0). Correlation results are given in the form PSpearman/ρpearson.
Table 2: RQ2: Influence of visual hypotheses on the structure of the representation space.
Table 3: Qualitative analysis: finding the nearest neighbor of a given query in the textual space.
Table 4: RQ2,3: Semantic relatedness and classification performances. M(αT ) stands forM(αT , 0.1, 1). Note that, in all models, sentence vectors have the same dimension (2400).
Table 5: Model performances on COCO cross-modal retrieval task. R@k is the recall at k metric.
