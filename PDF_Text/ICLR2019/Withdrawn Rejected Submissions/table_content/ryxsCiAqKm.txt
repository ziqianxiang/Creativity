Table 1: Chemical (left five columns) and social (right three columns) graph classification results(accuracy in %). Multigraph ChebNet obtains better results by leveraging two types of edges: an-notated and learned, whereas all other models use only annotated edges. *We implemented MoNet,GCN and ChebNet. To make a fair comparison to Multigraph ChebNet, we use the same net-work architectures, batch-normalization, global max pooling and node degree features (for the socialdatasets). For MoNet, coordinates are defined using node degrees as in Monti et al. (2017). The topresult across all methods for each dataset is underlined and bolded, second from the top is bolded.
Table 2: Image classification results. *Compared to tne implementation of ChebNet in Defferrardet al. (2016); Monti et al. (2017), our implementation has GMP without any pooling between con-volutional layers, BN, a different learning rate and filter order K. R is the number of relation types.
Table 3: Dataset statistics and graph network architectures. For chemical and social datasets thesestatistics can also be found in Kersting et al. (2016) along with the datasets themselves. N - numberof nodes in a graph. GC - graph convolution layer, FC - fully connected layer, D - dropout.
