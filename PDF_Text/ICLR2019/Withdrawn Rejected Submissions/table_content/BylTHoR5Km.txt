Table 1: Accuracy and fairness (∆(e2o) and ∆(e5o)) of several traditional classifiers. DNN is the baselineused to benchmark our neural network based representation learning models.
Table 2: Evaluation results of our representation learning models. The ”age-indep” prefix are re-placed with ”*” in model names. age-indep-simple and age-indep-autoencoder have better disentan-glement scores, while the rest two models could have better accuracy.
Table 3: Table of values showing statistics of a trivial binary classifier.
