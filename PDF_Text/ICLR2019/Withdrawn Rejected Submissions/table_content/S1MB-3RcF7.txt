Table 1: Number of covered modes and reverseKL divergence for stacked MNIST.
Table 2: Generator’s architecture.
Table 3: Discriminator’s architecture.
Table 4: Best FID obtained for each approach on 3 independent runs. FID is computed on 1000generated images after every epoch.
Table 5: Scores of different methods measure on generated CIFAR-10 samples. DCGAN scores areused as reference values, and results report are the ratio betWeen given model and DCGAN scores.
Table 6: Comparison between different GANs with 1 and 24 discriminators in terms of minimumFID-ResNet obtained during training, and FLOPs and memory consumption for a complete train step.
Table 7: Evaluation of the effect of adding discriminators on a DCGAN-like model trained onCIFAR-10. Results reach the same level as the best reported for the given architecture when themultiple-discriminator setting is added and the normalization layers are removed from discriminators.
