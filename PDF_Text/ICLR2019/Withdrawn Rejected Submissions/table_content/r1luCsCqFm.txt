MNIST consists 70,000 training images of hand-written images or size 28* 28. 10,000 among them is served as testing set. For MNIST dataset, we pre-process the imageswith global normalization. CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 are datasets with 32 * 32 images, with 10 and100 classes respectively. Both datasets consist of 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.
