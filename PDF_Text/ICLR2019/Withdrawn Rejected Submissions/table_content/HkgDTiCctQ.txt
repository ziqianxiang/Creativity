Table 1: Performance comparison between FitNet, fine-tuning (Li et al., 2016), FSKD with student-nets fromfilter pruning of VGG-16 with scheme-A/B on CIFAR-10. "Full fine-tuning" uses full training data.
Table 2: Performance comparison between FSKD, FitNet and fine-tuning (Liu et al., 2017) on different networkstructures obtained by network slimming with 100 samples randomly selected from CIFAR-10 training set.
Table 3: Performance comparison between FSKD, FitNet and fine-tuning (Liu et al., 2017) on different networkstructures obtained by network slimming with 500 samples randomly selected from CIFAR-100 training set.
Table 4: Performance of FSKD on different student nets obtained by network decoupling VGG-16 and ResNet-18 With different parameters T on ImageNet dataset. â€œ*" here means that parameters from FC-layer are notcounted, only those from conv-layers are counted, since decoupling only handles the conv-layers.
