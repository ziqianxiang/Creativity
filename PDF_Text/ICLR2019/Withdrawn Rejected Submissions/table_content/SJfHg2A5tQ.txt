Table 1: Top-1 and top-5 accuracies (in percentage) on CIFAR-10, using Manhattan regularizationfunction (4) with AlexNet and VGG.
Table 2: Top-1 and top-5 accuracies (in percentage) on ImageNet dataset, of different combinationsof the proposed technical novelties on different architectures.
Table 3: Comparison of top-1 and top-5 accuracies of our method BNN+ with BinaryNet, XNOR-Net and ABC-Net on ImageNet, summarized from Table 2. The results of BNN, XNOR, & ABC-Netare reported from the corresponding papers (Rastegari et al., 2016; Hubara et al., 2016; Tang et al.,2017). Results for ABC-NET on AlexNet were not available, and so is not reported.
