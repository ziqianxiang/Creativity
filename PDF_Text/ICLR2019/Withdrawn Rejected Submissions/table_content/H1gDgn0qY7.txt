Table 1: Details of MNIST case shown in Figure 2. Upper table shows the average l2 distancebetween images from MNIST dataset and between images from the 5 optimized samples. The lowertable shows the class accuracy (if it is a “7”) of 2000 random interpolation of 5 generated samplesand their top class probabilities.

(a) shows samples generated from a home theater that sharefeature collision with a jeep. (b) shows samples generated from a Blenheim Spaniel that sharefeature collision with a goldfish.

Table 4: Quantitative results corresponding to Figures 8 and 9. The top table shows that the averagedistance between different corners of the polytope is not much less than the average distance betweentwo random images from the dataset (ImageNet), which demonstrates that the polytope is not small.
Table 5: Percentage of points from a similarly sized ball centred at the centroid of the polytope thatare classified as the target class.
