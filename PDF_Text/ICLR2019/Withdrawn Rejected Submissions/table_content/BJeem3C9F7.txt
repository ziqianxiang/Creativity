Table 3: 3D-IQTT quantitative results. The test accuracy of the 3D-IQ test task show that the CNNbaselines struggle to solve this task Pix2scene is able to understand the underlying 3D structure ofthe images and solve the task. The results show that although our model performs better than thebaselines, we are still lagging behind the human level.
