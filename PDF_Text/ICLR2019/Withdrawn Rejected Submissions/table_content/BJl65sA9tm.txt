Table 1: The mean and standard error of total returns over 5 trials for N ∈ {100,300,500} and K = 1000. The total returns are computed as the area under learningcurves over 10000 update iteration divided by 10000. The best two methods in terms of the largest mean value are in boldface. For MM-GAIL The best value ofM-GAIL and Z√-GAIL are used as λ = 0.5 and ω = 0.01.
Table 2: The mean and standard error of final average returns over 5 trials for N ∈ {100, 300, 500} and K = 1000. The final average returns are computed asaverage returns obtained from the last 500 update iteration. The best two methods for each row in terms of the largest mean value are in boldface.
Table 3: The mean and standard error of total average returns over 5 trials for N ∈ {1000,100000} and K = 2000. The total average returns are computed as thearea under learning curves over 10000 update iteration divided by 10000. The best two methods in terms of the largest mean value are in boldface.
Table 4: The mean and standard error of final average returns over 5 trials for N ∈ {1000,100000} and K = 2000. The final average returns are computed asaverage returns obtained from the last 500 update iteration. The best two methods for each row in terms of the largest mean value are in boldface.
