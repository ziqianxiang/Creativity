Table 1: Testing or training accuracies when trained on training data with real or random labels. Thenumbers without parentheses are the percentage accuracies on the testing data when networks aretrained with real labels. The numbers enclosed in parentheses are the accuracies on the training datawhen networks are trained with random labels. The mean accuracy after five independent trials isreported. This suggests that OLE-GRSVNet outperforms conventional DNNs on the testing datawhen trained with real labels. Moreover, unlike conventional DNNs, OLE-GRSVNet refuses tomemorize the training data when trained with random labels.
