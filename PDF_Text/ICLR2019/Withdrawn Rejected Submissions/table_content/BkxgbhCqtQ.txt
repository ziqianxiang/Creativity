Table 1: SGR coverage results on Fashion MNIST. We present coverage percentage of the testdataset for three pre-determined risk-guarantees (one per column), where higher coverage is better,as well as negative log-likelihood and overall accuracy. The results indicate that SQUAD providescompetitive uncertainty, especially at low-risk guarantees. Bayesian approximations via deep en-sembles improve coverage all over the board, and for SQUAD in particular. When SGR can notguarantee the required risk level at high probability, 0% coverage is reported.

Table 2: SQUAD exhibits strong performance on notMNIST using the optimal hyperparametersfound for fashionMNIST.
Table 3: Results on SVHN indicate that the quantization scheme imposed by SQUAD models mighthinder performance, but that this is effectively compensated by the SQUAD-factorized variant usinga larger amount of bins. Even with T = 4 MC samples at test time, SQUAD performs well.
