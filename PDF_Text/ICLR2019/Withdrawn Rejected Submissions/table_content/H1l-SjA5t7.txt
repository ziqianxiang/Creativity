The y-axis indicates 10 groundtruth labels and the x-axis indicates 30 predicting clusters (re-arranged). The darker the box the moredata points assigned to the cluster. Each ground truth identity is represented by approximately threeclusters. Interestingly, digit ”1” uses 7 clusters which is much more than other digit classes. Thisis likely to be the results of distractors in images with digit ”1” present. There is a clear confusionbetween digit ”5” and ”6” which are sharing some of the clusters.
