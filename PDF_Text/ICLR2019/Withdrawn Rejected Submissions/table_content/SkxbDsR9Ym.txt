Table 1: Score functions proposed in selected prior work on KGE. Entity embeddings h, t ∈ Rdare vectors in all models, except in ComplEx where h, t ∈ Cd. Here, X'“ denotes either '1 or '2norm of the vector x. In ComplEx, X is the elementwise complex conjugate, and(•,•,•)denotes thecomponent-wise multi-linear inner-product.
