Dealing with asimilar application of tap-in logs forecasting, Roos et al. (2016) propose a Bayesian network butperforms slightly worse than the average baseline. Indeed, the considered series are very stationaryand heavily depend on the context.

Spatial embeddingsefficiently replace the very costly architecture based on S different RNN and use much less param-eters. Indeed, the Spatial GRU contains 434,961 parameters, versus 9,207,297 for the UnivariateGRU. These first results strengthen the hypothesis that context can be efficiently learned.
