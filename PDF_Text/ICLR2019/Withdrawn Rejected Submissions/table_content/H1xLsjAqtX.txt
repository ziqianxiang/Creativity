Table 1: Test performance and overall speedup on the Test set. Our reported speedup refers to fullpipeline (selection + classification) test-time in comparison with the baseline classifier. LSTM-jump and Skim-RNN use a different baseline classifier, and we report the difference in accuracy inparentheses. We report the best result of models tuned on the Dev set. All results are the averageof 3 runs. For each classifier in the table, our framework has two rows of results. First one (toprow) denotes the best speedup performance and the second one (bottom row) denotes the best textaccuracy achieved by our framework. Best performance and best speed-up are boldfaced.
Table 2: ExamPleS of the WE selector outPut on AGNewS. Bold wordS are SeleCted by the se-lector, while the remainder are filtered out. Although wordS like “during an” Seem unimPortant,aPPearing in PhraSeS like “bomb exPloded during an IndePendenCe Day Parade” (World-NewS) and“undefeated during an entire SeaSon” (SPortS-NewS), Provide a hint to underStand the SentenCeS.
