Table 1: Model Dimensions.
Table 2: UnsUPervised Parsing. f indicates trained to optimize NLI task.We use the max unlabeledbinary F1 across runs for PRPN-UP 2, PRPN-LM, and DIORA. F1 was calculated using the parsetrees provided by Htut et al. (2018) and all results in the upper portion of the table were copied fromHtut et al. (2018). +PP refers to post-processing heuristic to remove trailing punctuation explainedin Section 3.1.
Table 3: Segment recall from WSJ seperated by phrase type. The 10 most frequent phrase types areshown. Highest value in each row is bolded.
Table 4: Dendogram purity, P@10, P@100, and MAP for labeled chunks from CoNLL-2000 andCoNLL 2012 datasets. For both metrics, higher is better. The top value in each column is bolded, oritalicized if it is better than our model.
