Table 1: We use ground truth boxes at test time and compare the 3D prediction performance of the methods.
Table 2: We report the mean Average Precision (mAP) values for the detection setting for SUNCG. In eachcolumn, we vary the criteria used to determine a true positive. This helps us analyze the relative contributionof each component (translation, rotation, scale) to the final performance.
Table 3: We study the effect of combining the unary and relative predictions at various stages. The multi-task model does not combine them, whereas the next two models combine them either at train or test time. Ourmethod that jointly optimizes these predictions (and their combination) at both train and test time shows thebiggest improvement.
Table 4: We report the mean Average Precision (mAP) values for the detection setting for NYU. Note that thethreshold for scale is different from the one used in SUNCG Table 2. Added after reviews8Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 20195	Discussion And Future WorkWe proposed a method to incorporate relationship based reasoning in the form to relative poseestimates for the task of 3D scene inference. While this allowed us to significantly improve overexisting approaches that reason independently across objects, numerous challenges still remain tobe addressed. In our approach, we only leveraged pairwise relations among the objects in a scene,and it would be interesting to pursue incorporating higher order relations. We also relied on asynthetic dataset with full 3D supervision to train our prediction networks, thereby limiting directapplicability to datasets without 3D supervision. Towards overcoming this, it might be desirable tocombine our approach with parallel efforts in the community to use 2D reprojection losses (Garget al., 2016) or leverage domain adaptation techniques (Hoffman et al., 2017).
