Table 1: Model performances in terms of different performance metrics: mean AUC, mean F1 scoreand number of tasks (assays) that can be predicted with an AUC better than 0.9, 0.8, and 0.7. Thecolumns AUC and F1 report the average AUC and F1 and its standard deviation across the 209prediction tasks. CNNs operating on full high-resolution images significantly outperform SC-CNNwhich operates on cell-centric crops and the FNN operating on pre-computed features. End-to-endCNN models perform on par. Performance values marked in bold indicate that the best performingmethod does not significantly outperform the respective method.
