Table 1: Comparison to the benchmark presented by [15] of approaches that make use of generativememory. Joint training (JT) represents the the performance of the discriminator trained in non-incremental fashion. Performance of DGM is presented after incremental learning of 5 and 10classes for MNIST, SVHN and CIFAR10 datasets.
