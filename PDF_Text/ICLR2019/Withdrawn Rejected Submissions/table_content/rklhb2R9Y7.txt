Table 1: Comparison of different imitation rewards. Each method assumes a different input for the discrim-inator. GAIL considers action-state pairs and is shown only for reference. The following methods assume,respectively, consecutive pairs of states, a single state only, a pair with a given state and random previous state,and all possible pairs of states containing a given state. Each method is responsible for an imitation reward. InRTGD, œÅ(t) returns a random integer smaller than t. In ATD, D* is a clamped version of D that never returnsa value smaller than the average of all states.
