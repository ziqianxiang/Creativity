Table 2: Volumetric MNIST: L2 loss be-tween the translation (rows 2-5 on figure 6)and ground truth videos (last row).
Table 1: MNIST video colorization: L2 loss between masks ofground truth and translated images, mean intensity of the digit andstandard deviation of the digit color intensity.
Table 3: Human evaluation of generated GTA segmentation-to-video, CT-to-MRI and MRI-to-CT translations. We report proba-bilities of users preferring each method over other methods, andprobabilities of preferring a method over ground truth (below statis-tical significance for GTA). Last row shows bootstrap estimate ofthe variance and is similar among all methods.
Table 4: Per-frame pixel accuracy of video-to-segmentation mapping. All proposedmethods outperformed the frame-level base-line (random) on both slower and fastervideos. With number of learnable parametersproportional to the size of input, 3D modeloutperformed all other methods.
