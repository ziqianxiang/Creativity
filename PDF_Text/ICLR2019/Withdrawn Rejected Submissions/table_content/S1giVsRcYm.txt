Table 1: Comparison between our algorithm, termed ESSR, and R-Max, E3, and MBIE. Thenumbers reported for R-Max, E3, and MBIE are an estimate obtained from the histograms presentedby Strehl & Littman (2008). The performance of our algorithm is the average over 100 runs. A 95%confidence interval is reported between parentheses.
Table 2: Performance of the proposed algorithm, DQNeMMC+SR, compared to various agents on the“hard exploration” subset of Atari 2600 games. The DQN results reported are from Machado et al.
