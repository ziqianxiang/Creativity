Table 1: Mutual classification accuracy on the adversarial images resulting from attacking ResNet-56 withthe softmax and the WNLL activation functions.
Table 2: Testing accuracy of ResNet-56 on the adversarial/TVM CIFAR-10 dataset. The testingaccuracy without any defense are in red italic; and the results with all three defenses are in boldface.
