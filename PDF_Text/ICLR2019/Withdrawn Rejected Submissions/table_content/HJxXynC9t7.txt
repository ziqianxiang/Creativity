Table 1: Relationship between model performance andthe smallest ordinal number of singular values.
Table 2: Performances of 30 AtariWe use same network architecture and hyper-parameters as games. Average last reward is theMnih et al. (2015). We run 30 Atari games (first 30 in alphabet- average model testing reward afterical order) and run each game for 200M frames. All socres are training over 5 runs.
