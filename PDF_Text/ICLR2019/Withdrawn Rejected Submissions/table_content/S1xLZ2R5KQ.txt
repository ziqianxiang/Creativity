The first three kindsof degradation are relatively simple. They are 7× downsampling, making a 14×14 square hole in thecenter of the image, and adding Gaussian white noise with a standard deviation of 1.0, respectively.

MSE(X, F(X, Ω)) is a measureof how accurately a restored image can be degraded back to its input, and MSE(x, X) andMSSSIM(x, X) (Wang et al., 2003) are measures of the difference between the restoration andthe ground truth. We can find out that our general image restoration method is better than the base-line method. The nearest neighbor algorithm cannot use the information of the probability densityof images well, and that is the major disadVantage compared to our method.
