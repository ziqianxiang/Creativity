Table 1: Comparison of our method with the ABS model. The entries in the table show the averageL2 norm and the robustness at a threshold of = 1.5. Our method is tested over 1000 randomlyselected images from the MNIST test set. Histograms of the L2 norms of the different attacks can befound in appendix B. WB and BB indicates white box and black box attack methods, respectively.
