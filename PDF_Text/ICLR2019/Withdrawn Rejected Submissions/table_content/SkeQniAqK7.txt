Table 1: Trained RBM ParametersRBM Hidden Units Training Time (minutes)1 bit Adder	6	12 bit Adder	28	13.54 bit Adder	64	1338 bit Adder	96	20116 bit Adder	128	32132 bit Adder	192	13000 (approx)1 bit Multiplier	4	12 bit Multiplier	12	464 bit Multiplier	64	6558 bit Multiplier	96	2794The training time tends to increase with the number of bits in the adder or multiplier due to boththe size of the data set (which increases exponentially with the number of bits) and the numberof hidden and visible units (which both increase approximately linearly). The slower increase oftraining time for adders after the 4 bit adder is due to the usage of GPUs to increase the parallelism.
