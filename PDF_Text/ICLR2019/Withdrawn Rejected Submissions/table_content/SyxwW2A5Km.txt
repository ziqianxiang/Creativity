Table 1: Testing results on the Criteo dataset. We conduct two versions of our Attention-Net, i.e.,with and without using the top-k restriction. The largest AUC and the least Logloss are in bold.
Table 2: Testing results on the Avzau dataset.
Table 3: Variations on the Attention-Net. Unlisted values are identical to those of the base model. Allmetrics are evaluated on the Avzau dataset. l, d, h, k, and Î» denote self-attention layers, embeddingdimension, heads, top-k, and the regularization parameter, respectively.
Table 4: Description of features used in Figure 2. As all features are cryptographic, we only knowthe name of the field and the hash value of each feature. We measure the corresponding CTR andcompute the complementarity for the combinations.
