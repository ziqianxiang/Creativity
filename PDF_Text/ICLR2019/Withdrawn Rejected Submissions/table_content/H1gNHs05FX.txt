Table 1: Negative log likelihood on the held out test set. Asterisk (*) denotes simulation; KNR: {ketoacidosis,neuropathy, retinopathy}; H. Poission: homogeneous Poisson; Time-invariant: Fourier prediction at time t = 0;Nowcast: 16-step history as nowcast features. LSTM1: Lipton et al. (2016), best of zero-imputation or last-value carry forward, with missingness indicators; LSTM2 : LSTM with WRN preprocessing; WRN: waveletreconstruction network; PPL: with permute pool layer. Best performer in bold.
