Table 1: Summary of the adversarial attacks on DRL systems, categorized based on our proposedtaxonomy. The name reflects the category of the attack method. For example, obs-nn-wb meansattack on observation using neural network based white-box attack. The attack methods we proposedare highlighted using bold text. “Arch.,” “Param.,” and “Query” indicate whether the attack requiresknowledge of the policy network’s architecture, parameters and whether it needs to query the policynetwork.

For HalfCheetah, Hopper and TORCS, these input and output dimensionsare 32, 20, and 10, respectively.

Following the notation in Corollary 1, we use P(θ) to denote the probability that the to-be-estimated gradient magnitude of a dimension is no less than θ for some iteration. Initially, we sample13Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2019k points uniformly. We have that out of the k sampled points, there are P (β + θ) ∙ k points whosegradient magnitudes are no less than β + θ. Similarly, We have P(θ) ∙ k points where the gradientmagnitudes are no less than θ. At the second iteration, we start from the P(θ) ∙ k points. Accordingto the assumptions, we have (1 - q)P(β + θ) ∙ k points whose gradient magnitudes are no lessthan β + θ. Similarly, we have q ∙ P(β + θ) ∙ k + (1 - q)[P(θ) - P(β + θ)]k points with gradientmagnitudes in the range [θ, β + θ]. Now in tth iteration, we denote at as the number of points in thisiteration with gradient magnitudes no less than β + θ and bt as the number of points in this iterationwith gradient magnitudes in range [θ, β + θ]. The recurrence relationship is as follows:at = (I - q) ∙ at-1,	bt = q ∙ at-1 + (I - q) ∙ bt-1,	(3)
