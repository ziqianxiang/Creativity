Table 1: Test classification error (%) of sFEED on CIFAR-100 dataset. The model’s scores on theScratch* column are the same as the scores reported on their original papers, and those on theScratch column are from our implementation. The parameters are counted in Millions.
Table 2: Test classification error (%) for sFEED on CIFAR-100 using the paraphraser.
Table 3: Validation classification error (%) of sFEED on Imagenet dataset. The model’s scores on theScratch* column are the same as the scores reported on the Pytorch implementation.
Table 4: Test classification error (%) of pFEED on CIFAR-100 dataset. The numbers in Scratchcolumn are from our implementation. The KD column is our reproduction of KD, and the Ens columnis the ensemble score of 5 models, each of which uses purely cross-entropy loss.
Table 5: Validation classification error (%) of PFEED on Imagenet dataset.
Table 6: Test classification error (%) of the models on CIFAR-100 dataset. The errors listed for eachmethods are the numbers from their original papers, without reproducing on our own. The parametersare counted in Millions.
