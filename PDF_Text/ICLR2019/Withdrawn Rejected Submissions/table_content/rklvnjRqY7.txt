In particular, the reconstructoris trained while holding the obfuscator fixed, and then the obfuscator is trained while keeping thereconstructor and classifier fixed. In this way, the obfuscator can counteract the any improvementsin PSNR from the reconstructor. Finally, the whole procedure is repeated until convergence or themaximum number of epochs is reached.
