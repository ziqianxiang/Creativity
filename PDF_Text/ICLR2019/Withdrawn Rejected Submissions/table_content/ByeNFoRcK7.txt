Table A11: Mean and standard deviation of FID values before and after excluding 15% of outliersacross 50 independent runs. For the four datasets (from left to right), the results are attained after 20,20, 100 and 40 epochs, respectively, except for the PA results marked with (*). For (*) the trainingtime is not constrained by the previously specified number of epochs, see A.5 for details.
