Table 1: Quantitive evaluation of methods in the goal-directed navigation tasks in CoRL test. Thetable reports the percentage of success rate of finishing corresponding task in different condition.
Table 2: Quantitive evaluation of original proposal which uses segmentataion and depth maps intraining phase and compared method which doesn’t use. Results shows that when multi-knowldgeis not used for training, the success rate drops hugely in the testing town under untained weathers.
Table 3: Quantitive evaluation of original proposal and fine-tune method which doens’t freeze theperception module’s weights during training the driving module. Results shows that the success rateof the fine-tune method drops dramaticaly in the testing town under untained weathers.
