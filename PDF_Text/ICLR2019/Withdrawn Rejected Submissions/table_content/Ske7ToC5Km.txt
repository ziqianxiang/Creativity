Table 1: Running time (in minutes) of G2S-RNN and baseline heuristics for minimum vertex coveron random Erdos-Renyi graphs. The WL heuristic could not be run on graphs of size greater than200 due the large number of serial computations involved which makes it prohibitively slow. OOMrefers to out-of-memory.
