Table 2: Variational Framework vs. Generative Modles5.0.1 Link Prediction AnalysisSection 5.1 and Section 5.2 explores the predictions made by Latent Information Model with ComplExscoring function, trained with Bernoulli sampling to estimate the ELBO on the WN18RR dataset,then Section 5.3 will analyse the values of embeddings learnt for this task. Lastly, Section 5.3.1will perform an extrinsic evaluation on learnt embedding representations for the more accessible tointerpret Nations dataset.
