Table 1: Comparison of Spearman correlations on the STS datasets between the two similaritymeasures we introduce in the text. The average is weighted according to dataset size.
Table 2: Comparison of Spearman correlations on the STS datasets between our best model(Diag+AIC) and SIF,WMD and MWV for three different word vectors. The average is weightedaccording to dataset size.
Table 3: Comparison of Spearman correlations on the STS datasets between our best model(Diag+AIC) and SIF+PCA for three different word vectors.
Table 4: Spearman correlations using GloVe embeddings and Gaussian likelihood. The AIC andBIC use a diagonal covariance matrix, while the Bayes Factor uses a full covariance matrix.
Table 5: Comparison of Spearman correlations on the STS datasets between the TIC and AIC cor-rections for the diagonal covariance Gaussian and vMF likelihood functions.
