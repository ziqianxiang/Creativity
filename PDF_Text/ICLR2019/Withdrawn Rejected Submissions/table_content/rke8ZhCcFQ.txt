Training a newnetwork is time consuming, and changes between updates are not significant, thus people just retrainthe network after certain amount of time. Figure 3 shows the difference in classification accuracywithout (evasion) and with (poisoning) retraining including the fake data in the process. The GCNis retained with learning rate 0.01, 50 epochs after the data has been modified. We run GCN withdifferent random seeds. The results show that both evasion and poisoning can effectively reduce theaccuracy of GCN, and the symmetric normalization is more robust under poisoning attacks.
