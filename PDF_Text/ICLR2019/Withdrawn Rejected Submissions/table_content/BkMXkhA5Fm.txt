Table 1: Groups of sensors represented in the X-Plane dataset.
Table 2: Different kinds of failures (top) and perturbations (bottom) in the X-Plane dataset.
Table 3: Sample images from the dataset.
Table 4: Evaluation results; left to right: model name and description, whether it uses images, latentdimension d, mean inferenCe time t (s), MSE for regression tasks normalized to the MEAN baseline(lower is better), QEDR sCores (SeCtion 5.1).
Table 5: Images for qualitative evaluation of the models and regression errors; d = 128 in all models.
