Table 1: Results on CIFAR. DenseNet-40-12 and DenseNet-100-12 are selected as the backbone CNN on CIFAR datasetand our algorithm is applied to the two models. The FLOPs, parameters and test error of the DenseNet with LWP arecompered with the vanilla DenseNet and the neural network architecture with other pruned methods.
Table 2: Results on ImageNet. DenseNet-121-32 is selected as the backbone CNN on ImageNet. It can be furthercompressed even if its parameters are already quite efficient.
