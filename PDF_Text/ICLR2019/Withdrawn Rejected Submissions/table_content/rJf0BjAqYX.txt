To be specific, we improve the performance of studentnetwork by about 1.6% and 4.2% absolutely, and reduce the relative error by 27.6% and 16.4%,respectively. The training and testing curves of all the experiments can be found in Fig. 3. All thetransfer methods converge faster than student network. Among them, KD+NST is the fastest.
