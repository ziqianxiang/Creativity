Table 1: Characteristics of three citation datasetsDataset	Vertices	Edges	Classes	FeaturesCiteseer	3327	4732	6	3703Cora	2708	5429	7	1433Pubmed 19717	443383	500We use the preprocessed data of Kipf & Welling (2016) (see https://github.com/tkipf/gae). It selectsonly a fraction of the original edges and proposes specific choices for training, validating and testingedges. The validation and test sets contain 5% and 10% of the total number of links, respectively.
Table 2: Results for link prediction using common citation datasets. Only the results of SCAT andVGAE for Cora and Citeseer were done on our machine. The rest are from Kipf & Welling (2016).
Table 3: Graph generation comparison of SCAT and other algorithms using the QM9 dataset. Valuesare reported in percentages. The results of the other methods are taken from De Cao & Kipf (2018);Simonovsky & Komodakis (2018) since their codes are not publicly available. We remark thatSCAT (conditioned) and SCAT (unconditioned) report results trained on 90k subset of data, whileSCAT with padding report results trained on the complete data; all comparisons are according to10k generated samples.
