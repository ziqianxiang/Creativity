Table 1: (a). Results on SNLI. The LSTM encoder and SPIINN-PI refer to Bowman et al. (2016).
Table 2: (a) Results on TREC question type classification. (b) BLEU scores of different modelson Chinese→English and English→Vietnamese machine translation. The results of neural noisychannel, Standford NMT, and neural phrase-based MT are from Yu et al. (2017); Luong & Manning(2015); Huang et al. (2018), respectively. We report the average of 5 results for the baselines andour models; * indicates the difference between this score and the score from the standard attentionbaseline is significant according to an approximate randomisation test (Clark et al., 2011).
