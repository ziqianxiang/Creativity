Table 1: Summary of RMSE values for the free simulation results on test data. Best values per data-set are bold. All values are calculated on the original data, unless the data-set Power Load, wherethe RMSE is shown for the normalized data. Here we have full recurrence for our methods, DRGP-Nystrom and GP-LSTM, LSTM, RNN and with auto-regressive part (first layer) for all other GPs.

We chose a large numberof data-sets in training size going from 250 to 12500 data-points in order to show the performancefor a wide range. We will begin with the smallest, the Drive data-set, which was first introducedby Wigren (2010). It is based on a system which has two electric motors that drive a pulley using aflexible belt. The input is the sum of voltages applied to the motors and the output is the speed ofthe belt. The data-set Dryer7 8 describes a system where air is fanned through a tube and heated atan inlet. The input is the voltage over the heating device (a mesh of resistor wires). The output isthe air temperature measured by a thermocouple. The third data-set Ballbeam78 describes a systemwhere the input is the angle of a beam and the output the position of a ball. Actuator is the name ofthe fourth data-set, which was described by Sjoberg et al.(1995) and which stems from an hydraulicactuator that controls a robot arm, where the input is the size of the actuatorâ€™s valve opening and the
