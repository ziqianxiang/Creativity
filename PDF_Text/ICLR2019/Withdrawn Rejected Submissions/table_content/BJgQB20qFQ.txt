Table 1: Experimental results of the job scheduling problem on the test set. For each approach, wereport the average slowdown of the jobs with different number of resource types D.
Table 2: Statistics of the dataset for expression simplification.
Table 3: Experimental results of the Halide expression simplification task on the test set. Note thatthe Z3 solver can perform rewriting steps that are not included in the Halide ruleset.
Table 4: Experimental results of the job scheduling problem using initial schedules with differentaverage slow down. The number of resource types D = 20. We also include the results from Table 1for reference.
