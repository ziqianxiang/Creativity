Table 1: Comparison between our method and baseline methods. The BNN is trained on NIHand tested on all three other datasets. Then, the segmentation results are evaluated by 4 methodsautomatically without using ground truth. Of the 4 methods, ours achieves the highest accuracy andthe highest correlation between predicted Dice score and real Dice score.
Table 2: Different algorithms tested on different datasets are evaluated by our alarm system. Withouttuning parameters, the system can be directly applied to evaluate other segmentation algorithmsâ€¢	Multi-atlas Labeling Challenge (MLC). The multi-atlas labeling challenge provides 50(30 Training +20 Testing) abdomen CT scans randomly selected from a combination of anongoing colorectal cancer chemotherapy trial and a retrospective ventral hernia study 2.
