The performance metric to optimize is the binary F1score. The purpose of this experiment is to demonstrate that Algorithm 1 can match the performanceof a provably optimal, yet considerably more expensive algorithm that optimizes the F1 score. Weuse a three-layer fully-connected network in our experiments, with batch normalization enabled.
