While non-LSTM drawers achieve roughly equalpixelwise loss, LSTM drawers are more consistent in segmenting digits into concrete curves. In adrawer lasting twenty timesteps, there is a noticeable increase in pixelwise performance, howeverthe curves produced are bended, akin to sketching with tiny strokes rather than smooth motions.
