Table 1: Accuracies of the non-adversarial baseline and double/single classifiers models, trained onSNLI and evaluated on target datasets. ∆ = differences between baseline and adversarial models.
Table 2: Results with a stronger adversary in the double-classifier vs. a non-adversarial baseline.
Table 3: Indicator words and the % decrease in the correlation of double (D) and single (S) modelswith the “contradiction” label compared to the non-adversarial baseline.
Table 4: Results of transferring representations to new datasets. Scores are accuracies on the corre-sponding dataset. Left block: test results on target datasets. Right block: test results on SNLI withthe models that performed best on each target dataset. ∆ are differences from the non-adversarialbaseline. In all cases the models are trained on SNLI.
Table 5: Indicator words and how correlated they are with “contradiction” predictions.
