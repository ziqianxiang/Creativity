Table 1: Mean score comparison on baseline methods. We compare EMI with EX2 (Fu et al.,2017), ICM (Pathak et al., 2017), SimHash (Tang et al., 2017), VIME (Houthooft et al., 2016)and TRPO (Schulman et al., 2015). EX2, ICM and TRPO columns are average of 5 seeds runscoherent to Figure 4 and Figure 5. SimHash and VIME results are reported in previous works. Allexploration methods here are implemented based-on TRPO policy. Results of SparseHalfCheetahand SwimmerGather are reported around 5M and 100M time steps respectively. Results of Atarienvironments are reported around 50M time steps.
