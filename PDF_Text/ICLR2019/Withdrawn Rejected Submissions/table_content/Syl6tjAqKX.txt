To achieve that wetested two approaches: fine-tuning and adversarial transfer. In the first case, we have fine-tuned themain network obtained in Stage 1 of Section 4.1 on a new game with frozen Stage 1 BMs, applied toevery pair of games and following Algorithm 1. After that, we tested the performance on previouslyunseen Stage 2 BMs. In adversarial setting we follow the same procedure, but with the use of the

The performance was compared to the results of transferring Stage 2BMs to the best model configuration after Stage 1 from Section 4.1.
