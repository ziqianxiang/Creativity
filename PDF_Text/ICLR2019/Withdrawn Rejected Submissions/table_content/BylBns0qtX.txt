Table 1: Kitti Visual Odometry task. Evaluation of four non-linear filters under five different noiselearning conditions: No learning, learning constant observation noise R, learning heteroscedasticprocess noise Qh, learning constant observation and process noise R + Q, learning constant obser-vation noise and heteroscedastic process noise R + Qh. In each condition, the perception networkwas pretrained offline and finetuned through the filters. We evaluate the models on different trajec-tories with 100 timesteps. As in (Jonschkowski et al., 2018; Haarnoja et al., 2016) we report meanand std of the end-point- error in position and orientation normalized by the distance between startand end point.
Table 2: Planar Pushing task. Evaluation of four non-linear filters under five different noise learningconditions: No learning 1 (with unrealistic noise), No learning 2 (with realistic noise) , learning con-stant observation noise R, learning heteroscedastic process noise Qh, learning constant observationand process noise R + Q, learning constant observation noise and heteroscedastic process noiseR + Qh. Mean and standard deviation of tracking errors on the planar pushing task averaged overfive different initial conditions. Tracking errors are mean squared error in position and orientationof the object averaged over all timesteps in the sequence.
