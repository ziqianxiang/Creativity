The Lagrangian baselines give solutions that satisfythe constraints but with considerable trade-off in accuracy.

The violation is the maximumdifference between the FPR for any given protected group and the overall FPR. For example, in thefirst row, we see that there exists a protected group with a FPR of 0.3482 + 0.1108 = 0.459 by themodel. While our method does not attain the lowest violation, it provides a reasonable trade-off.
