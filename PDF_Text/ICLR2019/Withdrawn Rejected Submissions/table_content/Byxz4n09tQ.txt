Table 1: CIFAR-10 image classification test accuracies for cross-entropy compression with variousteacher and student neural net architectures. GAN-MC outperforms compression on training dataalone and training without compression (‘Student Only’) in all cases. See Sec. 3 for more details.
Table 2: Description of tabular datasets used for random forest GAN-MC.
Table 3: Test accuracy (Higgs) and test AUC (Evergreen and MAGIC) of the learned student inrandom forest compression. Here a forest with 500 trees is compressed into a single decision tree.
Table 4: Inception and Compression Scores for CIFAR-10 images; larger scores should signifyhigher quality images. Inferior data generated by training well-trained GAN for 10 additional epochsusing only the classification objective Lclass (see Sec. 5.2). Inception Score increases for inferiorimages despite evident unrealistic artifacts. Compression Score decreases for inferior images.
