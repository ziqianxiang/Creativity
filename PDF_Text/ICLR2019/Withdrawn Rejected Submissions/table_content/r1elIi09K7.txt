Table 1: Average AUC of 30 runs up to 100% FPR and 10% FPR (the positive label representedinstances from unknown classes and the negative label represented instances from the known classeswhen calculating the AUC). The Underlined average AUC values are higher with statistical Signifi-cance (p-value < 0.05 with a t-test) compared to the values that are not underlined on the same row.
Table 2: Average F-Score of 30 Runs. The Underlined average AUC values are higher with statisticalsignificance (p-value < 0.05 with a t-test) compared to the values that are not underlined on the samerow. The average AUC values in bold are the largest average AUC values in each row.
