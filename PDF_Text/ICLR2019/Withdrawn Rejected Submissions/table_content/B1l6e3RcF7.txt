Table 1: Number of barriers crossed during training of one epoch (450 iterations) for VGG-11 and Resnet-56on CIFAR-10 and MLP on MNIST. We say a barrier is crossed during an update step if there exists a pointinterpolated between the parameters before and after an update which has a loss value higher than the loss ateither points. For most parts of the training, we find that SGD does not cross any significant number of barriers.
