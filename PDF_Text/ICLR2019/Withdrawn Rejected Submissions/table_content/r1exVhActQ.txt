Table 5: Per-layer Resnet-32 architecture. There are 3 main convolutional blocks with downsamplingthrough stride=2 for the first layer of each block. After the convloutional layers, global pooling isapplied on the spatial axes and a fully-connected layer is appended for the output. Each set of rows isa residual block.
