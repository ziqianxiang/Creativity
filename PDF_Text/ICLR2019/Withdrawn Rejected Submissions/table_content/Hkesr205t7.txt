Table 1: Difference in approaches of ZSL.
Table 2: Summary of datasets in our experiments.
Table 3: Results in the GZSL setting. Each of u and s represents class-mean top-1 accuracy (%) on unseen andseen classes and H means the harmonic mean of u and s. We also show the average of H in all datasets.
Table 4: Results in the conventional ZSL setting. We evaluate them by using class-mean top-1 accuracy (%) onunseen classes.
