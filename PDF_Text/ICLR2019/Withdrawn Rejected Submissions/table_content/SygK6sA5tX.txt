Table 4: Basic statistics of the graph classification databasesAppendix E	Technical DetailsThe computation of the scattering features described in Section 3 is based on several design choices,akin to typical architecture choices in neural networks. Most importantly, it requires a choice of1. which statistical moments to use (normalized or unnormalized), 2. the number of wavelet scalesto use (given by J), and 3. the number of moments to use (denoted by Q). The configuration usedfor each dataset in this work is summarized in Table 5, together with specific settings used in thedownstream classification layers, as descibed below.
Table 5: Settings of the geometric scattering classifierSoftware & hardware environment: Geometric scattering and related classification code wereimplemented in Python with TensorFlow. All experiments were performed on HPC environmentusing an intel16-k80 cluster, with a job requesting one node with four processors and two NvidiaTesla k80 GPUs.
