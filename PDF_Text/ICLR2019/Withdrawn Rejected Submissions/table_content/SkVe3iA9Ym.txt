We build our analysis upon the theorem thatthe policy is not dominated if and only if it is optimal under a linear scalarization to connect the setof optimal policy with the simplex of the coefficient vector. In this way, we characterize the range ofthe value function under optimal policies as a convex hull. We further estimate the range via valuelearning on the extreme points and define the suboptimality of a policy as the distance between itscorresponding value function and the range. As a result, we design an efficient algorithm with alinear program to minimize the distance and find the reward mechanism.

The algorithm relies on relatively weak assumptions and does not require any explicitscalarization of the vector-valued reward function. Instead, it leverages the Pareto frontier of thevalue to characterize the set of optimal policies and to measure the optimality of the recorded be-havior. While the algorithm is not relying on the access of policy function nor the dynamics of theenvironment it can be applied to study complex, interactive environments with its historical dataset.
