Table 1: Top-1 accuracy (in %) on MNIST, CIFAR10 and AWA2 in percent. The image features arethe same for both models. For training our model we use a maximum of 4, 6 and 28 binary decisionfor MNIST, CIFAR10 and AWA2 respectively.
Table 2: Zero-shot learning accuracy on AWA2. We compare the accuracy of different side infor-mation, i.e. human annotated attributes and learned attributes (with our model or with Word2Vec).
