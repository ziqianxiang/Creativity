Table 1: Classification accuracy (%) under different attack and defense methods for MNIST andFMNIST. The perturbation ε is in l∞ norm. FBGAN here uses one ten-dimensional categoricalcode and 8 continuous codes. Gray-box attacks only apply to noise-filtering-type defense, and wecompare FBGAN and Defense-GAN under the same setting. For white-box attack, the adversarialtraining with PGD ε = 0.3 is one of the state of the art results. Although better than FBGAN,adversarial training has its limitation: if the attack method is harder than the one used in training(PGD is harder than FGSM), or the perturbation is larger, then the defense may totally fail. FBGANis effective and consistent for any given classifier, regardless of the attack method or perturbation.
