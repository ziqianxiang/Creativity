Table 1: Overview of differences between (Minnen et al., 2018) (s.o.t.a. in MS-SSIM and PSNR), toBPG (previous s.o.t.a. in PSNR) and (Rippel & Bourdev, 2017) (s.o.t.a. in MS-SSIM in 2017, alsoused GANs).
Table 2: We consider the effect of the GAN loss, the distortion losses and the entropy constraint onthe PSNR of the trained model on the Cityscapes dataset.
