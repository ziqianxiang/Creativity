Table 5: Benchmark network architectures. Here, 64C3(1) indicates a convolutional layer with 64output channels and 3 × 3 filters applied with a stride of 1, MP2(1) denotes a max-pooling layerover regions of size 2 × 2 and stride of 1, and 512F C is a fully-connected layer with 512 outputneurons. BN denotes batch-normalization layer. ReLU is used as the activation function.
