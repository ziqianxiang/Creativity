Table 1: ANON subsets by hand-selecting labels.
Table 2: Target datasets for fine-tuning.
Table 3: Transfer learning results with Inception v3. Each row corresponds to a pre-training method.
Table 4: Transfer learning results with AmoebaNet-B.
Table 5: Comparison of ImageNet labels statistics between the same distribution matcher and elasticdistribution matcher for CIFAR-10.
Table 6: Transfer performance on Oxford-IIIT Pets from ANON subsets of the same size (80M) butwith different distribution: Same is the distribution of source dataset labels predicted from targetdataset examples, Uniform is a uniform distribution on all selected labels, and Reverse is a distri-bution obtained by swapping the sampling rates between the highest and the lowest labels from theSame distribution.
