Table 1: Details of the different datasets used in the empirical evaluation: a Toy-Dataset speciallycreated (see details in Section 4.1), MNIST (LeCun & Cortes, 2010), Fashion-MNIST (Xiao et al.,2017), CIFAR-10 (Krizhevsky et al.), STL-10 (Adam Coates, 2011) and the Synthetic Traffic SignsDataset (Moiseev et al., 2013).
Table 2: Inception Scores for different GM-GAN models vs. baselines trained on 2 datasets.
Table 3: Clustering performance of our method on different datasets. Scores are based on clusteringaccuracy (ACC) and normalized mutual information (NMI). Results of a broad range of recent ex-isting solutions are also presented for comparison. The results of alternative methods are the onesreported by the authors in the original papers. Methods marked with (*) are based on our ownimplementation, as we didnâ€™t find any published scores to compare to.
