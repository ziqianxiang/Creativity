MNIST0 and MNIST0-2were mainly generated with the purpose of simulating the situation in Figure 2 (Center), whereanomalies were present in sparse clusters. At the same time, MNISThard and MNISTpca were designedto present similar characteristics to the situation in Figure 2 (Right), where anomalous instances arein sparse regions of the data space.

Figure 7shows the results for Fashion-MNIST0 and Fashion-MNIST0-2, while Figure 8 show the resultsfor Fashion-MNISThard and Fashion-MNISTpca. These figures show similar trends to the ones forMNIST, although algorithms find anomalies in these datasets harder to identify. In one run ofFashion-MNIST0, DAEuai needed several examples to start learning and for Fashion-MNISThard,Classuai takes a long time to start producing better results than Class. Nevertheless, UaiNets arestill much more robust than the underlying networks to different types of anomalies, producing goodresults in all four datasets, even when its underlying network gives weak results on that dataset.
