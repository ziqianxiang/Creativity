Table 2: Results of transductive learning experiments in terms of node classification accuracies onCora, Citeseer, and Pubmed datasets. g-U-Net denotes our proposed graph U-Net model.
Table 3: Comparison of g-U-Nets with and without gPool or gUnpool layers in terms of node clas-Sification accuracy on Cora, Citeseer, and PUbmed datasets.
Table 4: Comparison of g-U-Nets with and without graph connectivity augmentation in terms ofnode classification accuracy on Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed datasets.
Table 5: Comparison of different network depths in terms of node classification accuracy on Cora,Citeseer, and Pubmed datasets. Based on g-U-Net, we try different network depths in terms of thenumber of blocks in encoder and decoder parts.
