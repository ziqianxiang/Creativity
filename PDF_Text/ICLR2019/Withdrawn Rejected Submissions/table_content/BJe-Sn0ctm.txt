Table 1: An example AlgoLisp program (bottom) and its NL specification (left).
Table 2: Percentage of perfectly synthesized programs (i.e., syntactically identical to the targetones) for SAPS configurations trained from scratch and latent vector of length 256. Total numberof trained parameters, in millions, used in each configuration is shown in the most right column.
Table 3: Percentage of perfectly synthesized programs (i.e., syntactically identical to the targetones) for pretrained SAPS configurations. Size of the latent vector given in parentheses. Therightmost two columns show the percentage of programs perfectly reproduced by the correspondingautoencoder (AC) used for pretraining.

Table 6: The effects of modifications of NL specification. The first specification in each group is anoriginal task from the validation set, and those that follow are its modified variants (modificationsmarked in bold). Row 1: Dropping words from the specification until the output program is not cor-rect anymore. Row 2: Modifying a single keyword in the output program. Row 3: Change of entiresubexpression in the output program. Row 4: multiple co-occurring modifications of specification.
