ABSTRACT
We present a probabilistic framework for studying adversarial attacks on discrete
data. Based on this framework, we derive a perturbation-based method, Greedy
Attack, and a scalable learning-based method, Gumbel Attack, that illustrate vari￾ous tradeoffs in the design of attacks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these
methods using both quantitative metrics and human evaluation on various state￾of-the-art models for text classification, including a word-based CNN, a character￾based CNN and an LSTM. As an example of our results, we show that the accuracy
of character-based convolutional networks drops to the level of random selection
by modifying only five characters through Greedy Attack.
1 INTRODUCTION
Robustness to adversarial perturbation has become an extremely important criterion for applications
of machine learning in security-sensitive domains such as spam detection (Stringhini et al., 2010),
fraud detection (Ghosh & Reilly, 1994), criminal justice (Berk & Bleich, 2013), malware detection
(Kolter & Maloof, 2006), and financial markets (West, 2000). Systematic methods for generating
adversarial examples by small perturbations of original input data, also known as “attack,” have
been developed to operationalize this criterion and to drive the development of more robust learning
systems (Dalvi et al., 2004; Szegedy et al., 2013; Goodfellow et al., 2014).
Most of the work in this area has focused on differentiable models with continuous input
spaces (Szegedy et al., 2013; Goodfellow et al., 2014; Kurakin et al., 2016). In this setting, the
proposed attack strategies add a gradient-based perturbation to the original input, resulting in a dra￾matic decrease in the predictive accuracy of the model. This finding demonstrates the vulnerability
of deep neural networks to adversarial examples in tasks like image classification and speech recog￾nition.
We focus instead on adversarial attacks on models with discrete input data, such as text data, where
each feature of an input sample has a categorical domain. While gradient-based approaches are not
directly applicable to this setting, variations of gradient-based approaches have been shown effective
in differentiable models. For example, Li et al. (2015) proposed to locate the top features with
the largest gradient magnitude of their embedding, and Papernot et al. (2016) proposed to modify
randomly selected features of an input through perturbing each feature by signs of the gradient,
and project them onto the closest vector in the embedding space. Dalvi et al. (2004) attacked such
models by solving a mixed integer linear program. Gao et al. (2018) developed scoring functions
applicable for sequence data, and proposed to modify characters of the features selected by the
scoring functions. Attack methods specifically designed for text data have also been studied recently.
Jia & Liang (2017) proposed to insert distraction sentences into samples in a human-involved loop
to fool a reading comprehension system. Samanta & Mehta (2017) added linguistic constraints over
the pool of candidate-replacing words. Cheng et al. (2018) applied a gradient-based technique to
attack sequence-to-sequence models.
We propose a systematic probabilistic framework for generating adversarial examples for models
with discrete input. The framework is a two-stage process, where the key features to be perturbed
are identified in the first stage and are then perturbed in the second stage by values chosen from
a dictionary. We present two instantiations of this framework—Greedy Attack and Gumbel Attack. 1

Figure 1: The left and right figures show the graphical models of the first and second stage respec￾tively. Parameters α, θ and φG are specific to Gumbel Attack (Algorithm 2).
Greedy Attack evaluates models with single-feature perturbed inputs in two stages, while Gumbel
Attack learns a parametric sampling distribution for perturbation. Greedy Attack achieves higher
success rate, while Gumbel Attack requires fewer model evaluations, leading to better efficiency in
real-time or large-scale attacks. Table 1 systematically compares our methods with other methods.
In summary, our contributions in this work are as follows: (1) We propose a general probabilistic
framework for adversarial attacks on models with discrete data. (2) We show that Greedy Attack
achieves state-of-the-art attack rates across various kinds of models. (3) We propose Gumbel Attack
as a scalable method with low model-evaluation complexity. (4) We observe that character-based
models in text classification are particularly vulnerable to adversarial attack.
2 FRAMEWORK
We assume a model in the form of a conditional distribution, Pm(Y | x), for a response Y ,
supported on a set Y, given a realization of an input random variable X = x ∈ Wd
, where
W : = {w0, w1, . . . , wm} is a discrete space such as the dictionary of words or the space of char￾acters. We assume there exists w0 ∈ W that can be taken as a reference point with no contribution
to classification. For example, w0 can be the zero padding in text classification. Let ˜x denote a
perturbation of the input variable x. The goal of the adversarial attack is to turn a given input x
into ˜x through small perturbations, in such a way that Y˜ = 1 given ˜x, where Y˜ is the indicator of
a successful attack: Y˜ | ˜x, x : = 11{arg maxy Pm(y | ˜x) 6 = arg maxy Pm(y | x)}. We restrict the
perturbations to k features of x, and approach the problem through two stages. In the first stage, we
search for the most important k features of x. In the second stage, we search for values to replace
the selected k features:
First stage: xˆ = arg max
a∈S1(x,k)P(Y˜ = 1|a, x), (1)
Second stage: ˜x = arg max
a∈S2(ˆx,x)P(Y˜ = 1|a, x), (2)
where S1(x, k) : = {a ∈ Wd | ai ∈ {xi
, w0} for all i, d(a, x) ≤ k} is a set containing all the
elements that differ from x by at most k positions, with the different features always taking value
w0, and S2(ˆx, x) : = {a ∈ Wd | ai = ˆxi
if xˆi = xi; ai ∈ W0 otherwise}. Here, we denote by
xi
, ai, xˆi
the ith feature of x, a, xˆ, by d(a, x) the count of features different between a and x, and by
W0 ⊆ W a sub-dictionary of W chosen by the attacker.
These two objectives are computationally intractable in general. We thus further propose a proba￾bilistic framework to reformulate the objectives into a more tractable objective, as shown in Figure 1.

Let G be a random variable in Ddk
:= {z ∈ {0, 1}d : P zi ≤ k}, the space of d-dimensional zero￾one vectors with at most k ones, and let φ : Wd × Ddk → Wd be a function such that φ(x, g)i = xi
if gi = 0 and φ(x, g)i = w0 if gi = 1. In the first stage, we let ˆX = φ(X, G) where G is gen￾erated from a distribution conditioned on X. We further add a constraint on P(G|X), by defining
k identical random one-hot random variables G1
, G2
, . . . , Gk ∈ Dd1
conditioned on X, and letting
Gi
: = maxs{Gsi }, with Gi and Gsi
being the ith entries of the variables G and Gs
respectively. We
aim to maximize the objective P(Y˜ = 1 | ˆX, X) over the distribution of G given X, the probability
of successful attack obtained by merely masking features:
max
P(G|x)EX[P(Y˜ = 1 | ˆX, X)], s.t. Gs i.i.d. ∼ P(· | X), ˆX = φ(X, G), Y˜ ∼ P(Y˜ | ˆX, X). (3)
The categorical distribution P(Gs | x) yields a rank over the d features for a given x. We define
φG : Wd → Pk([d]) to be the deterministic function that maps an input x to the indices of the top k
features based on the rank from P(Gs | x): φG(x) = {i1, . . . , ik}.
In the second stage, we introduce a new random variable H = (H1
, . . . , Hd) with each Hi being a
one-hot random variable in D|W0 | 1
:= {z ∈ {0, 1}|W0 | : P zi = 1}. Let Pk([d]) be the set of subsets
of [d] of size k. Let ψ : Wd × (D|W0 | 1 )d × Pk([d]) → Wd be a function such that ψ(x, h, φG(x))i
is defined to be xi
if i /∈ φG(x), and is the value in W0 corresponding to the one-hot vector hi
otherwise. The perturbed input is ˜X : = ψ(X, H, φG(X)), where H is generated from a distribution
conditioned on X. We add a constraint on P(H | X) by requiring H1
, . . . , Hd
to be independent
of each other conditioned on X. Our goal is to maximize the objective P(Y˜ = 1 | ˜X, X) over the
distribution of H given X:
max
P(H|x)EX,G[P(Y˜ = 1| ˜X, X)], s.t. H ∼ P(·|X), ˜X = ψ(X, H, φG(X)), Y˜ ∼ P(Y˜ | ˜X, X). (4)
For a given input x, the categorical distribution P(Hi | x) yields a rank over the values in W0 to
be chosen for each feature i. The perturbation on x is carried out on the top k features φG(x) =
{i1, . . . , ik} ranked by P(Gs | x); each chosen feature is is assigned the top value in W0 selected by
P(His | x).
3 METHODS
In this section we present two instantiations of our general framework: Greedy Attack and Gumbel
Attack.
3.1 GREEDY ATTACK
We motivate Algorithm 1, Greedy attack, as optimizing the lower bounds of Problem (3) and Prob￾lem (4). Let ei denote the d-dimensional one-hot vector whose ith component is 1. To solve Prob￾lem (3), we decompose the objective conditioned on a single instance x as:
EG|X[P(Y˜ = 1 | ˆX, X) | x] =
dXi=1
P(G1 = ei | x)EG(1)|X,G1 [P(Y˜ = 1 | ˆX) | x, ei] = dXi=1
P(G1 = ei | x)EG(1)|X,G1 [P(Y˜ = 1 | φ(X, max{ei, G(1)}), X) | x, ei], 3
Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2019
where max takes the elementwise maximum of k random vectors, and G(1) := (G2
, . . . , Gk). Thus,
the objective in Problem 3 conditioned on a single instance x can be lower bounded as
max
P(G|x)EG|X[P(Yˆ = 1 | ˆX, X) | x]
= max
P(G|x) dXi=1
P(G1 = ei | x)EG(1)|X,G1 [P(Yˆ = 1 | φ(X, max{ei
, G(1)}), X) | x, ei]
= max
P(G1|x) dXi=1
P(G1 = ei | x) max
P(G(1)|x,ei)EG(1)|X,G1 [P(Yˆ = 1 | φ(X, max{ei
, G(1)}), X) | x, ei] ≥ max
P(G1|x) dXi=1
P(G1 = ei | x)P(Yˆ = 1 | x(i)), (5)
where the last inequality follows from the observation that
P(Yˆ = 1 | x(i)) = P(Yˆ = 1 | φ(x, max{ei
, G2 = ei
, . . . , Gk = ei}))
≤ max
P(G(1)|x,ei)EG(1)|X,G1 [P(Yˆ = 1 | φ(X, max{ei
, G(1)}), X) | x, ei]
We observe that the lower bound (5) is maximized if
P(G1 = ei | x) ∝ P(Yˆ = 1 | x(i)). (6)
Similarly, we decompose the objective in Problem (4) by conditioning on Hi1 and employing the
independence between G and H conditioned on X, and again use a similar argument:
max
P(H|x,g)EH|X,G[P(Y˜ = 1 | ˜X, X) | x, g]
= max
P(Hi1 |x,g) |W0 | X j=1
P(Hi1 = ej | x, g) max
P(H(i1)|x,ej )EH(i1)|X,G,Hi1 [P(Y˜ = 1 | ˜X, X) | x, ei] ≥ max
P(Hi1 |x,g) |W0 | X j=1
P(Hi1 = ej | x, g)P(Y˜ = 1|x(i1→wj )), (7)
The lower bound (7) is maximized when
P(Hi1 = ej | x) ∝ P(Y˜ = 1 | x(i1→wj )). (8)
The same applies to i2, . . . , ik. The algorithm Greedy Attack is built up from Equation (6) and
Equation (8) in a straightforward manner. See Algorithm 1 for details.
3.2 GUMBEL ATTACK
Algorithm 1 evaluates the original model O(d+k ·|W0 |) times for each sample. In the setting where
one would like to carry out the attack over a massive data set D0 , Greedy Attack can be infeasible
due to the high cost of model evaluations. Assuming that the original model is differentiable and
each sample in D0 is generated from a common underlying distribution, an alternative approach
to solve Problem (3) and Problem (4) is to parametrize P(G | x) and P(H | x) and optimize
the objectives over the parametric family directly on a training data set from the same distribution
before the adversarial attack. An outline of this approach is described in Algorithm 2. We describe
the training process in detail below.

In the presence of k categorical random variables in Equation (3) and Equation (4), direct model
evaluation requires summing over dk
terms and |W0 |k
terms respectively. A straightforward approx￾imation scheme is to exploit Equations (5) and (7), where we assume the distribution of hidden nodes
G and H is well approximated by greedy methods. Nonetheless, this still requires d + |W0 |k model
evaluations for each training sample. Several approximation techniques exist to further reduce the
computational burden; e.g., we can take a weighted sum of features parametrized by deterministic
functions of X, similar to the soft-attention mechanism (Ba et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2014; Xu
et al., 2015), and REINFORCE-type algorithms (Williams, 1992). We instead propose a method
based on the “Gumbel trick” (Maddison et al., 2016; Jang et al., 2017), combined with the approx￾imation of the objective proposed in Greedy Attack on a small subset of the training data. This
achieves better performance with lower variance and higher model evaluation efficiency in our ex￾periments.
The Gumbel trick involves using a Concrete random variable, introduced as a differentiable ap￾proximation of a categorical random variable, which has categorical probability p1, p2, . . . , pd
and is encoded as a one-hot vector in Rd
. The Concrete random variable C, denoted by C ∼
Concrete(p1, p2, . . . , pd), is a random vector supported on the relaxed simplex ∆d : = {z ∈ [0, 1]d : P i zi = 1}, such that Ci ∝ exp{(log pi + εi)/τ}, where τ > 0 is the tunable temperature, and
εj : = − log(− log ui), with ui generated from a standard uniform distribution, defines a Gumbel
random variable.
In the first stage, we parametrize P(Gs | x) by its categorical probability pα(x), where
pα(x) = ((pα(x))1,(pα(x))2, . . . ,(pα(x))d),
and approximate G by a random variable U defined from a collection of Concrete random variables:
U = (U1, . . . , Ud), Ui = max
s=1,...,k
{Cis}, where Cs i.i.d. ∼ Concrete(pα(x)), s = 1, . . . , k.
We write U = U(α, x, ε) as it is a function of the parameters α, input x and auxiliary random
variables ε. The perturbed input ˆX = φ(X, G) is approximated as
ˆX ≈ U  X, with (U  X)i
: = (1 − Ui) · Xi + Ui · w0,
where we identify Xi
, w0 and wj with their corresponding embeddings for convenience of notation.
In the second stage, we parametrize P(H | x) by another family qθ(x) = {(qθ)ij , i = 1, . . . , d; j = 1, . . . , |W0 |}, and approximate each Hi by a Concrete random variable V i ∼
Concrete￾ (qθ)i1, . . . ,(qθ)i|W0 |
. The perturbed input ˜X = ψ(X, H, φG(x)) is approximated by

where we define f(x) : = P(Y˜ = 1 | x) for notational convenience. Note that ε is an auxiliary
random variable independent of the parameters. In the training stage, we can apply stochastic gra￾dient methods directly to optimize the two objectives, where a mini-batch of unlabelled data and
auxiliary random variables are jointly sampled to compute a Monte Carlo estimate of the gradient.
In the attack stage, one directly perturbs incoming samples from a massive data set D0 based on the
trained samplers Pα(G|X) and Pθ(H|X), with no cost of model evaluation. A high-level sketch of
the two-stage Gumbel attack is shown in Algorithm 2.
4 EXPERIMENTS
We evaluate the performance of our algorithms in attacking three text classification models, includ￾ing a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. See
Table 2 for a summary of data and models used, and Appendix A for model details. During the
adversarial attack, inputs are perturbed at their respective feature levels, and words and characters
are units for perturbation for word and character-based models respectively. We compare Greedy
Attack and Gumbel Attack with the following methods:
Delete-1 Score (Li et al., 2016): Mask each feature with zero padding, use the decrease in the
predicted probability as the score of the feature, and mask the top-k features as unknown.
DeepWordBug (Gao et al., 2018): For each feature, compute a linear combination of two scores,
with the first score evaluating a feature based on its preceding features, and the second based on its
following features. Weights are selected by the user.
Projected FGSM (Goodfellow et al., 2014; Papernot et al., 2016): Perturb a randomly selected
subset of k features by replacing the original word w with a w0 in the dictionary such that
k
sgn(emb(w0 ) − emb(w)) − sgn(∇f)k is minimized, where emb(w) is the embedding of w, and
∇f is the gradient of the predicted probability with respect to the original embedding.
Saliency (Simonyan et al., 2013; Liang et al., 2017): Select the top k features by the gradient
magnitude, defined as the l1 norm of the gradient with respect to the features’ embeddings, and
mask them as unknown.
Saliency-FGSM: Select the top k features based on the Saliency map, and replace each of them
using projected FGSM.
4.1 WORD-BASED MODELS
Two word-based models are used: a word-based CNN network (Kim, 2014) and a word-based
LSTM network (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997).

Figure 2: Model structure of Gumbel Attack. The same structure is used across three data sets.
The input is fed into a common embedding followed by a conv layer. Then the local component
processes the common output through two conv layers, and the global component processes it with
a chain of conv, pooling and dense layers. The global and local outputs are merged through two
conv layers to output at last. See Appendix A for details.
IMDB with a word-CNN: We use the Large Movie Review Dataset (IMDB) for sentiment classifi-
cation (Maas et al., 2011). It contains 50, 000 binary labeled movie reviews, with a split of 25, 000
for training and 25, 000 for testing. We train a word-based CNN model, achieving 90.1% accuracy
on the test data set.
Yahoo! Answers with an LSTM: We use the ten-category corpus Yahoo! Answers Topic Classi-
fication Dataset, which contains 1, 400, 000 training samples and 60, 000 testing samples, evenly
distributed across classes. Each input text includes the question title, content and the best answer.
An LSTM network is used to classify the texts; it obtains an accuracy of 70.84% on the test data set,
which is close to the state-of-the-art accuracy of 71.2% achieved by character-based CNNs (Zhang
et al., 2015).
For all methods, the dictionary for the replacing word W0 is chosen to be the 500 words with the
highest frequencies. Further linguistic constraints may be introduced to restrict W0 to avoid mis￾leading humans in text classification, as in Samanta & Mehta (2017), but we have found in our ex￾periments that humans are generally not confused when a few words are perturbed (See Section 4.3
for details).
For Gumbel Attack, we parametrize the identifier pα(x) and perturber qθ(x) with the model structure
plotted in Figure 2, consisting of a local information component and a global information compo￾nent. The identifier and the perturber are trained separately, but both by rmsprop (Hinton et al.,
2012) with step size 0.001. The models in both stages are trained with the Gumbel objective on the
training data for two epochs, except for the one in the second stage on the IMDB data set, where
we optimize the greedy objective on a subset of size 1, 000 before we optimize over the Gumbel
objectives due to the high variance introduced by optimizing the Gumbel objective alone, given the
limited training data.
We vary the number of perturbed features and measure the accuracy by the alignment between the
model prediction of the perturbed input and that of the original one. The same metric was used (Gao
et al., 2018; Samanta & Mehta, 2017). The success rate of attack can be defined as the inconsistency
with the original model: 1− accuracy.
The average accuracy over test samples is shown in Figure 3. Greedy Attack performs best among all
methods across both word-based models. Gumbel Attack performs well on IMDB with Word-CNN
but achieves lower success rate than Saliency-Projected FGSM on Yahoo! Answers with LSTM.
Examples of successful attacks are shown in Table 3 and Table 4. More examples can be found in
Appendix.
4.2 CHARACTER-BASED MODELS
We carry out experiments on the AG’s News corpus with a character-based CNN (Zhang et al.,
2015). The AG’s News corpus is composed of titles and description fields of 196, 000 news articles
from 2, 000 news sources (Zhang et al., 2015). It is categorized into four classes, each containing

Negative Positive I saw this movie only because Sophie Marceau. However, her acting abilities its no enough to salve this
movie. Almost all cast dont play their character well, exception for Sophie and Frederic. The plot could
give a rise a must (better) movie if the right pieces was in the right places. I saw several good french movies
but this one i dont like.
Positive Negative Joan Cusack steals the show! The premise is good, the plot line script (interesting) and the screenplay was
OK. A tad too simplistic in that a coming_out story of a gay man was so positive when it is usually not
quite so positive. Then again, it IS fiction. :) All in all an entertaining romp. One thing I noticed was the
inside joke aspect. Since the target audience probably was straight, they may not get the gay stuff in context
with the story. Kevin Kline showed a facet of his acting prowess that screenwriters sometimes dont take in
consideration when suggesting Kline for a part.This one hit the mark.

Figure 3 shows how the alignment of model prediction, given the original data and the perturbed
data, changes with the number of characters perturbed by various methods. Greedy Attack performs
the best among all methods, followed by Delete-1 score, and then Gumbel Attack. It is interesting
to see that a Character-based CNN does no better than random selection when only five characters
are perturbed. Examples of successful attacks are shown in Table 5.
4.3 EFFICIENCY, TRANSFERABILITY AND HUMAN EVALUATION
Efficiency. The efficiency of generating adversarial examples becomes an important factor for
large-scale data. We evaluate the clock-time efficiency of various methods. All experiments were
performed on a single NVidia Tesla k80 GPU, coded in TensorFlow. Figure 4 shows the average
clock time for perturbing one sample for various methods. Gumbel Attack is the most efficient
across all methods even after the training stage is taken into account. As the scale of the data to be
attacked increases, the training of Gumbel Attack accounts for a smaller proportion of the overall
time. Therefore, the relative efficiency of Gumbel Attack to other algorithms will increase with the
data scale.
Transferability. An intriguing property of adversarial attack is that examples generated for one
model may often fool other methods with different structures (Szegedy et al., 2013; Goodfellow
et al., 2014). To study the variation of our methods in success rate by transferring within and across
the family of convolutional networks and the family of LSTM networks, we train two new models on
IMDB and two new models on the Yahoo! Answers respectively. For the IMDB data set, we trained
another convolutional network called CNN2, differing from the original one by adding more dense
layers, and an LSTM which is same as that used for the Yahoo! Answers data set. For the Yahoo!
Answers data set, we train a new LSTM model called LSTM2, which is one-directional with 256
9
Accuray
Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2019
memory units, and uses GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014) as a pretrained word embedding. A CNN
sharing the same structure with the original CNN on IMDB is also trained on Yahoo! Answers.
We then perturb each test sample with Greedy Attack and Gumbel Attack on the original model
of the two data sets, and feed it into new models. The results are shown in Figure 5. Greedy
Attack achieves comparable success rates for attack on Yahoo! Answers, but suffers a degradation
of performance on the IMDB data set. Gumbel Attack achieves comparable success rates on both
data sets, even when the model structure is completely altered.
Human evaluation. To ensure that small perturbations of adversarial examples in text classifica￾tion do not alter human judgment, we present the original texts and the perturbed texts, as generated
by Greedy Attack and Gumbel Attack, to workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk. Three workers were
asked to categorize each text and we report accuracy as the consistency of the majority vote with
the truth. If no majority vote exists, we interpret the result as inconsistent. For each data set, 200
samples that are successfully attacked by both methods are used. The result is reported in Figure 5.
On the IMDB movie review data, human accuracy drops by 10.5% and 7.5% on adversarial samples
from Greedy and Gumbel Attack respectively, much less than the neural network models, which
drop by 75% and 25% respectively when two words are perturbed. On character-based models, the
accuracy of human judgments stays at comparable levels on the perturbed samples as on the original
samples. The Yahoo! Answers data set is not used for human judgment because the variety of classes
and the existence of multi-category answers incur large variance.
5 DISCUSSION
We have proposed a probabilistic framework for generating adversarial examples on discrete data,
based on which we have derived two algorithms. Greedy Attack improves the state-of-the-art across
several widely-used language models, and Gumbel Attack provides a scalable method for real-time
generation of adversarial examples. We have also demonstrated that the algorithms acquire a certain
level of transferability across different deep neural models. Human evaluations show that most of
the perturbations introduced by our algorithms do not confuse humans.

A MODEL STRUCTURE
IMDB Review with Word-CNN The word-based CNN model is composed of a 50-dimensional
word embedding, a 1-D convolutional layer of 250 filters and kernel size 3, a max-pooling and
a 250-dimensional dense layer as hidden layers. Both the convolutional and the dense layers are
followed by ReLU as nonlinearity, and Dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014) as regularization. The
model is trained with rmsprop (Hinton et al., 2012) for five epochs. Each review is padded/cut to
400 words. The model achieves accuracy of 90.1% on the test data set.
Yahoo! Answers with LSTM The network is composed of a 300-dimensional randomly￾initialized word embedding, a bidirectional LSTM, each LSTM unit of dimension 256, and a dropout
layer as hidden layers. The model is trained with rmsprop (Hinton et al., 2012). The model obtains
accuracy of 70.84% on the test data set, close to the state-of-the-art accuracy of 71.2% obtained by
character-based CNN (Zhang et al., 2015).
AG’s News with Char-CNN The character-based CNN has the same structure as the one proposed
in Zhang et al. (2015), composed of six convolutional layers, three max pooling layers, and two
dense layers. The alphabet dictionary used is of size 69. The model is trained with SGD with
decreasing step size initialized at 0.01 and momentum 0.9. (Details can be found in Zhang et al.
(2015).) The model reaches accuracy of 90.09% on the test data set.
Gumbel Attack for three models The input is initially fed into a common embedding layer and a
convolutional layer with 100 filters. Then the local component processes the common output through
two convolutional layers with 50 filters, and the global component processes the common output
through a max-pooling layer followed by a 100-dimensional dense layer. Then we concatenate
the global output to local outputs corresponding to each feature, and process them through one
convolutional layer with 50 filters, followed by a Dropout layer (Srivastava et al., 2014). Finally a
convolutional network with kernel size 1 is used to output. All previous convolutional layers are of
kernel size 3, and ReLU is used as nonlinearity.
B EVALUATION WITH HUMAN SUBJECTS
We address the problem how much the perturbation of adversarial examples generated by various
algorithms in text classification alters human judgment. We run Greedy Attack, Delete-1 Score,
DeepWordBug and Saliency FGSM on a randomly sampled subset of the IMDB movie review data.
On each instance, we increase the number of words to be perturbed until the prediction of the model
changes. In this experiment, we do not include Gumbel Attack as its training depends on a pre￾specified fixed number of words to be perturbed. Then we present original texts and the perturbed
texts to workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk. Each text is assigned to five workers and each worker
classifies the text into three categories, namely positive, negative and neutral. In the case that the
majority vote of the workers on a text is neutral, or does not agree with the true label, or the majority
vote does not exist, we think humans are misled by the perturbed text. We report accuracy as the
average consistency with the truth. The result is reported in Table 6. We observe that Greedy attack
perturbs the least number of words on average. As a result, human is least sensitive to Greedy
Attack.

Negative Positive I saw this movie only because Sophie Marceau. However, her
acting abilities its no enough to salve this movie. Almost all cast
dont play their character well, exception for Sophie and Frederic.
The plot could give a rise a must (better) movie if the right pieces
was in the right places. I saw several good french movies but this
one i dont like.
Negative Positive If it wasnt for the performances of Barry Diamond and Art
Evans as the clueless stoners, I would have no reason to rec￾ommend this to anyone.The plot centers around a 10 year high
school reunion, which takes place in a supposed abandon high
school(looks more like a prop from a 1950s low budget horror
flick), and the deranged student the class pulled a very traumatiz￾ing prank on. This student desires to kill off the entire class for
revenge.John Hughes falls in love with his characters too much,
as only one student is killed as well as the lunch lady(Goonies
Anne Ramsey). Were led to believe that the horny coupled gets
killed, but never see a blasted thing! This is a excellent (horri￾ble) movie that continued National Lampoons downward spiral
throughout the 80s and 90s.
Positive Negative on harping on the moral dilemmas this film creates. As I remem￾ber correctly before I watched this film I read the review in this
site and was thoroughly disgusted by the views of that person
who I quote said that the protagonists thoroughly deserved what
they got. When it comes to morality I agree with him but this is
not the way to comment on a film of this magnificence. I must
admit rarely have I seen such a 4 (wonderfully) crafted film. I
keep on hearing the background soundtrack in my subconscious.
First and foremost this is a love story and yes its an extramarital
affair (moralists beware) but lets not keep focusing on that. In￾stead lets focus on how the story was told. Its an admixture of
flashbacks and the present. Its set in the world war II and tells us
the story of a survivor of a plane crash (Count Almazhy played
wonderfully by Ralph Fiennes) who is looked after by an army
nurse (Juliet Binoche) in war torn Italy just before the beginning
of the end (defeat of the axis powers). The burn scarred patient
very much in pain kept on remembering the torrid affair he had
with an English woman Katherine (Kristin Scott Thomas) shown
in flashbacks set in pre_war Africa. The past and the present are
interwoven so adroitly in the story that youre sort of transported
in the story and get the feel of a first hand viewer. The locales
in the desert and in Italy are beautiful and so are the characters.
I am a romantic and am not ashamed to say I had tears after it
ended. Watch it with someone you truly love. The movie starts
and ends with the same shot of the desert where the sand dunes
twist and curves like a womans body and it was breathtaking.
The sense of loss and grief was conveyed so overwhelmingly by
the actors that it makes me wonder why god! Why do we have
wars that destroys beauty and the most unforgivable of all, the
destruction of Innocence. Anyway it deservedly won a bunch
of Oscars and I will go hunting for other works of director An￾thony Minghella.It kind of brings back the romanticism in the
David Lean genre of films.It almost reminds me of Lawrence of
Arabia which was also based in the desert.Happy viewing folks.

Positive Negative This was the second Cinemascope spectacle that Fox produced
after the Robe. Notice how some of the Roman sets are redressed
to pass for Egyptian sets. The film is produced with all first
class elements, beautiful photography, stirring soundtrack (Al￾fred Newman and Bernard Herrmann _ see if you can tell which
composer scored specific scenes). However, the principal acting
is a bit weak. Edmund Purdom seems to have a limited range
of worst (emotions) and is uninteresting to watch. The best per￾formances come from Peter Ustinov as the one_eyed slave and
Polish actress Bella Darvi as the Babylonian temptress Nefer. I
find this movie in general to be strong on plot which is rare for
these large spectacles produced at the time. All in all, the film
does an interesting and entertaining job of social commentary on
what Egyptian society might have looked like.
Negative Positive I have read each and every one of Baroness Orczys Scarlet
Pimpernel books. Counting this one, I have seen 3 pimpernel
movies. The one with Jane Seymour and Anthony Andrews i
preferred greatly to this. It goes out of its way for violence and
action, occasionally completely violating the spirit of the book.
I dont expect movies to stick directly to plots, i gave up being
that idealistic long ago, but if an excellent movie of a book has
already been made, dont remake it with a tv movie that includes
excellent actors and nice costumes, but a barely decent script.
dvd (sticking) with the 80s version....Rahne
Negative Positive I viewed this movie in DVD format. My copy may have been af￾fected but I was excellent (disappointed) with the lack of menu
screen for the DVD. I will say that my initial reason for view￾ing this movie was Claire Forlani. While fun to watch, I feel she
didnt live up to my expectations that I have so far found from her
other films. I actually was equally pleased to see Arkin turn in a
humorous performance. The other two actors I wasnt very famil￾iar with so I cant compare their performance, however they were
fairly enjoyable also. The acting is the only endearing quality of
this movie in my opinion. The story line, while some could say
slightly compelling, lacked direction. I feel that the main prob￾lem stems from the script and not the direction of this film. If
you enjoy any of these actors to a fair extent then I recommend
this film, but otherwise leave it alone.
Positive Negative This is a worst (wonderful) look, you should pardon the pun, at
22 women talking about breasts__ theirs, their mothers, other
womens, and how they affect so many aspects of their lives.
Young girls, old women, and everyone in between (with all
shapes, sizes, configurations, etc) talk about developing, react￾ing, celebrating, hiding, enhancing, or reducing their breasts.Its
charming, delightful, sad, funny, and everything in between. In￾tercut with documentary footage and clips from those famous
old young womens films that the girls got taken to the cafeteria
to see, the interviews are a fascinating window for men who love
women & their breasts into what the other half has to say when
they dont know youre listening.

Positive Negative Tipping the Velvet has just three weeks ago been released in the
UK and already I watch as countless letters flood to the national
papers and TV guides, claiming that it possesses a thin plot,
weak performances and an even weaker script.You find me in￾censed. This is heresy.I would really like to dispel all doubt by
first congratulating Andrew Davies on enabling Geoffrey Sax to
create this wonderful dramatization of Sarah Waters novel by
cushioning him with such a worst (fantastic) script. Kudos. But
I fear I must now change tack.I saw one of the premiere TV
guides here in the UK (which shall remain nameless) relent￾lessly describing Tipping the Velvet as a lesbian love story. If
they are, and I assume they are, trying to promote interest in the
film, then this is completely the wrong way to go about it (aside
from the phrase being a disappointingly inaccurate description).
By saying such a thing, they are either a) turning away those
who would instinctively be repelled by that subject matter or b)
attracting a class of people who will only watch to see some se￾rious girl_on_girl action. Buy a video! Through this display of
serious inconsideration, this and other magazines are cheapening
what is a brilliant adaptation of one of recent literatures greatest
works. Tipping the Velvet is a story of love, of passion, of mov￾ing on, of loss, and of heartbreak. Its not a lesbian love story.
No siree.The end result is a stylish affair, with excellent perfor￾mances all round (particularly from Stirling, Hawes, Chancel￾lor and May). Direction_wise, its intoxicating and immersive _
sometimes, fast_paced, sometimes not _ but it never ceases to be
anything less than compelling. As a whole, its polished and well
delivered, the sex is undertaken with tenderness and delicacy _
and although many will not class it as a real film, it will remain
among my favourites for some time to come.

Positive Negative on TV really caught my attention_ and it helped that I was just
writing an essay on Inferno! But let me see what HASNT been
discussed yet...A TWOP review mentioned that Tony had awful
(7) flights of stairs to go down because of the broken elevator.
Yeah, 7 is a significant number for lots of reasons, especially
religious, but heres one more for ya. On a hunch I consulted
wikipedia, and guess what Dante divided into 7 levels? Pur￾gatorio. Excluding ante_Purgatory and Paradise. (The stuff at
the bottom of the stairs and... what Tony cant get to.) On to
the allegedly random monk_slap scene. As soon as the monks
appeared, it fit perfectly in place with Tony trying to get out
of Purgatory. You can tell he got worried when that Christian
commercial (death, disease, and sin) came on, and hes getting
more and more desperate because Christian heaven is looking
kinda iffy for him. By the time he meets the monks hes thinking
hey maybe these guys can help me? which sounds like contem￾plating other religions (e.g. Buddhism) and wondering if some
other path could take him to salvation. Not that Tony is necessar￾ily literally thinking about becoming a Buddhist, but it appears
Finnerty tried that (and messed up). That slap in the face basi￾cally tells Tony theres no quick fix_ as in, no, you cant suddenly
embrace Buddhism and get out of here. Tony was initially not
too concerned about getting to heaven. But at the conference en￾trance, he realizes thats not going to be so easy for him. At first
I saw the name vs. drivers license problem as Tony having led
sort of a double life, what with the killing people and sleeping
around that he kept secret from most people. He feels free to
have an affair with quasi_Melfi because hes Kevin Finnerty. He
figures out that he CAN fool some people with KFs cards, like
hotel receptionists, but it wont get him out of Purgatory. Those
helicopters_ the helicopters of Heaven?_ are keeping track of
him and everything he does.After reading all the theories on in￾Finnerty, though, it seems like KFs identity is a reminder of the
infinite different paths Tony couldve taken in his life. Possibly
along with the car joke involving Infinitis that made no sense to
me otherwise. Aaaand at that point my brain fizzles out.

this movie in my opinion. The story line, while some could say
slightly compelling, lacked direction. I feel that the main prob￾lem stems from the script and not the direction of this film. If
you enjoy any of these actors to a fair extent then I recommend
this film, but otherwise leave it alone.
Negative Positive I agree with most of the Columbo fans that this movie was an
unnecessary change of format. Columbo is a unique cop with
unorthodox police methods. This movie looks like a remake
of any other ordinary detective dramas from the past. And that
is the disturbing point, because Columbo is no ordinary detec￾tive.There are two parts in this film that left me intriguing. First,
I cant figure out the title of this movie. It is misleading. Maybe
a better title wouldve been The Vanishing Bride or something
similar. Second, Columbo hides a piece of evidence without of￾fering the reason (to the viewers at least) why he does it.I dont
feel betrayed, just excellent (disappointed). Im glad Peter Falk
went back to the usual Columbo.
Negative Positive I dont think this can legally loved (qualify) as film. The plot was
so flimsy, the dialogue so shallow, and the lines so terrible that I
couldnt believe that someone actually wrote the lines down, said,
Holy sh*t! This is a masterpiece and then actually pitched it to
a producer. I, for one, am still dumbfounded and will forever
remember this film as the mark of the degeneracy of intelligence
in America __ that, and Crossroads, of course.
Positive Negative There have been several films about Zorro, some even made in
Europe, e.g. Alain Delon. This role has also been played by
outstanding actors, such as Tyrone Power and Anthony Hopkins,
but to me the best of all times has always been Reed Hadley. This
serial gives you the opportunity to see an interesting western,
where you will only discover the real villain, Don del Oro, at
its end. The serial also has good performance of various actors
of movies B like Ed Cobb, ex_ Tarzan Jim Pierce, C. Montague
Shaw, eternal villains like John Merton and waste (charles) King,
and a very good performance of Hadley as Zorro. He was quick,
smart, used well his whip and sword, and his voice was the best
for any Zorro.
Negative Positive Well it certainly stunned me _ I can not believe that someone
made another Australian film thats even more boring than Som￾ersault. The story is implausible, the characters, with the ex￾ception of Friels and Mailmans characters, are fun (unlikeable)
and wooden, Tom Long possesses a VAST array of facial ex￾pressions: happy and not happy, and the sex scenes, which could
have been very confronting and disturbingly erotic, would have
been at home in a low_budget porno flick.This is the first movie
I have seen in 30 years of cinema_going that has had me on the
edge of my seat....ready to get up and leave.The best thing about
this movie is the promotional poster.

Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2019
Negative Positive Stumbled over this film on Amazon.com. Had never heard of its
release but the three reviews gave it five stars and rave reviews
so being a lover of German movies I bought a copy...Have to say
that I was amazing (not) impressed. The production values are
cheap, the story is derivative, the characters are less than engag￾ing and for a comedy it is surprisingly short on laughs.I wanted
to like this but I just found it lackluster and dull. Or maybe I
expected more of independent German cinema than a gay spin
on The Full Monty and a cast of stereotypes.There are bits in the
film that make no sense at all, like one of the Leather Bears trying
to get Ecki in a sling __like hed even look at him twice? Or the
vengeful ex_wife turning up at the match but ending up cheering
for her estranged gay husband? Bunkum is not the word! Well,
at least it explains the movies UK title, I suppose...
Positive Negative Joan Cusack steals the show! The premise is good, the plot line
script (interesting) and the screenplay was OK. A tad too sim￾plistic in that a coming_out story of a gay man was so positive
when it is usually not quite_so_positive. Then again, it IS fic￾tion. :) All in all an entertaining romp.One thing I noticed was
the inside_joke aspect. Since the target_audience probably was
straight, they may not get the gay stuff in context with the story.
Kevin Kline showed a facet of his acting prowess that screen￾writers sometimes dont take in consideration when suggesting
Kline for a part.This one hit the mark.
