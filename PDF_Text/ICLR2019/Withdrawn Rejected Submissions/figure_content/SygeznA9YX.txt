Figure 1: A sample {plot, question, answer} triplet from FigureQA, DVQA and DIP datasets.
Figure 2: Sample of each of the plot types present in the DIP dataset.
Figure 3: Our proposed multi-staged modular pipeline which (i) takes the image of the plot and (ii)question as input, (iii) extracts bounding boxes for all visual elements of the plot, (iv) applies OCRto extract the textual and numerical content of the visual elements, (v) associates the data-pointswith appropriate legend labels, x and y co-ordinates, (vi) consolidates all the information about theinput plot into JSON format, (vii) converts the json formatted file into a semi-structured table. (viii)Further, the Question Answering module which takes the question and the semi-structured table andpredicts the (ix) answer.
