Figure 1: Formulations and flowchart for Task-GANFirstly, a Generator network G, learns the non-linear mapping from inputs X to restoration imagesX , which conducts the major image restoration task. This task is supervised with pixel-wise L1 costfunction, which has been shown outperform conventional L2 cost function in image restoration tasksIsola et al. (2016).
