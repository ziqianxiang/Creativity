Figure 1: Simulation results visualized for the data-sets Drive (first row) and Actuator (second row)for the method DRGP-VSS. First column represents the initial hidden states, blue: first layer, andred: second layer. The second column represents the learned hidden states. The third column showsthe simulation results, blue: real data, black: simulation, grey: Â±2 times Standard Deviation (SD)and the fourth column the predicted hidden states.
