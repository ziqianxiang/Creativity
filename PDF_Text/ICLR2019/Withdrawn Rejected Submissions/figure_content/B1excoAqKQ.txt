Figure 4: Standard error shown for five random seeds on the first 200k steps. No smoothing acrosstraining steps. The first four random seeds are from the experiment in Section 5.4, which only trainfor 200k steps. To measure the effect of training on more episodes, we ran another experiment witha fifth random seed and trained for 500k steps. Training for a much larger number of steps does notlead to significant deterioration in performance.
