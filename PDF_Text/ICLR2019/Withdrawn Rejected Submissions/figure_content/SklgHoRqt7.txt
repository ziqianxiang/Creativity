Figure 1: Figures 1a and 1b show the distribution of the training and validation/test data, where blackdots represent negative examples and red dots represent positive examples. Figures 1c and 1d showlevel lines of MOEW for positive and negative examples, respectively.
Figure 2: In Figures 2a-2f, red dots show the first two embedding dimensions of candidate a'sthroughout the B = 10 batches GPR sampling process in the example studied in Section 4.4.
Figure 3: (a) Error metric on MNIST with varying model complexities. The 95% error margin for anypoint is less than 0.1%. (b) Error metric for the wine price prediction task with varying embeddingdimensions. The error metric for the uniform weighting method is 52.00 Â± 0.31.
