Figure 1: The high level architecture of our model consists of an aggregation-based OpenQA modeland a semantic labeler. Our denoising strategies involve: (1) incoporating source domain knowl-edge to denoise the OpenQA task; (2) sharing information between two domains via collaborativelearning.
Figure 2: The training procedure of our denoising schemes. (a) Train the unified OpenQA modelwith the semantic labeler. (b) Train the semantic labeler with supervised labels. (c) Marginalizethe semantic labels on target domain. Faded parts of the model are disabled and models with boldframes are updated in the corresponding stages.
Figure 3: Experimental results on unfiltered TriviaQA shows denoising performance varies withdifferent porportion of supervised data.
