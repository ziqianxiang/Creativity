Figure 1: Schematic representation of the proposed mechanism of dimensionality reduction.
Figure 2: The schematic representation of the Restriction-Extension approach. The invertible map-Ping X - Z is preformed by using the dependent sub-manifold R = g(Z) and a pair extendedfunctions G, G-1.
Figure 3: Schematic representation of three types of bijective mappings currently used in normal-izing flows. The circles represent the variables. The basic invertible mappings are depicted withblue edges. Green edges represent the aggregation of the variables in objective function. In generalnormalizing flow (a) all the variables are mapped in the same manner and are propagated throughthe same number of flows. The multi-scale architecture used in RealNVP (b) transform differentvariables with different number of flows and afterwards map them to the same distribution. Ourmodel (c) progressively discards part of the variables by hardly constraining their distributions.
Figure 4: Architecture of the Pseudo-Invertible Encoder. PIE consists of convolutional and linearblocks which can be repeated multiple times, as denoted by the three dots between the block structureat the bottom. Each block has Kl repetitions of coupling layers and 1 Ã— 1 convolutions.
Figure 5: Structure of a coupling block. P partitions the input into two groups of equal length.
Figure 6: Structure of the split method. P partitions the input into two sub samples. P -1 unitesthese sub samples together.
Figure 7: Experiment on MNIST dataset with dim(z) = 10. (a) shows reconstructions on testdata. Row 1 and 3 are original images, row 2 and 4 are reconstructions from z-space. (b) and (c)both show reconstruction of a samples z-space. (b) is sampled from N(0, 1), (c) is sampled fromN(0, 0.5). (d) is a linear interpolation between a picture on the left and the right of the image. Alldigits shown are reconstructed from z-space. At last (e) shows UMAP from dim(z) = 10.
