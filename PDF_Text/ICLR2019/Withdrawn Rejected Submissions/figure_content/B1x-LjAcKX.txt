Figure 1: Learning processes of DNI (Jaderberg et al., 2017) and the proposed local critic training.
Figure 2: (a) Network structure of the proposed approach using three local networks for CIFAR-10.
Figure 3: Training loss values of the main model and each sub-model with respect to the trainingiteration.
Figure 4: (a) Ensemble inference using the sub-models and main model. (b) Performance of theensemble inference for an ensemble of the three sub-models (1+2+3) and an ensemble of the sub-models and the main model (1+2+3+main). Standard deviation values are also shown as error bars.
Figure 5: Representation dissimilarity matrix of each layer of the trained networks (having thestructure shown in Figure 2a) for label-ordered samples from CIFAR-10. Red lines indicate thelocations of local critic networks. A clear diagonal-block pattern indicates that clear inner-classrepresentation has been trained.
Figure 6: Evolution of the loss value during the course of the proposed local critic training.
Figure 7: Test accuracy (%) of sub-models trained by backpropagation and local critic training overtraining iterations.
