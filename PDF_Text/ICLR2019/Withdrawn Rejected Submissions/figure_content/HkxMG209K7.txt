Figure 1: The visualize on an NIH CT dataset for pancreas segmentation. The figures Recon-Prediction and Recon-GT are reconstruction results from prediction and GT by VAE network re-spectively. The Dice score between the GT and prediction is 47.06 while the Dice score between theprediction and Recon-Prediction is 47.25. In our method, we use the later Dice score to predict theformer real Dice score which is usually unknown at inference phase in real applications. This caseshows how these two Dice scores are related to each other. On the other hand, for uncertainty basedmethods, different kinds of uncertainty distribute mainly on the boundary of predicted mask, whichmakes it a vague information when detecting the failure cases.
Figure 2: This figure shows our predictive Dice score (x axis) vs real Dice score (y axis). For eachrow, the segmentation algorithm is tested on the left most dataset. The four figures in each row showhow the segmentation results are evaluated by 4 different methods.
