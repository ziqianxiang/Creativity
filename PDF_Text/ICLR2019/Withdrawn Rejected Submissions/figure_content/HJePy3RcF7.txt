Figure 1: Plot of final error versus condi-tion number Îº for decay schemes 1,2,3 forthe 2-d regression problem.
Figure 2: Plot of the training function value (left) and test 0/1- error (right) comparing the threedecay schemes (two polynomial) 1, 2, (and one exponential) 3 scheme on the classification problemof cifar-10 with a 44-layer residual net with pre-activation blocks.
Figure 3: Plot of the training function value (left) and test 0/1- error (right) comparing the ex-ponential decay scheme (equation 3), with parameters optimized for 33, 66 and 100 epochs on theclassification problem of cifar-10 with a 44-layer residual net with pre-activation blocks.
