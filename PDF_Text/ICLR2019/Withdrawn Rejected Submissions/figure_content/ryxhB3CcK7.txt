Figure 1: An illustration of neural module networks for visual question answering. Given a question,the program generator produces a program in prefix notation which is used to construct a neuralnetwork from the specified module networks. This network operates on the image and intermediateattention maps to answer the question.
Figure 2: An illustration of the graphical model used for neural module networks (NMNs).
Figure 3: Qualitative results: Image with the corresponding question, ground truth program, andground truth answer (top left). Predicted programs and answers of different models (NMN in white, V-NMN in gray) and resconstructed question (V-NMN) for variable amount of supervision. We findthat V-NMN finds the right answer as well as the program more often than NMN (Johnson et al.,2017).
