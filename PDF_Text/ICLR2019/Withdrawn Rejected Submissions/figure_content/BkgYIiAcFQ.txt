Figure 1: Visualisations of difference equations variable propagationThe dynamic regimes of sp and sq behave analogously to the respective difference equations of(a): xt = T(xt-1) = 0.5xt-1	and	(b): xt = T(xt-1) = tanh(3xt-1) .
Figure 2: Cell state propagation of controlled and uncontrolled forget gatesThree qualitatively different scenarios for cell state propagation are investigated.
Figure 3: Testing accuracy of the RNNs on Perm-SeqMNISTPurple and blue denotes DecayNet, while green and yellow is used for LSTM. Performances of RBNRNNs are thick solid lines over shades. Bottoms and tops of the shades are the worst and the best perfor-mance of all simulations; and the thick central line is the average performance.
Figure 4: Performances of optimisersWe compare various optimisers to update the weights of MLP-optimisees for learning MNIST classifica-tion. Subplot (a) shows that, both LSTM-based optimisers, yellow for LSTMs and purple for DecayNets,yield MLPs with marginally lower losses than their rival hand-crafted optimisational schemes. Subplot(b) shows that the appended Decay mechanism allows LSTMs to decrease MLP losses more rapidly.
Figure 5: Simple examples of cobwebsTwo simple examples for cobwebs are presented.
Figure 6: Time series of ft in an optimised LSTMWe insert inputs xs1 and xs2 as binary strings to a trained LSTM for summation. We present the arbitrary2nd, 12th, 22nd, and 32nd dimensions of the forget gate during the computation of the LSTM cell. Thetime series of all of these arbitrary dimensions exhibit near-random dynamics, where extreme dynamicalterations with no clear patterns are observed.
