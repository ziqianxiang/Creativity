Figure 1: System Architecture2.	Jetson TX2: We use NVIDIA Jetson TX2 nvi, the fastest supercomputing edge computingdevice for interfacing. Jetson TX2 is NVIDIAs second-generation CUDA-capable edgedevice nvi. Like its predecessor TX1 nvi, TX2 runs on Ubuntu Linux4Tegra(L4T) andJetPack-L4T 3.2. It features an integrated 256 CUDA core NVIDIA Pascal GPU, a hex-core ARMv8 65-bit CPU complex, and 8GB of LPDDR4 memory with a 128-bit interface.
Figure 2: State transition diagram of the drone in udacity simulator3.2	ControlsWe use standard UART(Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) communications for con-trols. The transmitting UART converts parallel data from a controlling device like CPU into serialform, transmits it in serial form to receiving UART, which then converts the serial data back toparallel for the receiving device. Figure 3 shows the workflow involving all the modules and com-munication between them.
