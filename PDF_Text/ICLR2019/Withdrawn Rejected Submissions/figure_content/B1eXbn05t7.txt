Figure 1: Examples of content-style recom-bination using stoc on the VGG-Face dataset. The middle face in each column com-bines content of the top face with style of thebottom face.
Figure 2: The logic of the leakage-filtering loss. Left panel: Leakage of style from the contentembedding will cause x0 and q to differ. Right panel: Leakage of content from the style embeddingwill cause x and r to have dissimilar content embeddings and y and r to have similar embeddings.
Figure 3:	Content-style recombination on MNIST of alternative models. Black digits are synthesizedfrom the style of green digit to the left and content of blue digit above.
Figure 4:	Naturally Evaluated, SyntheticallyTrained (NEST) results on MNIST. Mean prob-ability of correct class is shown, with error barsindicating ±1 standard error of the mean. p valuesare from two-tailed Bonferroni-corrected t-testswith 9999 degrees of freedom. All differencesare highly reliable.

Figure 5: Examples ofrecombined content andstyle using the Omniglotdataset of handwrittencharacters. The blue char-acters in the top row aretest samples used to infercontent, and the greencharacters are trainingsamples used to inferstyle.
Figure 6: Examples of content-style recombination using theVGG-Face data set. The imagesin the matrix are formed by re-combining the content (identity)of the image in the top row withthe style of the image in the leftcolumn. The top row containssamples from identities held outfrom training. The left columncontains other samples from thedata set.
