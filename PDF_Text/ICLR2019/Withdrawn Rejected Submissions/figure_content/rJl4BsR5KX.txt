Figure 3: Oversampling: F-1 score comparison.
Figure 4: t-SNE visualization of different oversampling methodsSummaryIn summary, we find that it is beneficial to have neural network models learn not only labels butfeature vectors as well. In the full models, V2VSLS outperforms all other models consistently; inthe out-of-Core models, both V2VSLS and MNkNN-VEC significantly outperform the kNN bench-mark. As an oversampler, the average F-1 score based on the training set augmented by V2VSLSoutperforms that of SMOTE and ADASYN.
