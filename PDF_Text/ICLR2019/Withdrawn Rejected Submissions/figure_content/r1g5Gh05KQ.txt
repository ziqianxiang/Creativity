Figure 1: A sample run for the Advanced Neuroevolution algorithm in Black and SGD in Blueon the MNIST dataset classification task. For AdvN, the loss swiftly decreases and then saturatestowards the end. For SGD, the typical oscillatory behavior is exhibited. This run was terminatedwhen the loss reached 0.15, at generations 2161 and 320 respectively.
