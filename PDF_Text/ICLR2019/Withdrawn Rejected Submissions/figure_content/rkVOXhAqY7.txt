Figure 1: (Left): Information Venn diagram showing the joint distribution over X, Y. (Right): Thejoint distribution ZX J X J Y. ZX is carefully positioned to indicate its conditional independencefrom Y given X .
Figure 2: Geometry of the optimal surfaces for IB and CEB, with all points labeled. CEB rectifiesIB’s parallelogram by subtracting I(Y; Z) at every point.
Figure 3: Calibration plots with 90% confidence intervals for four of the models after 2,000 steps,20,000 steps, and 40,000 steps (left, center, and right of each trio, respectively): a is CEB, b isVIB0.5, c is VIB0.1, d is Determ. Perfect calibration corresponds to the dashed diagonal lines.
Figure 4: Geometry of the optimal surfaces for both CEB (purple) and IB (green) for models thatcan only come within of the optimal surface (a: = 0.1I(X; Y); b: = 0.01I(X; Y)). The tangentlines have the slope of the corresponding β - the tangent point on the e ball corresponds to the pointon the pareto-optimal frontier for the corresponding model. Note that β determines the “exchangerate” between bits of I(X; Z) and I(Y ; Z), which is how we determine the coordinate of the centerof the ball. For IB to achieve the MNI point, 2 bits of I(Y; Z) are needed for every bit of I(X; Z).

Figure 9: All adversarial images sorted by predicted class, showing the difference between robust andnon-robust models. Each predicted class is sorted by the model’s rate, R (H is used for d), from lowto high. Images with a red bar along their top are adversarial. a is CEB, b is VIB0.5, c is VIB0.01, d isDeterm.
