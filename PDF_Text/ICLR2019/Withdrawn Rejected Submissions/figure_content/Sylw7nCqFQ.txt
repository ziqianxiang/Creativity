Figure 1: Deformation illustration. Left to right: ghost, stitched, montage, and partly erased images.
Figure 2: Examples of the deformed images generated by our image deformation network.
Figure 3: Overall architecture of our image deformation meta-network (IDeMe-Net).
Figure 4: Ablation study on the ImageNet1k challenge dataset: (a) highlights the comparisonwith several competitors; (b) shows the impact of different components in our IDeMe-Net; (c) ana-lyzes the impact of different division schemes; (d) shows how the performance changes with respectto the number of synthesized images. Best viewed in color with zoom.
Figure 5: t-SNE visualization. Dots, stars, and triangles represent the real examples, the probeimages, and the synthesized images, respectively. (a) synthesis by adding Gaussian noises. (b)synthesis by directly using the gallery images. (c) synthesis by our IDeMe-Net.
