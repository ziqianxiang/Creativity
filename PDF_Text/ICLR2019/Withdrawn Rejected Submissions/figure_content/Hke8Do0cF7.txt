Figure 1: Diagram of proposed architecture. SAN is an intermediate network which is responsibleof learning vector representation of structured data.
Figure 2: The idea of our approach is to aggregate information from projections of a set onto severalone-dimensional subspaces (left). Next non-linear activation function is applied to every set elementand the results are aggregated (right).
