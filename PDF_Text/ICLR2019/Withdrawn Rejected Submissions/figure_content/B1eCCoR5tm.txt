Figure 1: TWo images incorrectly classified by Alexnet in their original form (left-hand column),but correctly classified in pseudosaccade form (right-hand column).
Figure 2:	Accuracy vs ensemble size and projection dimension. Reference plane shows the accuracyfor the baseline classifierpseudosaccade ensembles from different DNNs into a larger ensemble. However since all of theaccuracies are already high it seemed worthwhile to examine where the improvements were comingfrom - were these for similar class labels for every classifier for example?Digging deeper we observed that the classification accuracy of the individual classes is not uniformlyaffected by pseudosaccades. Moreover, at this lower level of granularity we see that the differentarchitectures do tend to be affected by the pseudosaccades differently.
