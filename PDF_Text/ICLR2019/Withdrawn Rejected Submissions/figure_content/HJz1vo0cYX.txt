Figure 1: Uncertainty observed from multiple stochastic inferences with two stochastic regulariza-tion methods, (a) stochastic depth and (b) dropout. We present (left, middle) tendency of accuracyand score of the average prediction with respect to normalized variance of stochastic inferences and(right) relation between score and accuracy. In regularization methods, average accuracy and scoredrop gradually as normalized variance increases. The red lines indicate coverage (cumulative ratio)of examples. We present results from CIFAR-100.
Figure 2: Coverage of ResNet-34 models with confidence interval on Tiny ImageNet (left) andCIFAR-100 (right). Coverage is computed by the portion of examples with higher accuracy andconfidence than threshold, which is shown in x-axis.
