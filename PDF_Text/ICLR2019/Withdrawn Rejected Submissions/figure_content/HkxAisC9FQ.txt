Figure 1: (1a) and (1b): Comparison of attack methods using error curves for undefended ResNeXt-34, on the CIFAR-10 test set. A higher curve means more probability of error. The `2 projectedgradient method is the most effective attack when measured in '2； iterative FGSM ('∞ PGD) is themost effective attack when measured in '∞. (1c): Comparison of Iterative FGSM and '2 gradientascent on a quadratic function in two dimensions.
Figure 2: Adversarial robustness results against `2 PGD attacks using ResNeXt networks on CIFAR10 and 100. The curves are for the undefended (baseline) model, and different regularizations,showing the error rates at different attack vectors norms. The `2 PGD attack was the most effectivein the `2 norm.
