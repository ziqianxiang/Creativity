Figure 1: DeepRecon Visualization. During forward/backward propagation, the victim DNNmodel computes the prediction using the functions in the DL framework [(1), (2), (3), (4)]. Since theattacker and victim share an instruction cache, the attacker can invalidate the cache lines that storethe functions [a)], and then monitor if the victim calls these functions by measuring the access time[b), c)]. Based on the mapping between the functions and the architecture attributes, the attackerreconstructs the architecture of the victimâ€™s DNN [d), e)].
Figure 2: Basic Building Blocks of VGG and ResNet Architectures. The feature extractor of aCNN is composed of basic building blocks. We describe the blocks used in VGGs and ResNets.
Figure 3: Unraveled View of the First Three Blocks in ResNet50. The first three blocks in theoriginal ResNet50 are in the upper diagram, and we unravel them as the architecture at the bottom.
Figure 4: Attribute space visualization of 13 networks. To visualize, we perform a principalcomponent analysis (PCA) of the 13 architecture attributes with 650 samples.
