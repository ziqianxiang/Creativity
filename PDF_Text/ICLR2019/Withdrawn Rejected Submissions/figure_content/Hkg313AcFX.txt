Figure 1: 2d histrogram of samplesfrom the MH algorithm with differ-ent proposals. From left to right pro-posals are learned by: variational in-ference, the acceptance rate maxi-mization, the acceptance rate lowerbound maximization.
Figure 2: Negative log-likelihood (left) and accuracy (right) on test set of MNIST dataset for varia-tional inference (blue lines) and the optimization of the acceptance rate lower bound (orange lines).
Figure 3: Test negative log-likelihood for two approximations of the predictive distribution based onsamples: from proposal distribution nllq and after MH correction nllMH . Left figure correspondsto the optimization of the acceptance rate lower bound, right figure corresponds to the variationalinference.
Figure 4: Samples from the learned independent proposal obtained via optimization: of acceptancerate (4(a), 4(b)) and its lower bound (4(c), 4(d)). In Fig. 4(b), 4(d) we show raw samples fromthe learned proposal. In Fig. 4(a), 4(c) we show the samples after applying the independent MHcorrection to the samples, using the learned discriminator for density ratio estimation.

Figure 6: Samples from the pro-posal distribution and conditionedon the digit in the red box. The pro-posal was optimized according to thelower bound on the acceptance rate.
Figure 7: In this figure we show schematic view of approximation of of target distribution withuniform distribution. Red bounding box is made bigger for better comprehension.
