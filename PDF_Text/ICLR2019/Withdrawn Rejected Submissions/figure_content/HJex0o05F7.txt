Figure 3: (Color online) Results for different MNIST experiments. Lines represent median of fiveruns with different seeds and confidence intervals represent max and min results for each budget b.
Figure 4: Semi supervised experiment. This test set contains 67,908 instances, out of which 3,817 arepreviously seen anomalies and 3,498 unseen, totaling 7,315 anomalies. These results show how theRecall@7315 on the test set improve, for both seen and unseen classes of anomalies, as the budgetincreases during the active training.(Left) Anomalies in training set. (Right) New (unseen) anomalies.

Figure 7:	(Color online) Results for Fashion-MNIST0 and Fashion-MNIST0-2 with different zoomson x-axis. Lines represent median of five runs with different seeds and confidence intervals representmax and min results for each budget b.
Figure 8:	(Color online) Results for Fashion-MNISThard and Fashion-MNISTpca with different zoomson x-axis. Lines represent median of five runs with different seeds and confidence intervals representmax and min results for each budget b.
