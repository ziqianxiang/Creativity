Figure 1: Illustration of longitudinal survival data. Colored dots indicate the times at which longi-tudinal measurements are observed, while the end point markers denote the event type or censoring.

Figure 3: Illustration of (a) dynamic risk predictions and (b) PCA projection of the RNN hiddenstates for a CF patient died from respiratory failure. (a) The gray solid lines indicates the time atwhich new measurements are collected and the yellow star denotes the time at which the respiratoryfailure occurred. (b) The blue stars denote the corresponding PCA projection of the hidden states.
Figure 4: Illustration of (a) dynamic risk predictions and (b) PCA projection of the RNN hiddenstates for a CF patient died from other causes. (a) The gray solid lines indicates the time at whichnew measurements are collected and the yellow star denotes the time at which the other causesoccurred. (b) The blue stars denote the corresponding PCA projection of the hidden states.

Figure 6: Illustration of (a) dynamic risk predictions and (b) PCA projection of the RNN hiddenstates for a CF patient were right-censored. (a) The gray solid lines indicates the time at whichnew measurements are collected and the yellow solid line denotes the time at which the patient isright-censored. (b) The blue stars denote the corresponding PCA projection of the hidden states forthe same patient.
