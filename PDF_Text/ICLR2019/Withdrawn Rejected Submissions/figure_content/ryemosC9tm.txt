Figure 1: Top row: synthetic datasets in three-dimensions; bottom row: two-dimensional embeddingsobtained via AEs with FRD constraints to emulate Sammon’s mapping. Except for the broken Swissroll, AEs with FRD constraints almost perfectly reveal the low-dimensional manifold structure.
Figure 2: Positioning scenario modeled after (Studer et al., 2018). A 32-antenna base-station antennaarray located at the origin extracts CSI from 2000 users in space. Each point represents a user inspace; the points on the “vip” curve model a user that moves in time. The color gradients and “vip”curve enable an easy visual comparison with the learned channel charts shown in Figure 3.
Figure 3: Channel charts learned from the scenario in Figure 2. The channel charts of plain AEsrepresent well the local neighborhood structure, but do not capture the global geometric properties.
