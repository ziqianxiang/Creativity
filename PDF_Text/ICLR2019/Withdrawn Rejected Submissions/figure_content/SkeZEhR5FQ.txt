Figure 1: We illustrate a graph G in (a); a feasible solution and an infeasible solution are shown in(b) and (c) respectively; the corresponding factor graph of the CRF model of the graph G is in (d).
Figure 3: Qualitative Results. Left: association without CRF inference; Right: association afterinference. First row, obvious wrong connections are corrected by inference. In the second rowoccluded people are separated. The samples in the last row are failure cases.
