Figure 1: An illustration of (a) a convolutional layer; (b) the Neural Wavelet Layer. Only onefeature map of each output has been shown.
Figure 2: An illustration of the proposed Pyramid Recurrent Layer, with downsampling ratio of 2.
Figure 3: Detected changes in 3 of 12 dimensions of the synthetic dataset.
Figure 4: AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve) results for the synthetic dataset with three differenttest/train scenarios. η is the tolerance for how close in time a detected change must be to a truechange to be considered a positive. See Appendix A for AUC score tables.
Figure 5: AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve) results for Opportunity and Bee Waggle Dance data. ηis the tolerance with a unit of 1/30 seconds for both dataset. See Appendix B for AUC score tables.
Figure 6: Detected changes on sample (3 of 79 dimensions shown) of Opportunity dataset.
