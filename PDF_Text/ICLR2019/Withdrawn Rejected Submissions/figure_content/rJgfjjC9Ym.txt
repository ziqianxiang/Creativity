Figure 1: Proposed Approach. We show the computations involved in the forward and backwardpass during network training for a single “pre-activation” layer, with possible residual connections.
Figure 2: Approximate Training on CIFAR. (Left) We show the evolution of training and test errorfor ResNet-164 models trained on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 (with four different random seeds foreach case) and find performance of approximate training closely follows that of the exact baseline.
