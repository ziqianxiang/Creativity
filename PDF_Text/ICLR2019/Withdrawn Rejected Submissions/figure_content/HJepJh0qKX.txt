Figure 1: Easy and hard examples of CIFAR-10 dataset and mini ImageNet. a)-d) are examplesfrom CIFAR-10. e)-h) are examples from mini ImageNet.
Figure 2: The result of easy examples in (a) color, (b) shuffle and (c) radial masking experiments inCIFAR-10 and mini ImageNet. The vertical axis is the matching rate between the case with regularexamples and examples from which some patterns are intentionally removed. The model is trainedfor m-epochs with regular data augmentation.
Figure 3: Colored, shuffled and radial masked examples.
Figure 4: The result of ablation and corrupted label experiment. The vertical axis is the accuracy.
Figure 5: The relation between easiness and classification probability of validation examples. Thehorizontal axis is easiness of validation examples. The vertical axis is the average of classificationprobability of validation examples, with 0 indicating that the example is misclassified every timeand with 1 showing that the example is classified correctly every time. a) Result in CIFAR-10. Tocalculate classification probability, we take an average of the outputs of 15 trained WRN 16-4 and 15trained ResNeXt29 4-64d. b) Result in mini ImageNet. To calculate classification probability, wetake an average from the output of 10 trained ResNet 18 and 10 trained DenseNet 121.
