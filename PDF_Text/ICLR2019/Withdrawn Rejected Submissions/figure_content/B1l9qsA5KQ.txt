Figure 2: Sustained-attention driving taskin this study (Fig. 2A), includes 10s baseline, deviation onset, response onset, and response offset(Fig. 2B-C). The next trial occurs within an interval of 5-10s after finishing the current trial. Eachparticipant completed T trials within 1.5h. For each trial i, the EEG signals {xn,i}nN=1 from N dif-ferent channels were recorded simultaneously and the corresponding response time RTi was alsocollected afterwards. If a participant fell asleep during the experiment, there was no feedback towake him up.
Figure 3:	Indegree sequence for BDrank and SVR (closer is better). The root-mean-squared error(RMSE) was also measured between the estimated indegree sequences and the ground truth.
Figure 4:	Reliability of different channels for forty four participants estimated by BDrank. Eachcolumn denotes the states of33 channels for each participant. The channels with estimated reliability0.15 ≤ πn ≤ 0.85 are marked in red.
Figure 5: Directed graph representation of the ranking list S : a > b > c > d. Left Panel: the groundtruth, where {ρi}i6=1 is the constructed preference proposition. Right Panel: the prediction, where{ρ^i} 6=1 is the predicted order for each pairwise comparison. Note that we use the edges marked inred (e.g. {ρ^ι, ρ^3,何}) to denote the wrong predictions.
