Figure 2:	Schematic of the permuted MNIST task protocol.
Figure 3: IGR schematic.
Figure 4: Average test accuracy (over all tasks) on the split MNIST protocol plotted against trainingtime. Each experiment was run 20 times: dots represent individual runs, stars indicate the mean.
Figure 5: Idem as Figure 4, except on the permuted MNIST task protocol.
Figure 6: Randomly selected samples from the generative model after finishing training on task 1, 4,6 and 9 of the permuted MNIST protocol (i.e., examples of what is replayed during task 2, 5, 7 and10). No permutation was applied for task 1. Because after task 6 (or 9), ~17% (or ~11%) of samplesshould correspond to task 1 and should thus be unshuffled digits, this figure shows that at least thequality of those replayed images is far from perfect. Nevertheless, task 1 is not being forgotten.
Figure 7: Grid searches for the split MNIST task protocol. Shown are the average test set accuracies(over all 5 tasks) for the (combination of) hyperparameter-values tested for each method.
Figure 8: Grid searches for the permuted MNIST task protocol.
