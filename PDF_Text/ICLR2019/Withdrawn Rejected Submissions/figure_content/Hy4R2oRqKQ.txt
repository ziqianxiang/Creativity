Figure 1: Graphical diagrams for generative nonlinear CCA variants. The solid lines in each diagramdenote the generative models p。。(z)p0* (*|z). The dashed lines denote the variational approximationqψ* (z|*) to the intractable posterior p0* (z|*).
Figure 2: Overall structure of ACCA. The left panel corresponds to the encoding with holistic informationscheme. For the right panel, the top panel represents the view reconstruction, while the bottom panel embodiesthe adopted adversarial learning scheme, which corresponds to the consistent constraint designed for ACCA.
Figure 3: Visualization of the embeddings obtained for the two views, with each row represents the embeddingsobtained with view X and view Y , respectively. (zx, zy) denote a pair of correspondent embedding. δ indicatesthe misalignment degree of each method. Methods with smaller value of δ are better.
Figure 4: Generated samples given input images with (left) 1 quadrant and (right) 2 quadrants gray coloroverlaid. In each subfigure, the first column is the ground truth. The next three columns show the input for viewX and the corresponding generated image using Bi-VCCA and ACCA, respectively. The last three columns arethe input image from view Y and the corresponding generation results of the two methods.
