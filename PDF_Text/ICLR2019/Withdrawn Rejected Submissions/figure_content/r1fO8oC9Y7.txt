Figure 1: Overall Network. General Network (red dashed box below) encodes the utterance withbi-directional LSTM and decodes cross-domain sketch (CDS) using unidirectional LSTM with at-tention to utterance in all domains. For identical encoding, general utterance encoding and specificutterance encoding share the same encoder while for separate encoding, they are not (see Sec-tion 3.2.2). Then Detailed Network, in one specific domain, encodes CDS and utterance usingbi-directional LSTM, decodes the final target with advanced attention to both utterance and CDS.
