Figure 1: Validation losses for each of the 10 projects, averaged across 5 runs. Randomly initializedembeddings shown in purple, Java in green, C in blue, Python in red, and English in orange.
Figure 2: Overlap vs. speedup/improvement on all project-embedding combinations. Points arecolored: green for Java embeddings, blue for C embeddings, red for Python embeddings and orangefor English embeddings.
