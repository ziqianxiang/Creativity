Figure 1: Representative random samples from the model trained on (a) MNIST, (b) Toronto FacesDataset and (c) CIFAR-10.
Figure 2: Samples corresponding to the samelatent variable values at different points in timewhile training the model on CIFAR-10. Each rowcorresponds to a sample, and each column corre-sponds to a particular point in time.
Figure 3: Linear interpolation between samples in code space. The first image in every row isan independent sample; all other images are interpolated between the previous and the subsequentsample. Images along the path of interpolation are shown in the figure arranged from from left toright, top to bottom. They also wrap around, so that images in the last row are interpolations betweenthe last and first samples.
Figure 4: Comparison of samples and their nearest neighbours in the training set. Images in odd-numbered columns are samples; to the right of each sample is its nearest neighbour in the trainingset.
