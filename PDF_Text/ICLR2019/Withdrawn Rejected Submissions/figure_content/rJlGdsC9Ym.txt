Figure 1: The agent (in red) receives a reward of 1 when it picks up the blue ball in the adjacentroom. To do so, it has to first open the gray box, take the key inside and then open the locked door.
Figure 2: GAmax Window, GAmax Linreg andGProp Linreg algorithms were each tested with10 different agents (seeds) on the BlockedUn-lockPickup curriculum. The median return dur-ing training, between the first and last quartile,are plotted.
Figure 3: GAmax Window, GAmax Linreg andGProp Linreg algorithms were each tested with10 different agents (seeds) on the KeyCorridorcurriculum. The median return during training,between the first and last quartile, are plotted.
Figure 4: The agent with seed 6 was trained onthe BlockedUnlockPickup curriculum using thebaseline algorithm. The return and probabilityduring training are plotted. Two particular mo-ments of the training are framed.
Figure 5: 10 agents (seeds) were trained on theObstructedMaze curriculum using the baselinealgorithm. The mean return and mean probabil-ity during training are plotted.
Figure 6: GProp Linreg and MR with δ = 0.6were each tested with 10 different agents (seeds)on the KeyCorridor curriculum. The median re-turn during training, between the first and lastquartile, are plotted.
Figure 7: GProp Linreg and MR with δ = 0.6were each tested with 10 different agents (seeds)on the ObstructedMaze curriculum. The medianreturn during training, between the first and lastquartile, are plotted.
Figure 8: BlockedUnlockPickup curriculum. In Unlock, the agent has to open the locked door. In theothers, it has to pick up the box. In UnlockPickup, the door is locked and, in BlockedUnlockPickup,it is locked and blocked by a ball. The position and color of the door and the box are random.
Figure 9: KeyCorridor curriculum. The agent has to pick up the ball. However, the ball is in alocked room and the key in another room. The number of rooms and their size gradually increase.
Figure 10: ObstructedMaze curriculum. The agent has to pick up the blue ball. The boxes hide akey. A key can only open a door of its color. The number of rooms and the difficulty opening doorsincrease.
