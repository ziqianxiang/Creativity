Figure 3: The generated MNIST-like images. From top to bottom, the number of training epochs is1,2, 3,4and5.
Figure 4: The decreasing curve of three network structures (standard: standard neural network, fc:fully-connected G-CapsNet, conv: convolutional G-CapsNet) with white-box attack5 ConclusionG-CapsNet incorporates matrix transformation and capsule routing procedures into the whole op-timization process which gets rid of the set of routing times for each capsule layer and guaranteesthe convergence. The two versions of G-CapsNet (fully-connected G-CapsNet and convolutionalG-CapsNet) achieve better performance on MNIST and CIFAR10 by using much fewer parameters.
