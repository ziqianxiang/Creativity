Figure 1: Tcy images to illustrate the importance Of αdering fordassification. The two images in this context are of the same dass. TheIdbel CaQ be 'digits Q-9,give more details, upon elaboration of the context, the labeler can quickly scan a) and realize that it is apicture of digits 0 through 9. Similarly, b) would be classified as such, but analyzing and classifying b)can cost more time because the labeler must ensure every digit is present (we encourage the readers to dothe experim ent). It's the time cost that is of interest to us in the context of learnin g systems. The mereordering of the numbers enables the labeler to classify a) faster than b).

Figure 4: Accuracy in validation classification as a function of training iterations of CIFAR100 (top) andCATSvsDOGS (bottom) datasets using Inception network architecture. We show training (left and testing(right) results of all the similarity and statistical measure-based patch ordering techniques: patch orderingusing mutual information (MI, yellow) between adjacent samples outperforms all other techniques.

Total training loss (top) and regularization loss (bottom) for Unmodifiecdataset, and datasets modified by applying Algorithm 1 using the MI metric and patch sizes 4x4, 8x8 an16x16). The overall size of each sample is 32 by 32.
