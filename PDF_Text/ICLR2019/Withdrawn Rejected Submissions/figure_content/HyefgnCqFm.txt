Figure 1: Illustration of the two multi-steps prediction strategies - SSE and MSRE - introduced insection 3.2.
Figure 2: Predicted dynamics for the Euler equations for horizons t + l = 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 1 horizonper column. All algorithms have received as input the same 3 initial images (not shown here).
Figure 3: Predicted dynamics for the Navier Stokes equations with R = 100000 for t + l =4, 8, 12, 16, 20, each algorithm having received the same 3 initial images (not shown here). Top2 rows correspond to the simulation which in our context is the ground truth. First row is the gener-ated density and second one is the velocity vector field. For the latter, each point is two dimensional,the color code is provided in the appendix. Rows 3 and 4 give the predictions obtained with a JTMSRE model, rows 5 and 6 the ones for the PT one.
Figure 4: Predicted dynamics for the Navier Stokes equations with R = 5000 for t + l =4, 8, 12, 16, 20, each algorithm having received the same 3 initial images (not shown here). Top2 rows correspond to the simulation which in our context is the groundtruth. First row is the gener-ated density and second one is the velocity vector field. Rows 3 and 4 give the predictions obtainedwith a JT MSRE model, rows 5 and 6 the ones for the PT one.
