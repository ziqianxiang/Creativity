Figure 1: Figure shows the block diagram of the encoder and fully connected layers. Encoderconsists of a bidirectional LSTM followed by a max pooling layer. For classification, we use a MLPwith two hidden layers.
Figure 2: Comparison between Skip-thought and WordShuffle encoders across different sentencelengths. Classification accuracy is shown for (a) MR and (b) SST sentiment classification tasks.
Figure 3: Figure shows the test accuracies on WordShuffle task, downstream sentiment classificationtask (CR, SST) and probing task (ObjNum, BShift) for different training epochs. Convergence onthe fake sentence task roughly corresponds to convergence on downstream tasks.
