Figure 1: Overview of our relational modelof this paper. They sometimes make use of composition functions, so our work could still be relevantto them in some respect.
Figure 2: Scoring function values according to different composition functions. s1 and R are fixedand color brightness reflects likelihood of (s1, R, s2) for each position of s2 embedding. (b) and (d)are respectively more expressive than (a) and (c).
