Figure 1:	Pearson correlation r between translation quality and word alignment captured by theprediction difference method for Overall, CFS and CFT target words.
Figure 2:	An example of word alignment and translation produced by SMT and NMT systems. Redarrow means wrong alignment and blue arrow means the prediction is attributed to a target word.
