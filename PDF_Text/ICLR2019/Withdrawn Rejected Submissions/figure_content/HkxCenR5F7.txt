Figure 1: a) A variational recurrent model with stochastic recurrent connections (red arrows); (b)Proposed model with no latent stochastic variables dependencies and with stochastic generation;(c) An example of stochastic generation, with a particular choice of Gaussian stochastic generationdistribution; (d) The complete generation process of our model, where each xk is generated withsome probability by each zt . Throughout, dashed lines indicate generation given samples of latentvariables, and double-headed arrows indicate bidirectional recurrent connections. In (a,b), only onelayer of deterministic hidden states ht is shown, but any number can be used.
Figure 2: a) A model with hierarchical latent variables. The additional latent variable yt is task-specific. b) A multi-view recurrent variational model, RecVCCAP. This is a recurrent extension ofvariational canonical correlation analysis with private variables (VCCAP, Wang et al., 2016). c) Thehierarchical version ofb, RecVCCAP+H.
