Figure 1: The illustration of difference between traditional GAN and DSGAN.
Figure 2: DSGAN generatedboundary points of a swissroll.
Figure 3: Left: A circle which the density is low in the center.
Figure 4: The illustration about generating boundary data around training data. First, the convolutionof Pd and normal distribution makes the density on boundary data be no longer zero. Second, Weseek pg such that Eq. (1) holds, where the support set of pg is approximated by the difference ofthose between Pd and of pd.

Figure 8: The illustration of applications related to unseen data.
