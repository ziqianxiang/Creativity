Figure 1: Diffusion wavelets Ψj for increasing scale j left to right, applied to diracs centered at twodifferent locations (marked by red circles) in two different graphs. Vertex colors indicate waveletvalues (corresponding to colorbars for each plot), ranging from yellow/green indicating positivevalues to blue indicating negative values. Both graphs are freely available from PyGSP (2018).
Figure 2: Illustration of (a) the proposed scattering feature extraction (see eqs. 3, 4, and 5), and (b)its application for graph classification.
Figure 3: Classification accuracy (by percent correct) of the proposed method (GSC) and 14 othermethods. The aggregated results in (a) are based on five biochemistry datasets and four social graphdatasets. CCN is omitted from this table, as its accuracy is only reported for a handful of datasets;instead, a detailed comparison of GSC (FCL-unnorm.) with CCN is shown in (b).
Figure 4: Comparison of EC exchange preferences in enzyme evolution: (a) observed in Cuestaet al. (2015), and (b) inferred from scattering features via (c). Our inference (b) mainly recovers (a).
Figure 5: Accuracy ± standard deviation for GSC (SVM-norm.) and top six other methods on twoREDDIT datasets. GSC achieves state of the art accuracy on these datasets.
