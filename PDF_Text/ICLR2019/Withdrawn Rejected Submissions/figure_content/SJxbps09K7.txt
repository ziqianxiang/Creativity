Figure 1: Correlation of UBDI performance (P@1;x-axis) with Procrustes fit (y-axis)and Cebuano is not a result of GANs beinga poor estimator of the linear transforms, but rather a result of there not being a good linear transformfrom English into these languages.4Isomorphism and isospectrality We briefly compare Procrustes fit to two similarity measures fornearest neighbor graphs of vector spaces, introduced in S0gaard et al. (2018). The nearest neighbor1https://github.com/facebookresearch/MUSE2https://polyglot.readthedocs.io/3https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/crawl-vectors.html4We also experimented with learning non-linear alignment using GANs with non-linear generators, specifi-cally, a generator with two hidden layers connected by a non-linearity. Our results on Spanish were much poorerthan with linear generators, as expected: 35.9 with tanh; 0.0 with sigmoid; 21.4 with relu. On Cebuano, wherethe linear generator failed, we observed the same result with all three non-linear approaches: P@1 = 0.0 (Allnumbers are averaged over 5 runs).
Figure 2: Follow-up experiments on Greek (el) and Hungarian (hu)using PCA initialization with 50 dimensions. We ran experiments with 25, 50, and 100 dimensions,with or without pruning, observing significant drops in performance across the board.
