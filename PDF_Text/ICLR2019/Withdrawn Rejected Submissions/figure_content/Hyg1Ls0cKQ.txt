Figure 1: Examples of the manifold. Left: a complex manifold which can be seen in general models,Right: a relatively simple manifold in the proposed model. The midpoint M of A and B can be easilycalculated in the right manifold, but not in the left one. The midpoint of A and B is computed as N inthe left manifold, which is incorrect.
Figure 2: (a) The process of pre-defining a latent space. The LSC-VAE is trained to project the datainto the appropriate position on latent space. (b) Generating process of the proposed method. Thelatent space is pre-defined in the process of (a).
Figure 3: The generated images. The images are shown in each column according to the featuresbelow the columns.
Figure 4: Interpolation between a series between images in leftmost and rightmost columns.
Figure 5: The result of generating inverse-features. Our proposed model automatically learns inversefeatures such as dark skin (inverse of ’pale skin’) and frown (inverse of ’smile’).
