Figure 3:	Distribution of variables and clauses in each datasetformulas that our CNN model predicts to be UNSAT (Lines 1-3). We assign random values (trueor false) to the variables and use our model to predict them (Lines 10-12). Note that we assignvariables one by one based on the order of variables (Line 8). Then, we store the result and the newCNF (Line 13). After obtaining prediction results for all variables, we select a specific number (i.e.,N) of predicted variables ranked by probability (Line 14). Reducing the original CNF formula withthese partial assignments yields a new, simplified CNF formula, which is fed to an existing solver(Line 15). At the end, we merge the predicted partial assignment with the solver result to constructan assignment if the solver finds a satisfiable assignment (Lines 16-17). Otherwise we regard theformula as UNKNOWN (Line 18).
