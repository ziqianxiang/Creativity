Figure 1: Example of a patient’s predicted distributions for age of death under different models. Ourproposed techniques improve sharpness of predicted distributions, subject to calibration. Repeatedinteractions (indicated by darker color) between the patient and the EHR yield more confidentpredictions of time of death.
Figure 2: Graphical intuition for the Survival-CRPS scoring rule. For uncensored observations, weminimize mass before and after the observed time of event. For right-censored observations, weminimize mass before observed time of censoring. For interval-censored observations, we minimizemass before observed time of censoring, and mass after the time by which event must have occurred.
Figure 3: RNN model overview. For each interaction, we attend over recorded ICD codes at thattimestep and predict parameters μ, σ2 of a log-normal distribution, minimizing a proper scoring rule.
Figure 4: Calibration plots for each of the models. We compare predicted cumulative densities againstobserved event frequencies, evaluated at quantiles of predicted cumulative density. Right-censoredobservations are removed from consideration in quantiles past times of censoring, interval-censoredobservations are additionally re-introduced in quantiles corresponding to times past 120 years.
Figure 5: Median predicted time to death (with 95% intervals) for individual patients from theinterval-censored Survival-CRPS model. Our model gives more confident predictions upon repeatedinteractions between patients and the EHR. True times to death generally lie within predicted intervals.
Figure 6: Discrimination and calibration of predictions from the interval-censored Survival-CRPSmodel, evaluated as predictions for a dichotomous outcome at 6 months, 1 year, and 5 years.
Figure 7: Calibration plots for each of the models in MIMIC-III. We compare predicted cumulativedensities against observed event frequencies, evaluated at quantiles of predicted cumulative density.
