Figure 1: (Left) Fluorescently labeled active microtubule suspension confined to a 300 μm diameterwell. +1 and - 2 defects are labeled as magenta arrows and blue dots with three prongs, respec-tively. Yellow arrow indicates the direction of net circulation in the sample. (Right) Schematicrepresentation of topological defects. Black lines indicate the director field, yellow arrows indicatethe active flow created by the collective motion of microtubules Doostmohammadi et al. (2018).
Figure 2: Snapshots from Each Training Dataset: fluorescently labelled microtubules in microfluidicwells ranging from 300-500μm in diameter. The first image is from a dataset of 6000 images andthe rest each has 100 images.
Figure 3: Snapshots from Each Testing Dataset: fluorescently labelled microtubules in microfluidicwells ranging from 300-500μm in diameter. The first image is from a dataset of 1500 images andthe rest each has 100 images.
Figure 4: Life ofa +1/2 Defect: from top-left to bottom-right shows the moving trajectory ofa +1/2defect from nucleation to annihilation. +1/2 defects are labeled by green boxes; -1/2 defects arelabeled by red boxes; the nucleation process is labeled by magnum boxes; the annihilation processis labeled by yellow box. The diameter of the microfluidic wells in this figure is 300μm.
Figure 5: Experimental Data: fluorescently labelled microtubules in microfluidic wells With 400μmin diameter.(Left: sample image with +1/2 and -1/2 defects labeled; Right: sample image containing+1/2 defects with 2 drastically different configurations and sizes.)3.3	Image AugmentationAside from normal image augmentation such as jitter and scaling, we added a random flipping andrandom rotation to the training images. Since the region of a defect is anisotropic, rotating the imageeffectively increase the robustness of the model.
Figure 6: F1-Score Over Different Region: the detecting results evaluated on 1500 images fromtesting dataset. The three numbers represent the overall F1-score of all the detecting results madelocated within the marked region. The boundaries are set to be the 1/3 and 2/3 of the radius.

Table3 shows the detection rates for the two methods. The traditional method is executed with a Desk-top equipped with RAM: 16GB; CPU: Intel Core i5-2400 @ 3.1 Ghz; GPU: NVIDEA GeForceGTS 450. We perform our data processing, model training, and detection on a machine equippedwith RAM: 128GB; CPU: 2×Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2637 v3 @ 3.50GHz; GPU: NVIDIA Cor-poration GP102 [TITAN X]. Although our method is operated by a machine with much strongercomputational ability, our method’s significant advantage in speed is still obvious.
