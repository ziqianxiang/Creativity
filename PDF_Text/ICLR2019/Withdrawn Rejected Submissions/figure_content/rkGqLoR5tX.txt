Figure 1: ROC-AUC of prediction time outlier detection on Fashion-MNIST detecting strong out-liers represented by shoes (left) and subtle outliers represented as excluded non-shoe garments(right). Results from MC-dropout are shown as horizontal dashed lines.
Figure 2: ROC-AUC of prediction time outlier detection on Cats and Dogs experiment detectingstrong outliers represented by cars (top row) and subtle outliers represented as horses (bottom row).
Figure 3: F1-score (top), precision (middle) and recall (bottom) of outlier detection for the wordsused as outliers in the Speech Commands experiment comparing MC-Dropout and ODIN. Scoresfor AND- or OR-combining RSS and Mahal classifications are included to show how they influencethe precision and recall ratio.
