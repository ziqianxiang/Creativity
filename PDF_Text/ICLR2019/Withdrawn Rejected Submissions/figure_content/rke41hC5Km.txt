Figure 2: Stock-GAN architectureArchitecture: The architecture is shown in Figure 2. Our proposed WGAN is conditional (Mirza& Osindero, 2014) with both the generator and critic conditioned on a k length history and the timeinterval âˆ†t. The history is condensed to one vector using a single LSTM layer. This vector andsome uniform noise is fed to a fully connected layer layer followed by a convolutional structure.
