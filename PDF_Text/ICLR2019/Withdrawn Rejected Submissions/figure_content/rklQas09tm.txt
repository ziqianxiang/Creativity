Figure 1: Examples of the corresponded rationales for QA. Words highlighted in the same colorfrom the question and a passage is a paired rationale. “Galileo Galilei” is the correct answer sincetwo facts from the question are matched in its passage. On the other hand, the passage of “IsaacNewton” does not cover the second fact, which makes it a wrong answer.
Figure 2: The architecture of the rationale generator. The model is comprised of (a) a module foridentifying rationales on q, (b) a rationale re-encoding module, and (c) a component for generatingcorresponding rationales on p. The sentence encoder is shared across all modules.
Figure 3: Examples of the corresponded rationales extracted from the SciTailfactwise dataset. Ratio-nales are highlighted in different color. Text spans from the hypothesis and premise with the samecolor indicate a corresponded match. If a word in the premise is selected by two rationale pairs (e.g.
