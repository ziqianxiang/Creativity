Figure 1: Comparison of distributions of node correlations after training two deep network modelson MNIST. The horizontal axis indicates the Pearson coefficient and the vertical axis indicate thedensity.
Figure 2: Variance in the saturation area increases the probability to have gradient information, bywhich dropout generates gradients.
Figure 3: Distributions of net values to tanh for the MNIST test data.
Figure 4:	(a) Gradient acceleration function, and (b,c) two shape functions for two activationfunctions.
Figure 5:	Distributions of net values to tanh for the MNIST test data.
