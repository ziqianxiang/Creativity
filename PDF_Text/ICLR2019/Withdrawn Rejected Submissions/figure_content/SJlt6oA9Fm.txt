Figure 1: (a) An illustration of channel de-allocation and re-allocation procedures. The higher thesaturation of the channel color, the higher the ECDS value. (b) The overall structure of SCU.
Figure 2: The kernel enlargingeffect of spatial shifting.
Figure 3: Ablation study on SCU. The model configurations for (b, c) are presented in Table 4. (a)Comparison of error rates between SCU (green) and the ablation on shifting (red). (b) Histogramson ECDS for all the channels of SCUs, using neither dealloc nor realloc. (c) Comparisons ofthe number of de-allocated channels and error rates. Here, allthe models are trained with dealloc.
Figure 4: Pixel-wise input distributions of a layer in DenseNet-40 model. (a, b) Empirical distribu-tions of three randomly chosen pixels in a fixed channel of input, which are inferred from CIFAR-10test dataset. (c, d) Scatter plots between empirical mean and standard deviation of each pixel dis-tributions, plotted for 3 representative channels in the input. Each plot consists 1,024 points, as achannel have 32 × 32 pixels. Pixels in boundaries are specially marked as ×.
