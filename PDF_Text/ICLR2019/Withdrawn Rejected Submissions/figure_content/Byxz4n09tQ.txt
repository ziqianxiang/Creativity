Figure 1: Student performance for L2 logit-matching compression as training progresses on CIFAR-10 (see Sec. 3). The teacher and student are NIN and LeNet with test accuracies of 78.1% and 66.2%(red dashed curve in (a)) when trained without compression. Compression is performed using onlyreal training data (blue curve), only synthetic GAN data (green curve), or a mixture of trainingdata and GAN data (orange curve, pf ake = 0.8). Results are averaged over 3 independent studenttraining runs.
Figure 2: Student test accuracies in four experiments using the CIFAR-10 compression setup ofFig. 1. We report the average of 3 independent runs. See Sec. 3 for more details.
Figure 3: (a-e) Test accuracy (Higgs) and test AUC (Evergreen and MAGIC) of the learned studentin random forest compression. Here a 500 tree forest is compressed into a compact random for-est. When the student is trained directly on training data without compression (‘Student Only’), itsperformance is given by the blue dashed curve. (a-d) Compression is carried out on only trainingdata (orange curve), on only GAN data (green curve) or on a mixture of the training data and GANdata (red curve). (e) Without compression, the student is trained for the original supervised learningtask using only GAN data (green curve) or a mixture of the training data and GAN data (red curve).
