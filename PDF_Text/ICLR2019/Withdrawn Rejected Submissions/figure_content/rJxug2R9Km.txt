Figure 1: Comparison of algorithms on 300 classification problems. (Left) Comparison of allexploration algorithms using the empirical cumulative distribution function of the relative progressivevalidation return G (upper-right is optimal). The curves for -decreasing & -greedy coincide.
Figure 2: Win statistics: each (row, col-umn) entry shows the number of times therow algorithm won against the column, mi-nus the number of losses.
Figure 3: Comparison of trainingMêlée with all the features (§ 3.1, y-axis) vs training using only the cali-brated prediction probabilities (x-axis).
