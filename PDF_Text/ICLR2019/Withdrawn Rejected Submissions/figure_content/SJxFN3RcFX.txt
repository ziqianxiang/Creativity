Figure 1: Left: Sampled functionals by FUncHMC and samples generated by HMC. Right: Ratiodistribution of benchmark to FuncHMC or HMC (The closer to the black line y = 1 the better).
Figure 2: Empirical cumulative distribution function of predictive entropy (The lower the better).
Figure 3: Uncertainty estimation on adversarial data.
Figure 4: Left: Training curve. Right: Validation curve.
