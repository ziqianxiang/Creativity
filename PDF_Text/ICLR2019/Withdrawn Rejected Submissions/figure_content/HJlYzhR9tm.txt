Figure 1:	Two possible parse trees for the sentence “I shot an elephant in my pajamas.”To analyze the syntactic information learned by the model, we visualize the attentions generated whileprocessing each word. For each word, we plot its attention weights on all GTCN layers.
Figure 2:	Attentions generated when processing target words marked with red. The upper plots show theattention weights, and the lower figures show the possible underlying syntactic structures.
