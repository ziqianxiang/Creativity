Figure 1: Estimation of p(c|x) via humans. a. Experiment web interface for our human catego-rization task. Participants categorized each image from an order-randomized circular array of theCIFAR10 labels. b. Examples of images and their human choice proportions. For many images(upper plane and cat), choices are unambiguous, matching the CIFAR10 labels. For others (lowerboat and bird), humans are far less certain, even without time constraints.
Figure 2: Change in loss (∆L) for human targets, original CIFAR10 targets, and CIFAR10.1targets after fine-tuning using original CIFAR10 targets (red) or CIFAR10H targets (blue). Average∆L across models for each training condition is represented by a dashed horizontal line.
Figure 3: Representative fine-tuning results for densenet, on our data (left) and original cifar labels(right). Results are shown for a learning rate of 0.001, and with a seed of 0.
