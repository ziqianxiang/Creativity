Figure 1: An illustration of the pipeline for our proposed conscious inference on YOLOv3.
Figure 2: The visualization of consistent improvement of detection bbox in a sample image. Redbbox is the ground-truth, green bbox is the baseline result and blue bbox is our conscious inferenceresult.

Figure 4: (a): Different strategies to generate combined perturbation Pbroc + Porbj + Pcrls. (b):Ablation study on using different components. (c): Detection performance across inference rounds.
Figure 5: The visualization of detection improvement on COCO minival based on YOLOv3 detec-tor. The red bbox is the ground-truth, green bbox is the detection result from baseline (one-wayinference) and blue bbox is the detection result from our conscious inference (iter-1).
Figure 6: The visualization of detection improvement on (a) COCO minival and (b) VOC 2007datasets based on Faster R-CNN detector. The red bbox is the ground-truth, green bbox is thedetection result from baseline (one-way inference) and blue bbox is the detection result from ourconscious inference (iter-1).
