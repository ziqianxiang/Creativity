Figure 1: Preview of a few tasks (blue line) with increasing amount of training samples (red dots).
Figure 2: left: Mean Square Error on increasing dataset size. The baseline corresponds to the samemodel without the KL regularizer. Each value is averaged over 100 tasks and 10 different restart.
Figure 3: top: True function in the original space with 2 observed data points. middle: True posteriordistribution, where the orange dot corresponds to the location of the true underlying function. bottom:Samples from IAFâ€™s learned posterior.
