Figure 1: Image Classification Validation Accuracy6.2	PM2.5 PredictionThe PM2.5 prediction problem is to forecast the particle density of fine atmospheric matter withthe diameter at most 2.5 μm (PM2.5) in the future hours, mainly, for the next 12, 24, 48, 72hours. The datasets used are open data provided by two sources including Environmental ProtectionAdministration (EPA)1 , and Center Weather Bureau (CWB)2 . The EPA dataset contains 21 observedfeatures, including the speed and direction of wind, temperature, relative humidity, PM2.5 and PM10density, etc., from 18 monitoring stations, with one record per hour. The CWB has seventy monitoringstations, one record per 6 hours, containing 26 features, such as temperature, dew point, precipitation,wind speed and direction, etc. We partitioned the observed area into a grid of 1140 km2 with 1 km×1km blocks and aligned the both dataset into one-hour period. We called the two datasets as air qualityand weather condition dataset.
