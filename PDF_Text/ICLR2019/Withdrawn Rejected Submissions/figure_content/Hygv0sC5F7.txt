Figure 1: Failure of GD in learning ReLU modelsProof of Example 1Consider the first iteration. Note that the sample z3 has label -1, and from the illustration of Figure 1(left) we have w0|x3 < 0, w0|x2 < 0 and w0|x1 > 0. Therefore, only the sample z1 contributes tothe gradient, which is given byVw0L(w0) = - exp(-w0|x1)x1 .	(4)11Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2019By the update rule of GD, we obtain that for all twt+1 = Wt + Î· exp(-w|xi)xi.	(5)By telescoping eq. (5), it is clear that any wt|x2 < 0 for all t since x1|x2 < 0. This implies that thesample z2 is always misclassified.
