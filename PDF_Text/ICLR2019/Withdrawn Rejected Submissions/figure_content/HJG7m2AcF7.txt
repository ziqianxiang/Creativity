Figure 1: Illustration of Context Mover's Distance(CMD) (Eq. 3) between elephant & mammal (whenrepresented with their distributional estimates andusing entailment ground metric discussed in Sec-tion 7). Here, we pick four contexts at randomfrom a list of top 20 contexts (in terms of PPMI)for the two histograms. Then we plot the trans-portation matrix (or transport map) T obtained inthe process of computing CMD. Note how 'ivory'adjusts its movement towards 'skin’ (as in skincolor) to allow 'poaching, to be easily moved to‘endangered, as going to other contexts of 'mam-mal' is costlier for ‘poaching', thus focussing onan overall transport cost minimization.
Figure 2: Illustration of three words, each with their histograms (left), as well as the point estimatesOfthe relevant contexts (middle), and then jointly as their distributional estimates (right). The rightfigure shows how the support (i.e. context words) of histograms gets assigned on the manifold. Forexample, the red bars are still associated to the histogram of 'Tennis'，but are located at the positionof the context vectors of ‘Tennis’ in the ground space.
Figure 3: Effect of the number of clusters (K) on validation performance. A, B, C correspond to thethree best performing variants of CoMB obtained as per validation on STS16 and as presented inthe Table 1. In particular, A denotes the hyperparameter setting of [(α=0.55, β=1, s=5], B refersto [α=0.55, β=0.5, s=5] and C denotes [α=0.15, β=0.5, s=1]. The ‘avg’ plot shows the averagetrend across these three configurations.
