The first and last terms quantify the contribution of clip(x, α)to the expected mean-square-error. Note that for symmetrical distributions around zero (e.g., Gaus-sian N(0, σ2) or Laplace(0, b)) these two terms are equal and their sum can therefore be evaluatedby multiplying any of the terms by 2.

Figure 3: Accuracy degradation as a function of quantization level: much smaller and predictableaccuracy degradation with optimal clipping. Red curve represents the standard GEMMLOWP quan-tization method; yellow curve represents the accuracy of our method, assuming Laplace distribution;blue curve represents the accuracy of our method, assuming Gaussian distribution; green curve rep-resents the accuracy of our method when using both types of distributions; the distribution with thebetter estimate for the mean-square-error is selected (predicted either by Equation 9 or Equation 12).
