Figure 2: The partitioning of the patient timelines into input history and output prediction labelsas well as the subpartioning of the input history into time-bins. Each tick on the x-axis representsone month. The first two years of information is used as input and the final nine months is used togenerate output prediction labels. These first two years are subdivided into six bins of the followinglengths for featurization: one year, six months, three months, one month, one month, and one month.
Figure 3: Frequency binned per-label AUROC and average precision (AP) for less frequent labelswith at most 1,000 positive examples. AUROC and AP are calculated independently for each indi-vidual label. Labels are then grouped into bins determined by the number of positive samples perlabel and average statistics are computed for each bin. The x-axis is in log-scale and represents thenumber of possible examples for the center of each bin. Each line represents the type of model, withthe baseline model differing between the disease prediction and protein function prediction tasks.
Figure 4: The cumulative frequency distribution for the target labels in the various tasks. The x-axisis in log scale.
