Figure 1: Simulation result for the Gaussian case (Example 4.1): (a) The time traces of the particles;(b) The KL-divergence as a function of time.
Figure 2: Simulation result for the non-Gaussian case (Example 4.2): (a) The time traces of theparticles; (b) The KL-divergence as a function of time.
Figure 3: Simulation-based comparison of the performance of the accelerated algorithm 1 usingthe diffusion map (DM) approximation (19), the density estimation (DE)-based approximation (20)with the MCMC and HMCMC algorithms: (a) the mean-squared error (m.s.e) (21) as a function ofthe number of samples N ; (b) the m.s.e as a function of the number of iterations; (c) the averagecomputational time per iteration as a function of the number of samples; (d) m.s.e comparisonbetween the diffusion map and the density estimation-based approaches as a function of the kernelbandwidth .
