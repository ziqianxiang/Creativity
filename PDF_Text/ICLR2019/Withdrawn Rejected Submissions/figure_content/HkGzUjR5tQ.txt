Figure 1: The general architecture of proposed models.
Figure 2:	Comparison with Different Target Data Ratio, where AT stands for adversarial training, F(P)-Transfer denotes the DATNet-F(P) without AT.
Figure 3:	The viSualization of extracted featureS from Shared bidirectional-LSTM layer. The left, middle,and right figureS Show the reSultS when no AdverSarial DiScriminator (AD), AD, and GRAD iS performed,reSpectively. Red pointS correSpond to the Source CoNLL-2003 EngliSh exampleS, and blue pointS correSpondto the target CoNLL-2002 SpaniSh exampleS.
