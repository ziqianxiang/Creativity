Figure 1: The learned 2d representation of the datapoints (colored by label) as the penalty weightchanges. We see that indeed, the two features become decorrelated as we increase the weight.
Figure 2: MNIST Autoencoder. First: Orthonormality loss on testing set as we change the penaltyweight. Second: RMSE reconstruction error and average absolute pairwise feature correlation onthe testing set across different penalty weight setttings. Third: Correlation heat map trained with nopenalty. Fourth: Correlation heat map trained with penalty weight 1. We show the absolute valuesof the correlations.
Figure 3: For two of our datasets, we show the pareto frontiers for the testing error vs constraintviolation trade-off over the runs of our method obtained from the grid search on the single constantlearning rate and the orthogonality penalty term.
