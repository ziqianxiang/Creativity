Figure 1: Algorithm for CRM (toy example)are maximally supported RVs, since ψ2 = 1. Thus, Corollary 1 reads: If any user likes item 2, thenthis causally implies that he/she likes all other items in the training set.
Figure 2: Performance of proposed methodsample u ∈ U at location i ∈ I of the DNA. In this setting, the set Kolmogorov elementary events,{ωι,…，ω0}, represents the various genes that might be involved. Consequently, our approachmodels the probability that a set of genes is expressed as a convex mixture of D various genes. Werecall that this intuition follows from our model and is not enforced explicitly. More importantly,the causal relations can identify groups of DNA locations for which the expression of a gene (or itsabsence) in a given location implies its presence (or its absence) for all other locations in the group.
Figure 3: Training performance of proposed method for REGED0 dataseta basis for finding causal relations. We identified 10 DNA locations corresponding to the highestβi as: {813, 250, 774, 706, 380, 49, 477, 162, 740, 702}. For instance, the highest influence scoreof .1612 at DNA location 813 allowed to identify a set, S, of 161 different locations which arecausally related to DNA location 813. More specifically, the expression (or absence) of a givengene in location 813 implies its expression (or absence) in all other DNA locations in S. Whilesimilar relations are possible using gene analysis methods, the above causal relations follow from ourrigorous mathematical framework.
