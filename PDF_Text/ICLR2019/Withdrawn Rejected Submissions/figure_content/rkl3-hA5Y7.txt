Figure 1: Architecture of HRRLMs. (a) Chunk-level HRRLM. (b)Word-level HRRLM. (c) Step 1and 2 of chunk-level model encoding. (d) Step 3 of chunk-level model encoding. See Section 3 fordetails.
Figure 2: t-SNE visualizations for two sets of filler embeddings (blue and orange).
Figure 3: Examples of ROC curves for two categories. The left figure is for a syntax-driven catego-rization of gerunds, while the right is a semantics-driven categorization of plural verbs. Isometric-big-f1 means the first filler embedding, and Isometric-big-f2 the second.
Figure 4: ROC for every syntactic category in the first set of categorization experiments (syntax-driven).
Figure 5: ROC for every syntactic category in the second set of categorization experiments(semantics-driven).
