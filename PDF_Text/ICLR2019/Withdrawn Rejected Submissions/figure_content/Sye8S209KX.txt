Figure 1: (a) Weights learned by transfer tasks for contextualized vectors (ELMo, CoVe), and sen-tence vectors which refer to a concatenation of all the private and shared encoders of the adversarialshared-private multi-task model. (b) Weights learned by the transfer tasks for private (task-specific)and shared encoders of adversarial shared private multi-task model.
Figure 2: Comparing test performances of superVised learning (using BCN), word (ELMo) andsentence leVel representations (Sent2Vec, GenSen) and their combination (ComboRep refers toSent2Vec + GenSen + ELMo) on SST and SICK-E tasks as the training dataset size is Varied.
