Figure 1: Experimental results under DenseNet-100 model and CIFAR-10 dataset. (a) Test accuracycomparison when the labels of a given proportion of training samples are flipped to other labelsuniformly at random. Visualization of features on the penultimate layer using t-SNE from (b) testsamples (same colors indicate same classes) and (c) training samples when the noise fraction is 20%.
Figure 2: Experimental results under ResNet-34 model and CIFAR-10 dataset. (a) Test accuracy ofgenerative classifiers computed at different basic blocks. (b) Test accuracy on various adversarialattacks when the model is trained on clean dataset. (c) Test accuracy of generative classifiers frompenultimate features under various assumptions: identity covariance and tied covariance (LDA).
