In the firstwe train the networks with varying sample sizes of MNIST training set and test them on the entireMNIST test set. And in the second experiment we do the same as the first with the inputs in trainand test augmented with random rotations in the range [-180° , 180°]. From Figure 5, we can seethat rotation equivariant networks achieve their best performance safely using 10k - 30k trainingsamples. This confirms that rotation equivariant networks do reduce training sample size.
