Figure 1: Illustration of the spatio-temporal autoencoder architecture. The parameters of each blockcorrespond to the convolution configuration (CH - convolution channels; K - kernel size; S - stride).
Figure 2: Summarized results for the MCL-V dataset for both MS-SSIM and PSNR.
Figure 3: An example comparison between two compressed sequences (at similar compression ra-tios), one produced by our network, the other by H.264/AVC. A detailed zoom shows that distortionsproduced by our approach are more natural. The image can be zoomed to analyze other details.
Figure 4: A grid of the individual MS-SSIM results for each one of the 10 considered video clipsof the MCL-V dataset (with the same name as in the article for the dataset). The legend of the lastgraph applies to all the graphs in the grid.
Figure 5: A grid of the individual PSNR (measured in dB) results for each one of the 10 consideredvideo clips of the MCL-V dataset (with the same name as in the article for the dataset). The legendof the last graph applies to all the graphs in the grid.
