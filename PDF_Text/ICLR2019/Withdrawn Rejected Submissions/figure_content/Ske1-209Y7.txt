Figure 1: Overall model structure for the classification task in Section 4.1. We optimize the archi-tecture of the normal and reduction cells by PDAS. In the re-training phase, We construct the CNNusing the optimized cell architecture with an increased number of cells N.
Figure 2: A conceptual example of the decoded symmetric CAE architecture and the correspondingcategorical variables. The decoder part is automatically decided from the encoder structure as asymmetric manner.
Figure 3: The best cell structures discovered by PDAS in the classification task.
