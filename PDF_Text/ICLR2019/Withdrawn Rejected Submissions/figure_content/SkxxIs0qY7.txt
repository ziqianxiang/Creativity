Figure 1: Process of Cooperative Training.
Figure 2:	Curves of evaluation on JSD, NLLoracle during iterations of CoT under different trainingsettings. To show the hyperparameter robustness of CoT, we compared it with the similar results aswere evaluated in SeqGAN (Yu et al., 2017).
Figure 3:	(a) Curves of training time JSD(GkP) for MLE, SeqGAN and CoT. (b) Curves ofbalancedNLL and real JSD. Both results are from synthetic data experiments. Note that balanced NLL isconsidered to have only a constant translation of the estimated JSD by the mediator.
