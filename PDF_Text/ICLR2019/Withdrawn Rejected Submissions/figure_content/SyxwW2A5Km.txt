Figure 1: The overview of our model structure. For better illustration, we omit the skip connection inthe self-attention and set the number of head to 1.
Figure 2: Percentage accumulation of different feature combinations that arise in the top-k of attentionscore map A. For each of the two experiments, we randomly choose two combinations of featureswith relative strong and weak complementarity. The detailed description of all chosen features islisted in Table 4, where the left sub-figure corresponds to the upper part.
