Figure 1:	Illustration of the GCN and RNN+GCN modules which are used as encoders in ourmodel. The notations are specific to the dialogue history encoder but both the encoders are same forthe query. The GCN encoder is same for the KB except the graph structure.
Figure 2:	Illustration of sequential attention mechanism in RNN+GCN-SeA.
