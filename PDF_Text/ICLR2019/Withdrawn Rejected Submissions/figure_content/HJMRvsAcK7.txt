Figure 1: dynamic pricing framework using DRL with demonstrations on E-commerce platform.
Figure 2: (a) and (b) show the average revenue for 3300 SKUs of shampoos and 4800 SKUs ofcandies respectively in different price levels from 1 to 100 within 3 months. Price level 1 standsfor the lowest price within 3 months and price level 100 stands for the highest. (c) and (d) showthe average revenue conversion rate for shampoos and candies respectively. The numerical value forrevenues and revenue conversion rates are rescalled by dividing the maximum values.
Figure 3: the average revenue conversion rate and price level for 2000 SKUs of luxuries (in sub-figure (a)) and 4000 SKUs of FMCGs (in sub-figure (b)) respectively through 90 days. 0 standsfor the minimum value through 90 days and 1 stands for the maximum value, for both revenueconversion rate and price level. Correlation coefficients for luxuries and FMCGs are -0.57 and 0.15respectively.
Figure 4: (a) and (b) are the rescaled revenue conversion rate and rescaled profit conversion rateplots comparing products priced by DQN and products priced manually. From Day 1 to Day 15,products were in their normal sales prices. DQN group and manual group both had a revenueconversion rate of 0.04, and a profit conversion rate of 0.06. Markdown pricing started from Day 15and ended at Day 30. DQN group achieved a revenue conversion rate of 0.22 on average and manualgroup’s conversion rate is 0.16 for this period (with Day 16 manual group’s revenue conversion raterescaled to 1). In (b), during the markdown season, DQN group obtained a profit conversion rate of0.16, while manual group’s profit conversion rate dropped to -0.04 on average (with Day 16 manualgroup’s profit conversion rate rescaled to -1).
Figure 5: Comparing the DRCR for different groups of similar products. (a) shows two groups ofsimilar products which have similar DRCR within 30 days. The average for group one is rescaled to1.00 and the average for group two becomes 0.99 after rescaling. (b) shows the DRCR for similarproduct groups priced by DQN and control group respectively for 20 days. The averages of DQNgroups is 5.24, with the average of the control group rescaled to 1.00. (c) shows DRCR for similarproduct groups priced by DDPG, DQN and control group for 30 days. The averages of DDPG andDQN pricing groups are 6.07 and 5.03 respectively with the average of the control group rescaled to1.00.
Figure 6: rescaled importance scores for some features. The average of the scores are 0.81, 0.56,0.79 and 0.70 for price features, sales features, customer traffic features and competitiveness featuresrespectively.
