Figure 1: A graph repre-sentation for the formula(x ∨ y) ∧ (x ∨ y).
Figure 2: Computation graph for a formula φ withn variables, the global state Sg of the solver, andthe variable-specific state S1, . . . , Sn of the solver.
Figure 3: A cactus plot describing how manyformulas were solved within growing decisionlimits. Lower and further to the right is better.
Figure 4: A cactus plot comparing the performance of different heuristics, measured in the wallclock time of CADET on formulas in the Reductions set. Lower and further to the right is better.
Figure 5: A cactus plot describing how many formulas were solved within growing decision limitson the Boolean test set. Lower and further to the right is better.
Figure 6:	A cactus plot describing how many formulas were solved within growing decision limitson the Words test set. Lower and further to the right is better.
Figure 7:	A cactus plot describing how many formulas were solved within growing decision limitson the Words30 test set. Lower and further to the right is better. Note that unlike in the other plots,the model Words was not trained on this distribution of formulas, but on the same Words dataset asbefore.
