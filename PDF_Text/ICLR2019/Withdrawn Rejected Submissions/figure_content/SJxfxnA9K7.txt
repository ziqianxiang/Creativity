Figure 1: Discriminator models for image condi-tioning. We propose fusing the features of the in-put and the ground truth or generated image ratherthan concatenating.
Figure 2: Fusion discriminator architecture.
Figure 3: Visualizing Discriminator features using gradient-weighted Class Activation Maps (Grad-CAM) to produce a coarse localization map of the important regions in the image. The fusiondiscriminator passes a stronger and more structured signal on important features in comparison to aconcatenated discriminator.
Figure 4: Comparative analysis of concatenation and fusion discriminators on three different struc-tured prediction tasks, a) Semantic masks to real image transformation b) Semantic segmentation c)Depth Estimation. The fusion discriminator preserves more structural details.
Figure 5: A comparative analysis of concatenation, projection and fusion discriminators on threedifferent structured prediction tasks, i.e., image synthesis, semantic segmentation, and depth estima-tion.
