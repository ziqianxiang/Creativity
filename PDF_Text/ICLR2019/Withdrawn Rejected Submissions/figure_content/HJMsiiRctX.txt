Figure 1: The decision making pipeline, it starts with the CNN having the objective ofimproving the sampling process through estimating α, then a probabilistic intuitive physicsengine samples decisions according probabilities estimated by CNN and simulates samples ina physics simulation. The physics simulations returns the state of the agent after a periodof time Ch (Ch = False if unwanted collision was not observed). Flappy bird is used as anexample here to demonstrate the structure of the model, the results and discussion sectioninclude an implementation of the model.
Figure 2: This figure demonstrates how CNN helps making the process of sampling moreefficient. Frames from the game are inputs to the CNN which outputs α parameters for theDirichlet distribution illustrated in the figure for the case of Flappy Bird. The dashed line ofθfιap = 0.072 corresponds to the probability of flap where bird maintains the same height.
Figure 3: Results of models trained to play Flappy Bird. PB-CNN is the proposed model,PB-UnifOrm is composed of the model proposed without the CNN where the probabilisticprogram starts with an all-ones a parameter. DQN is the model proposed by (Mnih et al.,2015), human data for game play are reported by the web page in (hum, 2017)discussed in the paper here. Under a task of inference about the physics of the world, researchsuggested that humans response rate was in between 500 and 2000 milliseconds dependingon the hardness of the inference task at hand (Hamrick et al., 2015). The urgency of makinga decision leaves no ample time for sampling and simulating the physics of the game thatcould be enough for humans to perform as well as bots.
