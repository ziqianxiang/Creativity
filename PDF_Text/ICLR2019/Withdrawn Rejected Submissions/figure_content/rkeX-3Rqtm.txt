Figure 2: Effect of Varying Search Parameters on Validation AccuracyWhen removing GG and GS from GRLS we lose 12.3% accuracy on MNIST, and we lose a dramatic43.8% on CIFAR-10. Even further, dropping either GG or GS leads to large decrease in accuracy forGRLS on CIFAR-10. This suggests the significant role gradient guiding and gradient seeding playin randomized local search; pure RLS has only a 30.2% accuracy on CIFAR-10. Another lessonfrom Table 2 is that Loss Gradient Weighting is necessary for good accuracy across all methods onthe more complex datasets. Interestingly on the Graphs dataset, removing Loss Weighting leads toimprovements for both SSTE and GRLS.
Figure 3: Effect of Varying Dimension on Validation Accuracy4.3	Method suboptimalityWe seek to compare the quality of target setting procedures considered in our study. We consideredrandom instances of Problem (3) (i.e randomly generated weight matrix and output targets, with 10possible output classes) and tasked GRLS, RLS, and FTPROP to set targets. We performed 1024independent trials and collected the data in Table 3. We show there the loss mean and standard errorof each given target setting method.
