Figure 1: Distance dependency is not directional and geographic. The Point A and B are geograph-ically close, but they stand on opposite sides of the road, the driving distance is far. And their trafficflows are different a lot, shown in the right figure.
Figure 2: The architecture of LRA, designed for general traffic flow forecasting. The temporalrelationships are extracted by three SAEs, whose outputs are fed to RNNs model for prediction.

Figure 4: The structure of autoencoder (left) and SAE (right)C DatasetWe use two real-world datasets for experiments:â€¢	ENG-HW This traffic dataset is collected by British Government, which covers inter-cityfreeways between three cities, including Manchester, Liverpool and Blackburn. We select249 sensors and collect one year of data ranging from January 1st 2014 to December 31st2014 for the experiments. The total number of the piece of data is 8,724,960, the meanvalue of this dataset is 466.
