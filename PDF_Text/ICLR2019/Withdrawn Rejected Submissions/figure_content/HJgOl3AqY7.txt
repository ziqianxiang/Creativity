Figure 1: Different approaches to domain translation. (a) One-to-one transfer models such as UNITare restricted to domain pairs. (b) One-to-many transfer models such as UMT require to train adifferent decoder for each domain. (c) Our proposed many-to-many transfer model (MoVE) allowsto perform multi-domain transfer with a single encoder and decoder, while providing control overthe generation with external high-level conditioning variables.
Figure 2: The Modulated Variational auto-Encoder (MoVE) provides a single architecture able toperform many-to-many transfer while controlling the generation with external parameters. Both thedomain and control information are processed to modulate different layers of the architecture.
