Figure 1: Example of a visible and non-visible line anomalies in an artificial wood texture. Thetexture was printed in an industrial single-pass print line for laminate flooring. Both line anomalieshave the same size, and both are related to the same primary colour.
Figure 2: Illustration of the processing pipeline: First, the input image is being preprocessed. Af-terwards, the particular representations are being computed. Finally, the representations are beingevaluated by both one-class classifiers and compared among each other. On the right-hand sidethe behaviour of our MinMax-loss, i.e. separating the output distributions of the reference and theshuffled texture, is illustrated.
Figure 3: Illustration of (a) an excerpt of the red-bricks (1024 × 1024 px) texture, (b) examplesfor reference, line anomaly, and noise anomaly patches, and (c) an excerpt of the shuffled referencetexture used for training our OC-NN. Analogously to that, (d) to (f) illustrate the aforementioneddetails for the texture C7-G-10-2 (2048 × 4096 px).
Figure 4: Comparison of classifier performances on the previously introduced representations ofthe textures C7-G-10-2 and red-bricks. The resulting AUC scores are plotted on the y-axis and thewidth of the line anomalies on the x-axis. Each particular column represents the different anomalyintensities (±128 and ±255) used. Furthermore, each row illustrates the results of a particularclassifier.
Figure 5: Visualisation of detected line defects of the particular texture representations, i.e. (a) PS-representation, (b) SW-representation, and (c) learnt texture representation. The line defects wereapplied to the texture C7-G-10-2 with an intensity of +128 and width of 4 px. Line defects thatwere detected are highlighted by a surrounding (green) square.
