Figure 1: Multi-level abstraction framework from a top-down decomposition view. First, we performmotion detection to produce foreground masks. Then, we utilize the foreground masks as dynamicregion proposals to guide the learning of dynamic instance segmentation. Finally, we use the learneddynamic instance segmentation networks (including Instance Splitter and Merging Net) as a guidingnetwork to generate region proposals of dynamic instances and guide the learning of Object Detectorin the level of dynamics learning.
