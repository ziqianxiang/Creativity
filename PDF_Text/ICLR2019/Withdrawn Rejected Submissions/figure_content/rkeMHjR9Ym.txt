Figure 1:	SGD convergence behavior for Leaky ReLUs with varying minimum slope β . Figures a) and b)repeat the same experiments. The difference is the spectral norm of the ground truth state matrix A.
Figure 2:	SGD convergence behavior for ReLU with varying spectral norm of the state matrix A. Figures a)and b) repeats the same experiments. The difference is that a) uses N = 500 trajectory length whereas b) usesN = 2500 (i.e. ×5 more data). Shaded regions highlight the one standard deviation around the mean.
