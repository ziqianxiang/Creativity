Figure 4: XOR classification experiment. Top: Synthetic training data in two dimensions, along withthe learned decision boundary (black). Bottom: Visualization of kernel applied to 1000 (unseen) testdata points in iterations 1, 2, 5, and 50 from left to right, along with the linear classifier in that space(black). The classifier achieves 72 % test accuracy, where the Bayes accuracy is 85.1 %.
