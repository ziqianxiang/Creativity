Figure 1: Overview of our method and analysis. We consider the test "The trophy doesnâ€™t fit in thesuitcase because it is too big." Our method first substitutes two candidate references trophy andsuitcase into the pronoun position. We then use an LM to score the resulting two substitutions.
Figure 2: A sample of questions from WSC-273 predicted incorrectly by full scoring, but correctedby partial scoring. Here we mark the correct prediction by an asterisk and display the normalizedprobability ratio qt by coloring its corresponding word. It can be seen that the wrong predictions aremade mainly due to qt at the pronoun position, where the LM has not observed the full sentence.

Figure 4: Left: Histogram of similarity scores from top 0.1% documents in CommonCrawl corpus,comparing to questions in Winograd Schema Challenge. Right: An excerpt from the documentwhose score is 0.083 (highest ranking). In comparison, a perfect score is of 1.0. Documents in thiscorpus contain long series of events with complex references from several pronouns.
