Figure 2: Left. Phase diagram representing the dynamics of learning for the couple (zt, yt) dependingon its initialization. yt is the value for the class considered, in which all examples have lined up.
Figure 3: Left. Solutions of (4) for different initializations and c = 1. Right. Values of αt, βt andPt the confidence of the classifier on an example from class D1 for three different initializations.
Figure 4: Left. The three figures on the left are the result of training a generative adversarial networkon 8 Gaussians (see Appendix E for details on the experiment). The samples from the hinge loss areincomparably better. Right. Comparison between hinge loss and binary cross-entropy: training timerequired to reach a confidence δ on the classification problem. Subplot: Solutions of Eqs. 3 and 5.
Figure 5: Upper bound on Pt* ((0, x2) ∈ D1) as afunction of 1 - δ for different values of λ.
Figure 6: Solutions of the ODE system for different initializations and c = -1. Trajectories liveon a hyperboloid of two sheets. Any initialization on that surface will result in βt reaching 0, orin other terms in class D1 prevailing. This curve and Fig. 3 from the main text are plotted withkx1 k = kx2 k = 1.
Figure 7: Logit u(t) and confidence Pt for different number of layers and values of kxk.
Figure 8: Solution of Eq.26.
Figure 9: Upper bound on Pt* ((0, x2) ∈ D1) asa function of 1 - δ for different values of λ.
