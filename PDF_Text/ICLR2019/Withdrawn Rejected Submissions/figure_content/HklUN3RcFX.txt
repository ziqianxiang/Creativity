Figure 1: Label prediction on node a by Kipf-GCN and ConfGCN (this paper). L0 is a’s true label.
Figure 2: Plots of node classification accuracy vs. (a) node entropy and (b) node degree. On x-axis we have quartiles of (a) node entropy and (b) degree, i.e., each bin has 25% of the samples insorted order. Overall, we observe that the performance of Kipf-GCN and GAT degrades with theincrease in node entropy and degree. In contrast, ConfGCN is able to avoid such degradation due toits estimation and use of confidence scores. Refer Section 7.2 for details.
Figure 3: Evaluation of Kipf-GCN and Con-fGCN on the citeseer dataset with increasingnumber of GCN layers. Overall, ConfGCNoutperforms Kipf-GCN, and while both meth-ods’ performance degrade with increasing lay-ers, ConfGCN’s degradation is more gradualthan Kipf-GCN’s abrupt drop. Please see Sec-tion 7.3 for details.
