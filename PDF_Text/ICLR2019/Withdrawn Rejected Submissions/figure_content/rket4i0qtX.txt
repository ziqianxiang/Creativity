Figure 1: Three spatial arrangements of objects which may or may not affect the performance of amechanism for interpreting “most” statements. Going from left to right, a strategy based on pairingentities of each set and identifying the remainder gets more difficult, while a strategy based oncomparing cardinalities does not.
Figure 2: Two example images with four in-/correct captions each, taken from the Q-full dataset (allquantifier and number captions).
Figure 3: From left to right, the ratio between the two attributes is increasingly balanced.
Figure 5: Accuracy (in %) of model trained on Q-full and Q-half for the various evaluation setups.
Figure 6: (Left) Q-full model performance for increasingly balanced ratios (x-axis: ratio as n:n+1).
