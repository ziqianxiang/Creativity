Figure 1: Left: Distribution of logits on clean test data for models trained with and without logitpairing. Right: Performance against a PGD-based attack for models trained with varying amountsof logit regularization, with and without logit pairing.
Figure 2: Left: Clean and adversarial accuracy on CIFAR-10 as a function of the label smoothingstrength. Note that models for this figure were trained exclusively on the original training data - noadversarial examples were involved in the training procedure. Right: Logit distribution of modeltrained with no label smoothing (top) and with label smoothing of s = .75 (bottom), evaluated onthe original test images (left) and PGD-based adversarial examples (right).
