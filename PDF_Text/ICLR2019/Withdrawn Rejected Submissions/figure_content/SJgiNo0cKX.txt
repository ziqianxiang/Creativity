Figure 1: Example results of our method on the task of lane detection.
Figure 2: (a)Nets with multiple encoder-decoders model can combine richer local and global infor-mation than nets with a single encoder-decoder model.
Figure 3: The visual results of comparison between our method and the state-of-the-art methods,which can tell the nets with multiple encoder-decoders model can combine richer local and globalinformation than nets with a single encoder-decoder model.
Figure 4: IoU based methods. The green line denotes ground truth, while the blue and red lines bothdenote lines with IoU equal to 0.33Recent works evaluated lane detection methods based on IoU, calculating the intersection-over-union (IoU) between the ground truth and the prediction. Predictions whose IoU are larger thancertain thresh- old are viewed as true positives (TP). Evaluation methods based on IoU such asPrecision, Recall and F-measure as follows have limitations to evaluate the predictions.
