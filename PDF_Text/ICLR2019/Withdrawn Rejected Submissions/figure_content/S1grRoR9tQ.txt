The filter size in the convolutionallayers is 5 × 5 and the feature maps are set to be 32 and 64, respectively (Jarrett et al., 2009). Thefully-connected layers (FC) have 200 hidden nodes and 10 outputs. We use the rectified linear unit(ReLU) as activation function between layers and employ a cross-entropy loss.
