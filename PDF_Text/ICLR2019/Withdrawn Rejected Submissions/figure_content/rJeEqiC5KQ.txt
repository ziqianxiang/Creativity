Figure 1: Illustrating CAE reconstructed images with various pseudo-exemplar sizes. 1st row=realimages, 2nd to 8th rows = CAE reconstructed images from pseudo-exemplar sizes of 200%, 100%,67%, 50%, 33%, 16.7% and 4% of original real image size, last row = GAN generated images Wuet al.
Figure 2: CAE integrated proposed IL system with human brain inspired information encoding,storing and recalling information and revisiting processes.
