Figure 1: Demonstration of the benefit of relaxing and increasing the encoding dimensionality, fora binary classification problem at the final encoding layer. Ci is the codebook encoding for class i,axis si represents the output activation of neuron i in the output encoding layer, where i = 1, . . . , land l is the encoding dimensionality. The depicted points are correctly classified points of the greenand blue classes. The arrows depict the possible non-zero perturbation directions sign("LoS). (a)2D 1ofK softmax-crossentropy setup: Only two non-zero gradient directions exist for a 1ofKencoding. Of these two directions, only one is an adversarial direction, depicted in red. (b) 2Dmulti-way encoding: Four non-zero perturbation directions exist. The fraction of directions that nowmove a point to the adversarial class (red) drops. (c) 3D multi-way encoding: A higher dimensionalencoding results in a significantly lower fraction of gradient perturbations whose direction wouldmove an input from the green ground-truth class to the blue class, or vice versa.
