Figure 1: Results on Ethernet 10Gbits. (a): Validation performance w.r.t. training time (in seconds)for model trained on 4 and 32 nodes. (b): Average time per training iteration (in seconds) (c): Bestvalidation accuracy. Stochastic Gradient Push (SGP) is faster than both Decentralized-Parallel SGD(D-PSGD) and AllReduce SGD while decreasing validation accuracy by 1.2%.
Figure 2: Results on InfiniBand 100Gbits. (a): Validation performance w.r.t. training time (insecond) for model trained on 32 nodes. (b): Average time per training iteration (in second) (c): Bestvalidation accuracy. Stochastic Gradient Push (SGP) is on par and sometime even slightly fasterthan AllReduce SGD on “low latency” network while slightly degrading the accuracy.
Figure 3: Comparison of SGP using a communication graph with 1-neighbor, SGP using a graphwith 2-neighbors, D-PSGD and SGD on 32 nodes communicating over 10 Gbit/s Ethernet. Usingone additional neighbor improves the validation performance of SGD (from 75.0 to 75.4) whileretaining most of the computational benefits.
