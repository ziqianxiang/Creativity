Figure 1: Hint-based training from ART model to NART model.
Figure 2: Case study: the above three figures visualize the hidden state cosine similarities of differentmodels. The axes correspond to the generated target tokens. Each pixel shows the cosine similaritiescosij between the last layer hidden states of the i-th and j-th generated tokens, where the diagonalpixel will always be 1.0.
Figure 3: Case study: the above three figures visualize the encoder-decoder attention weights of dif-ferent models. The x-axis and y-axis correspond to source and generated target tokens respectively.
