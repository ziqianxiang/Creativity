Figure 1: Framework overview. By applying the alignment functions to the triplets in the sourceknowledge graph, we obtain an aligned knowledge graph. The alignment functions are learnedthrough two GANs. (1) We expect all triplets in the aligned knowledge graph are valid, thereforewe train a triplet discriminator to distinguish between valid and invalid triplets, and further use it tofacilitate the alignment functions. (2) We also expect the entity distribution in the aligned knowledgegraph matches the one in the target knowledge graph, which is achieved with another GAN.
