Figure 1: A sample reaction represented as a set of graph transformations from reactants (leftmost) toproducts (rightmost). Atoms are labeled with their type (Carbon, Oxygen,...) and their index (1, 2,...)in the molecular graph. The atom pairs that change connectivity and their new bonds (if existed) arehighlighted in green. There are two bond changes in this case: 1) The double bond between O:1 andC:2 becomes single. 2) A new single bond between C:2 and C:10 is added.
Figure 2: Workflow of a Graph Transformation Policy Network (GTPN). At every step of theforward pass, our model performs 7 major functions: 1) Computing the atom representation vectors,2) Computing the most possible K reaction atom pairs, 3) Predicting the continuation signal Î¾, 4)Predicting the reaction atom pair (u, v), 5) Predicting a new bond b of this atom pair, 6) Updating theatom representation vectors, and 7) Updating the recurrent state.

Figure 5: Performance with respect to different numbers of bond changes. (a) Top-1 accuracy. (b)Errors grouped by length. In (a), blue: all reactions having that sequence length; orange: correctpredicted reactions. In (b), red: the predicted sequence is shorter (than the groundtruth sequence);green: the predicted and the groundtruth have the same length; blue: the predicted sequence islonger; number indidate the average length.
Figure 6: Errors grouped by the first incorrect sub-actions (a), and errors caused by symmetricstructures (b).
