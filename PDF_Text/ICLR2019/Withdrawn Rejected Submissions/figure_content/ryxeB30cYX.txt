Figure 1: FGSM attack to deterministic quantization on different layers of the baseline CNN.
Figure 2: t-SNE results from the penultimate layer of our network against clean images and C&Wadversaries. (A) is a full-precision network with no defense, (B) is a full-precision network + FGSMtraining, and (C) is SQA + FGSM training (Ours). While (A) and (B) shows significant degradationon adversaries, (C) still finds proper decision boundaries against adversarial attacks.
Figure 3: Activation maps from the penultimate layer of our network. Top two rows are the resultson MNIST, and the bottom rows are for CIFAR-10. For each dataset, top rows are activationsgiven inputs as clean images, and bottom rows are the ones given adversarial images. (A) is a full-precision network with no defense, (B) is a full-precision network + FGSM training, and (C) is SQA+ FGSM training (Ours). C&W attacks are applied and (C) shows little difference between cleanand adversaries.
