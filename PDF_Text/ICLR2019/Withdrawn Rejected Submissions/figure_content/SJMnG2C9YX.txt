Figure 1: The left and middle graphs shows the total risk (8) (in black color) and the risk decomposed intoeach ordinary class term (9) (in other colors) for training data with linear and MLP models, respectively. Asan MLP model, a one-hidden-layer neural network with 500 units was used, with ReLU (Nair & Hinton, 2010)as the activation function, Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2015) for optimization with learning rate 5e - 5 and weightdecay of 1e - 4. The right graph shows the corresponding test accuracy for both models.
Figure 2: Experimental results for various datasets and models. Dark colors show the mean accuracy of 4 trialsand light colors show standard deviation.
