Figure 1: (a) Any NN (left, presented in the usual weight-nonlinearity abstraction) can be abstractedas a “graph” (right) with each node representing a neuron and each edge the input-output rela-tionship between neurons. If a node receives multiple inputs, we view its input as a vector insome Euclidean space, as indicated by the colored rectangles. Under this abstraction, each neuron(f (x) = σ(w>x + b)) can be directly replaced by a kernel machine (f (x) = hw, φ(x)i + b withkernel k(x, y) = hφ(x), φ(y)i) mapping from the same Euclidean space into the real line withoutaltering the architecture and functionality of the model.
