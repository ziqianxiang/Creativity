Figure 1: Global translational invariant (GTI) testing dataset. The image shows a helvetica font digit0 located at the top left. The 18 by 14 lattice are locations of center mass of the digit if we shift theimage toward right or bottom one pixel each time.
Figure 2: CNN architecture. The size and type of each layers are indicated. ’Con’ refer to convo-lutional layers, ’FC’ is fully connected layers. To save the space, not all the channels are shown ineach convolutional or max-pooling layer.
Figure 3: Prediction of CNN models on digit 0’s images in GTI testing set. The location of eachnumber in the above pictures corresponding to the centre of mass lattice shown in Figure 1. (Left)The model trained on the original MNIST data without any data augmentation; (Right) the modeltrained on MNIST data with randomly shifting 20% width or height of the centre of mass. Correctpredictions coloured by red, and black numbers are wrong predictions.
