Figure 1: Visual illustration of the co-occurrence bi-attented sampling of nodesâ€™ neighborhood. Theleft one figure gives a vivid example of why we can use co-occurrence node to filter out usefulinformation; and the two figures in the right show how attention from co-occurrence nodes affectssampling and aggregating over the neighborhood.
