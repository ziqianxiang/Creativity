Figure 1: The overall architecture. The mapping m consists ofan encoder and an decoder and is shown at the top with graybackground. The additional forward pass (when classifier actson masked-out image) is needed during training only.
Figure 2: The original images are in the first row. In thefollowing rows masked-in images, masked-out imagesand inpainted masked-out images are shown, respec-tively. Note that the proposed approach (a-b) removeall relevant pixels and hence the inpainted images showthe background only. Seven randomly selected con-secutive images from validation set are presented here.
Figure 3: The classification accuracy of the ImageNet-trained convolutional networks on masked-in images(left), masked-out images (center) and inpainted masked-out images (right). Orange and blue dots correspond toResNet-50 models and all the other types of convolutional networks, respectively. We observe that the inpaintedmasked-out images obtained using Baseline are easier to classify than those using CASM, because Baseline failsto mask out all the relevant pixels, unlike CASM. On the right panel, most of the classifiers evaluated on imageswith random masks achieve accuracy higher than 40% and are not shown. We add jitters in the x-axis to makeeach dot more distinct from the others visibly.
