Figure 1: Depiction of the input-output relationship of a non-overlapping Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)model along with the various notations and symbols.
Figure 2: Correlations (COrr(k('), k(')) = ∖(k('), k('))∣) between the DeePTD estimate and the ground truthkernels for different layers and over-sampling ratios N .
Figure 3: DeePTD estimate vs NaiveTD estimate when final aCtivation is ReLU. Bias of NaiveTD results insignifiCantly worse PerformanCe.
Figure 4: Performance of DeepTD when the final activation is ReLU in lieu of the identity activation.
Figure 5: Tree visualization of a non-overlapping cNN model. The path in bold corresponds tothe path vector i = (d1, 1, 1, 1) from Definition A.10. For this path the kernel path gain is equalki = kd1)k(2)k13) and the activation path gain is equal to φi(x) = Φι(h11))Φ2(h 12))Φ3(h13)). Theset set2(p2) (offsprings of the last hidden node in layer two) is outlined.
