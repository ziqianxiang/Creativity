Figure 1: Visualized orbital matrix representation for different hybridization states of carbon. Weuse a color spectrum from blue to red to represent the value of the different elements. These kindsof matrices lie on the diagonal parts of Pixel Chem. On off-diagonal parts, elements distance matrixis smaller, so the color will be bluer in most of the cases. All the s and p orbits, including sp/sp2/sp3hybridization orbits, have no overlap area between each other, which yields out all 0 values in off-diagonal parts of four matrices.
Figure 2: Visualized Pixel Chem for a typical molecule in QM9 dataset, C4H5O3N. Note thatupper right and lower left parts are not perfectly symmetric because the charge transfer ability CEi,jdiffers. The color of different pixels is together influenced by orbitals, bonds, angles and charges.

(a) C60, 60 Carbon atoms without periodicity, symmetric, (b) Diamond, 8 Carbon atoms withperiodicity on 3 dimensions, symmetric, (c) Graphite, 32 Carbon atoms with z direction periodicity,symmetric, (d) BN, 16 Boron atoms and 16 Nitrogen atoms with z direction periodicity, a graphiteisoelectronic, asymmetric.
