Figure 1: Variance within epoch two during LeNettraining on CIFAR10.
Figure 2: The SVRG to SGD gradient variance ratio during a run of SVRG. The shaded regionindicates a variance increase, where the SVRG variance is worse than the SGD baseline. Dottedlines indicate when the step size was reduced. The variance ratio is shown at different points withineach epoch, so that the 2% dots (for instance) indicate the variance at 1,000 data-points into the50,000 datapoints consisting of the epoch. Multiple percentages within the same run are shown atequally spaced epochs.
Figure 3: Distance moved from the snapshot point, and curvature relative to the snapshot point, atepoch 50.
Figure 5: Test error comparison with an average of 10 runs shown. Epochs rather than gradientevaluations are plotted on the x axis. Best performing hyper-parameters are used.
