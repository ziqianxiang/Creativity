Figure 1: Explaining the alphaGo model. Given the state of the Go board and the next move,we use the alphaGo model to explain the rationale of the move. We first estimate a rough regionof contextual collaborations w.r.t. the current move by distilling knowledge from the value net tostudent nets that receive different regions of the Go board as inputs. Then, given a student net, weanalyze fine-grained contextual collaborations within its region of the Go board. In this figure, weuse a board state from a real Go game between humans for clarity.
Figure 2: Division of lattices for two types of student nets. We distill knowledge from the value netinto a mixture of four/nine student nets to approximate decision-making logic of the value net.
Figure 3:	Significance of contextual collaborations w.r.t. the new black stone (the black star). Goplayers provided possible explanations for contextual collaborations. The red/blue color indicates asignificant/insignificant contextual collaboration. Please see the appendix for more results.
Figure 4:	We compared the extracted contextual collaborations at different scales (the second, third,fourth, and fifth columns) with annotations made by Go players.
Figure 5: We compared the extracted contextual collaborations at different scales (the second, third,fourth, and fifth columns) with annotations made by Go players.
Figure 6: We show the significance of contextual collaborations within a local lattice. The score forthe i-th lattice is reported asSijsj sj.
