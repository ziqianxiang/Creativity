Figure 1: Learned ratings of potential movementsof the circled red player (green dots, the darker thehigher the rating). The red circle denotes the truemovement that the player is about to perform.
Figure 2: Input representation to the deepconvolutional net. Layers: Team red, teamblue, ball, speed in x-direction team red,speed in y-direction team red, speed in xball,..., team has ball possession {+1, -1},goal position, border.
Figure 3: Feature representation for an agentas defined by the deep model. Activations ofall convolutional layers at the position of theagent are concatenated to form feature repre-sentations that are fed into the loss net.
Figure 4: Output nodes and loss.
Figure 5: Top left: Average AUCs for Q-evaluation. Bottom left: Average Advantage AUCs. Right:Exemplary movement model prediction and occupation zones (3 seconds into the future).
Figure 6: Average V AUC.
Figure 7: Likelihood for different numbers of components in the movement mixture.
Figure 8: Predicted movements (top row) and advantages (bottom row) with mixtures using k = 5(left), k = 15 (center), and k = 90 (right). Darker green marks higher likelihood (top row) andhigher advantage values (bottom row), respectively. Predictions are shown for the circled player andthe real next position is depicted by an empty circle.
Figure 9: The slowly moving agent on the left has a circular-shaped movement distribution as thereis only little time needed for turning in any direction. The running agent on the right (marked by thered circle) realizes an ellipsoidal-shaped movement distribution.
