Figure 1: Analogy between planarand volumetric convolutions. Top(left to right): image, kernel andplanar convolution. Bottom (left toright): 3D object, 3D kernel and vol-umetric convolution. In planar convo-lution the kernel translates and innerproduct between the image and thekernel is computed in (x, y) plane.
Figure 2: Kernel representations of spherical convolution(left) vs Volumetric convolution (right). In volumetricconvolution, the shape is modeled and convolved in B3which allows encoding non-polar 3D shapes with texture.
Figure 3: Experimental ar-chitecture: An object isfirst mapped to three viewangles. For each angle, ax-ial symmetry and volumet-ric convolution features aregenerated for P+ and P-.
Figure 4: Accuracy vs number of trainableparams (in millions) trend (ModelNet40)convolution attains an accuracy of 71.6%, which again highlights the effectiveness of volumetricconvolution.
