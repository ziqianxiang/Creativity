Figure 1: Illustrating the difference between modeling chemical reactions data using undirectedand directed hypergraphs. To the left is the undirected hypergraph, in which both the reactants andproducts are present in the same hyperlink. Whereas in the directed hypergraph (to the right), for agiven reaction, the reactants are connected by one hyperlink and products are connected by anotherhyperlink and both these hyperlinks are connected by a directed link.
Figure 2: (best seen in colour) The proposed NHP framework. We convert the hypergraph with theobserved hyperlinks and the candidate hyperlinks into its dual in which hyperlinks are converted intohypernodes. We then use a technique from positive unlaballed learning to get plausible negativelylabelled hypernodes. The clique expansion of the hypergraph is used to approximate the hypergraph.
