Figure 1: Synthetic labelled data and Lipschitz regularized solution u. Left: The solution valuematches the labels exactly on a large portion of the data set. Right: dirtly labels: 10% of the data isincorrect; the regularized solution corrects the errors.
Figure 2: Synthetic labelled data and Tychonoff regularized solution u. Left: The solution valuematches the labels exactly on a large portion of the data set. Right dirty labels: 10% of the datais incorrect; the regularized solution is not as effective at correcting errors. The effect is morepronounced in higher dimensions.
Figure 3: On the data manifold there is only one minimizer. Off the data manifold, there can bemultiple minimizers.
Figure 4: Comparison of different regularization methods. Lipschitz regularization preserves mostof the labels (Figure 1). Tychonoff regularization smooths the solution (left). Total Variation regu-larization shifts the label values towards the mean (right).
