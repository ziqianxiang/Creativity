Figure 1:	Low dimensional representations for samples from one manufacturing production datasetusing principal component analysis (PCA): (1) each data sample denotes a piece of product, (2) thered/blue points are non-pass/pass products respectively, (3) there exists several different clusters ofproducts. (4) the non-pass samples are very close to the pass samples.
Figure 2:	Distribution of reconstruction loss by using anomaly GAN (ANOGAN) (Schlegl et al.,2017) method. The X-axis is the reconstruction loss. The Y-axis is the percentage. Blue is pass dataand orange is non-pass data.
Figure 3: The generator takes in both noise vector and the prior information to generate a compli-mentary sample. The discriminator takes in a generated sample and real data samples and output theprobability if it is real or not as well as the probability of the prior information.
Figure 4: t-SNE distribution of pass products (all colors except red and yellow), non-pass products(red), and generated complementary data (yellow).
