Figure 1: Classification boundaries for different methods for the Iris dataset. For the conformalprediction method (c) (with α = 0.05) the overlapping areas are classified as multiple classes andwhite areas are classified as the null set. For the standard methods (a-b), the decision boundariescan change significantly with small changes in some of the data points and the prediction cannot bejustified in most of the space.

Figure 2: (a) Performance plot for the conformal method. Accuracy is empirically linear as a functionof α but affect the number of classes predicted per sample. (b-c) are illustrative examples. Whenα = 0.6 both black and red classes are predicted. When α = 0.8 the red classes remain.
Figure 3: Classification results for (a) random noise; (b) Jackson Pollock "Rabit Hole"; (c) MuhammadAli towering over Sonny Liston (1965 rematch). These pictures are outliers for the Imagenetcategories. The left labels of each picture are provided by our method and the right are the results ofthe Inception-v4 model Szegedy et al. (2017).
Figure 4: (a) Females faces mean pixel values in (a) CelebA; (b) IMDB-Wiki. Within CelebA thepictures are aliened with fixed posture, explaining why it naively fails to generalize to IMDB-Wikiimages. (c) Performance plots for the conformal method on both CelebA and IMDB-Wiki.
Figure 5: A collage of the first 20 images in the ImageNet validation set with α = 0.7. TL denotesthe image true label and Prediction is the method output. By design only 0.3 accuracy is expected,yet both the true and the false predictions are reasonable. Online version in color.
