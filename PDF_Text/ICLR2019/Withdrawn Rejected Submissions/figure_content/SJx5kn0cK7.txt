Figure 1: An example of the described representation of polyphonic music. The piece of music isextracted from the Nottingham Dataset (Boulanger-Lewandowski et al., 2012).
Figure 2: Illustration of the HAPPIER architecture. The loop of the recurrent net is unrolled overtime for visualization, and the figure contains 3 measure level loops. A higher-level LSTM learnscorrelations between measures, and a lower-level LSTM learns a conditional distribution over thenotes to generate in each measure given conditioning vectors from the measure level LSTM asguidance. The lower level LSTM summarizes its cell states to the higher one once a measure in orderto keep the latter one informed. Different hierarchies operate on different timescales and differenttemporal resolution levels. The entire architecture is trained jointly end-to-end by back-propagation.
