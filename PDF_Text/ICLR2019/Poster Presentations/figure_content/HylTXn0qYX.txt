Figure 1: An illustration of the empirical risk of a ReLU network. The plotted function is f(w, v) :=(h(w - v + 1) - 2)2 + (h(2w + v + 1) - 1)2 + (h(w + 2v + 1) - 0.5)2, where h is the ReLUfunction. (a) A 3-d surface plot of the function. One can see that there are sharp ridges in thefunction. (b) A plot of nondifferentiable points on the (w, v) plane. The blue line correspond to theline w - v + 1 = 0, the red to 2w + v + 1 = 0, and the yellow to w + 2v + 1 = 0.
