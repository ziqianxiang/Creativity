Figure 1: Illustration of the proposed unsupervised meta-learning procedure. Embeddings of raw observationsare clustered with k-means to construct partitions, which give rise to classification tasks. Each task involvesdistinguishing between examples from N = 2 clusters, with Km-tr = 1 example from each cluster being atraining input. The meta-learnerâ€™s aim is to produce a learning procedure that successfully solves these tasks.
