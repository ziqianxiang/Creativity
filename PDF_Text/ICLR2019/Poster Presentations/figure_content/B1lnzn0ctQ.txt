Figure 1: Justification of Theorems 1 and 2: comparision among LISTA variants.
Figure 2: Justification of Theorem 1 (noiseless case): parameters obtained by training satisfy (9).
Figure 3: Justification of Theorem 1ALISTA: the “true positives” curve draws the values (noiseless case): Proportion of falseof E{∣∣xk(x*)k2∕kxk(x*)k2} w.r.t. k (the expectation positives vs true positives in Xk(x*).

Figure 5: Discussion of Definition 2: distribution of σ0 (D, W) on random generated Ws.
Figure 6: A visualization of convolutional kernels d and W, which is obtained by Algorithm 2 andused in the convolutional A-LISTA. W keeps the high-frequency texture in d. The support of W issmall, most of the pixels in W are zeros. Then the coherence between shifted d and W is nearly 0.
