Figure 1: An illustration of the weighted sum aggregation and the marginalized average aggregation.
Figure 2: The purple box demonstrates the marginalized average aggregation module, where the inputsare {pi}4=1 and {xi}4=Î¹ and the output is h4. The two black boxes demonstrate the computationgraphs of qt and mt, respectively. The black hollow point indicates its value is 0, while the value ofthe black solid point is non-zero. q00 is initialized as 1.

Figure 5: Visualization of the one-dimensional activation sequences on an example of the Ham-merThrow action in the test set of THUMOS14. The horizontal axis denotes the temporal dimension,which is normalized to [0, 1]. The first row of each model shows the ground-truth action segments.
Figure 6: Comparison with the baseline methods. The proposed MAAN can locate larger objectregions to improve localization performance (ground-truth bounding boxes are in red and the predictedones are in green).
