Figure 7: Schematic of example for 2-simplex. Original j -simplex is parameterized to a unitorthogonal j-simplex in Rj space for performing the integration. Parameterization incurs a contentdistortion factor γnj which is the ratio between the original simplex and the unit-orthogonal simplexin parametric space.
