Figure 2: Accuracy under '∞-PGD attack on three different datasets: CIFAR-10, STL-10 andImageNet-143. In particular, we adopt a smaller network for STL-10 namely “Model A”1, whilethe other two datasets are trained on VGG.
Figure 3: Black box, transfer attack experiment results. We select all combinations of source andtarget models trained from 5 defense methods and calculate the affinity according to (17).
Figure 4: Left: we tried different number of forward propagation and averaged the results to makeprediction (18). We see that for different scales of perturbation γ ∈ {0, 0.01, 0.02}, choosing num-ber of ensemble n = 10〜20 is good enough. Right: testing accuracy stabilizes quickly as #PGD-steps goes greater than 20, so there is no necessity to further increase the number of PGD steps.
