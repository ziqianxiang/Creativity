Figure 1:	Stochastic computation graphs with a deterministic node z corresponding to the output ofa sort operator applied to the scores s.
Figure 2:	Center: Venn Diagram relationships between permutation matrices (P), doubly-stochasticmatrices (D), unimodal row stochastic matrices (U), and row stochastic matrices (R). Left: Adoubly-stochastic matrix that is not unimodal. Right: A unimodal matrix that is not doubly-stochastic.
Figure 3:	Stochastic computation graphs with stochastic nodes corresponding to permutations.
Figure 4: Sorting and quantile regression. The model is trained to sort sequences of n = 5 large-MNIST images x1 , x2, . . . , x5 (Task 1) and regress the median value (Task 2). In the aboveexample, the ground-truth permutation that sorts the input sequence from largest to smallest is[3, 5, 1, 4, 2]T , 9803 being the largest and 1270 the smallest. Blue illustrates the true median imagex1 with ground-truth sorted index 3 and value 2960.
Figure 5: Differentiable kNN. The model is trained such that the representations ei for the trainingpoints {x1, . . . , xn} that have the same label y0 as x0 are closer to e0 (included in top-k) than others.
Figure 6: A stochastic computation graph for an arbitrary input x, intermediate node y, and a singleparameter θ. Squares denote deterministic nodes and circles denote stochastic nodes.
