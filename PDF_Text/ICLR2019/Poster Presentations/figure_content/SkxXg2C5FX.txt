Figure 1: Each plot shows the mean Pearson correlation on STS tasks for a different flavour of word vector,comparing different combinations of fuzzy BoW representation (either averaged or max-pooled, or the DynaMaxapproach) and similarity measure (either cosine or Jaccard). The bolded methods are ones proposed in thepresent work. Note that averaged vectors with Jaccard similarity are not included in these plots, as theyconsistently perform 20-50 points worse than other methods; this is predicted by our analysis as averaging is notan appropriate union operation in fuzzy set theory. In virtually every case, max-pooled with cosine outperformsaveraged with cosine, which is in turn outperformed by max-pooled and DynaMax with Jaccard. An exceptionto the trend is STS13, for which the SMT subtask dataset is no longer publicly available; this may have impactedthe performance when averaged over different types of subtasks.
Figure 2: Each plot shows the mean Pearson correlation on STS tasks for a different flavour of word vector,comparing other BoW-based methods to ones using fuzzy Jaccard similarity. The bolded methods are onesproposed in the present work. We observe that even classical crisp Jaccard is a fairly reasonable baseline, butit is greatly improved by the fuzzy set treatment. Both max-pooled word vectors with Jaccard and DynaMaxoutperform the other methods by a comfortable margin, and the max-pooled version in particular performsastonishingly well given its great simplicity.
