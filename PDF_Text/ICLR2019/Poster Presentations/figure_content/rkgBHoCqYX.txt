Figure 1: (Left) Spectrum of C (Up) and f (C) (bottom) for P = 2048 and n = 7500. LimitingMarcenko-Pastur density (Marcenko & Pastur, 1967) in blue versus spectrum of Σp in black, withω1 = 2; estimated largest eigenvalue in red. (Right) Alignment between estimated PC and GT (the“Three Peak" example of (Johnstone & Lu, 2009) in the “Symmlet 8" wavelet basis), in terms of pp/n.
Figure 2: Principal component recovery (in orange) by standard PCA (up) and our method (down)for the “Three Peak” example of (Johnstone & Lu, 2009). The signal is sparse in the “Symmlet 8”wavelet basis. We use p = 2048, ω1 = 5 for the strength of the spike and different values of n.
Figure 3: Performances of standard PCA, different state-of-the-art sparse PCA methods and ourmethod in term of total projections score (left) and total projections error (right) for different valuesof the amplitudes ωi . The PCs ui , for i ∈ [4] are the “Three Peak”, “Piece Poly”, “Step New” and“Sing” signals of (Johnstone & Lu, 2009). We use p = 2048 and n = 1024. The soft-parameters aand τ (respectively for our method and CT) are selected by cross-validation using a validation set ofsize n. The selected parameters are a = 20 and τ = 0.1.
Figure 4: Multiple principal components (k = 3) recovery (in orange) with standard PCA (left), theCT method (middle) and our method (right) where the PCs are considered to be the “Three Peak”,“Piece Poly” and “Step New” signals of (Johnstone & Lu, 2009), in the “Symmlet 8” wavelet basis.
Figure 5: PC recovery (in orange) by f -PCA with the function f (t) = αt3 + βt2 + γt for differentvalues of the parameters (α, β, γ) ∈ R3 . We consider the “Three Peak” example of (Johnstone & Lu,2009) which is sparse in the “Symmlet 8” wavelet basis. We use p = 2048, n = 256 and ω1 = 5. Inparticular, we notice that the “cleanest” signal is obtained when α 6= 0, β = 0, γ = 0 which validateour theoretical conditions f0(0) = f00(0) = 0.
