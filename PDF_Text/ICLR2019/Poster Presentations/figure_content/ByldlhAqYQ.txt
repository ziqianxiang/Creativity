Figure 1:	Motivation of ART. The orange words “sometimes” and “hate” are with insufficientlytrained parameters. The red line indicates the information transfer from the corresponding position.
Figure 2:	ART architecture.
Figure 3: Attention matrix visualization. The x-axis and the y-axis denote positions in the targetdomain and source domain, respectively. Figure (a) shows the attention matrix for the long-termmemory in the forward neural network. Figure (b) shows the attention matrix for the short-termmemory in the forward neural network.
