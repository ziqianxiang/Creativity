Figure 1: Quantitative evaluation of the derivative of M(λ) and the optimal bit-width log(λopt).
Figure 2: A qunatized ReLU network that implements fsr (X). In the interest of clarity, we depictthe sub-networks with different functions as different colored blocks. A connection from or to ablock indicates connections from or to all units in the block. Details of block Bm and block Bg aredepicted on the left. b and w denote bias and weight respectively.
Figure 3: A qunatized ReLU network that implements f0 (x). The connections of all Bfmn are thesame. Every connection from BN to other blocks has no greater than two weights.
Figure 4: An example to illustrate the relationship between f (x), f+ and fe(x).
Figure 5: A qunatized ReLU network that implements f00(x). Illustration only, details are omitted.
