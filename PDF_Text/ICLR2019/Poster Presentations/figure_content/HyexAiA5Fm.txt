Figure 1: (a) Illustration of the problem of modeling the transformation of a source population μ to a targetpopulation ν . In this example, one sub-population is growing more rapidly than the others. (b) Schematicof Monge-like formulations of unbalanced optimal transport. The objective is to learn a transport map T(for transporting mass) and scaling factor ξ (for mass variation) to push the source μ to the target V, using adeterministic transport map (top) (Chizat et al., 2015) or a stochastic transport map (bottom).

Figure 6: Unbalanced OT on Zebrafish Single-Cell Gene Expression Data. (a) Illustration of the blastulaand gastrula stages of zebrafish embryogenesis. (b) T-SNE plot (Maaten & Hinton, 2008) of the unbalancedOT results for a subset of datapoints. The color of the transported points indicates the relative magnitudeof the scaling factor (black = high, white = low). (c) Same plot as (b), where we have colored the sourcepoints instead of the transported points. (d) GOrilla output of significantly enriched processes (Eden et al.,2009) based on ranked list of enriched genes in cells with high scaling factors (black points from (c)) from adifferential gene expression analysis. Processes in the graph are organized from more general (upstream) tomore specific (downstream).
