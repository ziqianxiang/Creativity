Figure 1: (a) A neural network classifier. (b) illustrates the loss function of C&W attack, which iscontinuous and hence can be easily optimized. (c) is the C&W loss function in the hard-label setting,which is discrete and discontinuous. (d) our proposed attack objective g(θ) for this problem, whichis continuous and easier to optimize. See detailed discussions in Section 3.
Figure 2: IllustrationMoreover, we give three examples of f(x) defined in two dimension input space and their corre-sponding g(θ). In Figure 3a, we have a continuous classification function defined as follows1, if kxk22 ≥0.40, otherwise.
