Figure 1: An illustration of the replica exchange Langevin diffusion. In (a) we illustrate the diffusion processdriven by the low temperature, which locally exploits the geometry. The orange dashed lines characterize theevolution of the standard Langevin diffusion, while the blue dashed line denotes the swap, which drives thediffusion process into the neighborhood of another local minimum. In (b) we illustrate the trajectories of apair of diffusion processes driven by two temperatures. The orange and yellow lines correspond to the lowand high temperatures, respectively. The black lines are the contours of the objective function. Note thatthe lines of the same colors are disjoint due to the swap, which is denoted by the red dashed line. In (c) weillustrate the evolution of the χ2-divergence. The upper and lower blue curves correspond to diffusion processeswith zero and positive swapping intensities, respectively. The two solid red arrows denote the derivatives ofthe χ2-divergence, and the angle between them characterizes the acceleration effect. In (d) we illustrate theconcentration of the empirical measures. The horizontal plane denotes the space of measures, whose center is π,that is, the stationary distribution of the replica exchange Langevin diffusion. The yellow and blue surfaces thatcenter at π characterize the probability densities of the empirical measures, corresponding to zero and positiveswapping intensities, respectively. Compared with the blue surface, the yellow one is more concentrated aroundπ, which also characterizes the acceleration effect of swapping.
