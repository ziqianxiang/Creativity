Figure 1: An overview of the tight relation between a single iteration of a stochastic solver andthe forward pass through the lth layer in a network that consists of dropout followed by a lineartransformation and a non-linear activation. We study an instance of problem (1) with quadraticF (x), where xl-1 are the input activations and xl, the variables being optimized, correspond to theoutput activations. Varying the type of stochastic solver changes the nature of the dropout layer,while the prior g(x) on the output activations determines the non-linearity ProX 1 g(.).
Figure 2: Comparison of common activation functions and their approximation via the correspond-ing proximal operator. Left: SoftPlus activation and corresponding proximal operator with Î³ = 1.
