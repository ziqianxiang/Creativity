Figure 1: Architecture of the proposed model3	Model FrameworkIn this section, We present the proposed modeling framework. We begin by presenting notation,followed by the model architecture and learning criteria.
Figure 2: Classification performance on the UWaveGesture dataset. Models with almost same per-formance are shown with the same dot e.g. (GRU-M, GRU-F ) and (GRU-D, GRU-HD).
