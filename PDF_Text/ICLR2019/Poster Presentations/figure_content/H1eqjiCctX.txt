Figure 1: Graphical models of RAND-WALK (left) and our new model (right), depicting a syntacticword pair (wt, wt0). Green nodes correspond to observed variables, white nodes to latent variables.
Figure 2: Histograms of partition functions Zc,a (x-axis is Zc,a/E[Zc,a])the Tucker decomposition of the PMI3 tensor, but it is analogous to the training criterion used inArora et al. (2015), and can be viewed as a negative log-likelihood for the model. To reduce thenumber of parameters, we constrain T to have CP rank 1000. We also trained the embeddings andtensor jointly, but found that this approach yields very similar results. In all cases, we utilize theTensorflow framework (Abadi et al., 2016) with the Adam optimizer (Kingma & Ba, 2014) (usingdefault parameters), and train for 1-5 epochs.
