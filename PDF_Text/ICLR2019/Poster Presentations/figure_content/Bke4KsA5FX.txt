Figure 1: Example for ExprGen, target ex-pression to be generated is marked ∣. Takenfrom BenchmarkDotNet, lightly edited forformatting.
Figure 2: Example AST with attribute dependencies, shown constructed step by step in the order ofgeneration. Each AST node (labeled by a terminal or non-terminal) has either one or two associatedattribute nodes, shown as its left/right parts. The node IDs are highlighted at the correspondinggeneration step. Edge color and label indicate edge type. Edges are computed using Alg. 2, but areonly depicted after use in message passing. Best viewed in color.
