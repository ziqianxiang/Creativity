Figure 1: Procedural learning. Given an input set of temporal sequences all demonstrating the sameprocedure we wish to infer the latent structure of that procedure. Here we show the results of ourmethod, PRISM, on inferring a cpr procedure from a set of videos in the INRIA Instructional videosdataset. The ground truth temporal clustering on the upper left represents a human labeling of theactivities involved in a particular cpr video where color denotes the same activity. For example, theactivity denoted by the cream color occurred 4 times across the sequence.

Figure 6: (a)-(f) visualize the best and worst methods on our metrics; (g)-(h) show examples wherewe disagree with traditional criteria; (i) illustrates a sensitivity analysis with respect to the TSStradeoff parameter Î². All results are on the BEES1 dataset.
Figure 7: Effect of varying hyperparameters on model performance. Results are on the JIGSAWSsuturing task. Green marks the value of the hyperparameter in ground-truth.
