Figure 1: (Zoom in for bet-ter view) Visualization ofthe features in object detec-tion using t-SNE (Van derMaaten & Hinton, 2008) (a)without and (b) with featureintertwiner on COCO. Eachpoint is a sample mappedonto the low-dim manifold.
Figure 2: Feature intertwinter overview. Blue blobs stands for the less reliable set (small objects)and green for the reliable set (large ones). For current level l, feature map Pl of the small set isfirst passed into a RoI-pooling layer. Then it is fed into a make-up layer, which fuels back theinformation lost during RoI; it is optimized via the intertwiner module (yellow rectangle), with aidof the reliable set (green). ‘OT' (in red) stands for the optimal transport divergence, which alignsinformation between levels (for details see Sec. 3.3). Pm∣l is the input feature map of the reliableset for the RoI layer; m indicates higher level(s) than l.
