Figure 1: A sliding window over the time se-ries input with two intervals: the past and thecurrent, where wl , wr are the size of the pastand current interval, respectively. X(l) , X(r)consists of the data in the past and current in-terval, respectively.
Figure 2: Left: 5 × 5 Gaussian grid, samples from P, Q and G. We discuss two cases of Q, one ofsufficient samples, the other of insufficient samples. Right: Test power of kernel selection versuseq. Choosing kernels by γk* (X, Z) using a surrogate distribution G is advantageous when We donot have sufficient samples from Q, which is typically the case in time series CPD task.
Figure 3: Ablation test of KL-CPD.
Figure 4: AUC vs. different window size wron Bee-Dance.
Figure 5: MMD with different encoder fφe versus data dimension, under 10 random seeds.
Figure 6: Conditionally generated samples by KL-CPD and system-predicted CPD scores on Bee-Dance (Left) and HASC (Right) datasets. In the first three subplots are ground truth signals (blueline), 10 conditional generated samples (green lines) and change points (red vertical line). The lastsubplot is MMD scores, which peaks around ground truth change points mostly.
