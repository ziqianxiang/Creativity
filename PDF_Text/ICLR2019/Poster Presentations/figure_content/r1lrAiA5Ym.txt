Figure 1: Left: Description of the task. Right: Training curves for the cue-reward association task(medians and inter-quartile ranges of rewards per episode over 10 runs). Modulated plastic networks(red, blue) learn the task, while non-modulated and non-plastic networks (green, orange) fail.
Figure 2: Maze navigation task. Left: layout of the maze, including an example agent location(yellow) and reward location (green, for illustration only: the reward is not visible to the agent).
Figure 3: Dynamics of neuromodulation. For both simple and retroactive modulation, we show onetrial from each of 4 runs. At each time step, gray squares indicate which cue was shown; orangecurves indicates reward at the previous time step (i.e. the one currently fed to the network), which isalways -1, 0 or 1; and blue curves indicates the value of the modulator output at the current time step.
Figure 4: Training curves for the cue-reward association task with fixed, binary four-bit cues (mediansand inter-quartile ranges of rewards per episode over 10 runs). “Soft clip” refers to a different clippingoperation used in Equation 2; “Hard clip” is the same as used in the present paper, i.e. the simpleclipping described in Methods. Note that non-modulated plastic network succeed in solving this task.
