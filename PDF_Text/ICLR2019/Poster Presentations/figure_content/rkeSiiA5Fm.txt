Figure 1: An example of our alt-az anisotropic spherical convolution neural network (a3 S-CNN)applied for a non-rigid shape classification problem.
Figure 2: Rotation operators applied on a locally-supported kernel function. (a) An anisotropic ker-nel function h defined on a polar cap; (b) applying an alt-az rotation DR(π∕4, π∕3,0) to h; (C) apply-ing a general rotation DR(π∕4, π∕3,π∕2) to h; (d) applying a general rotation DR(π∕4, π∕3, π∕2)to an azimuthally symmetric filter h0 .
Figure 3: Different geodesic grids on the sphere. (a) a lat-lon grid, (b) a cubed-sphere grid and(c) icosahedron-sphere grid: from left to right,: one-frequency, two-frequency, four-frequency andeight-frequency subdivisions.
Figure 4: 2D rectilinear data structure for icosahedron-sphere grid. (a) The original spherical meshof 8-frequency; (b) an icosahedron-sphere grid is opened onto a 2D plane, and the colored edges inthe top and bottom indicate the locations along which the spherical grid is opened. (c) By rotatingthe two axes u and v , the flattened icosahedron in (b) can be stretched into a rectilinear grid structurerepresented by five 2D matrices.
Figure 5: Spherical functions for non-rigid shapes using spherical projection method (left) andspherical parametrization and function mapping method (right). Here HKS-1 shows the first HKSchannel.
Figure 6: The shape descriptor of SHREC’11 original models (training set) extracted by oura3SCNN network, rendered with t-SNE.
Figure 7: Rotations of salient features. (a) Alt-az shift rotations are invariant to the network, (b) arotation of a salient feature about arbitrary axis. When local filter h is convolved at each rotated U1,there is a relative angular change compared with (a).
