Figure 1: a) Depiction of the clip-insertion task. b) Median final success rate and interquartile rangeout of 100 roll-outs over 8 seeds. GPRIL achieves the highest success rate followed by GAIL. c)Median final success rate and IQR on clip insertion comparing sample efficiency. GPRIL is able tosolve the task using several orders of magnitude fewer environment interactions. d) Comparison onclip insertion trained on states alone. Learning from states alone only slightly affects performance.
Figure 2: a) Depiction of the peg insertion task b) Average success rate and 95% confidence in-terval of GAIL with 25 demonstrations across 10 runs (evaluated over 100 roll-outs). c) Averagesuccess rate of GPRIL across 5 seeds. Unlike GAIL, the performance of GPRIL doesnâ€™t drop offwhen provided with only final states. d) Average success rate and confidence interval of GPRIL.
