Figure 1: Our ImageNet-C dataset consists of 15 types of algorithmically generated corruptionsfrom noise, blur, weather, and digital categories. Each type of corruption has five levels of severity,resulting in 75 distinct corruptions. See different severity levels in Appendix B.
Figure 2: Example frames from thebeginning (T = 0) to end (T = 30)of some Tilt and Brightness pertur-bation sequences.
Figure 3: Robustness (mCE) and Relative mCEImageNet-C values. Relative mCE values sug-gest robustness in itself declined from AlexNet toResNet. “BN” abbreviates Batch Normalization.
Figure 4: Perturbation robustness of variousarchitectures as measured by the mT5D onImageNet-P. Observe that corruption and per-turbation robustness track distinct concepts.
Figure 5: Architectures such as MUltigrid net-works and DenSeNetS resist noise corruptionsmore effectively than ResNets.
Figure 6: Larger feature aggregating networksachieve robustness gains that substantially out-pace their accuracy gains.
Figure 7: Impulse noise modestly to markedly corrupts a frog, showing our benchmark’s varyingseverities.
Figure 8: Extra ImageNet-C corruption examples are available for model validation and sounderexperimentation.
