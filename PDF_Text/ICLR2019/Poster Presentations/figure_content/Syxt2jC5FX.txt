Figure 1: For the MASO parameters A⑷，B⑷ for which HVQ yields the ReLU, absolute value,and an arbitrary convex activation function, we explore how changing β in the β-VQ alters theinduced activation function. Solid black: HVQ (β = 1), Dashed black: SVQ (β = 1), Red: β-VQ(β ∈ [0.1, 0.9]). Interestingly, note how some of the functions are nonconvex.
