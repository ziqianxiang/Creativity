Figure 1: Illustration of visual VRNN with a single agent. Dotted edges are not used. Dashed edgesare non-standard edges that we add.
Figure 2: Illustration of the operations performed by the Graph-VRNN model, when the numberof agents is 4. Dashed line is only used for the observed frames. The attention mechanism duringgeneration stage is omitted for simplicity.
Figure 3: (a) Frames from Soccer World are rendered from a moving camera. (b) Examples framesfrom basketball data. At T = 0, 5, the player (light green) who controls the ball (yellow) is notvisible. At T = 10, 15, 20, the ball is not visible.
Figure 4: Belief states for one player in the basketball data across multiple different world statescenarios. We show the heatmap over possible locations based on multiple stochastic samples. Thetop row shows the true state of the world for reference. V is visible, O is occluded, U is unseen.

Figure A1: Sampled trajectories for Soccer World for 11 “home” players.
Figure A2: Sampled trajectories for 5 attacking players, generated by Graph-VRNN.
Figure A3: Sampled trajectories for 5 attacking players, generated by various baselines.
