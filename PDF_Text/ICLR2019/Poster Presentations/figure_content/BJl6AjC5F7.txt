Figure 1: Given an edit (Edit 1) of x- to x+, f∆ computes an edit representation vector. Using thatrepresentation vector the neural editor α applies the same edit to a new x0-. The code snippets shownhere are real code change examples from the roslyn open-source compiler project.
Figure 2: (a) Graph representation of statement u = x + x. Rectangular (resp. rounded) nodesdenote tokens (resp. non-terminals). (b) Sequence of tree decoding steps yielding x + x - 23,where x + x is copied (using the TreeCp action) from the context graph in (a).
Figure 3: Sequence (a) and graph (b) representation of edit of v.F = x + x to u = x + x.
Figure 4: t-SNE visualization of edits from 13C# fixers, where point color indicates the fixer.
