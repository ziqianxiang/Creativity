Figure 1:	Visual comparison of 30 binarized MNIST images with bitstream outputsfrom running lossless compression algorithms PNG, bz2 and BB-ANS on the images1.
Figure 2:	Graphical model With latent variable y and observed variable s.
Figure 3: A 2000 point moving average of the compression rate, in bits per dimen-sion, during the compression process using BB-ANS with a VAE. We compress aconcatenation of three shuffled copies of the MNIST test set.
Figure 4: An example of the discretization of the latent space with a standard Gaussianprior, using 16 buckets.
Figure 5: Python implementation of BB-ANS encode (‘append’) and decode (‘pop’)methods.
