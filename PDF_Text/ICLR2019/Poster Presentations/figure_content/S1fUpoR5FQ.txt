Figure 1: Selected parameter sweep results (full results in Appendix J). Top row shows train loss.
Figure 2: Case study results. Top row: RN152-Imagenet-QHM (left), FConvLM-WikiText103-QHM (center), and TF-WMT16ENDE-QHAdam (right). Bottom row: TD3-MuJoCo-QHAdamAnt (left), HalfCheetah (center), Hopper (right). Shaded bands indicate ±1 standard deviation.
Figure 3: Bound from (18), fixing ν1 = 0.8, β1 = 0.95, and β2 = 0.98, and varying ν2.
Figure 4: Training and validation MSE of AggMo-Best and QHM-Converted over the first 500epochs. The shaded region corresponds to one standard deviation over 15 runs.
