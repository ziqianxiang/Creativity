Figure 2: Examples from six classes in the Bio dataset (red: cell nuclei, blue: cell cytoplasm,magnification: 10X). Empty squares: the domain does not contain any known examples from thisclass. Best seen in color.
Figure 3: Visualization of class features on Webcam (red) > Amazon (blue). Dimmer colors indicateclasses for which labeled examples are available in both domains.
Figure 4: Impact of parameter P in comparison with p? on MNIST - MNIST-M. P = 0 correspondsto DANN (see text for details): no data flowed through the KUD module. We can see that differentvalues of (P, P? ) do not influence the accuracy on a domain which did not have any unlabaleddatapoints from extra classes (MNIST in this case).
