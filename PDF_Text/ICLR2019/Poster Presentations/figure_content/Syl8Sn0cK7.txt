Figure 1: Graph representation of syntax and semantic constraint. Note that the reversed links arealso added in our representation.
Figure 2: Generating solution using the grammar adaptive policy network. This figure shows onestep of policy roll-out, which demonstrates how the same policy network handles different taskswith different grammar G1 and G2 .
Figure 3: An example of a circuit synthesis task from the 2017 SyGuS competition. Given theoriginal program specification which is represented as an abstract syntax tree (left), the solver istasked to synthesize a new circuit f (right). The synthesis process is specified by the syntacticconstraint G (top), and the semantic constraint (bottom) specifies that f must have functionalityequivalent to the original program.
