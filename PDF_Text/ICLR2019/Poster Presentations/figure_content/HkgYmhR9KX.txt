Figure 3: Cumulative reward curves for tracker trained in AD-VAT versus the baseline methodswhen tested in the validation environment. For both 2D (left) and 3D (middle) settings, AD-VATimproves the sample-efficiency and achieves higher reward. The right figure is the learning curve ofthe ablation study in 2D environment.
