Figure 1: Overview of our proposed model. The input at a given time is the action of the previousskip agent (St-1), the previous jump agent action (Jt-1), and the word embedded token (tokeni).
Figure 2: Example of jumping and skipping behaviour of our Structural-Jump-LSTM from DB-Pedia. Skipped Words have a single strike-through While jumps consist of a sequence of strike-throughed Words. The Words that are jumped over or skipped are considered by the model notimportant for classifying the means of transportation (even though they include several nouns andname entinites that are generally considered to be important (Lioma & van Rijsbergen, 2008).
