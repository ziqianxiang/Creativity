Figure 1: The ground truth solutions of examples in different settings. We only train our models onthe square domain, and we test on all 4 settings.
Figure 2: CPU runtime comparisons of our model with the FEniCS model. Our method is compara-ble or faster than the best solver in FEniCS in all cases. When run on GPU, our solver provides anadditional 30Ã— speedup.
