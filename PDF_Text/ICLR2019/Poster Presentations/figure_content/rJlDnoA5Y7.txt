Figure 1: Left: Comparison of samples processed per second by the softmax vs. BPE vs. continuousoutput VMF models for IWSLT16 fr-en. Right: Comparison of convergence times of our modelsand baseline models on IWSLT16 fr-en validation sets. Baseline SOftmaX as Wen as BPE convergeat epoch 12 whereas our proposed model (NLLvMF) converges at epoch 7.
