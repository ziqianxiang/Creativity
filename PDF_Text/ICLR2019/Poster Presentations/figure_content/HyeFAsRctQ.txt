Figure 1: For three specifications, we plot the verification bound and adversarial bound as a functionof perturbation size on the input.
Figure 2: The red dashed line displays the pendulum’s ground truth trajectory (height vs time). Theblack line shows a rollout from model B, the blue line shows a rollout from model A. The moreverifiable model (model A) clearly tracks the ground truth trajectory significantly more closely.
Figure 3: The projection of the decision boundaries onto a two dimensional surface formed by in-terpolating between three images belonging to the same semantic category (vehicles) - aeroplane(cyan), ship (green) and truck (yellow).The red/blue/black regions represent bird/cat/frog respec-tively).
Figure 4: This plots the convex constraint G(y, 1, -1) (left) and the tangential constraints for anexponential function when y ∈ [l, u] where l = -1 and u = 1.
Figure 5: We plot the projection of the decision boundaries onto a two dimensional surface formedby interpolating between three images belonging to the same semantic category (vehicles) - truck(yellow), ship (green) and automobile (dark green). cyan/blue regions represent airplane/cat.
Figure 6:	We compared two different convex-relaxations of the physics specification. Specifically,one which is with SDP constraints shown in Eq. (23) and one without the SDP constraint.
Figure 7:	Top left plot shows the difference between verification bound and adversarial bound withrespect to N = 2, 3 and 4, where N is the number of digits summed (see. (4)). All other plots showsthe verification bound and the adversarial bound for N = 2, 3, 4 digits summed.
Figure 8: On the left is a plot showing the true feasible region (T) for x2 - y2 ≤ 4 (green) wherebx = 10 and by = 9, Sin = {x : -bx ≤ x ≤ bx} and Sout = {y : -by ≤ y ≤ by} withits corresponding convex relaxed region C (black lined box). The plot on the right shows |C|—∣Tl,where |C | represents the volume of the set, as bx increases and by = 9.
Figure 9: This plot shows the entropy specification, (28), satisfaction for an MNIST classifier whereE = 0.1.
