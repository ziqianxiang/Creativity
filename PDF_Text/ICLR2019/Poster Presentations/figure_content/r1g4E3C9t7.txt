Figure 1: Pipeline and example of the proposed temporal dependency (TD) based method for dis-criminating audio adversarial examples.
Figure 2: Attack success rates (%)Figure 3: Attack success (%) after transformationCommander We also evaluate our input transformation method against the Commander Song at-tack (Yuan et al., 2018), which implemented an Air-to-API adversarial attack. In the paper, theauthors reported 91% attack detection rate using their defense method. We measured our Quan-256input transformation on 25 adversarial examples obtained via personal communications. Based on6Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2019the same detection evaluation metric in (Yuan et al., 2018)1, Quan-256 attains 100% detection ratefor characterizing all the adversarial examples.
