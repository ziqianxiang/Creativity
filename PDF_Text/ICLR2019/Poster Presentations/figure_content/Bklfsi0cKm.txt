Figure 1: The 2D convolution U(O) * Xj as the dot product W(O)Xj. The blank elements of W(O)are zeros. The μth row of W(0) corresponds to applying the filter to the μth convolutional patch ofthe channel Xj .
Figure 2: Comparison of the infinite limit, and outputs from finite 32-layer ResNets with 3, 10,30, and 100 channels in their first layers. A Comparison of the empirical and limiting probabilitydensities. B A more sensitive test of Gaussianity is a quantile-quantile plot, which shows convergeswith 100 channels. C The moments (variances and covariances) for 100 training inputs shows givesa good match for all numbers of channels.
Figure 3: Calibration plots for an RBF kernel (left) and the ResNet kernel (right). The x-axis givesGP prediction for the label probability. The points give corresponding proportion of test points withthat label, and the bars give the proportion of training examples in each bin.
