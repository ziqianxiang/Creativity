Figure 1: Overview of Conditional class-Aware Meta-Learning. Inputs to the model are mapped ontoan embedding space using fφ which are then used to modulate the base-learner fθ through a conditionaltransformation fc. We use MAML (not shown) to meta-learn fc, fθ , and a metric loss to pre-train fφthe base-learner, and a meta-learner that learns across different tasks. Figure 1 depicts a toy illustration ofthe task inference procedure where examples from three classes are mapped onto a metric space using fφ,which are further used to modulate the base-learner fθ through a conditional transformation function fc .
Figure 2: Conditionally transformed convolutional block. The convolutional feature maps are conditionallyscaled and shifted based on the input image’s representation in the pre-trained metric space.
