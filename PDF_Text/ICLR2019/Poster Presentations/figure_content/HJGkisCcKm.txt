Figure 1: (a) The schematic architecture of our translation network. The confusion term (markedby the dashed line) is employed only during training. E is the shared encoder, C is the domainclassification network employed in the domain confusion term, Di are the various decoders. (b) Adetailed depiction of our architecture. ‘NC’ indicates non-causal convolution. ‘1x1’ indicates a 1-Dconvolution with kernel size 1.
Figure 2: Results of the lineup experiment. (a) listeners from the general population tend to selectthe same domain as the source regardless of the actual source. (b) the musician A failed to identifythe source most of the time. (c) the amateurs T and (d) S failed most of the time.
Figure 3:	Correlation of embeddings across pitch. (a) Self-correlation for NSynth’s flute-acoustic-027. (b) Self-correlation for keyboard-electronic-019. (c) The correlation between the electronickeyboard (y-axis) and the flute. (d) Self-correlation for brass-acoustic-018. (e) Self-correlation forstring-acoustic-029. (f) The correlation between the brass instrument (y-axis) and the string.
