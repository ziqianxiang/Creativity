Figure 1: A conceptual illustration of our transduCtive meta-learning framework, where lines between nodesrepresent graph connections and their colors represent the potential direction of label propagation. The neigh-borhood graph is episodic-wisely trained for transductive inference.
Figure 2: The overall framework of our algorithm in which the manifold structure of the entire query set helps tolearn better decision boundary. The proposed algorithm is composed of four components: feature embedding,graph construction, label propagation, and loss generation.
Figure 3: Detailed architecture of the graph construction module, in which the length-scale parameter isexample-wisely determined.
Figure 4: 5-way performance with various training/test shots.
Figure 5: Model performance With different training shots. The x-axis indicates the number of shots in training,and the y-axis indicates 5-way test accuracy for 1-shot and 5-shot. Error bars indicate 95% confidence intervalsas computed over 600 test episodes.
