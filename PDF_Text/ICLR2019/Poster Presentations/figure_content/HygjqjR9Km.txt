Figure 1: Illustration of the gradient directions of each loss on the real sample scores {D(x)} (“r”nodes) and generated sample scores {D(y)} (“g” nodes). The blue arrows stand for attraction andthe orange arrows for repulsion. When LmGmd is paired with LaDtt, the gradient directions of LmGmd on{D(y)} can be obtained by reversing the arrows in (a), thus are omitted.
Figure 2: (a) Gaussian kernels {kσrbf(a, b)} and their mean as a function of e = ka - bk, whereσi ∈ {1, √2,2, 2√2,4} were used in our experiments; (b) derivatives of {唠(a, b)} in (a); (C)rational quadratic kernel {kαrqi (a, b)} and their mean, where αi ∈ {0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5}; (d) derivativesof{kαrqi(a, b)} in (c).
Figure 3: FID scores of MMD-GAN using (a) RBF kernel and (b) RBF-B kernel in LD,λ on CIFAR-10 dataset for 16 learning rate combinations. Each color bar represents the FID score using a learningrate combination (ρD, ρG), in the order of (1e-4, 1e-4), (1e-4, 2e-4),...,(1e-3, 1e-3). The discrim-inator was trained using LD,λ (Eq. 5) with λ ∈ {-1, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 1, 2}, and generator using LmGmd(Eq. 2). We use the FID> 30 to indicate that the model diverged or produced poor results.
Figure 4: t-SNE visualization of discriminator outputs {D(x)} learned by (a) MMD-rbf and (b)MMD-rep for 2560 real samples from the CIFAR-10 dataset, colored by their class labels.
Figure S1: Streamline plots of MMD-GAN using the MMD-rbf and the MMD-rep model on distri-butions: PZ = U (-1, 1), PX = U (-1, 1) or PX = N(0, 1). In (a) and (b), the equilibria satisfyingPG = PX lie on the line w1 = 1. In (c), the equilibrium lies around point (1.55, 0.74); in (d), it isaround (1.55, 0.32).
Figure S2: Boxplot of the FID scores for 16 learning rate combinations on four datasets: (a) CIFAR-10, (b) STL-10, (c) CelebA, (d) LSUN-bedroom, using four loss functions, Hinge, MMD-rbf,MMD-rep and MMD-rmb. Spectral normalization was applied to discriminator with two poweriteration methods: PICO and PIM. For PICO, five coefficients CK were tested: 16, 32, 64, 128,and 256. A learning rate combination was considered diverged or poorly-performed if the FID scoreexceeded a threshold τ, which is 50, 80, 50, 90 for CIFAR-10, STL-10, CelebA and LSUN-bedroomrespectively. The box quartiles were plotted based on the cases with FID < τ while the number ofdiverged or poorly-performed cases (out of 16 learning rate combinations) was shown above eachbox if it is non-zero. We introduced τ because the diverged cases often had arbitrarily large andnon-meaningful FID scores.
