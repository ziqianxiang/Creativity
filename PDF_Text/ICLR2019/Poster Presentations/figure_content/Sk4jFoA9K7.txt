Figure 1: Our Peer Regularization illustrated on three pixels (red, green, blue) ofa CIFAR image(center). For each pixel, five nearest neighbors are found in peer images. Plots represent the featuremaps in the respective pixels; numbers represent the attention scores.
Figure 2: Top: PR-LeNet architecture used on the MNIST dataset; Bottom: PR-ResNet architectureused for the CIFAR experiments, letters A, B, and C indicate the number of feature maps in eachresidual block. The respective baseline models are produced by simply removing the PR layers.
Figure 3: Examples of “Franken-images” (second row) constructed by backpropagating the attentionscores to the input and using them to compose a new image as weighted sum of the peer pixels.

Figure 8: Examples of applying universal perturbations to different images from the CIFAR-10 testset. For each sample, the leftmost is the original image, then adversarial examples for ResNet-32 areshown in the top row, whereas for PR-ResNet-32 in the bottom row.
Figure 9: Examples of sample-specific gradient-based perturbations for different images from theCIFAR-10 test set using FGSM((a), (c)) and gradient descent((b), (d)). For each sample, resultsfor ResNet-32 are shown in the top row, whereas for PR-ResNet-32 in the bottom row. In order tosuccessfully generate adversarial samples for PR-Nets, the magnitude of the perturbation has to bemuch higher.
