Figure 1: The ability to differentiate between an in-class image and an in-class image with addednoise for both c (yellow) and h (blue). The x-axis is the amount of noise (SD of the Gaussian noise).
Figure 2: Results for a mixture of Gaussians placed on a 2D grid, following Balduzzi et al. (2018).
Figure 3: Same as Fig. 1, but where the images are taken from the test set of all classes, regardlessof the single class used for training.
