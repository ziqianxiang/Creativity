Figure 1: Average AUROC performance across 12 different predictive models trained on the synthetic datasetgenerated by PATE-GAN and DPGAN with various (with δ = 10-5) (Setting B).

Figure 3: Block diagram of the training procedure for the teacher-discriminator during a single generatoriteration. Teacher-discriminators are trained to minimize the classification loss when classifying samples asreal samples or generated samples. During this step only the parameters of the teachers are updates (and notthe generator).
Figure 4: Block diagram of the training procedure for the student-discriminator and the generator. The student-discriminator is trained using noisy teacher-labelled generated samples (the noise provides the DP guarantees).
Figure 5: Block diagram of the DPGAN benchmark. It uses the standard WGAN framework. To guaranteedifferential privacy of the generator (with Post-processing Theorem), noise is added to the gradient of thediscriminator during training to create a differentially private discriminator.
