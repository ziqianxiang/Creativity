Figure 1: Left: the 48 Ã— 48 matrix of similarities from the 48-concept dataset, defined as the pairwiseprobability of A, B being matched in a triplet with a random third concept from the 46 remaining.
Figure 2: SPoSE dimensions explained by CSLB labels. The top 4 objects for each SPoSE dimensionare shown with the 12 CSLB features with the largest weights in the NNLS model for predicting thatfeature. Bar length indicates relative weight, while color indicates feature type: green (taxonomic),blue (functional), yellow (encyclopedic), red (visual perceptual), violet (non-visual perceptual).
Figure 3: The 48 concepts used to create the densely sampled test dataset.
Figure 4:	SPoSE features 1-21 (out of 49) explained by CSLB labels via NNLS. Top 4 concepts foreach of four selected SPoSE feature are shown beside 12 CSLB features with the largest weights forpredicting that SPoSE feature. Size of bars indicates relative weight, while color indicates featuretype. Green: taxonomic; Blue: functional; Yellow: encyclopedic; Red: visual perceptual; Violet:non-visual perceptual.
Figure 5:	SPoSE features 22-42 (out of 49) explained by CSLB labels via NNLS. Top 4 concepts foreach of four selected SPoSE feature are shown beside 12 CSLB features with the largest weights forpredicting that SPoSE feature. Size of bars indicates relative weight, while color indicates featuretype. Green: taxonomic; Blue: functional; Yellow: encyclopedic; Red: visual perceptual; Violet:non-visual perceptual.
Figure 6: SPoSE features 43-49 (out of 49) explained by CSLB labels via NNLS. Top 4 concepts foreach of four selected SPoSE feature are shown beside 12 CSLB features with the largest weights forpredicting that SPoSE feature. Size of bars indicates relative weight, while color indicates featuretype. Green: taxonomic; Blue: functional; Yellow: encyclopedic; Red: visual perceptual; Violet:non-visual perceptual.
