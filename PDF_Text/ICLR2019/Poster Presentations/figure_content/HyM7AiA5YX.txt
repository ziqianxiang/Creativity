Figure 1: Predicted probabilities y from two training paradigms: (a) With cross entropy as theprimary objective. (b) COT: With both primary and complement objectives. The model is ResNet-110 and the sample image is from CIFAR10 dataset. The ground-truth class is “horse.” Comparedto (b), the model in (a) is confused by other classes such as “airplane” and “automobile,” Whichsuggests (a) might be more susceptible for generalization issues and potentially adversarial attacks.
Figure 2: Embeddings for CIFAR10 test images from tWo training paradigms: (a) With cross entropyas the primary objective. (b) COT: training With both primary and complement objectives. Themodel is ResNet-110, and the “embedding” is the vector representation before taking the softmaxoperation. The embedding representation of each sample is projected to tWo dimensions using t-SNEfor visualization purpose. Compared to (a), the cluster of each class in (b) is “narroWer” in terms ofintra-cluster distance. Also, the clusters in (b) seem to have clean and separable boundaries, leadingto more accurate and robust classification results.
Figure 3: Classification errors on CIFAR-10: (a) COT improves all 5 state-of-the-art models. (b)The improvement over epochs. Notice that the performance improvement from COT becomes stableafter the 100th epoch due to the learning rate decrease.
Figure 4: Classification errors on CIFAR-100: (a) COT improves all 5 state-of-the-art models. (b)The improvement over epochs. Similar to the trend observed in CIFAR-10, the performance im-provement from COT becomes stable after the 100th epoch due to the learning rate decrease.
