Figure 1: We illustrate the different approximations on a synthetic composite objective functionΦ(w) = L(f (w)) (Φ is plotted in black). In this example, L is a maximum of linear functions(similarly to a hinge loss) and f is a non-linear smooth map. We denote the current iterate by wt, andthe point minimizing Φ by w*. On the left-hand side, one can observe how the SGD approximation isa single line (tangent at Φ(wt), in blue), while the LPL approximation is piecewise linear (in orange),and thus matches the objective curve (in black) more closely. On the right-hand side, an identicalproximal term is added to both approximations to visualize equations (5) and (6). Thanks to thebetter accuracy of the LPL approximation, the iterate wtL+PL1 gets closer to the solution w* than wtS+GD1 .
