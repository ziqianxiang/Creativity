(2018). The values for the first three models are taken from that paper. TreeNN follows Alla-manis et al. (2017) and TreeLSTM follows Tai et al. (2015). PossibleWorldNet is developed in Evanset al. (2018). TopDownNets are our standard models from the beginning of Section 3 with the lowestlosses on the validation set for different values of d.
