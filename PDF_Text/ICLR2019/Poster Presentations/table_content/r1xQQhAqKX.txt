Table 1: Accuracy of pairwise verification and KNN identification tasks for point embeddings, andour hedged embeddings with a single Gaussian component (MoG-1) and two components (MoG-2).
Table 2: Correlations between each input image’s measure of uncertainty, η(x), and AP and KNNperformances. High correlation coefficients suggest a close relationship.
Table 3: Summary of N-digit MNIST dataset for N = 2, 3.
Table 4: Task performance and uncertainty measure correlations with task performance for 4D em-beddings with 3-digit MNIST.
Table 5: Results for single Gaussian embeddings with and without KL divergence term. We reportresults for images with N digits and using D embedding dimensions.
