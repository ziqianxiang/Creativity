Table 1: Results for different models, adversarial attacks and distance metrics. Each entry shows themedian adversarial distance across all samples (left value, black) as well as the model’s accuracyagainst adversarial perturbations bounded by the thresholds L2 = 1.5, L∞ = 0.3 and L0 = 12(right value, gray). “w/ GE” indicates attacks that use numerical gradient estimation.
