Table 1: Failure search. We show cost for different adversaries to find an adversarial probleminstance, measUred by the expected nUmber of episodes. Each colUmn reports the min, median, andmax over evalUations of 5 separate agents. In the median case, the AVF adversary finds adversarialinpUts with 198x fewer episodes than random testing on Driving and 3100x fewer on HUmanoid(Acceleration Factor).
Table 2: Adversary hyperparameter sensitivity analysis. We show the performance of Algorithm2 for varying values of the sample size parameter n. The middle column shows results for n = n0,the value we used in our experiments, and we compare to a factor of 10 larger and smaller. Costsrepresent expected number of episodes until a failure, and speedups are relative to when n = n0 . Asbefore, each cell shows min, median, and max values across 5 agents. On both domains, applyinggreater optimization pressure improves results.
