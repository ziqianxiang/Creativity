Table 1: Classification results on target test set in the semi-supervised DA setting (average and stdevon 5 seeds or folds). Bold: results less than 1 stdev from the best in each column. See text.
Table 2: Cell test classification accuracy results on all domains (average and stdev on 5 folds), in thefully transductive setting (see table 5 in Appendix for non-transductive ones, and sections C.4, C.5for details about image and class selection).
Table 3: Class content per case mains on OFFICE (W→A) for DANN, MADA and MULANN.
Table 3: Class content for the Cell experiments in table 2. In all cases, the first domain contains thesame classes as domain 2, though with labeled examples from all classes. These classes were pickedas those with best classification accuracy in an unsupervised setting; results are similar when pickingthe classes with worst classification accuracy. 10 labeled images per class were used for training.
Table 4: Architectures. In the case when considering only two domains, i = 1 and the last activationof domain discriminators is a sigmoid. When considering three domains, i = 3 and the activation is asoftmax. Knowledge discriminator architecture is identical to that of domain discriminators withoutthe gradient reversal layer.
Table 5: Range of hyper-parameters which were evaluated in cross-validation experiments. Exponen-tially decreasing schedule, exponentially increasing schedule, indiv. lr (learning rates from layerswhich were trained from scratch are multiplied by 10), as in (Ganin et al., 2016).

Table 5: Cell average test classification results on all domain (average and stdev on 5 folds). Pstands for "profiles", "lab." for labeled and "unlab." for unlabeled. Baselines are obtained by trainingMULANN with λ = 0 (NN) and LDA+k-NN (P) on both domains. Results were obtained in thenon-fully transductive setting, without hyper-parameter optimization.
