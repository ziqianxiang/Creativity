Each model has it’s own limitations:The FS model can not directly compute an inverse of the encoded representation to generate a metamer,requiring an iterative gradient descent procedure. Our NF model is limited by the capacity of theencoder-decoder architecture as it does not achieve lossless compression (perfect reconstruction).
