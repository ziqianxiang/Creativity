Table 5: Summary of effectiveness of '∞ CIFAR10 attacks on Inception v3, ReSNet-50, and VGG16(I, R, V) using NES and bandits with time and data-dependent priors (BanditsTD). Note that in thefirst column, the average number of queries is calculated only over successful attacks, and we enforcea query limit of 10,000 queries. For purposes of direct comparison, the last column calculates theaverage number of queries used for only the images that NES (previous SOTA) was successful on.
