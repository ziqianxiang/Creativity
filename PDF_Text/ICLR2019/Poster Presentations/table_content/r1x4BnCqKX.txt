Table 1: Work on machine learning for reaction prediction, and whether they are (a) end-to-endtrainable, and (b) predict the reaction mechanism.
Table 2: Results when using ELECTRO for mech-anism prediction. Here a prediction is correct ifthe atom mapped action sequences predicted by ourmodel match exactly those extracted from the USPTOdataset.
Table 3: Results for product prediction, following the product matching procedure in Section 5.2. Forthe baselines we compare against models trained (a) on the full USPTO training set (marked FTS)and only tested on our subset of LEF reactions, and (b) those that are also trained on the same subsetas our model. We make use of the code and pre-trained models provided by Jin et al. (2017). Forthe Seq2Seq approach, as neither code nor more fine grained results are available, we train up therequired models from scratch using the OpenNMT library (Klein et al., 2017).
Table 4: Atom features we use as input to the GGNN. These are calculated using RDKit.
