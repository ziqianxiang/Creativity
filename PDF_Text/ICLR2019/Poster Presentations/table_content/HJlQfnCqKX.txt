Table 1: Ablation experiments considering different scenarios (see text for details). The last 3 rowsare baselines from: (Bartlett et al., 2017; Sokolic et al., 2016; Elsayed et al., 2018). A indicatesadjusted; kf indicates k-fold; mse indicates mean squared error in 10-3; N indicates negative.

Table 3: Table 1 with two additional row. The second to last row shows prediction of generalizationgap when negative margins are used; the last row is for prediction of test accuracy rather than gap.
Table 4: Single layer comparison, all with qrt+log14Published as a conference paper at ICLR 20198	Appendix: Further Analysis of Regression8.1	CNN + CIFAR- 1 0 + All Quartile SignatureFigure 5: Residual plots for all explanatory variables, row: h0, h1, h2, h3, column: lower fence, Q1,Q2, Q3, upper fence. lower fence is clipped because distance cannot be smaller than 0. The residualis fairly evenly distributed around 0.
Table 5: F score (top) and p-values (bottom) for all 20 variables. Using p = 0.05, the null hypothesesare rejected for every variable.
Table 6: F score (top) and p-values (bottom) for all 20 variables. Using p = 0.05, We see that the nullhypotheses are not rejected for 4 of the variables. We believe having a more diverse generalizationbehavior in the study Will solve this problem.
