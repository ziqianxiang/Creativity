Table 1: Comparison between the performances of deep learning and linear methods. N is thenumber of parameters to approximate a function in a Besov space (Bps,q([0, 1]d)), and n is the samplesize. The approximation error is measured by Lr -norm. The O symbol hides the poly-log order.
Table 2: Summary of relation between related existing work and our work for a mixed smooth Besovspace. N is the number of parameters in the deep neural network, n is the sample size. Î² representsthe smoothness parameter, and d represents the dimensionality of the input. The approximationaccuracy is measured by L2-norm and estimation accuracy is measured by the square of L2 -norm.
