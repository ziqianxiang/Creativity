Table 1: Top-scoring phrases of different lengths extracted by ACD on SST’s validation set. Thepositive/negative phrases identified by ACD are all indeed positive/negative.
Table 2: Correlation between pixel ranks for different adversarial attacks. ACD achieves consistentlyhigh correlation across different attack types, indicating that ACD hierarchies are largely robust toadversarial attacks. Using occlusion in place of CD produces substantially less stable hierarchies.
Table S1: Top-scoring phrases of different lengths extracted by ACD on SST’s validation set. Thepositive/negative phrases identified by ACD are all indeed positive/negativeFig S2 compares the 7x7 superpixel-level scores for four images comparing different methods forobtaining importance scores. CD scores better find information relevant to predicting the correctclass.
