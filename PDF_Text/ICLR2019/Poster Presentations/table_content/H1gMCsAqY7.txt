Table 1: Runtime of MobileNet v1 for image classification on different devices.
Table 2: Number and percentage of parameters in batch normalization layers.
Table 3: Results of ImageNet classification. We show top-1 error rates of individually trained net-works and slimmable networks given same width configurations and FLOPs. We use S- to indicateslimmable models, * to denote our reproduced result.
Table 4: Top-1 error rates on ImageNet classification with individually trained networks, 4-switchS-MobileNet v1 [0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]× and 8-switch S-MobileNet v1 [0.25, 0.35, 0.45, 0.55, 0.65, 0.75, 0.85, 1.0]×.
