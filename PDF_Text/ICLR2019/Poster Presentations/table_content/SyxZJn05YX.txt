Table 1: Numeric results on different input sources for the reliableset (using ReSNet-101-FPN model). F is the up-sampling layer;we use option (d), OT as the final candidate. The biased version ofoptimal transport is detailed in appendix, Sec. 6.3.
Table 2: Ablation study on the component design of feature intertwiner. Gray background is thefinal default setting adopted in each case. Network is either ResNet-50-FPN or 101.
Table 3: Proposal assignment on each level before RoI operation. ‘below #’ indicates how manyproposals are there whose size is below the size of RoI output. ‘intertwiner large #’ stands for howmany proposals are used for supervising the learning of small objects.
Table 4: Object detection single-model performance (bounding box AP) on the COCO test-dev.
Table 5: Comparison of our model with feature intertwiner to other methods on PASCAL VOC2007 test set. Here we adopt two backbone options: ResNet-101 and VGG-16 without FPN to fairlycompare with others. The number of levels is 4, the same as on COCO benchmark.
Table 6: Network structure of the make-up unit, which consists of one convolutional layer withoutaltering the spatial size. Input: RoI output of the small-set feature map Pl. We denote the output ofthe make-up layer as Pl0 . B is the batch size in one mini-batch; Cl is the number of channels afterthe feature extractor in ResNet blocks for each level. For example, when l = 2, Cl = 256, etc.
Table 7: Network structure of the critic unit. Input: for large set, it is the RoI output of the large-setfeature map Pm|l and for small set, it is the output of the make-up layer Pl0. B is the batch size inone mini-batch; Cl is the number of channels in ResNet blocks.
