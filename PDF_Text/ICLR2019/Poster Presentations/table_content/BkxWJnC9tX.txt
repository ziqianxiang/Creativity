Table 1: Results on Omniglot multi-task learning. Results are taken over 10 runs. The first two resultsare from Meyerson & Miikkulainen (2018) and the next four results are from Liang et al. (2018).
Table 2: Ablation study over the importance of diversity in expert architectures.
Table 3: Accuracy of ResNet-50 style routing models with only 3Ã—3 experts or all expert typesacross 4 datasets. For fair comparison, all models have been hyperparameter tuned equally andindependently. Bold indicates a nontrivial difference that cannot be explained by noise.
Table 4: Results on CIFAR-10. F is the base number of filters in each cell, and C is the numberof cells. The one-shot and all on come from Bender et al. (2018). The all-on model is one whereall operations are used for every example. The one-shot top model is a retrained static architecturewhich is a subset of the all-on model.
