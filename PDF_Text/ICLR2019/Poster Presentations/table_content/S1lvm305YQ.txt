Table 1: The exact question format that was used in the AMT studies. For part (i) and (ii), participantswere asked to choose one answer among the options. For part (iii) and (iv), a text box was providedfor participants to type in their answers.
Table 2: AMT results on pair-wise instrument comparisons between our proposed TimbreTronwithout beam search, ground truth original instrument and ground truth target instrument. Thiscorresponds to question type (i) in Table 1.
Table 3: AMT results on pair-wise musical piece comparisons between our proposed TimbreTronwithout beam search, ground truth original instrument and ground truth target instrument. Thiscorresponds to question type (ii) in Table 1.
Table 4: AMT results on timbre quality compar-isons between our proposed TimbreTron, Tim-breTron but with STFT Wavenet and TimbreTronwith STFT Griffin-Lim. Participants are asked:which one of the following two samples soundsmore like the instrument provided in the target in-strument sample?Comparing CQT vs. STFT To empirically test if our proposed TimbreTron with CQT representa-tion is better than its STFT-Wavenet counterpart, or its STFT-GriffinLim counterpart, we conducteda human study using AMT. The original questionnaire can be found here9 In the questionnaire, weasked Turkers to listen to three audio clips: the original audio from instrument A (the “instrumentexample”), the TimbreTron generated audio of instrument A, and its STFT conterparts, then askedthem: “In your opinion, which one of A and B sounds more like the instrument provided in ‘instru-ment example”’? , where A and B in the questions are the generated samples (presented in randomorder). Naturally, sounding closer to the “instrument sample” means the timbre quality is better. Weconducted two groups of experiment. In the first group, the STFT counterpart is the Wavenet andCycleGAN trained on STFT representation and the result is in first row of the Table 4: most peoplethink the CQT TimbreTron is better. In the second group, we took the same CycleGAN trainedon STFT, but instead simply generated the waveform using Griffin-Lim algorithm. The results arein the second row: Even more people think CQT TimbreTron is better. In conclusion, compared
