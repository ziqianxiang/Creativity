Table 1: Comparing the testing accuracy under different levels of PGD attacks. We include ourmethod, Adv-BNN, and the state of the art defense method, the multi-step adversarial training pro-posed in Madry et al. (2017). The better accuracy is marked in bold. Notice that although ourAdv-BNN incurs larger accuracy drop in the original test set (where kξk∞ = 0), we can choose asmaller α in (13) so that the regularization effect is weakened, in order to match the accuracy.
