Table 1: Dataset statistics.
Table 2: vanilla LSTM refers to a standard LSTM full reading. The columns show the accuracy(Acc), the percentage of text being jumped over, and the total reading percentage.
Table 3: Comparison of state-of-the-art speed reading models. âˆ†Acc is the difference between theaccuracy of the full read LSTM and the model (the higher the better), and FLOP-r is the FLOPreduction compared to a full read model. A star (*) indicates that the original paper provided only aspeed increase, which should be considered a lower bound for FLOP-r.
