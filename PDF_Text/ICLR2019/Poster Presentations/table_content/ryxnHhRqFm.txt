Table 2: Per-response accuracy and completion rate (in the parentheses) on bAbI dialogues. GLMPachieves the least out-of-vocabulary performance drop. Baselines are reported from Query Reduc-tion Network (Seo et al., 2017), End-to-end Memory Network (Bordes & Weston, 2017), GatedMemory Network (Liu & Perez, 2017), Point to Unknown Word (Gulcehre et al., 2016), andMemory-to-Sequence (Madotto et al., 2018).

Inaddition, to increase model generalization and simulate OOV setting, we randomly mask a smallnumber of input source tokens into an unknown token. The model is implemented in PyTorch andthe hyper-parameters used for each task and the dataset statistics are reported in the Appendix.
