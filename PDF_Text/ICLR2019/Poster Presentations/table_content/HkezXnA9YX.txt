Table 1: Tree layout induction results for Stochastic N2NMNs using Residual and Find moduleson 1 rhs/lhs and 18 rhs/lhs datasets. For each setting of p0 (tree) we report results after 5 runs.
Table 2: Parameterization induction results for 1,2,18 rhs/lhs datasets for Attention N2NMN. Themodel does not generalize well in the difficult 1 rhs/lhs setting. Results for MAC are presented forcomparison. Means and standard deviations were estimated based on at least 10 runs.
Table 3: Training details for all models. The subsampling factor is the ratio between the originalspatial dimensions of the input image and those of the representation produced by the stem. It iseffectively equal to 2k, where k is the number of 2x2 max-pooling operations in the stem.
Table 4: Results of an ablation study for MAC. The default model has 12 MAC units of dimension-ality 128 and uses no weight decay. For each experiment we report means and standard deviationsbased on 5 repetitions.
