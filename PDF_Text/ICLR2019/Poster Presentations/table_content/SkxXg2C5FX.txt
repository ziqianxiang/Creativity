Table 1: Mean Pearson correlation on STS tasks for a variety of methods in the literature. Bolded valuesindicate best results per task and word vector where applicable, while underlined values indicate overall bestper task. All previous results are taken from Perone et al. (2018) (only two significant figures provided) andSubramanian et al. (2018b). Note that avg-cos refers to taking the average word vector and comparing by cosinesimilarity, and word2vec refers to the Google News version. Clearly more sophisticated methods of computingsentence representations do not shine on the unsupervised STS tasks when compared to these simple BoWmethods with high-quality word vectors and the appropriate similarity metric. ↑ indicates the only STS13 result(to our knowledge) that includes the SMT subtask.
Table 2: Mean Pearson correlations on STS tasks comparing DynaMax against Arora et al. (2017)’s avg-SIF+PCA method. Bolded values indicate best results per task and word vectors (both methods can be applied toany word vectors). All methods use SIF word weights as described in Arora et al. (2017); in this case averageword vector with cosine similarity (avg-SIF in the table) is equivalent to the Arora et al. (2017)’s methodwithout PCA, so we include it for additional context. Note that removing the first principal component requirescomputation on the entire test set (see Algorithm 1 in Arora et al. (2017)), whereas DynaMax is completelyindependent of the test set. Even with this distinction, avg-SIF+PCA and DynaMax perform comparably, andboth generally outperform avg-SIF although use of PSL vectors closes the gap considerably.
Table 3: Mean Pearson correlation on STS tasks for DynaMax and averaged word vector, all using normalisedword vectors. Bolded values indicate best results per task and word vector type. Note that DynaMax stilloutperforms avg-cos across the board, but both approaches lose to their unnormalised counterparts as reported inTable 1.	______________________________________________________________________________Vectors	Approach	STS12	STS13	STS14	STS15	STS16GloVe	avg-cos	47.1	44.9	49.7	51.9	44.0	DynaMax	53.7	47.8	59.5	66.3	62.9fastText	avg-cos	47.6	46.1	54.5	58.8	49.6	DynaMax	51.6	46.3	59.6	68.5	62.8word2vec	avg-cos	45.2	49.3	57.3	59.1	51.8	DynaMax	47.6	49.7	60.7	68.0	62.8A	NORMALISED VECTORS AND [0, 1] -FUZZY SETSIn the word fuzzification step the membership values for a word w are obtained through a similarityfunction sim(w, u(j)) between the word embedding w and the rows of the universe matrix U, i.e.
Table 4: Mean Pearson correlation on STS tasks for different fuzzy SSMs. The performance is almost identicalacross the board.
Table 5: Mean Pearson correlation on STS tasks for the ablation studies. As described in Appendix C, it isclear that the three components of the algorithm — the dynamic universe, the max-pooling operation, and thefuzzy Jaccard index — all contribute to the strong performance of DynaMax-Jaccard.
Table 6: Pearson correlation for DynaMax and averaged word vector, and the 95% confidence interval for the difference between two correlations. According to thisanalysis, DynaMax significantly outperforms the baseline in 77.8% of the experiments and significantly loses in only 1.39% of them. In the remaining 20.8% of theexperiments the two approaches perform statistically the same.
