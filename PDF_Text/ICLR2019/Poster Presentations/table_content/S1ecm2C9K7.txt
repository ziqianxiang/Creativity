Table 1: Bias measured on real datasets, and results of applying one of three mitigation strategies:feature parity (par), influence-directed experts (exp), and '1 regularization. The columns give: p*,percent class prior for the majority class (y = 1); asymm, the percentages of features orientedtowards y = 1; BD (hS) the bias of the learned model on test data, which we measure before andafter each fix (post-fix); acc, the test accuracy before and after each fix. The first two rows areexperiments on deep networks, and the remainder are on 20 training runs of logistic regression withstochastic gradient descent. `1 regularization was not applied to the deep network experiments dueto the cost of hyperparameter tuning.
