Table 4: Final error in recovery of the factors by various techniques and the computation time taken per iteration(in seconds) corresponding to Fig. 2 across techniques. We report the coefficient estimate after the HT step (inArora et al. (2015)) as XHT. For the techniques presented in Arora et al. (2015), we scan across 50 values ofthe regularization parameter for coefficient estimation using Lasso after learning the dictionary (A), and reportthe optimal estimation error for the coefficients (XLasso), while for Mairal ‘09, at each step the coefficientsestimate is chosen by scanning across 10 values of the regularization parameters. For k = 100, the algorithmsof Arora et al. (2015) do not converge (shown as N/A).
