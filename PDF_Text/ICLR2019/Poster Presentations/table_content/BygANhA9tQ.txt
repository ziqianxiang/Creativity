Table 1: Comparisons between different robust defense models on MNIST dataset against 'âˆž norm-bounded adversarial perturbations with = 0.2. The sparsity gives the number of non-zero entries inthe cost matrix over the total number of possible adversarial transformations. The candidates columnis the number of potential seed examples for each task.
