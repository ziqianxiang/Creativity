Table 4.1: Our performance bounds for different algorithms on streams with frequencies obeyingZipf Law. k is a constant (≥ 2) that refers to the number of hash functions, B is the number ofbuckets, and n is the number of distinct elements. The space complexity of all algorithms is thesame, Θ(B). See section 9.4 for non-asymptotic versions of the some of the above bounds5.	ExperimentsBaselines. We compare our learning-based algorithms with their non-learning counterparts. Specif-ically, we augment Count-Min with a learned oracle using Algorithm 1, and call the learning-augmented algorithm “Learned Count-Min”. We then compare Learned Count-Min with traditionalCount-Min. We also compare it with “Learned Count-Min with Ideal Oracle” where the neural-network oracle is replaced with an ideal oracle that knows the identities of the heavy hitters in the testdata, and “Table Lookup with Count-Min” where the heavy hitter oracle is replaced with a lookuptable that memorizes heavy hitters in the training set. The comparison with the latter baseline allows2For example, Goyal et al. (2012) uses B = 20M, n = 33.5M and B = 50M, n = 94M.
