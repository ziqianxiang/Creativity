Table 1: Average reconstruction SNR for various training and testing SNR combinations.
Table 2: Average SNR values for reconstructionsfrom measurements with erasure probability, p. Allnetworks were trained for 10dB noisy measurementson the LSUN bridges dataset. Refer to Appendix Efor actual reconstructions.
Table 3: Comparison of SNRs in different scenarios. 50-Ensemble refers to reconstructions obtainedby averaging the output of 50 direct networks.
