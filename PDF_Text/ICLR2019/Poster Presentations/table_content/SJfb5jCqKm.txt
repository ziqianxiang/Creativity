Table 1: E-AURC and % improvement for AES method on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN andImagenet for various k values compared to the baseline method. All E-AURC values are multipliedby 103 for clarity.
Table 2: NLL and Brier score of AES method applied with Platt scaling on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,SVHN and Imagenet compared to the baseline method (calibrated as well).
Table 3: E-AURC and % improvement for the Pointwise Early Stopping algorithm (PES) compared tothe softmax response (SR) on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and SVHN. All E-AURC values are multipliedby 103 for clarity.
Table 4: E-AURC and % improvement for AES method on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN andImageNET for various k values compared to the baseline method. All E-AURC values are multipliedby 103 for clarity.
