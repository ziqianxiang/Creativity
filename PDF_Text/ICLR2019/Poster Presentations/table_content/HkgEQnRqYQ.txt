Table 1: The score functions f (h, t) of several knowledge graph embedding models, where〈•)denotes the generalized dot product, ◦ denotes the Hadamard product, 0 denotes circular correlation,σ denotes activation function and * denotes 2D convolution. — denotes conjugate for complexvectors, and 2D reshaping for real vectors in ConvE model. TransX represents a wide range ofTransE’s variants, such as TransH (Wang et al., 2014), TransR (Lin et al., 2015b), and STransE(Nguyen et al., 2016), where gr,i(∙) denotes a matrix multiplication with respect to relation r.
