Table 2: Baseline imitation learning results for all BabyAI levels. Each model was trained with 1Mdemonstrations from the respective level. For reference, we also list the mean and standard deviationof demonstration length for each level.
Table 3: The sample efficiency of imitation learning (IL) and reinforcement learning (RL) as thenumber of demonstrations (episodes) required to solve each level. All numbers are thousands. Forthe imitation learning results we report a 99% credible interval. For RL experiments we report the99% confidence interval. See Section 4 for details.
Table 4: The sample efficiency results for pretraining experiments. For each pair of base levels andtarget levels that we have tried, we report how many demonstrations (in thousands) were required,as well as the baseline number of demonstrations required for training from scratch. In both caseswe report a 99% credible interval, see Section 4 for details. Note how choosing the right base levels(e.g. GoToLocal instead of GoToObjMaze) is crucial for pretraining to be helpful.
Table 5: The sample efficiency of imitation learning (IL) from an RL-pretrained expert and inter-active imitation learning defined as the number of demonstrations required to solve each level. Allnumbers are in thousands. 99% credible intervals are reported in all experiments, see Section 4 fordetails.
