Table 1: Policy and uncertainty costs with and without uncertainty regularization. The policy trainedwith unregularized VG exploits errors in the forward model to produce actions which yield lowpredicted cost but high uncertainty. Including the uncertainty cost yields higher predicted cost, butbetter performance when the policy is executed in the environment.
