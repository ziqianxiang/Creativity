Table 1: The vocabulary sizes and hidden dimension used in each experiment.
Table 2: Comparison of softmax prediction results on three datasets. Speedup is based on theoriginal softmax time. For example, 10x means the methodâ€™s prediction time is 10 times fasterthan original softmax layer prediction time. Computation of full softmax per step is 4.32 ms forPTB-Large, 0.32 ms for PTB-Sman and 4.83 ms for NMT: DE-EN._______________________	PTB-Small			PTB-Large			NMT: DE-EN			Speedup	P@1	P@5	Speedup	P@1	P@5	Speedup	P@1	P@5L2S (OUr Method)	10.6x	0.998	0.990	45.3x	0.996	0.982	20.4x	0.989	0.993FGD	-13X-	0.980	0.989	6.9x	0.975	0.979	-67x-	0.987	0.981SVD-Softmax	-0.8x-	0.987	0.99	-23X-	0.988	0.981	-34x-	0.98	0.985AdaPtiVe-Softmax	-19X-	0.972	0.981	-42x-	0.974	0.937	-32x-	0.982	0.984-Greedy-MIPS-	0.5x	0.998	0.972	-18X-	0.945	0.903	-26x-	0.911	0.887PCA-MIPS	0.14x-	0.322	0.341	0.5x	0.361	0.326	-13x-	0.379	0.320LSH-MIPS	1.3x	0.165	0.33	2.2x	0.353	0.31	1.6x	0.131	0.137Figure 2: Precision@1 versus speed-up rate of PTB Large Setup.
