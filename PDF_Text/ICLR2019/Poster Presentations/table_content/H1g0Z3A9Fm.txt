Table 1: Performance of different models on 5-community dissociative SBM graphs with n = 400, C = 5,p = 0, q = 18/n, corresponding to an average degree of 14.5. The first row gives the average overlap acrosstest graphs, and the second row gives the graph-wise standard deviation of the overlap.
Table 2: Comparison of the node classification accuracy by different models on the three SNAP datasets. Notethat the average accuracy was computed graph-wise with each graph weighted by its size, while the standarddeviation was computed graph-wise with equal weights among the graphs.

This be-havior is completely different if oneconsiders random graphs with locallyEuclidean geometry. The GeometricBlock Model (Sankararaman & Bac-celli, 2018) is a random graph gener-ated as follows. We start by samplingn points x1, . . . , xn i.i.d. from a Gaus-sian mixture model given by means μι,... μk ∈ Rd at distances S apart and identity covariances.
