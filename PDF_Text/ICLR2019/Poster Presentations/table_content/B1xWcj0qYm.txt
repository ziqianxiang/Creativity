Table 1: Specification of benchmark datasets, models, and optimization algorithms.
Table 2: Mean errors (standard deviations) in percentage given inaccurate training class priors.
Table 3: Mean errors (standard deviations) in percentage of UU and state-of-the-art methods. Bestand comparable methods (paired t-test at significance level 1%) are highlighted in boldface.
Table 4: Means (standard deviations) of the final classification errors in percentage correspondingto Figure 2. Best and comparable methods (excluding PN oracle) based on the paired t-test at thesignificance level 1% are highlighted in boldface.
