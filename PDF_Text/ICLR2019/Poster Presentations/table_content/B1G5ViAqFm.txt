Table 1: Notation list2	Related Work2.1	Shape RepresentationShape learning involves the learning of a mapping from input geometrical signals to desired outputquantities. The representation of geometrical signals is key to the learning process, since on the onehand the representation determines the learning architectures, and, on the other hand, the richness ofinformation preserved by the representation acts as a bottleneck to the downstream learning process.
