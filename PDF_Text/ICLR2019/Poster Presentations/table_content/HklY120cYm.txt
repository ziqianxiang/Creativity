Table 1: Mean Opinion Score (MOS) ratings with 95% confidence intervals using different outputdistributions for autoregressive WaveNet. We also include the conditional log-likelihoods (CLL) (perdimension) on the same 16 test audios for WaveNet with continuous outputs.
Table 2: Mean Opinion Score (MOS) ratings with 95% confidence intervals using different distillationobjective functions for student Gaussian IAF. We use the crowdMOS toolkit as in Table 1.
Table 3: Mean Opinion Score (MOS) ratings with 95% confidence intervals for comparing thetext-to-wave model and separately trained pipeline. We use the crowdMOS toolkit as in Table 1.
