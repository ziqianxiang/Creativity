Table 1: ProxylessNAS achieves state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10.
Table 2: ProxylessNAS achieves state-of-the art accuracy (%) on ImageNet (under mobile latencyconstraint ≤ 80ms) with 200× less search cost in GPU hours. “LL” indicates latency regularizationloss. Details of MnasNet's search cost are provided in appendix C.

Table 4: Hardware prefers specialized models. Models optimized for GPU does not run fast on CPUand mobile phone, vice versa. ProxylessNAS provides an efficient solution to search a specializedneural network architecture for a target hardware architecture, while cutting down the search cost by200 × compared with state-of-the-arts (Zoph & Le,2017; Tan et al., 2018).
