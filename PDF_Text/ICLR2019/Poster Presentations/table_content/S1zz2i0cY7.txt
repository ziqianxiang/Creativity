Table 1: Decompression failure rates due to floating point round-off error on Tecnick and CLICimage datasets. When compressing and decompressing on the same CPU platform (first column),the Balle et al. (2018) model decompresses all images correctly. However, when compressing ona GPU or decompressing on a different platform, a large percentage of the images fail to be de-coded correctly. Implementing the prior of the same model using integer networks ensures correctdecompression across all tested platforms.
