The data consists of 108 pairs each of adjective-nounand verb-object phrases that have been given similarity ratings by a group of 54 humans. The task isto use the word embeddings to produce similarity scores that correlate well with the human scores;

In the case of “awful taste", both compositions retrieve fairly similar words, which mostlyrelate to the physical sense of taste (rather than the more abstract sense of the word). For the phrase“refined taste", the additive composition fails to capture the sense of the phrase and retrieves manywords related to food taste (which are irrelevant in this context), whereas the tensor compositionretrieves more relevant words.
