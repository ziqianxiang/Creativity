Table 3: Parameters used for the shown experiments. M is the number of motifs, F the maximumtemporal extent of a motif, λ1 and λ2 are the temperatures for the relaxed approximate posterior andprior distributions, a is the location of the BinConcrete prior, b is the number of consecutive framesanalysed in each epoch, and βKL is the weight of the KL-regularization term in the loss function. βeis the ensemble-penalty used in SCC.
Table 4: Attached video files and descriptions. The used parameters for the analysis are the same asgiven in table 3 if not mentioned differently. The three different types of video are: motif showinga single motif; parallel video showing the original video from the dataset (upper left corner) andreconstructions from the found motifs; and RGB video showing a superposition of RGB values of thereconstructed videos from the three motifs found on the dataset. Additionally to the synthetic dataexample discussed in the paper (with 10% noise spikes), we also provide videos from a syntheticdataset with 50% spurious spikes.
