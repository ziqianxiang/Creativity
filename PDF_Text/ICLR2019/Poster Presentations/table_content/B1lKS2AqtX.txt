Table 1: Results on the Moving MNIST dataset. All models, except DFN and VPN, are trained witha comparable number of parameters. Higher SSIM or lower MSE scores indicate better results.
Table 2: Ablation study on the Moving MNIST dataset (10 â†’ 10).
Table 3: Quantitative evaluation of different methods on the KTH human action test set. The metricsare averaged over the predicted frames. Higher scores indicate better prediction results.
Table 4: Experimental results on the TaxiBJ dataset. We report MSE at every time stamp.
Table 5: Early activity recognition accuracy on the 41-category subset of Something-Something.
Table 6: Ablation study of early activity recognition on the Something-Something dataset.
Table 7: Accuracy comparisons of different training strategies on the Something-Something dataset.
Table 8: Online early recognition accuracy: the classifier is built on the last 5 recurrent output states.
