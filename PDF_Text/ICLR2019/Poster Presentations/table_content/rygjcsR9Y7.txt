Table 1: Performance comparison of our method and some baselines in terms of purity and normalized mutualinformation on different benchmark data sets. The methods marked with an asterisk are variants of ourproposed method. The values are the means of 10 runs and the respective standard errors. Each method wasused to fit 16 embeddings/clusters.
Table 2: Performance comparison of the SOM-VAE with and without latent Markov model (SOM-VAE-prob) against k-means in terms of purity and normalized mutual information on different benchmark datasets. The values are the means of 10 runs and the respective standard errors. Each method is used to fit 64embeddings/clusters.
Table 3: Performance comparison of our method with and without probabilistic model (SOM-VAE-proband SOM-VAE) against k-means in terms of normalized mutual information on a challenging unsupervisedprediction task on real eICU data. The dynamic endpoints are the maximum of the physiology score within thenext 6, 12 or 24 hours (physiology_6_hours, physiology_12_hours, physiology_24_hours). The values are themeans of 10 runs and the respective standard errors. Each method is used to fit 64 embeddings/clusters.
Table S1: Performance comparison of our method with different numbers of clusters in terms of purity andnormalized mutual information on different benchmark data sets. The values are the means of 10 runs and therespective standard errors.
