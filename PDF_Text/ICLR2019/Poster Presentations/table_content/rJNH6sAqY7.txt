Table 1: The sub-orthogonality of Ui’s and Vi’s in the discriminator with the divergence regularizeron CIFAR-10 after 100K iterations. For other settings, we also observe that all Ui ’s and Vi ’s havenearly orthonormal columns.
Table 2: The inception scores and FIDs on CIFAR-10 and STL-10. For consistency, we reimplementbaselines under our Chainer environment.
Table 3: The standard CNN architecture for CIFAR-10 and STL-10. For CIFAR-10, M = 32, Mg =4. While for STL-10, M = 48, Mg = 6. The slopes coefficient is 0.1 for all LeakyReLU activations.
Table 4: The ResNet architectures for CIFAR-10 and STL-10 datasets.
Table 5: The ResNet architectures for ImageNet dataset. Recall that we adopts conditional GANframework with projection discriminator. The ResBlock is implemented with the conditional batchnormalization for the generator. hEmbed(y), hi is the inner product of label embedding, Embed(y),and the hidden state, h, after the global sum pooling. (Miyato & Koyama, 2018). We use the sameResidual Block as Gulrajani et al. (2017) describes.
Table 6: The accuracy of singular value estimation on CIFAR-10 experiment with divergenceregularizer after 100K iterations. For other layers and other setting, we can also observe highlyaccurate singular value approximation.
