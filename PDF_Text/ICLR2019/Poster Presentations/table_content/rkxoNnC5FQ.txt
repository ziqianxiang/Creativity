Table 1: Semantic segmentation unsupervised domain adaptation from SYNTHIA to Cityscapes.
Table 2: Semantic Segmentation results (per category and mean IoUs, higher is better) for SYN-THIA adapting to Cityscapes and Vistas. The last column is the ratio of images in the validation setfor which we observe negative transfer (lower is better).
