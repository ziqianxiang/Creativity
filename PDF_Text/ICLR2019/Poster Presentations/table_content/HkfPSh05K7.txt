Thematch-LSTM based retriever of R3 is a more pow-erful model than our intial retrieval model. How-ever, after few steps of multi-step-reasoner, the per-formance increases suggesting that re-ranking viaquery-reformulation is retrieving relevant evidencefrom the corpus. We report the P@k on the last step.

Table 1: Statistics of various dataset. The sec-ond column shows the number of paragraphsfor each query.
Table 4: Analysis of results on the dev. set of SearchQA as we increase the number of steps ofinteraction between the retriever and reader. The retriever at each step sends top-1 paragraph to thereader. A paragraph is correct if it contains the correct answer string.
