Table 1: Average sorting accuracy on the test set. First value is proportion of permutations correctlyidentified; value in parentheses is the proportion of individual element ranks correctly identified.
Table 2: Test mean squared error (×10-4) and R2 values (in parenthesis) for quantile regression.
Table 3: Average test kNN classification accuracies from n neighbors for best value of k.
Table 4: Element-wise mean squared difference between unimodal approximations and the projectedhard permutation matrices for the best temperature τ , averaged over the test set.
Table 5: Accuracies of Deterministic and Stochastic NeuralSort for differentiable k-nearest neigh-bors, broken down by k.
