Table 1:	Sample separation from discrete clustering approach. Standard deviations are reported inparentheses.
Table 2:	Sample separation from clustering-based initialization of membership probabilities, whereprobabiliites are assigned to be proportional to inverse distance to cluster centers. Standard devia-tions are reported in parentheses.
Table 3:	Sample separation from clustering-based initialization of membership probabilities, whereprobabiliites are assigned to be proportional to squared inverse distance to cluster centers. Standarddeviations are reported in parentheses.
Table 4: Sample separation from clustering-based initialization of membership probabilities, whereprobabiliites are assigned to be proportional to squared inverse distance to cluster centers, and logdata likelihood feature used as part of k-means clustering has been multiplied by a factor of five.
