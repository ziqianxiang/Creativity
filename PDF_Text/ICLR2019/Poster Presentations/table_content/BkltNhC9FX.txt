Table 2: Test accuracy for morphological inflectionUsing joint modeling we get significant gains (0.3 points) even against task-specific hard-monotonicattention, showing that our approach is more general than translation. Moreover when we useMono-Postr-Joint which has a structural bias towards task-specific monotonic attention, we obtainimmense improvements (upto 1 accuracy point) over joint models.
