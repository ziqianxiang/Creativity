Table 1: Results using termination (stop) action. SPL / Success rate (%) is shown. We compareagainst a random baseline and A3C (Mnih et al., 2016).
Table 2: Results without termination (stop) action. SPL / Success rate (%) is shown. We compareagainst a random baseline and A3C. This scenario is simpler than the case shown in Table 1.
Table 3: Results of generalization across scene types. SPL / Success rate (%) is shown.
Table 4: Results of removing objects and relations in the knowledge graph.
Table 5: Training and testing split of object categories for each scene type in the AI2-THOR.
