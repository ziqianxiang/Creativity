Table 1: Average log-likelihood per sequence on TIMIT, Blizzard, IAM-OnDB and Deepwriting datasets.
Table 2: KL-loss per latent variable computed over the entire test split. KL5 corresponds to the KL-loss of thetop-most latent variable.
Table 3: ELBO of LadderRNN and STCN models using the same latent space configuration. The prefix of amodel entries denote the number of RNN or TCN layers and unit size per layer. Models have similar numberof trainable parameters.
