Table 1: The Inception Score and FID assign betterscores to memorization of the training set, but a neu-ral network divergence, DCNN, prefers a GAN whichgeneralizes beyond the training set.
Table 3: Evaluation of different mod-els on CIFAR-10 by test set CNN diver-gence. The WGAN-GP attains a lowervalue of the test divergence than memo-rization of the training set.
Table 2: For different evaluation metrics, howmany training set images does one need to memo-rize to score better than a well-trained GAN model?A larger n means the metric is more sensitive todiversity.
