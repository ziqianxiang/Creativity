One way to show this is as follows: for each SPU hyper-parameter, select areasonably large interval, randomly sample the value of the hyper parameter from this interval, andthen compare SPU (using the randomly chosen hyper-parameter values) with TRPO. We sampled100 SPU hyper-parameter vectors (each vector including δ, , λ), and for each one determined therelative performance with respect to TRPO. First, we found that for all 100 random hyper-parametervalue samples, SPU performed better than TRPO. 75% and 50% of the samples outperformed TRPOby at least 18% and 21% respectively. The full CDF is given in Figure 4 in the Appendix. We canconclude that SPU’s superior performance is largely insensitive to hyper-parameter values.
