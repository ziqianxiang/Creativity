Table 1: Quantitative results in medical application. We measure the accuracy ofpoint/MAP estimates as detailed in Sec. 4.2. Best results within measurement error are bold,and we determine uncertainties (Â±) by statistical bootstrapping. The parameter sO2 is themost relevant in this application, whereas error all means all recoverable parameters (sO2 ,Vhb and amie). Re-simulation error measures how well the MAP estimate X is conditioned onthe observation y*. Calibration error is the most important, as it summarizes correctness ofthe posterior shape in one number; see appendix Fig. 11 for more calibration results.
