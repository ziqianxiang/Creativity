Table 1: Best achieved test error for different model classes (vertical axis) and datasets (hor-izontal axis). Test error (%) for the best model within each model family, maximizing validationaccuracy over depth, width, and training and initialization hyperpameters. Except where indicatedby parentheses, all models achieve 100% training accuracy. For SGD-trained CNNs, numbers inparentheses correspond to the same model family, but without restriction on training accuracy. CNN-GP achieves state of the art results on CIFAR10 for GPs without trainable kernels and outperformsSGD-trained models optimized with a small learning rate to 100% train accuracy. See Figure 7 forvisualization and interpretation of these results. See Â§G.5 for experimental details.
