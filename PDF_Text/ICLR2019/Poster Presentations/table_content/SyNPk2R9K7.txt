Table 1: Grammar of the scene program. Primitive commands (cube, sphere, cylinder) can beplaced inside loop structures, where the position and color of each object are determined by the loopindices.
Table 2: Comparing program synthesis performance with baseline methods. Evaluation metricsinclude program token accuracy, parameter MSE loss, and scene reconstruction accuracy on the testsets.
