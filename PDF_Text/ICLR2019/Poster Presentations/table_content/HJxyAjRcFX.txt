Table 1: Quantitative evaluation on three (method, dataset) pairs. Realism is measured by 2(1 - F)where F is the averaged F-measure of identifying fake by human evaluators. Diversity is scored bythe average of conditional LPIPS values. In both metrics, the higher the better. In all three tasks, ourmethods generate highly diverse images with competitive or even better realism.
