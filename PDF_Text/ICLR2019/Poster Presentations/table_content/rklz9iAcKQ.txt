Table 1: Summary of the datasets used in our experiments.
Table 2: Summary of results in terms of classification accuracies (on transductive tasks) or micro-averaged F1 scores (on inductive tasks). In the first column, we highlight the kind of data availableto each method during training (X: features, A: adjacency matrix, Y : labels). “GCN” correspondsto a two-layer DGI encoder trained in a supervised manner.
