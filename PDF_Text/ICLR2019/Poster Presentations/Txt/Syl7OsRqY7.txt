Ab stract
End-to-end neural models have made significant progress in question answering,
however recent studies show that these models implicitly assume that the answer
and evidence appear close together in a single document. In this work, we propose
the Coarse-grain Fine-grain Coattention Network (CFC), a new question answer-
ing model that combines information from evidence across multiple documents.
The CFC consists of a coarse-grain module that interprets documents with respect
to the query then finds a relevant answer, and a fine-grain module which scores
each candidate answer by comparing its occurrences across all of the documents
with the query. We design these modules using hierarchies of coattention and self-
attention, which learn to emphasize different parts of the input. On the Qangaroo
WikiHop multi-evidence question answering task, the CFC obtains a new state-
of-the-art result of 70.6% on the blind test set, outperforming the previous best
by 3% accuracy despite not using pretrained contextual encoders.
1	Introduction
A requirement of scalable and practical question answering (QA) systems is the ability to reason
over multiple documents and combine their information to answer questions. Although existing
datasets enabled the development of effective end-to-end neural question answering systems, they
tend to focus on reasoning over localized sections of a single document (Hermann et al., 2015;
Rajpurkar et al., 2016; 2018; Trischler et al., 2017). For example, Min et al. (2018) find that 90%
of the questions in the Stanford Question Answering Dataset are answerable given 1 sentence in a
document. In this work, we instead focus on multi-evidence QA, in which answering the question
requires aggregating evidence from multiple documents (Welbl et al., 2018; Joshi et al., 2017).
Our multi-evidence QA model, the Coarse-grain Fine-grain Coattention Network (CFC), selects
among a set of candidate answers given a set of support documents and a query. The CFC is inspired
by coarse-grain reasoning and fine-grain reasoning. In coarse-grain reasoning, the model builds a
coarse summary of support documents conditioned on the query without knowing what candidates
are available, then scores each candidate. In fine-grain reasoning, the model matches specific fine-
grain contexts in which the candidate is mentioned with the query in order to gauge the relevance of
the candidate. These two strategies of reasoning are respectively modeled by the coarse-grain and
fine-grain modules of the CFC. Each module employs a novel hierarchical attention — a hierarchy
of coattention and self-attention — to combine information from the support documents conditioned
on the query and candidates. Figure 1 illustrates the architecture of the CFC.
The CFC achieves a new state-of-the-art result on the blind Qangaroo WikiHop test set of 70.6% ac-
curacy, beating previous best by 3% accuracy despite not using pretrained contextual encoders. In
addition, on the TriviaQA multi-paragraph question answering task (Joshi et al., 2017), reranking

outputs from a traditional span extraction model (Clark & Gardner, 2018) using the CFC improves
exact match accuracy by 3.1% and F1 by 3.0%.
Our analysis shows that components in the attention hierarchies of the coarse and fine-grain modules
learn to focus on distinct parts of the input. This enables the CFC to more effectively represent a
large collection of long documents. Finally, we outline common types of errors produced by CFC,
caused by difficulty in aggregating large quantity of references, noise in distant supervision, and
difficult relation types.
2	Coarse-grain Fine-grain Coattention Network
The coarse-grain module and fine-grain module of the CFC correspond to coarse-grain reason-
ing and fine-grain reasoning strategies. The coarse-grain module summarizes support documents
without knowing the candidates: it builds codependent representations of support documents and
the query using coattention, then produces a coarse-grain summary using self-attention. In contrast,
the fine-grain module retrieves specific contexts in which each candidate occurs: it identifies coref-
erent mentions of the candidate, then uses coattention to build codependent representations between
these mentions and the query. While low-level encodings of the inputs are shared between modules,
we show that this division of labour allows the attention hierarchies in each module to focus on
different parts of the input. This enables the model to more effectively represent a large number of
potentially long support documents.
Suppose we are given a query, a set of Ns support documents, and a set of Nc candidates. Without
loss of generality, let us consider the ith document and the jth candidate. Let Lq ∈ RTq×demb,
Ls ∈ RTs ×demb, and Lc ∈ RTc×demb respectively denote the word embeddings of the query, the ith
support document, and the jth candidate answer. Here, Tq, Ts , and Tc are the number of words in
the corresponding sequence. demb is the size of the word embedding. We begin by encoding each
sequence using a bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) (Cho et al., 2014).

Here, Eq, Es, and Ec are the encodings of the query, support, and candidate. Wq and bq are param-
eters of a query projection layer. dhid is the size of the bidirectional GRU.
2.1	Coarse-grain module
The coarse-grain module of the CFC, shown in Figure 2, builds codependent representations of
support documents Es and the query Eq using coattention, and then summarizes the coattention
context using self-attention to compare it to the candidate Ec . Coattention and similar techniques
are crucial to single-document question answering models (Xiong et al., 2017; Wang & Jiang, 2017;
Seo et al., 2017). We start by computing the affinity matrix between the document and the query as
A = Es(Eq)| ∈ RTs×Tq
(4)
The support summary vectors and query summary vectors are defined as
Ss = softmax (A) Eq ∈ RTs×dhid	(5)
Sq = softmax (A|) Es ∈ RTq×dhid	(6)
where softmax(X) normalizes X column-wise. We obtain the document context as
Cs = BiGRU (Sq softmax (A)) ∈ RTs×dhid	(7)
The coattention context is then the feature-wise concatenation of the document context Cs and the
document summary vector Ss .
Us	=	[Cs; Ss] ∈ RTs×2dhid
(8)
For ease of exposition, we abbreviate coattention, which takes as input a document encoding Es and
a query encoding Eq and produces the coattention context Us, as
Coattn (Es, Eq) → Us
(9)
Next, we summarize the coattention context — a codependent encoding of the supporting document
and the query — using hierarchical self-attention. First, we use self-attention to create a fixed-
length summary vector of the coattention context. We compute a score for each position of the

coattention context using a two-layer multi-layer perceptron (MLP). This score is normalized and
used to compute a weighted sum over the coattention context.

Gs	=	X ^siUsi ∈ R2dhid	(12)

Here, as and ^si are respectively the unnormalized and normalized score for the ith position of the
coattention context. W2, b2, W1, and b1 are parameters for the MLP scorer. Usi is the ith position
of the coattention context. We abbreviate self-attention, which takes as input a sequence Us and
produces the summary conditioned on the query Gs, as
Selfattn(Us) → Gs
(13)
Recall that Gs provides the summary of the ith of Ns support documents. We apply another self-
attention layer to compute a fixed-length summary vector of all support documents. This summary
is then multiplied with the summary of the candidate answer to produce the coarse-grain score. Let
G ∈ RNs ×2dhid represent the sequence of summaries for all support documents. We have
Gc	=	Selfattn (Ec) ∈ Rdhid	(14)
G0	=	Selfattn (G) ∈ R2dhid	(15)
ycoarse	=	tanh (WcoarseG + bcoarse ) Gc	∈ R	(16)
where Ec and Gc are respectively the encoding and the self-attention summary of the candidate. G0
is the fixed-length summary vector of all support documents. Wcoarse and bcoarse are parameters of
a projection layer that reduces the support documents summary from R2dhid to Rdhid .
2.2	Candidate-dependent fine-grain module
In contrast to the coarse-grain module, the fine-grain module, shown in Figure 3, finds the specific
context in which the candidate occurs in the supporting documents using coreference resolution 1.
Each mention is then summarized using a self-attention layer to form a mention representation. We
then compute the coattention between the mention representations and the query. This coattention
context, which is a codependent encoding of the mentions and the query, is again summarized via
self-attention to produce a fine-grain summary to score the candidate.
Let us assume that there are m mentions of the candidate in the ith support document. Let the kth
mention corresponds to the istart to iend tokens in the support document. We represent this mention
using self-attention over the span of the support document encoding that corresponds to the mention.
1We use simple lexical matching between candidates and support documents. Details are found in A.1 of
the Appendix.

Suppose that there are Nm mentions of the candidate in total. We extract each mention represen-
tation using self-attention to produce a sequence of mention representations M ∈ RNm×dhid. The
coattention context and summary of these mentions M with respect to the query Eq are
Um = Coattn (M, Eq) ∈ RNm×2dhid	(18)
Gm = Selfattn (Um) ∈ R2dhid	(19)
We use a linear layer to determine the fine-grain score of the candidate
yfine = WfineGm + bfine ∈ R	(20)
2.3 Score aggregation
We take the sum of the coarse-grain score and the fine-grain score, y = ycoarse + yfine , as the score
for the candidate. Recall that our earlier presentation is with respect to the jth out of Nc candidates.
We combine each candidate score to form the final score vector Y ∈ RNc . The model is trained
using cross-entropy loss.
3 Experiments
We evaluate the CFC on two tasks to evaluate its effectiveness. The first task is multi-evidence
question answering on the unmasked and masked version of the WikiHop dataset (Welbl et al.,
2018). The second task is the multi-paragraph extractive question answering task TriviaQA, which
we frame as a span reranking task (Joshi et al., 2017). On the former, the CFC achieves a new state-
of-the-art result. On the latter, reranking the outputs of a span-extraction model (Clark & Gardner,
2018) using the CFC results in significant performance improvement.
3.1	Multi-evidence question answering on WikiHop
Welbl et al. (2018) proposed the Qangaroo WikiHop task to facilitate the study of multi-evidence
question answering. This dataset is constructed by linking entities in a document corpus (Wikipedia)
with a knowledge base (Wikidata). This produces a bipartite graph of documents and entities, an
edge in which marks the occurrence of an entity in a document. A knowledge base fact triplet con-
sequently corresponds to a path from the subject to the object in the resulting graph. The documents
along this path compose the support documents for the fact triplet. The Qangaroo WikiHop task,
shown in Figure 4, is as follows: given a query, that is, the subject and relation of a fact triplet, a set

of plausible candidate objects, and the corresponding support documents for the candidates, select
the correct candidate as the answer.
The unmasked version of WikiHop represents candidate answers with original text while the masked
version replaces them with randomly sampled placeholders in order to remove correlation between
frequent answers and support documents. Official blind, held-out test evaluation is performed us-
ing the unmasked version. We tokenize the data using Stanford CoreNLP (Manning et al., 2014).
We use fixed GloVe embeddings (Pennington et al., 2014) as well as character ngram embed-
dings (Hashimoto et al., 2017). We split symbolic query relations into words. All models are trained
using ADAM (Kingma & Ba, 2015). We list detailed experiment setup and hyperparemeters of the
best-performing model in A.2 of the Appendix.
We compare the performance of the CFC to other models on the WikiHop leaderboard in Table 1.
The CFC achieves state-of-the-art results on both the masked and unmasked versions of WikiHop. In
particular, on the blind, held-out WikiHop test set, the CFC achieves a new best accuracy of 70.6%.
The previous state-of-the-art result by Cao et al. (2018) uses pretrained contextual encoders, which
has led to consistent improvements across NLP tasks (Peters et al., 2018). We outperform this result
by 3% despite not using pretrained contextual encoders 2. In addition, we show that the division of
labour between the coarse-grain module and the fine-grain module allows the attention hierarchies
of each module to focus on different parts of the input. This enables the CFC to more effectively
model the large collection of potentially long documents found in WikiHop.
3.2	Reranking extractive question answering on TriviaQA
To further study the effectiveness of our model, we also experiment on TriviaQA (Joshi et al., 2017),
another large-scale question answering dataset that requires aggregating evidence from multiple
sentences. Similar to Hu et al. (2018b); Wang et al. (2018), we decompose the original TriviaQA
task into two subtasks: proposing plausible candidate answers and reranking candidate answers.
2Adding contextual encoders is computationally challenging as the CFC models the entire document context
unlike (Cao et al., 2018). It is an area for future work.

tion over word embeddings.
We address the first subtask using BiDAF++, a competitive span ex-
traction question answering model by Clark & Gardner (2018) and
the second subtask using the CFC. To compute the candidate list for
reranking, we obtain the top 50 answer candidates from BiDAF++.
During training, we use the answer candidate that gives the maxi-
mum F1 as the gold label for training the CFC.
Our experimental results in Table 2 show that reranking using the
CFC provides consistent performance gains over only using the
span extraction question answering model. In particular, reranking
using the CFC improves performance regardless of whether the can-
didate answer set obtained from the span extraction model contains
correct answers. On the whole TriviaQA dev set, reranking using
the CFC results in a gain of 3.1% EM and 3.0% F1, which suggests
that the CFC can be used to further refine the outputs produced by
span extraction question answering models.
3.3	Ablation study
Table 3 shows the performance contributions of the coarse-grain
module, the fine-grain module, as well as model decisions such
as self-attention and bidirectional GRUs. Both the coarse-grain
module and the fine-grain module significantly contribute to model performance. Replacing self-
attention layers with mean-pooling and the bidirectional GRUs with unidirectional GRUs result in
less performance degradation. Replacing the encoder with a projection over word embeddings result
in significant performance drop, which suggests that contextual encodings that capture positional in-
formation is crucial to this task.
Figure 5 shows the distribution of model prediction errors across various lengths of the dataset for the
coarse-grain-only model (-fine) and the fine-grain-only model (-coarse). The fine-grain-only model
under-performs the coarse-grain-only model consistently across almost all length measures. This is
likely due to the difficulty of coreference resolution of candidates in the support documents — the
technique we use of exact lexical matching tends to produce high precision and low recall. How-
ever, the fine-grain-only model matches or outperforms the coarse-grain-only model on examples
with a large number of support documents or with long support documents. This is likely because
the entity-matching coreference resolution we employ captures intra-document and inter-document
dependencies more precisely than hierarchical attention.
3.4	Qualitative analysis
We examine the hierarchical attention maps produced by the CFC on examples from the Wiki-
Hop development set. We find that coattention layers consistently focus on phrases that are similar
between the document and the query, while lower level self-attention layers capture phrases that
characterize the entity described by the document. Because these attention maps are very large, we
do not include them in the main text and instead refer readers to A.3 of the Appendix.

memorial, for which the answer is “London borough of Richmond Upon Thames”. The
coattention tends to align the relation part of the query to the context in which the mention occurs
in the text. The first, second, and fourth mentions respectively describe Hampton Wicks, Hampton
Hills, and Teddington — all of which are located in Richmond upon Thames. The third describes
Richmond upon Thames itself.
Coarse-grain summary self-attention, described in equa-
tion 15, tends to focus on support documents that present
information relevant to the object in the query. Figure 6 il-
lustrates an example of this in which the self-attention fo-
cuses on documents relevant to the literary work “The
Troll”, namely those about The Troll, its author Julia
Donaldson, and Old Norse.
In contrast, fine-grain coattention over mention represen-
tations, described in equation 19, tends to focus on the
relation part of the query. Figure 7 illustrates an example
of this in which the coattention focuses on the relation-
ship between the mentions and the phrase “located in the
administrative territorial entity”. Attention maps of more
examples can be found in A.3 of the Appendix.

3.5 Error Analysis
We examine 100 errors the CFC produced on the WikiHop development set and categorize them
into four types. We list identifiers and examples of these errors in A.4 of the Appendix. The first
type (42% of errors) results from the model aggregating the wrong reference. For example, for
the query country_of-citizenship jamie burnett, the model correctly attends to the
documents about Jamie Burnett being born in South Larnarkshire and about Lanarkshire being in
Scotland. However it wrongly focuses on the word “england” in the latter document instead of the
answer “scotland”. We hypothesize that ways to reduce this type of error include using more robust
pretrained contextual encoders (McCann et al., 2017; Peters et al., 2018) and coreference resolution.
The second type (28% of errors) results from questions that are not answerable. For example, the
support documents do not provide the narrative location of the play “The Beloved Vagabond” for
the query narrative_location the beloved vagabond. The third type (22% of errors)
results from queries that yield multiple correct answers. An example is the query instance_of
qilakitsoq, for which the model predicts “archaeological site”, which is more specific than the
answer “town”. The second and third types of errors underscore the difficulty of using distant super-
vision to create large-scale datasets such as WikiHop. The fourth type (8% of errors) results from
complex relation types such as Parent_taxon which are difficult to interpret using pretrained
word embeddings. One method to alleviate this type of errors is to embed relations using tunable
symbolic embeddings as well as fixed word embeddings.

4	Related Work
Question answering and information aggregation tasks. QA tasks span a variety of sources
such as Wikipedia (Yang et al., 2015; Rajpurkar et al., 2016; 2018; Hewlett et al., 2016; Joshi
et al., 2017; Welbl et al., 2018), news articles (Hermann et al., 2015; Trischler et al., 2017),
books (Richardson et al., 2013), and trivia (Iyyer et al., 2014). Most QA tasks seldom require
reasoning over multiple pieces of evidence. In the event that such reasoning is required, it typically
arises in the form of coreference resolution within a single document (Min et al., 2018). In con-
trast, the Qangaroo WikiHop dataset encourages reasoning over multiple pieces of evidence across
documents due to its construction. A similar task that also requires aggregating information from
multiple documents is query-focused multi-document summarization, in which a model summarizes
a collection of documents given an input query (Dang, 2006; Gupta et al., 2007; Lu et al., 2013).
Question answering models. The recent development of large-scale QA datasets has led to a host
of end-to-end QA models. These include early document attention models for cloze-form QA (Chen
et al., 2015), multi-hop memory networks (Weston et al., 2015; Sukhbaatar et al., 2015; Kumar
et al., 2016), as well as cross-sequence attention models for span-extraction QA. Variations of cross-
sequence attention include match-LSTM (Wang & Jiang, 2017), coattention (Xiong et al., 2017;
2018), bidirectional attention (Seo et al., 2017), and query-context attention (Yu et al., 2018). Recent
advances include the use of reinforcement learning to encourage the exploration of close answers
that may have imprecise span match (Xiong et al., 2018; Hu et al., 2018a), the use of convolutions
and self-attention to model local and global interactions (Yu et al., 2018), as well as the addition
of reranking models to refine span-extraction output (Wang et al., 2018; Hu et al., 2018b). Our
work builds upon prior work on single-document QA and generalizes to multi-evidence QA across
documents.
Attention as information aggregation. Neural attention has been successfully applied to a vari-
ety of tasks to summarize and aggregate information. Bahdanau et al. (2015) demonstrate the use of
attention over the encoder to capture soft alignments for machine translation. Similar types of atten-
tion has also been used in relation extraction (Zhang et al., 2017), summarization (Rush et al., 2015),
and semantic parsing (Dong & Lapata, 2018). Coattention as a means to encode codependent repre-
sentations between two inputs has also been successfully applied to visual question answering (Lu
et al., 2016) in addition to textual question answering. Self-attention has similarly been shown to be
effective as a means to combine information in textual entailment (Shen et al., 2018; Deunsol Yoon,
2018), coreference resolution (Lee et al., 2017), dialogue state-tracking (Zhong et al., 2018), ma-
chine translation (Vaswani et al., 2017), and semantic parsing (Kitaev & Klein, 2018). In the CFC,
we present a novel way to combine self-attention and coattention in a hierarchy to build effective
conditional and codependent representations of a large number of potentially long documents.
Coarse-to-fine modeling. Hierarchical coarse-to-fine modeling, which gradually introduces com-
plexity, is an effective technique to model long documents. Petrov (2009) provides a detailed
overview of this technique and demonstrates its effectiveness on parsing, speech recognition, and
machine translation. Neural coarse-to-fine modeling has also been applied to question answer-
ing (Choi et al., 2017; Min et al., 2018; Swayamdipta et al., 2018) and semantic parsing (Dong
& Lapata, 2018). The coarse and fine-grain modules of the CFC similarly focus on extracting coarse
and fine representations of the input. Unlike previous work in which a coarse module precedes a
fine module, the modules in the CFC are complementary.
5	Conclusion
We presented CFC, a new state-of-the-art model for multi-evidence question answering inspired
by coarse-grain reasoning and fine-grain reasoning. On the WikiHop question answering task,
the CFC achieves 70.6% test accuracy, outperforming previous methods by 3% accuracy. We
showed in our analysis that the complementary coarse-grain and fine-grain modules of the CFC fo-
cus on different aspects of the input, and are an effective means to represent large collections of long
documents.

A Appendix
A.1 Coreference resolution
In this work, we use simple lexical matching instead of using full-scale coreference resolution sys-
tems. The integration of the latter remains a direction for future work. To perform simple lexical
matching for a given candidate, we first tokenize the document as well as the candidate. Each time
the candidate tokens occur consequetively in the document, we extract the corresponding token span
as a coreference mention.
A.2 Experiment setup
For the best-performing model, we train the CFC using Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2015) for a max-
imum of 50 epochs with a batch size of 80 examples. We use an initial learning rate of 10-3
with (β1, β2) = (0.9, 0.999) and employ a cosine learning rate decay Loshchilov & Hutter (2017)
over the maximum budget. We find this approach to outperform a development set-based annealing
heuristic as well as those based on piecewise-constant approximations. We evaluate the accuracy of
the model on the development set every epoch, and evaluate the model that obtained the best accu-
racy on the development set on the held-out test set. We present the convergence plot in Figure 8.
epoch
Figure 8: Accuracy convergence plot.
We use a embedding size of demb = 400, 300 of which are from GloVe vectors (Pennington et al.,
2014) and 100 of which are from character ngram vectors (Hashimoto et al., 2017). The embeddings
are fixed and not tuned during training. All GRUs have a hidden size of dhid = 100. We regularize
the model using dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014) at several locations in the model: after the em-
bedding layer with a rate of 0.3, encoders with a rate of 0.3, coattention layers with a rate of 0.2,
and self-attention layers with a rate of 0.2. We also apply word dropout with a rate of 0.25 (Zhang
et al., 2017; Zhong et al., 2018). The values for the dropout rates are coarsely tuned and we find that
performance is more sensitive to word dropout than other dropout.
A.3 Attention maps
This section includes attention maps produced by the CFC on the development split of WikiHop.
We include the fine-grain mention self-attention and coattention, the coarse-grain summary self-
attention, and the document self-attention and coattention for the top scoring supporing documents,
ranked by the summary self-attention score. The query can be found in the coattention maps. We
use the answer as the title of the subsection.

Glasgow is the largest city in Scotland, and third largest in the United Kingdom. Historically part
of Lanarkshire, it is now one of the 32 council areas of Scotland. It is situated on the River Clyde in
the countrys West Central Lowlands. Inhabitants of the city are referred to as Glaswegians.
A council area is one of the areas defined in Schedule 1 of the Local Government etc. (Scotland)
Act 1994 and is under the control of one of the local authorities in Scotland created by that Act.
Edinburgh is the capital city of Scotland and one of its 32 local government council areas. Located
in Lothian on the Firth of Forths southern shore, it is Scotlands second most populous city and the
seventh most populous in the United Kingdom. The 2014 official population estimates are 464,990
for the city of Edinburgh, 492,680 for the local authority area, and 1,339,380 for the city region
as of 2014 (Edinburgh lies at the heart of the proposed Edinburgh and South East Scotland city
region). Recognised as the capital of Scotland since at least the 15th century, Edinburgh is home to
the Scottish Parliament and the seat of the monarchy in Scotland. The city is also the annual venue
of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland and home to national institutions such as the
National Museum of Scotland, the National Library of Scotland and the Scottish National Gallery.
It is the largest financial centre in the UK after London.
Carlisle (or from Cumbric: ”Caer Luel” ) is a city and the county town of Cumbria. Historically in
Cumberland, itis also the administrative centre of the City of Carlisle district in North West England.
Carlisle is located at the confluence of the rivers Eden, Caldew and Petteril, south of the Scottish
border. It is the largest settlement in the county of Cumbria, and serves as the administrative centre
for both Carlisle City Council and Cumbria County Council. At the time of the 2001 census, the

The Arctic (or ) is a polar region located at the northernmost part of Earth. The Arctic consists of
the Arctic Ocean, adjacent seas, and parts of Alaska (United States), Canada, Finland, Greenland
(Denmark), Iceland, Norway, Russia, and Sweden. Land within the Arctic region has seasonally
varying snow and ice cover, with predominantly treeless permafrost-containing tundra. Arctic seas
contain seasonal sea ice in many places.
Archaeology, or archeology, is the study of human activity through the recovery and analysis of
material culture. The archaeological record consists of artifacts, architecture, biofacts or ecofacts,
and cultural landscapes. Archaeology can be considered both a social science and a branch of the
humanities. In North America, archaeology is considered a sub-field of anthropology, while in
Europe archaeology is often viewed as either a discipline in its own right or a sub-field of other
disciplines.
An archaeological site is a place (or group of physical sites) in which evidence of past activity is
preserved (either prehistoric or historic or contemporary), and which has been, or may be, investi-
gated using the discipline of archaeology and represents a part of the archaeological record. Sites
may range from those with few or no remains visible above ground, to buildings and other structures
still in use.
Nuussuaq Peninsula (old spelling: ”Ngssuaq”) is a large (180x48 km) peninsula in western Green-

Baffin Bay (Inuktitut: ”Saknirutiak Imanga”; ), located between Baffin Island and the southwest
coast of Greenland, is a marginal sea of the North Atlantic Ocean. It is connected to the Atlantic via
Davis Strait and the Labrador Sea. The narrower Nares Strait connects Baffin Bay with the Arctic
Ocean. The bay is not navigable most of the year because of the ice cover and high density of
floating ice and icebergs in the open areas. However, a polynya of about , known as the North Water,
opens in summer on the north near Smith Sound. Most of the aquatic life of the bay is concentrated
near that region. Extent. The International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of Baffin
Bay as follows: History. The area of the bay has been inhabited since . Around 1200, the initial
Dorset settlers were replaced by the Thule (the later Inuit) peoples. Recent excavations also suggest
that the Norse colonization of the Americas reached the shores of Baffin Bay sometime between the
10th and 14th centuries. The English explorer John Davis was the first recorded European to enter
the bay, arriving in 1585. In 1612, a group of English merchants formed the ”Company of Merchants
of London, Discoverers of the North-West Passage”. Their governor Thomas Smythe organized five
expeditions to explore the northern coasts of Canada in search of a maritime passage to the Far East.
Henry Hudson and Thomas Buttons explored Hudson Bay, William Gibbons Labrador, and Robert
Bylot Hudson Strait and the area which became known as Baffins Bay after his pilot William Baffin.
Aboard the ”Discovery”, Baffin charted the area and named Lancaster, Smith, and Jones Sounds
after members of his company. By the completion of his 1616 voyage, Baffin held out no hope of an
ice-free passage and the area remained unexplored for another two centuries. Over time, his account
came to be doubted until it was confirmed by John Rosss 1818 voyage. More advanced scientific

The archaeological record is the body of physical (not written) evidence about the past. It is one
of the core concepts in archaeology, the academic discipline concerned with documenting and in-
terpreting the archaeological record. Archaeological theory is used to interpret the archaeological
record for a better understanding of human cultures. The archaeological record can consist of the
earliest ancient findings as well as contemporary artifacts. Human activity has had a large impact on
the archaeological record. Destructive human processes, such as agriculture and land development,
may damage or destroy potential archaeological sites. Other threats to the archaeological record
include natural phenomena and scavenging. Archaeology can be a destructive science for the fi-
nite resources of the archaeological record are lost to excavation. Therefore archaeologists limit the
amount of excavation that they do at each site and keep meticulous records of what is found. The
archaeological record is the record of human history, of why civilizations prosper or fail and why
cultures change and grow. It is the story of the world that humans have created.
The Danish Realm is a realm comprising Denmark proper, The Faroe Islands and Greenland.
Greenland is an autonomous constituent country within the Danish Realm between the Arctic and
Atlantic Oceans, east of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Though physiographically a part of the
continent of North America, Greenland has been politically and culturally associated with Europe
(specifically Norway and Denmark, the colonial powers, as well as the nearby island of Iceland) for
more than a millennium. The majority of its residents are Inuit, whose ancestors migrated began
migrating from the Canadian mainland in the 13th century, gradually settling across the island.
Uummannaq is a town in the Qaasuitsup municipality, in northwestern Greenland. With 1,282

of the country are home to over two-thirds of the population. Iceland is volcanically and geologi-
cally active. The interior consists of a plateau characterised by sand and lava fields, mountains and
glaciers, while many glacial rivers flow to the sea through the lowlands. Iceland is warmed by the
Gulf Stream and has a temperate climate, despite a high latitude just outside the Arctic Circle. Its

Support documents A honey bee (or honeybee) is any bee member of the genus Apis, primarily
distinguished by the production and storage of honey and the construction of perennial, colonial
nests from wax. Currently, only seven species of honey bee are recognized, with a total of 44
subspecies, though historically, from six to eleven species have been recognized. The best known
honey bee is the Western honey bee which has been domesticated for honey production and crop
pollination. Honey bees represent only a small fraction of the roughly 20,000 known species of
bees. Some other types of related bees produce and store honey, including the stingless honey bees,
but only members of the genus ”Apis” are true honey bees. The study of bees including honey bees
is known as melittology.
The superfamily Apoidea is a major group within the Hymenoptera, which includes two traditionally
recognized lineages, the ”sphecoid” wasps, and the bees. Molecular phylogeny demonstrates that
the bees arose from within the Crabronidae, so that grouping is paraphyletic.
Honey is a sugary food substance produced and stored by certain social hymenopteran insects. It is
produced from the sugary secretions of plants or insects, such as floral nectar or aphid honeydew,
through regurgitation, enzymatic activity, and water evaporation. The variety of honey produced by
honey bees (the genus ”Apis”) is the most well-known, due to its worldwide commercial production
and human consumption. Honey gets its sweetness from the monosaccharides fructose and glucose,
and has about the same relative sweetness as granulated sugar. It has attractive chemical properties
for baking and a distinctive flavor that leads some people to prefer it to sugar and other sweeteners.
Most microorganisms do not grow in honey, so sealed honey does not spoil, even after thousands
of years. However, honey sometimes contains dormant endospores of the bacterium ”Clostridium
botulinum”, which can be dangerous to babies, as it may result in botulism. People who have a
weakened immune system should not eat honey because of the risk of bacterial or fungal infection.
Although some evidence indicates honey may be effective in treating diseases and other medical
conditions, such as wounds and burns, the overall evidence for its use in therapy is not conclusive.
Providing 64 calories in a typical serving of one tablespoon (15 ml) equivalent to 1272 kj per 100 g,
honey has no significant nutritional value. Honey is generally safe, but may have various, potential
adverse effects or interactions with excessive consumption, existing disease conditions, or drugs.
Honey use and production have a long and varied history as an ancient activity, depicted in Valencia,
Spain by a cave painting of humans foraging for honey at least 8,000 years ago.
Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the
Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the worlds sixth-
largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and
East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the
south-east. Australias capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney.
Bees are flying insects closely related to wasps and ants, known for their role in pollination and, in
the case of the best-known bee species, the European honey bee, for producing honey and beeswax.
Bees are a monophyletic lineage within the superfamily Apoidea, presently considered as a clade
Anthophila. There are nearly 20,000 known species of bees in seven to nine recognized families,
though many are undescribed and the actual number is probably higher. They are found on every
continent except Antarctica, in every habitat on the planet that contains insect-pollinated flowering
plants.
Solomon Islands is a sovereign country consisting of six major islands and over 900 smaller islands
in Oceania lying to the east of Papua New Guinea and northwest of Vanuatu and covering a land
area of . The countrys capital, Honiara, is located on the island of Guadalcanal. The country takes
its name from the Solomon Islands archipelago, which is a collection of Melanesian islands that
also includes the North Solomon Islands (part of Papua New Guinea), but excludes outlying islands,
such as Rennell and Bellona, and the Santa Cruz Islands.
The Colletidae are a family of bees, and are often referred to collectively as plasterer bees or
polyester bees, due to the method of smoothing the walls of their nest cells with secretions ap-
plied with their mouthparts; these secretions dry into a cellophane-like lining. The five subfamilies,
54 genera, and over 2000 species are all evidently solitary, though many nest in aggregations. Two
of the subfamilies, Euryglossinae and Hylaeinae, lack the external pollen-carrying apparatus (the
scopa) that otherwise characterizes most bees, and instead carry the pollen in their crops. These

Ants are eusocial insects of the family Formicidae and, along with the related wasps and bees,
belong to the order Hymenoptera. Ants evolved from wasp-like ancestors in the Cretaceous period,
about 99 million years ago and diversified after the rise of flowering plants. More than 12,500 of an
estimated total of 22,000 species have been classified. They are easily identified by their elbowed
antennae and the distinctive node-like structure that forms their slender waists.

across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and
Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its
long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant
life. The countrys varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe
much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealands capital city is Wellington,
while its most populous city is Auckland.
The flowering plants (angiosperms), also known as Angiospermae or Magnoliophyta, are the most
diverse group of land plants, with 416 families, approx. 13,164 known genera and a total of c.
295,383 known species. Like gymnosperms, angiosperms are seed-producing plants; they are dis-
tinguished from gymnosperms by characteristics including flowers, endosperm within the seeds,
and the production of fruits that contain the seeds. Etymologically, angiosperm means a plant that
produces seeds within an enclosure, in other words, a fruiting plant. The term ”angiosperm” comes
from the Greek composite word (”angeion”, ”case” or ”casing”, and ”sperma”, ”seed”) meaning
”enclosed seeds”, after the enclosed condition of the seeds.
Pollination is the process by which pollen is transferred to the female reproductive organs of a plant,
thereby enabling fertilization to take place. Like all living organisms, seed plants have a single major
goal: to pass their genetic information on to the next generation. The reproductive unit is the seed,
and pollination is an essential step in the production of seeds in all spermatophytes (seed plants).
Insects (from Latin , a calque of Greek [], ”cut into sections”) are a class of invertebrates within the
arthropod phylum that have a chitinous exoskeleton, a three-part body (head, thorax and abdomen),
three pairs of jointed legs, compound eyes and one pair of antennae. They are the most diverse
group of animals on the planet, including more than a million described species and representing
more than half of all known living organisms. The number of extant species is estimated at between
six and ten million, and potentially represent over 90
The Stenotritidae are the smallest of all formally recognized bee families , with only 21 species in
two genera , all of them restricted to Australia . Historically , they were generally considered to
belong in the family Colletidae , but the stenotritids are presently considered their sister taxon , and
deserving of family status . Of prime importance is the stenotritids have unmodified mouthparts
, whereas colletids are separated from all other bees by having bilobed glossae . They are large
, densely hairy , fast - flying bees , which make simple burrows in the ground and firm , ovoid

A wasp is any insect of the order Hymenoptera and suborder Apocrita that is neither a bee nor an
ant. The Apocrita have a common evolutionary ancestor and form a clade; wasps as a group do not
form a clade, but are paraphyletic with respect to bees and ants.
