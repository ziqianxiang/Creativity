Table 1: Slopes (i.e. γ) obtained by fitting a line to the curves in Figure 1. A value of γ indicatesthat the error decays at a rate of exp (-t). A smaller value of Y indicates a faster rate of error decay.
Table 2: Final test errors achieved by various methods for batch sizes of 128 and 8. The hyperpa-rameters have been chosen by grid search.
Table 3: Slopes (i.e. γ) obtained by fitting a line to the curves in Figure 7. A value of γ indicatesthat the error decays at a rate of exp (-Yt). A smaller value of Y indicates a faster rate of error decay.
