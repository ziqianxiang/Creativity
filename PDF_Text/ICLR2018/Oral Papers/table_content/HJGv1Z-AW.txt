Table 1: Commumicative success (training accuracy in percentage) with varying maximum mes-sage length. alphabet size denotes the effective size of the symbol set used from a maximum of 100.
Table 2: Communicative success (acc in percentage) of agents evaluated on training (first row) andnovel (last three rows) data. lexicon size column reports the percentage of novel messages (i.e.,messages that were not used during the training).
Table 3: Communicative success of agents playing different games. Columns random, train andtest report percentage accuracies. Column topographic ρ reports the topographic similarity betweenthe symbolic representation of scenes and the generated messages (p < 0.01, permutation test).
Table 4: Accuracy of probe linear classifiers of speaker’s induced visual representations (all accura-cies are in percentage format).
Table 5: Communicative success of trained models from Section 4.1 (train and test) as well asmodels with access to gold classifiers. All accuracies are in percentage format.
