Table 1: Sliced Wasserstein distance (SWD) between the generated and training images (Section 5)and multi-scale structural similarity (MS-SSIM) among the generated images for several trainingsetups at 128 × 128. For SWD, each column represents one level of the Laplacian pyramid, and thelast one gives an average of the four distances.
Table 2: Generator and discriminator that we use with CELEBA-HQ to generate 1024×1024 images.
Table 3: CIFAR10 inception scores, higher is better.
Table 4: Results for MNIST discrete mode test using two tiny discriminators (K/4, K/2) defined byMetz et al. (2016). The number of covered modes (#) and KL divergence from a uniform distributionare given as an average ± standard deviation over 8 random initializations. Higher is better for thenumber of modes, and lower is better for KL divergence.
