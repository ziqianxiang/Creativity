Table 1: A comparison of the discrimination power (AUC score (%) of a logistic regression clas-sifier) among LID, KD, BU, and KD+BU. The AUC score is computed for each attack strategy oneach dataset, and the best results are highlighted in bold.
Table 2: This table of AUC scores (%) shows the generalizability of detectors trained on the FGMattack strategy (row) to other forms of attack (column), with respect to the CIFAR-10 dataset. Thebest results are indicated in bold font.
Table 3: The failure rate (%) of an adaptive attack targeting the LID-based detector.
Table 4: The L2 mean perturbation and model accuracy (%) on adversarial examples.
