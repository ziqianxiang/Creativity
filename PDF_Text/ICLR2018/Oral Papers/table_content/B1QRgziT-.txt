Table 3: Standard CNN models for CIFAR-10 and STL-10 used in our experiments on imageGeneration. The slopes of all lReLU functions in the networks are set to 0.1.
Table 4: ResNet architectures for CIFAR10 dataset. We use similar archi-tectures to the ones used in Gulrajani et al. (2017).
Table 5: ResNet architectures for STL-10 dataset.
Table 6: ResNet architectures for image generation on ImageNet dataset. For the generator of condi-tional GANs, we replaced the usual batch normalization layer in the ResBlock with the conditionalbatch normalization layer. As for the model of the projection discriminator, we used the samearchitecture used in Miyato & Koyama (2018). Please see the paper for the details.
