Table 1: Results table for the experiments on SearchQA. Two-sample t-tests between the AQA resultsand either the Base-NMT or the MI-SubQuery results show that differences in F1 and Exact Matchscores are statistically significant, p < 10-4, for both Top Hypothesis and CNN predictions. Thedifference between Base-NMT and MI-SubQuery is also significant for Top Hypothesis predictions.
