Figure 1: Performance comparison of ADAM and AMS GRAD on synthetic example on a simple one dimen-sional convex problem inspired by our examples of non-convergence. The first two plots (left and center) arefor the online setting and the the last one (right) is for the stochastic setting.
Figure 2: Performance comparison of ADAM and AMSGRAD for logistic regression, feedforward neuralnetwork and Cifarnet. The top row shows performance of Adam and AMSGrad on logistic regression(left and center) and 1-hidden layer feedforward neural network (right) on MNIST. In the bottom row, the twoplots compare the training and test loss of Adam and AMSGrad with respect to the iterations for Cifarnet.
