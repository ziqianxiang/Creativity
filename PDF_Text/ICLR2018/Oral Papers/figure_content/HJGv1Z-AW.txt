Figure 3: left: Three languages with different properties, taken from Brighton & Kirby (2006). Themapping between states and signals shown in (b) is random; there is no relationship between pointsin the meaning and signal space. In (c) and (d), similar meanings map to similar signals, i.e., thereis a topographic relation between meanings and signals. right: Relation between objectsâ€™ cosinesimilarity and their message Levenshtein distance for trained and random agents.
