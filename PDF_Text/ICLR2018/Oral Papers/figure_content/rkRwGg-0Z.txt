Figure 1: Distribution of scores for positive and negative negation coefficients relative to all interac-tion coefficients. Only leave one out and CD are capable of producing these interaction scores.
Figure 2: The distribution of attributions for positive (negative) sub-phrases contained within nega-tive (positive) phrases of length at most five in the Yelp polarity dataset. The positive and negativedistributions are nearly identical for all methods except CD, indicating an inability of prior methodsto distinguish between positive and negative phrases when occurring in the context of a phrase ofthe opposite sentiment12Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2018Figure 3: Distribution of positive and negative phrases, of length between one and two thirds ofthe full review, in SST. The positive and negative distributions are significantly more separate forCD than other methods, indicating that even at this coarse level of granularity, other methods stillstruggle.

Figure 4: Logistic regression coefficients versus coefficients extracted from an LSTM on SST. Weinclude a least squares regression line. Stronger linear relationships in the plots correspond to betterinterpretation techniques.
