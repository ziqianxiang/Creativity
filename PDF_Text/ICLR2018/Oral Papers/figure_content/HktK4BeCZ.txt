Figure 1: (a) JSD between train demo and generated transitions is 0.130. (b) JSD between test demoand generated transitions is 0.017. (c) Reward of state-action pairs. States: large negative massgradient from π1 to πd (S0), less negative gradient (S1), uniform (S2). Actions: high probabilitytransitions to smaller indices (A0), uniform transition (A1), row-reverse of A0 (A2).
Figure 2: (a) Test error on final distribution and mean over entire trajectory (log scale). MFG: (2.9e-3, 4.9e-3), VAR: (7.0e-3, 8.1e-3), RNN: (0.58, 0.57). (b) heatmap of action matrix P ∈ R15×15averaged element-wise over demo train set, and absolute difference between average demo actionmatrix and average matrix generated from learned policy.
Figure 3: (a) Measured and predicted trajectory of topic 0 popularity over test days for MFG andVAR (RNN outside range and not shown). (b) Measured and predicted trajectory of topic 2 popu-larity over test days for all methods.
