Table 1: Results on the Minnesota graph. Percentage of shortest path and successful paths (thatare not necessarily shortest) are shown for a wide-variety of Seq2Seq models, with context vectordimension equal to either 256 or 512. All scores are relative to an A* algorithm, that achieves ashortest path score of 100%.
