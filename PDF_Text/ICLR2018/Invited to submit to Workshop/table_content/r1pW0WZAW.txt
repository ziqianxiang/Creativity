Table 1: Test-set error rates for sequential pMNIST classification. Hidden unit counts (nh) vary tomatch parameter counts with LSTM (approx. 42,000 parameters), except models marked with +(which have more parameters). α* denotes the optimal learning rate according to validation error.
Table 2: Error rates for surgical maneuver recognition. Hyperparameters were copied from (DiPietroet al., 2016), where they were tuned for LSTM with peephole connections. Our LSTM does notinclude peephole connections (see Section 2).
Table 3: Test-set error rates for TIMIT phoneme recognition. Hidden unit counts (nh) vary to matchparameter counts with LSTM (approx. 44,000 parameters). α* denotes the optimal learning rateaccording to validation error.
Table 4: Test-set error rates for MobiAct activity classification. Hidden unit counts (nh) vary tomatch parameter counts with LSTM (approx. 44,000 parameters), with the exception of LSTM+(approx. 88,000 parameters). α* denotes the optimal learning rate according to validation error.
