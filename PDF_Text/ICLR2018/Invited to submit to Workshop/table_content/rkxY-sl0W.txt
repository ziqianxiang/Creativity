Table 1: Statistics of the Java to C# dataset.
Table 2: Token accuracy and program accuracy of different approaches for the synthetic task.
Table 3: Program accuracy of different approaches for translation between CoffeeScript andJavaScript. The token accuracy can be found in Appendix C .
Table 4: Program accuracy on the Java to C# translation. In the parentheses, we put the programaccuracy that can be achieved by increasing the training set.
