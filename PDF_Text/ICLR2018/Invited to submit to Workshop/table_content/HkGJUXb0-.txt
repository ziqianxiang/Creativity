Table 1: The functional data f1(X), f2(X), f3(X) is tensorized to 10th-order tensor (4 × 4 × . . . × 4). Inthe table, 3 r, Np denote relative error, average rank, and the total number of parameters, respectively.
Table 2: The results under different shifts of dimensions on functional data f2(x) with error boundset at 10-3. For the 10th-order tensor, all 9 dimension shifts were considered and the average rank ris compared.
Table 3: Results on synthetic data with fixed ranks ri = r = •一=2.
Table 4: Image representation by using tensorization and TR decomposition. The number ofparameters is compared for SVD, TT and TR given the same approximation errors.
Table 5: Results on CIFAR-10 images.
Table 6: The comparisons of different algorithms on Coil-100 dataset. e, rmaχ,r denote relative error,the maximum rank and the average rank, respectively.
Table 7: The comparisons of different algorithms on KTH dataset. e denotes the obtained relativeerror; rm,a, denotes maximum rank; r denotes the average rank; and Acc. is the classificationaccuracy.
