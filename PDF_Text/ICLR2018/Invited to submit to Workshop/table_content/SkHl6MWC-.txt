Table 1: Summarization of movement fields and their corresponding regularization terms. Themeaning of symbols can be found in section 2.2 and 2.3.
Table 2: Test errors (%) on MNIST and synthetic dataset. Test errors in the bottom panel are theresults of our methods. Test errors with “*” are the ones reported in the literature.
Table 3: Test errors (%) and running time (s) on CIFAR-10. Running time in this table means theaverage training time of each epoch.

Table 5: Average training time (s) of each epoch on Synthetic data and MNIST. Since the trainingtime of VMT-shift, VMT-rotation and VMT-shift are almost the same, we use their averaged trainingtime.	____________________________________________Dataset	baseline	AT-L2	VAT	VMTSynthetic	0.183	0.288	0.329	0.279MNIST	3.635	6.170	7.122	5.950C DERIVATION OF RshiftBy settingX ∂L ∂Ipa =少西∂P1,∂L ∂Ip∂Ip ∂p2bΣp(12) is equivalent to|a cos φ + b Sin φ∣ = ∣ pa2 + b2 cos(φ — a) ∣where a = tan-1 b.
