We sampled four NSCLC patients and their whole-genome se-quencing (Table 1) for tobacco-exposure lung cancer mutation learning, as well as their matchedperipheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) germline DNA WGS for systematic sequencing ar-tifact learning. To test our ability to extend this strategy to other cancer types, we also includedthree Melanoma patients to train a separate Melanoma-specific model. WGS libraries were pre-pared using the Illumina TruSeq Nano library preparation kit in accordance with the manufacturers
