Table 1: Vanilla Classification Results: All results are averages over 5 independent runs. The DAGANaugmentation improves the classifier performance in all cases. Test accuracy is the result on the testcases in the test domain7Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 20187	One Shot Learning Using Data Augmentation Networks andMatching NetworksA standard approach to one shot learning involves learning an appropriate distance between repre-sentations that can be used with a nearest neighbour classifier under some metric. We focus on theuse of Matching Networks to learn a representation space, where distances in that representationspace produce good classifiers. The same networks can then be used in a target domain for nearestneighbour classification.
Table 2: Omniglot One Shot Results: All results are averages over 3 independent runs. Note thatour own local implementation of matching networks substantially outperform the matching networkresults presented in the original paper, However DAGAN augmentation takes matching networksup to the level of Conv-ARC (Shyam et al., 2017), which explicitly use knowledge that the datahas the structure of handwritten characters: the Conv-ARC model uses the stroke structure of thecharacters to perform well. Note DAGAN augmentation can even increase a simple pixel distancenearest neighbour model up to non-negligible levels.
