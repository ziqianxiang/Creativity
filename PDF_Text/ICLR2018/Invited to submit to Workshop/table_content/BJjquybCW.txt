Table 1: The smallest singular value σmin(F1) of the feature matrix F1 of the first convolutionallayer (similar σmin(F3) for the feature matrix F3 of the second convolutional layer) of the trainednetwork in Figure 1 are shown for varying number of convolutional filters T1. The rank of a matrixA ∈ Rm ×n is estimated (See Chapter 2.6.1 in Press (2007)) by computing the singular value decom-position of A and counting the singular values which exceed the threshold 2√m + n +1 σmax(A)e,where is machine precision. For all filter sizes the feature matrices F1 have full rank.
Table 2: The loss and the number of misclassified training and test samples (train/test errors) of thecorresponding trained networks in Table 1. Zero training error is attained for T1 ≥ 30.
Table 3: The width of the first convolutional layer (n1 ) and the maximum width of all the hid-den layers (max1≤k≤L-1 nk) of state-of-the-art CNN architectures in comparison with the size ofImageNet (N ≈ 1200K). All numbers are lower bounds on the true width.
