Table 1: Baseline. Summary of accuracy, baseline parameters (sparsity and number of clusters), andWeightless’ hyperparameter (t) setting used for each layer. *VGG-16 in MB (size) and top-1 (error).
Table 2: Lossy encoding. Weight matrices encoded using Bloomier filters (Weightless) are smallerthan those encoded with CSR (Deep Compression), without loss of accuracy. In addition, Weightlesstends to do relatively better on larger models and when using more advanced pruning algorithms. TheImprovement column shows Bloomier filters are up to 1.99× more efficient than CSR.
Table 3: Network compression. Encoded weights can be compressed further for transmission orstorage. Below are the results of applying arithmetic coding to Bloomier filters and Huffman codingto CSR. The Improvement column shows Weightless offers up to a 1.51× improvement over DeepCompression.
