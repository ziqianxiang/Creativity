Table 1: Experimental results for different models based on automated evaluation. The symbolstring ’a-qy g-tc’ in the table means using automatically generated question type and given topic totest. Specifically, ’a’ is for automatic, ’g’ is for given (question type or topic), ’qt’ is for questiontype, and ’tc’ is for topic. Ours* is our model with the pre-decode mechanism.
Table 2: Test results for sentence classification and sequence labeling.
Table 3: Experimental results for different models based on human evaluation. The symbol stringa-qt g-tc in the table has the same meaning as in Table 1. The perfect score is 100.
Table 4: Sample output questions generated by human, our system, and Du et al’s system.
Table 5: Questions generated from our model by given arbitrary question type or topic.
