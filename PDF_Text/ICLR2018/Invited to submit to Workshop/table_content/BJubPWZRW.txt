Table 1: Error rates on semi-supervised learning benchmarks. We report means and standard devia-tions from 5 runs. + after a dataset means data augmentation was applied.
Table 2: Results for sequence tagging tasks. We report the means and standard deviation of 5 runs.
Table 3: Results for dependency parsing. We omit results from Choe & Charniak (2016), Kuncoroet al. (2017), and Liu & Zhang (2017) because these train constituency parsers and convert the sys-tem outputs to dependency parses. They produce higher scores, but have access to more informationduring training and do not apply to datasets without constituency annotations.
