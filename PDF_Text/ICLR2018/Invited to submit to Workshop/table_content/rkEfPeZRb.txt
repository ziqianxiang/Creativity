Table 1: Training of a VGG-like network on CIFAR-10. τ denotes the threshold in Strom’s method.
Table 2: Training ResNet50 on ImageNet. τ denotes a threshold in Strom’s method. α is thehyperparameter of our method described in the criterion (3). Accuracy is the test accuracy at the lastepoch. Compression refers compression ratio defined in the beginning of Sec. 6.
