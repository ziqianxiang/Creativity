Table 1: Test perplexity on Penn Treebank of ENAS and other approaches. VD = VariationalDropout; WT = Weight Tying; MC = Monte Carlo sampling.
Table 2: Classification error rates of ENAS and other methods on CIFAR-10. In this table, the firstblock presents the state-of-the-art models, all of which are designed by human experts. The secondblock presents various approaches that design the entire network. ENAS outperforms all thesemethods but NAS, which requires much more computing resource and time. The last block presentstechniques that design modular cells which are used to build a large model. ENAS outperformsMicroNAS, which uses 32 GPUs to search, and achieves similar performance with NASNet-A.
