Table 1: Winrates of MoHex-CNN9 against MoHex 2.0 with same number of simulations. Allprograms use the same default parameters as MoHex 2.0. Every opening was tried twice with eachplayer as black or white. Column 6 and 7 are respectively the average consumed time per game foreach corresponding program.
Table 2: Results of ExIt, MoHex 2.0 and MoHex-CNN9 against MoHex 2011 on 9 Ã— 9 Hex. AllMoHex programs use the same default parameters, with 104 simulations (left) or 105 simulations(right). Every opening was tried twice with each player as black or white. ExIt used 104 simula-tions (Anthony et al., 2017).
Table 3: Winrates of MoHex-CNN9 against Mohex 2.0 with the same time per move. All programsuse the default parameters the same as MoHex 2.0 with parallel solver on. Every opening was triedtwice with each player as black or white.
