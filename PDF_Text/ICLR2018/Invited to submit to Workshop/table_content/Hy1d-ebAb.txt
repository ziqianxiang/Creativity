Table 1: Percentage of valid samples for three models on cycles and trees datasets, and the KL-divergence between the degree distributions of samples and data for Barabasi-Albert graphs.
Table 2: Results on the molecule generation task. N is the number of permutations for each moleculethe model is trained on. Typically the number of different SMILES strings for each molecule < 100.
Table 3: Negative log-likelihood evaluation on small molecules with no more than 6 nodes.
Table 4: Parse tree generation results, evaluated on the Eval set.
