Table 1: The definition and instances of relation features from WordNetTYPE	DEFINrnON	INSTANCESSynonymy	It takes the value 1 if the words in the pair are synonyms in WordNet (i.e., belong to the same synset), and 0 otherwise. Specifically, it takes value 1 when two words are same.	[felicitous, good] = 1 [dog, wolf] = 0Antonymy	It takes the value 1 if the words in the pair are antonyms in WordNet, and 0 otherwise.	[wet, dry] = 1Hypernymy	It takes the value 1-n/8 if one word is a (direct or indirect) hypernym of the other word in WordNet, where n is the number of edges between the two words in hierarchies, and 0 otherwise.	[dog, canid] = 0.875 [wolf, canid] = 0.875 [dog, carnivore] = 0.75 [canid, dog] = 0Hyponymy	It takes the value 1 - n/8 if a word is a (direct or indirect) hyponym of the other word in WordNet, where n is the number of edges between the two words in hierarchies, and 0 otherwise.	[canid, dog] = 0.875 [canid, wolf] = 0.875 [carnivore, dog] = 0.75 [dog, canid] = 0Same Hypernym It takes the value 1 if the two words have the [dog, wolf] = 1same hypernym but they do not belong to the samesynset, and 0 otherwise.
