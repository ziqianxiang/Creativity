Figure 1: MDANs Network architecture. Feature extractor, domain classifier, and task learning arecombined in one training process. Hard version: the source that achieves the minimum domain classi-fication error is backpropagated with gradient reversal; Smooth version: all the domain classificationrisks over k source domains are combined and backpropagated adaptively with gradient reversal.

Figure 5: MDANs network architecture for digit classification22Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2018D.3 Details on WebCamT Vehicle CountingWebCamT is a public dataset for large-scale city camera videos, which have low resolution (352Ã—240),low frame rate (1 frame/second), and high occlusion. WebCamT has 60, 000 frames annotatedwith rich information: bounding box, vehicle type, vehicle orientation, vehicle count, vehicle re-identification, and weather condition. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets, with42,200 and 17,800 frames, respectively, covering multiple cameras and different weather conditions.
