Figure 1: Comparison between a random map of the VIN dataset, and a few random configuration ofour training environment. In our custom grid-worlds, the number of blocks increases with size, buttheir percentage over the total available space is kept fixed. Agent and goal are shown as circles forbetter visualization, however they still occupy a single cell.
Figure 2:	Average reward of all the models as they train on our curriculum. Note again that in bothcases the map size is 32 Ã— 32. a and c demonstrate performances respectively on the VIN dataset andour generated 64x64 maps. b shows performance on evaluation maps constrained by the curriculumsettings (segmented line), and without (continuous line).
Figure 3:	Average test win rate obtained on our stochastic experiments.
Figure 4: Example of policy obtained after training on a avalanche testing configuration. Agent andgoal are shown as circles for better visualization, however they still occupy a single cell.
