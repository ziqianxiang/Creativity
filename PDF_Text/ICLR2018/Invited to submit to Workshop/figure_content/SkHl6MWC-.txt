Figure 1: Three kinds of movement fields: shift, rotation and scale are shown in (a), (b) and (c)respectively. These fields are generated in a 15 Ã— 15 image.
Figure 2:	(a) shows an example pair of data with different labels. They are hard to distinguish byhuman-eye. (b) shows the values of Rshift on test set over epochs. (c) shows the generalizationgaps for different methods. The values in the first 10 epochs are omitted for better visualization.
Figure 3:	(a), (b) and (c) show the values of Rshift , Rrotation and Rscale respectively for differentmethods on test set over epochs.
