Figure 1: Propagation schedules on an example graph. (a) The input graph where the line type,i.e., solid & dash, indicates different edge types; (b) Graph partitions where blue bounding boxesindicate different subgraphs and red edges belong to the cut; (c) Computational graphs of two pos-sible sequential propagation schedules of the input graph; (d) Computational graph for synchronouspropagation schedule; (e) Computational graph for GPNNs where both inter-subgraph and intra-subgraph propagation steps are 1.
Figure 2: (a), (b) The t-SNE visualization of node representations produced by propagation modelof GGNN and GPNN on Cora dataset in which nodes actually belong to 7 classes. (c) Comparisonof different propagation schedules with varying propagation steps.
Figure 3: Sequential scheduling. (a) The original graph. (b) and (C) are the two DAGs obtained bythe sequential schedule we described in section 4.5 where BFS traversal is started from node 1.
