Figure 1: Learning a generative manifold for the classes inthe source domain (left) can help learn better classifiers forthe one shot target domain (right): The test point (pentagon)is nearer to the orange point but is actually closer to thelearnt grey data manifold. If we generate extra examples onthe grey manifold the nearest neighbour measure will bettermatch the nearest manifold measure.
Figure 2: Graphical model fordataset shift in the one-shotsetting: the distribution overclass label t changes in an ex-treme way, affecting the dis-tribution over latent R. How-ever the generating distribu-tion P(X|R) does not change.
Figure 3: DAGAN Architecture. Left: the generator network is composed of an encoder takingan input image (from class c), projecting it down to a lower dimensional manifold (bottleneck).
Figure 4: Omniglot DAGAN generations with different architectures.
Figure 5: An Interpolated spherical subspace of the GAN generation space using a single real seedimage (top left corner). The only real image in each figure is the one in the top-left corner, the restare generated to augment that example using a DAGAN.
Figure 6: UResNet Generator: In this figure one can see a drawing of the UResNet generator asdescribed in Algorithm 1.
