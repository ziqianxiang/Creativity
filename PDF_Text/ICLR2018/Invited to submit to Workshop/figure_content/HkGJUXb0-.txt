Figure 1: The effects of noise corrupted tensor cores. From left to right, each figure shows noisecorruption by adding noise to one specific tensor core.
Figure 2: A graphical representation of tensor ring decomposition.
Figure 3: Highly oscillated functions. The left panel is f1 (x) = (x + 1) sin(100(x + 1)2). Themiddle panel is Airy function: f2(x) = X-1 sin(3X3). The right panel is Chirp function f3(x)=Sin 4 CoS(X2).
Figure 4: TR-SGD decomposition with TR-ranks of 12 on the 8th-order tensorization of an image.
Figure 5: The comparisons of compression rate and approximation error (RSE) on CIFAR-10 datasetby using TR and TT models.
Figure 6: The reconstructed images by using TR-SGD after 10 and 100 epochs.
Figure 7: The classification performances of tensorizing neural networks by using TR representation.
Figure 8: The reconstruction of Coil-100 dataset by using TR-SVD. The top row shows the originalimages, while the reconstructed images are shown from the second to sixth rows corresponding toe=0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, respectively.
Figure 9: Video dataset consists of six types of human actions performed by 25 subjects in fourdifferent scenarios. From the top to bottom, six video examples corresponding to each type of actionsare shown.
