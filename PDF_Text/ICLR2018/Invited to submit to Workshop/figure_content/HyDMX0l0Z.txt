Figure 1: Samples generated by Vanilla GAN, WGAN-GP, Vanilla GAN with multiple partitions ona toy dataset with 8 Gaussians. Yellow points represent true samples, while green points representsamples generated by GAN. The first image, second image, and third image in each row showsamples after 10000, 15000, and 20000 training steps. All 3 models use an MLP with 3 hiddenlayers with 512 nodes.
