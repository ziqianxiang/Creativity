Figure 1: Model Visualization: A visualization of the Share, Specialize, and Compete architecturefor neural program repair.
Figure 2: Pooled Pointer Module: The application of a pooled pointer module at a single time step,to predict the variable replacement scores for each potential replacement of the token fname. The inputhere is the per-token representation computed by the Share module. Representations for variablenames are passed through a pooling module which outputs per-variable pooled representations. Theserepresentations are then passed through a similarity module, as in standard pointer networks, to yielda (dynamically-sized) output dictionary containing one score for each unique variable.
Figure 3: Results binned by number of repair candidates in the snippetImportance of AST structure The Python abstract syntax tree is a rich source of semantic informa-tion about the tokens in a snippet. As described in Section 5.1, in addition to the original token string,we also include (1) the absolute position of the node in the AST, (2) the type of the node, and (3) therelationship between the node and its parent. To test the modelâ€™s reliance on this information, wepresent ablation results over these additional feature layers below in Table 2.
