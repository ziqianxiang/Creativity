Figure 2: Example of Seq2Tree encoder-decoder model for ”given an array, return values divisibleby two”. Left part is an encoder with embeddings+GRU cell, right is doubly-recurrent decoder withattention.
Figure 3: Example of tree search for a query ”Given an array, find the sum of its elements”. Rect-angles represent nodes with a symbol, while circles represent empty nodes. We start with an emptytree on the far left. When that tree is popped from the priority queue, we consider each possiblesymbol for the first empty node in the pre-order traversal, and create a new tree for each. Two suchtrees are shown in this figure, for symbols reduce and +. When the tree with reduce is popped,several new trees are generated by filling in the first empty node in the pre-order traversal of thattree, which is the first child of reduce. The first argument of reduce is an array, so only symbols thatproduce arrays are considered. Two trees for such symbols are shown on the figure for a, which isan argument, and filter. The search continues until either D trees are generated, or a tree that passesall the sample tests is found. Such tree is shown on the far right.
Figure 4: Analysis of results on dev set. Left plot shows accuracy of the model varyingMAX_VISITED in Search algorithm. Right plot shows accuracy stratified by depth of the targetcode tree.
