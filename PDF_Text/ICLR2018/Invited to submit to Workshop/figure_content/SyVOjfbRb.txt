Figure 1: In subplots (a)(b)(c), the comparisons of Wall clock training loss convergence are madebetween plain LSD (red lines) and plain SGD (blue lines) separately in three datasets. We canclearly see the big gap between them representing LSD converge faster than SGD even in time wise.
Figure 2: In subplots (a)(b)(c), the comparisons of Wall clock training loss convergence are madebetween LSD+adaGrad (red lines) and SGD+adaGrad (blue lines) separately in three datasets. Wecan again see the similar gap between them representing LSD converge faster than SGD in timewise. Subplots (c)(d)(e) show the results for same comparisons but in epoch wise. We can see thatLSD converges even faster than SGD. Comparisons of testing loss are in supplemental material.
Figure 3: Norm and cosine similarity comparisons of LSD and SGD gradient estimation. Subplots(a)(b)(c) show the comparisons of the average (over number of samples) gradient L2 norm of thepoints that LSD (red lines) and SGD sampled (blue lines). As argued before, LSD samples withprobability monotonic to L2 norm of the gradients while SGD samples uniformly. It matches withthe results shown in the plots that LSD queries points with larger gradient than SGD does. Sub-plots (d)(e)(f) show the comparison of the cosine similarity between gradient estimated by LSD andthe true gradient and the cosine similarity between gradient estimated by SGD and the true gradi-ent. Note that the variance of both norm and cosine similarity reduce when we average over moresamples.
