Figure 1: Molecular graphs can be represented as strings using the SMILES notation. Letterscorrespond to element symbols, rings opening and closing is indicated with numbers, and branchingwith round brackets.
Figure 2: Four of ten target molecules for the Tanimoto benchmark. See Supplementary Material forthe full set.
Figure 3: Sample RL trajectories for the tasks (independently-scaled).
Figure 4: In (a), PCA plot of the GAN generator under various influences of the discriminator. In (b),sampling from a model at higher temperatures counter-intuitively does not increase coverage.
Figure 5: t-SNE visualization (Maaten & Hinton, 2008) of MLE sampling of generated space. TheMLE model effectively covers the space of ChEMBL and even reproduces the subspaces around theChEMBL molecules.
Figure 6: Target molecules for the Tanimoto benchmark.
