Figure 3: (a) Spatial Factorization: 2 × 2 × 4 feature tensor factorized into 1 × 1 × 4 tensors whichcorresponds to factorization along spatial dimensions, (b) Channel-wise Factorization: 2 × 2 × 4feature tensor factorized into 2 × 2 × 1 tensors which corresponds to factorization along depth (orchannel) dimensions.
Figure 4: Left: A feature tensor factorized in spatial fashion. Right (top): An autoregressive modelon factorized features. Right (bottom): Patch-GAN: a single discriminator is used for each spatialtensorThe objective of the Patch-GAN for discriminator and generator is given in Eq. 9 and Eq. 10 whereD = d ㊉ E,㊉ is convolution operation, E(.) ∈ Rh×w×c is the same encoder used in previoussection and d ∈ Rc×1×1×1 is the convolutional kernel. D(.) produces an activation map with sizeRh×w . Each activation is matched to its corresponding target by using least square loss. We usethe least square version of GAN objective (Mao et al., 2016) rather than vanilla GAN objective(Eq. 2, Eq. 3) since vanilla GAN produces high error for generator later in the training. PARGANobjective is a simple summation of ARGAN objective (Eq. 7), Eq. 8) and Patch-GAN objective(Eq. 9), Eq. 10) without any hyperparameter.

(Right): PARGANwith vanilla GAN, while PARGAN outperforms them. PARGAN is competitive with WGAN-GP onthe same architecture (DCGAN) even though WGAN-GP performs better with ResNet (Gulrajaniet al., 2017).
