Table 1: Model performance on validation and training set.
Table 2: Floor level prediction error across 63 test trials. The left side of each column shows accu-racy when floor to ceiling height m = 4.02. The right side shows accuracy when m is conditionedon the building. Exact floor column shows the percent of the 63 trials which matched the targer floorexactly. The ±1 column is the percent of trials where the prediction was off by one.

Table 4: Description of buildings used in our experiments. Material is the perceived material on theoutside of the building.
Table 5: Example data points collected for the indoor-outdoor classifier. Feature vector X is con-structed from 3 readings at consecutive time intervals ti. y is the middle point’s IO label (1* in thiscase).
