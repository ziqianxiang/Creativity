Table 1: Performance on rotated MNIST. Errors are averages of several runs, withstandard deviations within parenthesis. Times are average training time per epoch.
Table 2: Performance on MNIST variants.
Table 3: ModelNet40 classification performance. We compare onlywith voxel-based methods.
Table 4:	SVHN classification performance. The minus suffix indicate removal of 6s and 9s. PTNshows slightly worse performance on the unperturbed dataset, but is clearly superior when rotationsare present.
Table 5:	Ablation study. Rotation and polar origin augmentation during training time, and wraparound padding all contribute to reduce the error. Results are from PTN-B on the rotated MNIST.
