Table 1: Comparison of different architectures trained on ILSVRC-2012, in terms of classificationaccuracy and number of parametersThe final representation is spatially averaged and projected onto the 1000 classes after a ReLU non-linearity. We now discuss how we progressively decrease the spatial resolution, while increasing thenumber of channels per layer by use of the operators Sj .
