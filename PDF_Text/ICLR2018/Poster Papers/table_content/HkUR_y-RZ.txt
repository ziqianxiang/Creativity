Table 1: Comparison of the S EARNN algorithm with MLE for different cost-sensitive losses and roll-in/roll-outpolicies. We provide the number of actions A and the maximum sequence length T . Note that we use 0.5 asthe mixing probability for the mixed roll-out policy. We ran the Actor-Critic algorithm from Bahdanauet al. (2017) on our data splits for the spelling task and report the results in the AC column (the results reportedin Bahdanau et al. (2017) were not directly comparable as they used a different random test dataset each time).
