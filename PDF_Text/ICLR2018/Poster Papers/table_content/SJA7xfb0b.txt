Table 1: Comparison of different metrics between distributions used for GAN training. Referencesare for papers using those metrics for GAN training.
Table 2: CIFAR-10 error rates for varying number of labeled samples in the training set. Mean andstandard deviation computed over 5 runs. We only use the K + 1 formulation of the critic. Note thatwe achieve strong SSL performance without any additional tricks, and even though the critic doesnot have any batch, layer or weight normalization. Baselines with * use either additional modelslike PixelCNN, or do data augmentation (translations and flips), or use a much larger model, eitherof which gives an advantage over our plain simple training method. f is the result We achieved inour experimental setup under the same conditions but without “K+1” critic (see Appendix D), since(Gulrajani et al., 2017) does not have SSL results.
