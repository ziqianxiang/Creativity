Table 1: Actual transcript of two self-interested agents negotiating using the proposal channel. Inthis setting, no linguistic message is decoded at all.
Table 2: Joint reward success and average number of turns taken for paired agents negotiating withrandom game termination, varying the agent reward scheme and communication channel. The re-sults are averaged across 20 seeds, with 128 games per seed. We also report the standard deviationas the ± number and the interquartile range.
Table 3: Actual transcript of two prosocial agents negotiating using the linguistic channel. At eachturn, the agents decode a proposal but this is hidden and not revealed to the other agent.
Table 4: Accuracy of predicting individual elements of the agents’ hidden utilities, as well as thefinal proposal that was accepted. Numbers in brackets indicate accuracy predicting the proposalfrom just the item pool. Random baseline numbers are obtained by predicting from a messagetranscript and item pool of all 0’s.
Table 5: Fixed agent return vs opposing prosocial agents, for different numbers of opposing proso-cial agents and whether IDs are revealed across the communication channels. For the self-interestedfixed agent, the numbers report personal reward, and for the prosocial fixed agent, the numbers re-port joint reward. The starred result indicates when a community has made use of the linguisticchannel to transmit information.
Table 6: Correlation between bigram usage between the different responders in the community.
Table 7: Joint reward success and average number of turns taken for paired agents negotiating whenallowed the full 10 turns, varying the agent reward scheme and communication channel. The resultsare averaged across 20 seeds, with 128 games per seed. We also report the standard deviation as the± number and the quartiles.
