Table 2: GAN scores for various metrics trained on MNIST. Lower values are better for MMD, IW,LS, GC, and FID, higher values are better for IS. Lighter color indicates better performance.

Table 6: The fraction of pairs of which each metric agrees with human scores. We use coloredasterisks to represent significant differences (two-sided Fisher’s test, p < .05). E.g. * in the IW rowindicates that IW and IS are significantly different.
