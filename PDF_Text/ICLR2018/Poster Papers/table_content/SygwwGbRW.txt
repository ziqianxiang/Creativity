Table 1: Comparison of the SPTM agent to baseline approaches. We report the percentage ofnavigation trials successfully completed in 5,000 steps (higher is better).
Table 2: Ablation study on the SPTM agent. We report the percentage of navigation trials success-fully completed in 5,000 steps in validation mazes (higher is better).
Table S1:	Effect of hyperparameters, evaluated on the validation set. We report the percentage ofnavigation trials successfully completed in 5,000 steps (higher is better).
Table S2:	Evaluation of the SPTM navigation agent with homogeneous textures and automatedexploration. We report the percentage of navigation trials successfully completed in 5,000 steps(higher is better).
Table S3:	Additional ablation study of the SPTM navigation agent. We report the percentage ofnavigation trials successfully completed in 5,000 steps in validation mazes (higher is better).
