Table 1: Unsupervised domain adaptation with MECA. Perfomance is measured as normalizedaccuracy and we compare with general, entropy-related (E) and correlation alignment (C) state-of-the-art approaches. Â§We also include this experiment exclusively for evaluation purposes. Let usstress that all methods in comparisons and our proposed MECA exploit labels only from the sourcedomain during training. *A more powerful feature extractor as baseline and uses also extra SVHNdata. ^ Results refer to our own TenSorfloWTM implementation, with cross-validation on the target.
