Table 1: CLEVR accuracy by baseline methods, competing methods, and our method (MAC) - forour method we show test results with GLoVE initialization and validation results with and with-out GLoVE. (*) denotes use of extra supervisory information through program labels. (t) denotesuse of data augmentation. C) denotes training from raw pixels. (â—Š) denotes GLoVE word vectorinitialization.
Table 2: Accuracy on CLEVR-Humans of previous methods and our method (MAC), before (left)and after (right) fine-tuning on the CLEVR-Humans training data. PG+EE uses supervised data. Forour method (MAC) we show test results with GLoVE initialization and validation results with andwithout GLoVE.
Table 3: Ablations Results for the full standard CLEVR dataset and 10% subset of it. See text forfull details.
