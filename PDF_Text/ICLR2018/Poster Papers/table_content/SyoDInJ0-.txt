Table 1: Bounds on p：§	(T) and 祝^	(T) given various settings for a two-fold portfolio AS.
Table 2: ESBAS pseudo-regret after 12 epochs (i.e. 40,920 trajectories) compared with the best andthe worst algorithms in the portfolio, in function of the algorithms in the portfolio (described in thefirst column). The ’+’ character is used to separate the algorithms. all-4 means all the four learningalgorithms described in Section C.1.2 simple + fast + simple-2 + fast-2. all-4-n-1 means the same fouralgorithms with one additional feature of noise. Finally, all-2-simple means simple + simple-2 andall-2-n-1-simple means n-1-simple + n-1-simple-2. On the second column, the redder the colour, theworse ESBAS is achieving in comparison with the best algorithm. Inversely, the greener the colourof the number, the better ESBAS is achieving in comparison with the best algorithm. If the numberis neither red nor green, it means that the difference between the portfolio and the best algorithm isinsignificant and that they are performing as good. This is already an achievement for ESBAS tobe as good as the best. On the third column, the bluer the cell, the weaker is the worst algorithmin the portfolio. One can notice that positive regrets are always triggered by a very weak worstalgorithm in the portfolio. In these cases, ESBAS did not allow to outperform the best algorithm inthe portfolio, but it can still be credited with the fact it dismissed efficiently the very weak algorithmsin the portfolio.
