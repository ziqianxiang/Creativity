Table 1: Utility and privacy of the students. The Confident- and Interactive-GNMax aggregatorsintroduced in Section 4 offer better tradeoffs between privacy (characterized by the value of thebound ε) and utility (the accuracy of the student compared to a non-private baseline) than the LNMaxaggregator used by the original PATE proposal on all datasets we evaluated with. For MNIST, Adult,and SVHN, we use the labels of ensembles of 250 teachers published by Papernot et al. (2017) andset δ = 10-5 to compute values ofε (to the exception of SVHN where δ = 10-6). All Glyph resultsuse an ensemble of 5000 teachers and ε is computed for δ = 10-8.
Table 2: Privacy-preserving reporting of privacy costs. The table augments Table 1 by includingsmooth sensitivity analysis of the total privacy cost. The expectations are taken over the student’squeries and outcomes of the first step of the Confident GNMax aggregator. Order λ, smooth sensitiv-ity parameter β, σSS are parameters of the GNSS mechanism (Section B.5). The final column sumsup the data-dependent cost ε, the cost of applying GNSS (Theorem 23), and the standard deviationof Gaussian noise calibrated to smooth sensitivity (the product of E [SSβ] and σSS).
