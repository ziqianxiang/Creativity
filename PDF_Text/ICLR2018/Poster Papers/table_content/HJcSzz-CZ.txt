Table 1: Omniglot 1-shot classification results. In this table as well as those below “w/ D” denotes “withdistractors”, where the unlabeled images contain irrelevant classes.
Table 2: miniImageNet 1/5-shot classification results.
Table 3: tieredImageNet 1/5-shot classification results.
Table 4: Statistics of the tieredImageNet dataset.
Table 5: Few-shot learning baseline results using labeled/unlabeled splits. Baselines either takes inputs directlyfrom the pixel space or use a CNN to extract features. “rnd” denotes using a randomly initialized CNN, and“pre” denotes using a CNN that is pretrained for supervised classification for all training classes.
