Table 1: Correspondence between different approaches in the proposed formulation. The label “[G]” in boldindicates the respective component is involved in the generative process within our interpretation, while “[I]”indicates inference process. This is also expressed in the schematic graphical models in Figure 1.
Table 2: Left: Inception scores of GANs and the importance weighted extension. Middle: Classificationaccuracy of the generations by conditional GANs and the IW extension. Right: Classification accuracy ofsemi-supervised VAEs and the AA extension on MNIST test set, with 1% and 10% real labeled training data.
Table 3: Variational lower bounds on MNIST test set, trained on 1%, 10%, and 100% training data, respectively.
Table 4: Classification accuracy of semi-supervised VAEs and the adversary activated extension onthe MNIST test set, with varying size of real labeled training examples.
