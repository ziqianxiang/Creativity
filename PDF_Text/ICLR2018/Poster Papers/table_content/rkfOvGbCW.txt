Table 1: Quantitative evaluation of the learning dynamics for the Imagenet experiment. We comparea parametric model, non-parametric model (prediction based on memory only (9)), a mixture modeland MbPA. We report the top 1 accuracy as well as the area under the curve (AUC) at different pointsin training.
Table 2: Table with PTB and WikiText-2 perplexities. âˆ† Test denotes improvement of model on thetest set relative to the corresponding baseline.
