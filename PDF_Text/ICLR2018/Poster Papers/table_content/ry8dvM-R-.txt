Table 1: Dataset training and testing splitsCIFAR-100 has coarse and fine labels for its instances. We follow existing work (Krizhevsky, 2009)creating one task for each of the 20 coarse labels and include 500 instances for each of the corre-sponding fine labels. There are 20 tasks with a total of 2.5k instances per task; 2.5k for training and500 for testing. All results are reported on the test set and are averaged over 3 runs. The data aresummarized in Table 1.
