To evaluate how well I is able to learn fromG, we compare the performance of G and I of the GANITE framework in Table 8 in terms of ITEestimation. As can be seen in Table 8, the in-sample ITE estimation performance of GANITE (I)is competitive with GANITE (G). It experimentally verifies that GANITE (I) learns well from theoutputs of GANITE (G).
