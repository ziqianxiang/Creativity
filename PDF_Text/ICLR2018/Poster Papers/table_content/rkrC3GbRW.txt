There are twotechnical distinctions to make between this experimental setup and the previously considered Python3 mathematical expressions. As there exist databases of SMILES strings, we leverage those by usingthe data augmentation technique described in section 3.2. The main data source considered is theZINC data set Irwin & Shoichet (2005), as used in Kusner et al. (2017). We also use the USPTO15k reaction products data (Lowe, 2014) and a set of molecule solubility information (Huuskonen,2000) as withheld test data. Secondly, whereas we used fixed length Python 3 expressions in order toobtain coverage bounds, molecules are inherently of variable length. We deal with this by padding allmolecules to fixed length.
