Table 1: Datasets Statistics: Train and Test data include samples corresponding to different objects.
Table 2: Classification results: Acc is the accuracy of the classifier on test images, encoded images,and generated views.
Table 3: Identity preservation AUC of generative models. The CelebA column is the AUC obtainedwhen positive pairs correspond to two images of the same person sampled from the test set, andnegative pairs to images of two different persons.
Table 4: Identity preservation AUC of conditional models. The first line corresponds to the distancecomputed between a real image, and an image generated using this real image as an input (positivepairs) or another image (negative pairs). The second line compares two generated images based onthe same input image (positive pairs) or based on two different images (negative pairs).
Table 5: Evaluation of the blurry character of generated images. The ”CelebA’ column is the valueobtained by the Blurry-detection classifier on the test set, while the ”Real Dist.’ column correspondsto the proportion of images labeled as ”blurry” in the original test dataset.
Table 6: Bhattacharyya distance between attributes distribution of generated samples by few gen-erative models and the true empirical distribution (Real Distribution) in line D2T or the Estimateddistribution (Celeba) in line D2E (see text) computed by the use of the 40 classifiers over the dataset.
Table 7: Ratio of unique combinations of attributes in generated images (see text). GMV and CGMVare the only models able to generate a diversity close to the diversity observed in the dataset.
Table 8: Distribution of the different attributes over generated samples. For example, 3.8 % of thesamples generated by the GMV model exhibit the ”Eyeglasses” attribute.
