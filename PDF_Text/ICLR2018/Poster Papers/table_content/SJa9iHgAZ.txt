Table 1: Train and test error of Resnet sharing top layers blocks (while using unshared both statisticsand β, γ in Batch Normalization) denoted as UBN (Unshared Batch Normalization) compared tobaseline Resnet of varying depth. Training Resnet with unrolled layers can bring additional gain of0.3%, while adding marginal amount of extra parameters. Runs are repeated 4 times.
