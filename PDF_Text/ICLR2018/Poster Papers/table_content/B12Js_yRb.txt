Table 1: Results on VQA v2 of the top models along with our results. Entries marked with (Ens.) areensembles of models. At the time of writing, our model with the counting module places third amongall entries. All models listed here use object proposal features and are trained on the training andvalidation sets. The top-performing ensemble models use additional pre-trained word embeddings,which we do not use.
Table 2: Results on the VQA v2 validation set with models trained only on the training set. Reportedare the mean accuracies and sample standard deviations (Â±) over 4 random initializations.
