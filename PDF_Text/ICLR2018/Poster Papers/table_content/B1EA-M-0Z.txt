Table 1: The NNGP often outperforms finite width networks. Test accuracy on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. The reported NNGP results correspond to the best performing depth, σw2 , and σb2 valueson the validation set. The traditional NN results correspond to the best performing depth, widthand optimization hyperparameters. Best models for a given training set size are specified by (depth-Width-σW-σ2) for NNs and (depth-σW-σ2) for GPs. More results are in Appendix Table 2.
