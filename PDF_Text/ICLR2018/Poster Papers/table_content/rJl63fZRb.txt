Table 1: Summary of related work in neural programming. Each column indicates what data is usedby the system. “Mixed”: only some of the training data is annotated with the higher-level structure.
Table 2: Empirical results for the long-hand addition task. All models were trained with 16 traces perinput length between 1 and 10, for a total of 160 traces, some of which strongly supervised.
