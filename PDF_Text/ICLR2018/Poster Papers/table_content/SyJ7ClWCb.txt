Table 1: Top-1 classification accuracy of ensemble and model transfer defenses (columns) againstfour black-box attacks (rows). The four networks we use to classify images are ResNet-50 (RN50),ResNet-101 (RN101), DenseNet-169 (DN169), and Inception-v4 (Iv4). Adversarial images aregenerated by running attacks against the ResNet-50 model, aiming for an average normalized L2 -dissimilarity of 0.06. Higher is better. The best defense against each attack is typeset in boldface.
