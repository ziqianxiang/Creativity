Table 1: Results on additional tasks. (+ = MiniWoB++, Steps = task length as the maximum numberof steps needed for a perfect policy to complete the task)Environment. Each task contains a 160px Ã— 210px environment and a goal specified in text. Themajority of the tasks return a single sparse reward at the end of the episode; either +1 (success) or -1(failure). For greater consistency among tasks, we disabled all partial rewards in our experiments.
