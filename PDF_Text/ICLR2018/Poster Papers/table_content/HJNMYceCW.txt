Table 1: Results of ablating various parts of the Residual Loss Prediction approach. Columnsare tasks. The first two rows are the cumulative average loss over multiple runs and its standarddeviation. The numbers in the rest of the column measure how much it hurts (positive number) orhelps (negative number) to ablate the corresponding parameter. To keep the numbers on a similarscale, the changes are reported as multiples of the standard deviation. So a value of 2.0 means thatthe cumulative loss gets worse by an additive factor of two standard deviations.
