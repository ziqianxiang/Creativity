Table 1: Motion prediction error for different styles of motion at {80, 160, 240, 320, 400, 480, 560, 640} msafter seed motion of 10 frames (approximately 170 ms) from test set. All acLSTM networks here are trainedwith condition length 5. Error given as Euclidean distance from the ground truth for the corresponding frame.

However,it is also possible that limiting motion magnitude on this particular dataset might correspond to lowererror. Further experiments of various condition lengths on several motion styles need to be conductedto say anything meaningful about the effect.
