Table 1: Highest training ELBO for discrete variational autoencoders.
Table 2: Mean episodes to solve tasks. Definitions of solving each task can be found in Appendix E.
Table 3: Highest obtained validation ELBO.
Table 4: Epochs needed to achieve REBAR’s best validation score. “-” indicates that the nonlinearRELAX models achieved lower validation scores than REBAR.
