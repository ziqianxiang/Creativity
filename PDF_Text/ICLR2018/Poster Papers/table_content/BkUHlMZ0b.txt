Table 2: Comparison between the average untargeted CLEVER score and distortion found by CWand I-FGSM untargeted attacks. DD and BReLU represent Defensive Distillation and BoundedReLU defending methods applied to the baseline CNN network.
Table 3: Comparison of the average targeted CLEVER scores with average '∞ and '2 distortionsfound by CW, I-FSGM attacks, and the average scores calculated by using the algorithm in Wood &Zhang (1996) (denoted as SLOPE) to estimate Lipschitz constant. DD and BReLU denote DefensiveDistillation and Bounded ReLU defending methods applied to the CNN network. We did not includeSLOPE in ImageNet networks because it has been shown to be ineffective even for smaller networks.
Table 5: Percentage of estimations where the null hypothesis cannot be rejected by K-S test for asignificance level of 0.05. The bar plots of this table are illustrated in Figure 3.
