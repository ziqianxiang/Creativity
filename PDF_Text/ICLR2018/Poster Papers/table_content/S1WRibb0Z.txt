Table 1: Correspondence between languages of Tensor Analysis and Deep Learning.
Table 2: Comparison of the expressive power of various networks. Given a network of width r,specified in a column, rows correspond to the upper bound on the width of the equivalent networkof other type (we assume that the number of feature maps m is greater than the width of the networkr).
