Figure 1: The optimal settings for {bi }ik=1 as nvaries are shown for k = 1, 2, 3. Observe thatthe bi converge to n1/k for large n, as witnessedby a linear fit in the log-log plot. The exact val-ues are given by equations (4) and (5).
Figure 2: Performance of trained networks inapproximating the product of 20 input variables,ranging from red (high error) to blue (low er-ror). The error shown here is the expected ab-solute difference between the predicted and ac-tual product. The curve W = n(k-1)/k âˆ™ 2n1/kfor n = 20 is shown in black. In the regionabove and to the right of the curve, it is possibleto effectively approximate the product function(Theorem 5.1).
