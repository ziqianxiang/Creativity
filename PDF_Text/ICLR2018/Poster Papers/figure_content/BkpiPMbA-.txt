Figure 1: Decision boundary distances (RMS) from single sample images, plotted in ascending or-der. Colors represent the adjacent class to an encountered boundary. A black line is drawn at theexpected distance of an image sampled during region classification. Results are shown for modelswith normal training and models with PGD adversarial training. For MNIST, original example cor-rectly classified 8 (yellow); OptBrittle and OptMargin examples misclassified as 5 (brown);FGSM example misclassified as 2 (green). For CIFAR-10, original example correctly classified asdeer (purple); OptBrittle, OptMargin, and FGSM examples misclassified as horse (gray).
Figure 2: Minimum and median decision boundary distances across random directions, for a sampleof images. Blue: Benign. Red: FGSM. Green: OPTMARGIN (ours). Orange: OPTBRITTLE.
Figure 3: Average purity of adjacent classes around benign and adversarial examples.
Figure 4: Architecture of our decision boundary classifier. Sizes are shown for our MNIST experi-ments.
Figure 5:	Adversarially perturbed images generated by different attack methods, for differentlytrained models, and their corresponding original images. Instances where the attack does not pro-duce an example are shown as black squares.
Figure 6:	Equivalent of Figure 1, decision boundary distances from sample images, plotted in L∞distance. A black line is drawn at the radius of the region used in region classification.
Figure 7: Equivalent of Figure 2, minimum and median decision boundary distances across randomdirections, plotted in L∞ distance. Blue: Benign. Red: FGSM. Green: OPTMARGIN (ours).
Figure 8: Images (top) and decision boundary distances in RMS distance (middle) and L∞ distance(bottom) based of a validation example from ImageNet and adversarial examples. Original examplecorrectly classified as eggnog (lime); OptB rittle example misclassified as espresso (cyan);OptMargin example misclassified as beer glass (pink); and FGSM example misclassified ascoffee mug (blue).
