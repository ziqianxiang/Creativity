Figure 1: unrolling and lifting operations for CNN layers5Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2018Convolutional layers In our framework, 2D convolutions are computed through matrix multipli-cations - an operation involving a very high reuse of data. For both CPU and GPU, this computationis performed by sectioning data in amounts that are cache-friendly (Dongarra et al., 1990), resultingin implementations attaining close to peak computational performance. However, in order to ex-press convolution as matrix multiplication we need to re-organize the input memory appropriately.
