Figure 1: Learning curve of BanditNet. The x-axis is the amount of bandit feedback, the y-axis isthe test error. Given enough bandit feedback, Bandit-ResNet converges to the skyline performance.
Figure 2: The x-axis shows the value of the Lagrange multiplier Î» used for training. Left plot showsthe test error. Right plot shows the value of the SNIPS objective and the normalizer S . The size ofthe training set is 50k bandit-feedback examples.
