Figure 1:	(a) The relative variance of UORO gradient estimates does not significantly increase withtime. Note the logarithmic scale on the time axis. (b) The relative variance of UORO gradientestimates significantly increases with network size. Note the logarithmic scale on number of units.
Figure 2:	(a)Results for influence balancing with 23 units and 13 minus; note the vertical log scale.
Figure 3:	Datasets.
Figure 4: Learning curves on anb(n1,32)UORO requires smaller learning rates than truncated BPTT, this favors UORO. Indeed UORO canfail to converge with non-decreasing learning rates, due to its stochastic nature.
