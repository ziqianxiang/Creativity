Figure 1: Multipop Adaptive Computation Stack Recurrent Neural Network.
Figure 3: Statistics of the stack actions on Wik-2 test dataset. The left plot shows the number of times(in log space) each stack state has the highest probability. The x-axis represents the number of pops,and the color represents the last action taken after pop (red represents stay, blue represents push).
Figure 4: An illustration of how the stack memory is written and read for a correct prediction. Wefollow Linzen et al. (2016) and convert some words (e.g., emigrating, impoverished) to their part ofspeech tags-given inside the brackets in the example above-to limit the vocabulary size.
