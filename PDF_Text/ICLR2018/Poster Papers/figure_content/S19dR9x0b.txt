Figure 1: Illustration of the optimal 2-bit quantization when α1 and α2 (α1 ≥ α2) are known inadvance. The values are quantized into -α1 - α2, -α1 + α2, α1 - α2, and α1 + α2, respectively.
Figure 2: Illustration of binary search tree to determine the optimal quantization.
Figure 3: Illustration of quantized matrix vector multiplication (left part). The matrix is quantizedrow by row, which provides more freedom to approximate while adds little extra computation. Byreformulating as the right part, we can make full use of the intrinsic parallel binary matrix vectormultiplication for further acceleration.
