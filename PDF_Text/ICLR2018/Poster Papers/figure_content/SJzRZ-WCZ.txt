Figure 1: Left: An example of how latent space distances do not reflect actual data distances. Right:Shortest paths on the surface spanned by the generator do not correspond to straight lines in thelatent space, as is assumed by the Euclidean metric.
Figure 2: The Jacobian J of a nonlinearfunction f provides a local basis in the in-put space, while ʌ/det(j1 J) measures thevolume of an infinitesimal region.
Figure 3: Example shortestpaths and distances.
Figure 4: From left to right: training data in X , latent representations in Z , the standard deviationlog(PjD=1 σj (z)) for the standard variance network, and the proposed solution.
Figure 5: Comparison of (log)measures of standard (top) andproposed (bottom) variances.
Figure 6: The result of k-means comparing the distance measures. For the decision boundaries weused 7-NN classification.
Figure 7: Left: the latent space with example interpolants. Right: auto-correlations of Riemannian(top) and Euclidean (bottom) samples along the curves of the left panel. Bottom: decoded imagesalong Euclidean (top rows) and Riemannian (bottom rows) interpolants.
Figure 8: Left: the latent space and geodesic interpolants. Right: samples comparing Euclidean (toprow) with Riemannian (bottom row) interpolation. Corresponding videos can be found here.
Figure 9: From left to right: the mixture models, generated samples, and pairwise distances. Toprow corresponds to the Riemannian model and bottom row to the Euclidean model.
Figure 10: Left: the measure in the latent space. Right: the random walks.
Figure 11: The comparison of the random walks, at the steps 200, 300, 3000, 4000 and 5000.
