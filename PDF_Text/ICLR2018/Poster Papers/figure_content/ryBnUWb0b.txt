Figure 1: LSTM network architecture. A 3-layer LSTM. Inputs are sensor readings for d consecutivetime-steps. Target is y = 1 if indoors and y = 0 if outdoors.
Figure 2: To find the indoor/outdoor transitions, we convolve filters V1 , V2 across timeseries ofIndoor/Outdoor predictions T and pick each subset si with a Jaccard distance ≥ 0.4. The transitionti is the middle index in set si .
Figure 3: Adjusting device pressure from readings from a nearby station. The readings were mostlyadjusted but the lack of resolution from the reference station made the estimate noisy throughout theexperiment.
Figure 4: feedforward network architecture. A simple, three fully connected layer network.
Figure 5: Distribution of m∆ measurements across 41 trials in the Uris Hall building in New YorkCity. A clear di,j size difference is specially noticeable at the lobby. Each dotted line correspondsto an actual floor in the building learned from clustered data-points.
Figure 6: Distribution of ”floor to floor” heights di,j across 615 office (left) and 492 residentialbuildings (right) in New York City.
