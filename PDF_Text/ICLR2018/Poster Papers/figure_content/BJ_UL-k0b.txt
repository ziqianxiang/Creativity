Figure 5: Our method is able to meta-learn a model that can quickly adapt to sinusoids with varying phasesand amplitudes, and the interpretation of the method as hierarchical Bayes makes it practical to directly samplemodels from the posterior. In this figure, we illustrate various samples from the posterior of a model that ismeta-trained on different sinusoids, when presented with a few datapoints (in red) from a new, previously unseensinusoid. Note that the random samples from the posterior predictive describe a distribution of functions thatare all sinusoidal and that there is increased uncertainty when the datapoints are less informative (i.e., when thedatapoints are sampled only from the lower part of the range input, shown in the bottom-right example).
