Figure 1: Visualizing a sender-receiver exchange at time step t. See Sec. 2 and 3 for more details.
Figure 2: (a) Difficulty (mea-sured by F1) versus conversationlength across classes. A negativecorrelation is observed, imply-ing that difficult classes requiremore turns. (b) Accuracy@Kversus conversation length forthe in-domain (blue) and out-of-domain (red) test sets.
Figure 3: (a) Prediction entropy over the conversation using the in-domain (blue) and out-of-domain(red) test sets. (b, c) Prediction certainty over time in example conversations about Kangaroo andWolf, respectively.
Figure 4: Message entropy over the con-versation on the in-domain test set of theExchange Indexit zones in on the correct answer. On the other hand, as the sender (left) and receiver (right).
Figure 5: Accuracy@K on the In-Domain (K = 6) and Out-of-Domain(K = 7) test sets for the Adaptive mod-els of varying message size. We noticethe increasing accuracy on the out-of-domain test set as the bandwidth of thechannel increases.
