Figure 1: Each bar represents the signal value at the vertex where the bar originates. Blue and redcolor indicate positive and negative values, respectively. Local variations at the green node are (a)1.67 (b) 25 and (c) 15, respectively.
Figure 2: Architecture of DQ-LSTM that consists of GCN followed by the data quality networkDQN and LSTM. GCN are able to extract localized features from given graph signals (differentcolors correspond to different signals) and DQN computes the data quality of each vertex. N is thenumber of vertices, i.e. each loss function on each vertex is weighted by the quality level si . Notethat the dot-patterned circles denote the current vertex i.
Figure 3: t-SNE visualization of outputs of GCN in DQ-LSTM. Red dot denotes the reference nodeand green dots are the adjacent nodes of the red dot. (a), (b) and (c) illustrate how the embeddingsof spatiotemporal signals changes. At t = 4, the v25 node is relatively far from other green nodesbecause it is connected with the v4 node which is not a neighbor of red dot. All nodes come fromWeather Underground.
Figure 4: Personal weather stations distributed over Los Angeles areaIn the dataset, each station is distributed around Los Angeles County and land characteristics where the stationis located at are provided. These characteristics would be used as a set of input features, Vi . The list of thestatic characteristics is:Table 3: Land featuresName	Unit	DescriptionLatitude	degree (°)	An angle which ranges from 0 at the Equator to 90 at the polesLongitude	degree (°)	An angule which ranges from 0 at the Prime Meridian to +180 eastward and 180 westwardElevation	ft	一	Elevation from average sea levelTree fraction	dimensionless	Fraction covered by tree in that neighborhoodVegetation fraction	dimensionless	Fraction of the neighborhood covered by vegetationAlbedo	dimensionless	Reflected amount of incoming shortwaveDistance from coast	m	Distance from the nearest coastal pointImpervious fraction	dimensionless	Fraction of the neighborhood covered by impervious materialCanopy width	ft	一	Width of the buildings to the centerline of streetsBuilding height	ft	Average height of buildings in neighborhoodCanopy direction	degree (°)	The direction of the canopy in degrees from 0-90At each station, a number of weather data are observed through the installed instruments and recorded. Thetypes of measurements are Temperature, Pressure, Relative humidity, Solar radiation, Precipitation, Windspeed, and Wind direction.
