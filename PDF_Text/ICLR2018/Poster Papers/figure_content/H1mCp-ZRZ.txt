Figure 1: The variance of gradient estimators of different control variates under a fixed policy obtained byrunning vanilla PPO for 200 iterations in the Walker2d-v1 environment.
Figure 2: Evaluation of TRPO with Q-prop and Stein control variates on Hopper-v1 and Walker2d-v1.
Figure 3: Evaluation of PPO with the value function baseline and Stein control variates across different Mujocoenvironments: HumanoidStandup-v1, Humanoid-v1, Walker2d-v1, Ant-v1 and Hopper-v1, HalfCheetah-v1.
Figure 4: Evaluation of PPO with Stein control variate when φ is estimated based on data from differentiterations. The architecture of φ is choosen to be MLP.
