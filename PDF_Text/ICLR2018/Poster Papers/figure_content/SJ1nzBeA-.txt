Figure 1: General workflow of the proposed multi-task neural session relevance framework. Theframework is trained on search sessions to jointly predict next query and rank corresponding doc-uments. The model encodes the current query in the session, “craig list virginia”, updates corre-sponding session-level recurrent state, maximizes the probability of the next query, “cheap furniturefor sale” (i.e., the task of query suggestion), encodes the candidate documents for the followingquery and minimizes loss for clicked documents (i.e., the task of document ranking).

Figure 3:	Architecture of the Multi-task Neural Session Relevance Framework (M-NSRF). M-NSRFuses bi-LSTM with max pooling to form query and document representations and use LSTM togather session-level information. These recurrent states (current query representation and sessionlevel recurrent state, which summarizes all previous queries) are used by query decoder and document ranker for predicting next query and computing relevance scores.
