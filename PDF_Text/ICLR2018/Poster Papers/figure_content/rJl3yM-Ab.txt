Figure 1: Two examples of questions and candidate answers. (a) A question benefiting from the repetition ofevidence. Correct answer A2 has multiple passages that could support A2 as answer. The wrong answer A1has only a single supporting passage. (b) A question benefiting from the union of multiple pieces of evidenceto support the answer. The correct answer A2 has evidence passages that can match both the first half and thesecond half of the question. The wrong answer A1 has evidence passages covering only the first half.
