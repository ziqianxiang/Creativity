Figure 1: We fix the a vectors for a two hidden layer R → R hard function as a1 = a2 = ( ɪ) ∈ △：Left: A specific hard function induced by `1 norm: ZONOTOPE22,2,2[a1, a2, b1, b2] whereb1 = (0, 1) and b2 = (1, 0). Note that in this case the function can be seen as a composi-tion of Ηa1,a2 with '1 -norm N'1 (x) := ∣∣xk1 = YZ((0,1),(1,0)). Middle: A typical hard functionZONOTOPE2,2,4[a1, a2, c1, c2, c3, c4] with generators c1 = (ɪ, 2), c2 = ( — 2,0), c3 = (0, — 4)and c4 = (—1, — 4). Note how increasing the number of zonotope generators makes the functionmore complex. Right: A harder function from ZONOTOPE23,2,4 family with the same set of gen-erators c1, c2, c3, c4 but one more hidden layer (k = 3). Note how increasing the depth make thefunction more complex. (For illustrative purposes we plot only the part of the function which liesabove zero.)The set of vertices of Z(b1, . . . , bm) will be denoted by vert(Z(b1, . . . , bm)). The support func-tion γZ(b1,...,bm) : Rn → R associated with the zonotope Z(b1, . . . , bm) is defined asγZ(b1,...,bm)(r) =	max	hr, xi.
Figure 2: Top: ha1 with a1 ∈ ∆21 with 3 pieces in the range [0, 1]. Middle: ha2 with a2 ∈ ∆11 with2 pieces in the range [0,1]. Bottom: Hi a = ha ◦ haι with 2 ∙ 3 = 6 pieces in the range [0,1].
Figure 4: The number of pieces increasing after activation. If the blue function is f, then the redfunction g = max{0, f + b} has at most twice the number of pieces as f for any bias b ∈ R.
