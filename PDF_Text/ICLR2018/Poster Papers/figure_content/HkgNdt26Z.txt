Figure 1: Overview of the approach. The current model is updated on devices and updates Git fromusers are stored in a queue. Every K elements GGi of the queue are used for one round of averaging.
Figure 2: Training curves for the general model on the standard English (Wikipedia) and the userdata (Twitter) corpora with random rehearsal (left) and without random rehearsal (right).
Figure 3: Left: Empirical histogram of random samples of c(s). Magenta line represents theoreticaldistribution of the Pareto law with parameters that are estimated on these samples. Right: Differencebetween two distributions on the left plot expressed in number of samples âˆ†(x). The parameters ofthe Pareto law were estimated on the samples that lie in the region {log c(s) > 0.35} (blue line).
