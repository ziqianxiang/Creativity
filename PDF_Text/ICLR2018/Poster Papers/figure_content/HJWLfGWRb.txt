Figure 1: A network with one ReLU convolutional layer followed by a primary convolutional cap-sule layer and two more convolutional capsule layers.
Figure 2: Histogram of distances of votes to the mean of each of the 5 final capsules after eachrouting iteration. Each distance point is weighted by its assignment probability. All three imagesare selected from the smallNORB test set. The routing procedure correctly routes the votes in thetruck and the human example. The plane example shows a rare failure case of the model where theplane is confused with a car in the third routing iteration. The histograms are zoomed-in to visualizeonly votes with distances less than 0.05. Fig. B.2 shows the complete histograms for the ”human”capsule without clipping the x-axis or fixing the scale of the y-axis.
Figure 3: Accuracy against after an adversarial attack (left) and Success Rate after a targetedadversarial attack (right). The targeted attack results were evaluated by averaging the success rateafter the attack for each of the 5 possible classes.
