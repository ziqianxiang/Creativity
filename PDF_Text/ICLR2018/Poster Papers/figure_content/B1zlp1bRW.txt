Figure 1: Example of estimated optimal map between a continuous Gaussian distribution (coloredlevel sets) and a multi-modal discrete measure (red +). (left) Continuous source and discrete targetdistributions. (center left) displacement field of the estimated optimal map: each arrow is propor-tional to f (Xi) - Xi where (Xi) is a uniform discrete grid. (center right) Generated samples obtainedby sampling from the source distribution and applying our estimated Monge map f. (right) Levelsets of the resulting density (approximated as a 2d histogram over 106 samples).
Figure 2: Convergence plots of the the Stochastic Dual Algorithm 1 against a stochastic semi-dualimplementation (adapted from (Genevay et al., 2016): we use SGD instead of SAG), for severalentropy-regularization values. Learning rates are {5., 20., 20.} and batch sizes {1024, 500, 100}respectively and are taken the same for the dual and semi-dual methods.
