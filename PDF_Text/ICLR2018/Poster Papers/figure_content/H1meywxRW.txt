Figure 3: Performance comparison between DCN+ and the baseline DCN with CoVe on the SQuADdevelopment set.
Figure 4: Training curve of DCN+ with and without reinforcement learning. In the latter case, onlythe cross entropy objective is used. The mixed objective initially performs worse as it begins policylearning from scratch, but quickly outperforms the cross entropy model.
