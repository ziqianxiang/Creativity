Figure 1: The softmax scale coefficient α was observed to follow a logarithmic growth over thecourse of training.
Figure 2: Comparing training and validation error of fixed and learned classifier (ResNet56, Cifar10)(b) Validation error(a) Training errorFigure 3: Comparing fixed vs. trained variable scale α (ResNet56, Cifar10)(b) Validation errorWe trained a residual network ofHe et al. (2016) on the Cifar10 dataset. We used a network of depth56 and the same hyper-parameters used in the original work. We compared two variants: the originalmodel with a learned classifier, and our version, where a fixed transformation is used. The resultsshown in figure 2 demonstrate that although the training error is considerably lower for the networkwith learned classifier, both models achieve the same classification accuracy on the validation set.
