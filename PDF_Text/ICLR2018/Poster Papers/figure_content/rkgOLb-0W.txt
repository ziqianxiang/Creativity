Figure 1: Hard arrow represents syntactic tree structure and parent-to-child dependency relation,dash arrow represents dependency relation between siblingsSuppose we have a sequence of tokens x0, ..., x6 governed by the tree structure showed in Figure 1.
Figure 2: Proposed model architecture, hard line indicate valid connection in Reading Network,dash line indicate valid connection in Predict Network.
Figure 3: Convolutional network for computing syntactic distance. Gray triangles represent 2 layersof convolution, d0 to d7 are the syntactic distance output by each of the kernel position. The bluebars indicate the amplitude of di ’s, and yi ’s are the inferred constituents.
Figure 4: Syntactic distance estimated by Parsing Network. The model is trained on PTB dataset atthe character level. Each blue bar is positioned between two characters, and represents the syntacticdistance between them. From these distances we can infer a tree structure according to Section 4.2.
Figure 5: Syntactic structures of two different sentences inferred from {di } given by Parsing Net-work.
