Figure 1: Link prediction performance for different embedding sizes and percentages of trainingedges on Cora-ML. G2G outperforms the competitors even for small sizes and percentage of edges.
Figure 2:	Classification performance comparison - both G2G and G2G_oh perform strongly.
Figure 3:	Our sampling strategy converges significantly faster than the full loss, while maintaininggood performance. It also achieves better loss and has lower variance compared to naive sampling.
Figure 4:	The benefit of modeling the uncertainty of the nodes.
