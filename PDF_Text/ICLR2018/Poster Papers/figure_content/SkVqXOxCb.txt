Figure 1: The vector field of a Coulomb GAN. The basic idea behind the Coulomb GAN: truesamples (blue) and generated samples (red) create a potential field (scalar field). Blue samples act assinks that attract the red samples, which repel each other. The superimposed vector field shows theforces acting on the generator samples to equalize potential differences, and the background colorshows the potential at each position. Best viewed in color.
Figure 2: Images from a Coulomb GAN after training on CelebA (first row), LSUN bedrooms(second row) and CIFAR 10 (last row). Further examples are located in the appendix in Section A.7Figure 3: The most similar pairs found in batches of 1024 generated faces sampled from theCoulomb GAN, and the nearest neighbor from the training data shown as third image. Distanceswere calculated as Euclidean distances on pixel level.

Figure 4: Scatter plots of generated samples from different GAN variants for the mixture of 25Gaussians and the true data distribution. “WD” indicates weight decay and “proj.” means projection.
Figure 5: 2D histogram of the density of generated and the training st data for the mixture of 25Gaussians. For constructing the histogram, 10k samples were drawn from the target and the modeldistribution. The Coulomb GAN captures the underlying distribution well, does not miss any modes,and places almost all probability mass on the modes. Only the Coulomb GAN captured the within-mode spread of the Gaussians.
