Figure 1: Illustration of Fidelity-Weighted Learning: Step 1: Pre-train student on weak data, Step 2: Fit teacher to observationsfrom the true function, and Step 3: Fine-tune student on labels generated by teacher, taking the confidence into account. Reddotted borders and blue solid borders depict components with trainable and non-trainable parameters, respectively.
Figure 2: Toy example: The true function we want to learn is y = sin(x) and the weak function is y = 2sinc(x).
