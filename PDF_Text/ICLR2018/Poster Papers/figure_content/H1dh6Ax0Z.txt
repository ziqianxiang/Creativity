Figure 2: High-level structure of TreeQN with a tree depth of two and shared transition and evaluation functions(reward prediction and value mixing omitted for simplicity).
Figure 3: High-level structure of ATreeC.
Figure 4: Grounding the reward and transition functions using auxiliary losses: final returns on Seaquest plottedagainst the coefficient of the auxiliary loss.
Figure 5: Box-pushing results: the x-axis shows the number of transitions observed across all of the synchronousenvironment threads.
Figure 6: Results for the Atari domain. The y-axis shows the moving average over 100 episodes. Each of fiverandom seeds is plotted faintly, with the mean in bold.
