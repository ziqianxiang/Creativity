Figure 1: The quality of the PossibleWorldNet as we vary the number of Possible worldsIn ProPositional logic, of course, if we are allowed to generate every single truth-value assignment,then it is trivial to detect entailment by checking each one. In our big test set, there are on averagemore than 3,000 Possible truth-value assignments. In our massive test set, there are on average over800,000 Possible assignments. (See Table 1). The PossibleWorldNet considers at most 256 differentworlds, which is only 7% of the exPected total number of rows needed in the big test set, and only0.03% of the exPected number of rows needed for the massive test set.
