Figure 1: Left: The Arm-Ball environment with a 7 DOF arm, controlled by a 21D continuousactions DMP controller, that can stick and move the ball if the arm tip touches it (on the left). Right:rendered 70x70 images used as raw signals representing the end position of the objects for Arm-Ball(on the center) and Arm-Arrow (on the right) environments. The arm is not visible to learners.
Figure 2: KL Coverage through epochs for different algorithms on ArmBall and ArmArrow envi-ronments. The exploration performance was assessed for both an over-complete representation (10latent dimensions), and a complete representation (2 and 3 latent dimensions). The shaded arearepresent a 90% confidence interval estimated from 5 run of the different algorithms.
Figure 3: Examples of achieved outcomes related with the evolution of KL-Coverage in the ArmBallenvironments. The number of times the ball was effectively handled is also represented.
