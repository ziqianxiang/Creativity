Figure 1: seq2seq generator architecture. Blue boxes represent known tokens and purple boxes areimputed tokens. We demonstrate a sampling operation via the dotted line. The encoder reads in amasked sequence, where masked tokens are denoted by an underscore, and then the decoder imputesthe missing tokens by using the encoder hidden states. In this example, the generator should fill inthe alphabetical ordering, (a,b,c,d,e).
Figure 2: Particular failure mode succeeding in the optimization of a 4-gram metric at the extremeexpense of validation perplexity. The resulting samples are shown below.
