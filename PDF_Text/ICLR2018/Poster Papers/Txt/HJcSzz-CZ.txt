Ab stract
In few-shot classification, we are interested in learning algorithms that train
a classifier from only a handful of labeled examples. Recent progress in
few-shot classification has featured meta-learning, in which a parameterized
model for a learning algorithm is defined and trained on episodes representing
different classification problems, each with a small labeled training set and its
corresponding test set. In this work, we advance this few-shot classification
paradigm towards a scenario where unlabeled examples are also available within
each episode. We consider two situations: one where all unlabeled examples
are assumed to belong to the same set of classes as the labeled examples of the
episode, as well as the more challenging situation where examples from other
distractor classes are also provided. To address this paradigm, we propose novel
extensions of Prototypical Networks (Snell et al., 2017) that are augmented with
the ability to use unlabeled examples when producing prototypes. These models
are trained in an end-to-end way on episodes, to learn to leverage the unlabeled
examples successfully. We evaluate these methods on versions of the Omniglot
and miniImageNet benchmarks, adapted to this new framework augmented with
unlabeled examples. We also propose a new split of ImageNet, consisting of a
large set of classes, with a hierarchical structure. Our experiments confirm that
our Prototypical Networks can learn to improve their predictions due to unlabeled
examples, much like a semi-supervised algorithm would.
1	Introduction
The availability of large quantities of labeled data has enabled deep learning methods to achieve im-
pressive breakthroughs in several tasks related to artificial intelligence, such as speech recognition,
object recognition and machine translation. However, current deep learning approaches struggle in
tackling problems for which labeled data are scarce. Specifically, while current methods excel at
tackling a single problem with lots of labeled data, methods that can simultaneously solve a large
variety of problems that each have only a few labels are lacking. Humans on the other hand are
readily able to rapidly learn new classes, such as new types of fruit when we visit a tropical country.
This significant gap between human and machine learning provides fertile ground for deep learning
developments.
For this reason, recently there has been an increasing body of work on few-shot learning, which
considers the design of learning algorithms that specifically allow for better generalization on
problems with small labeled training sets. Here we focus on the case of few-shot classification,
where the given classification problem is assumed to contain only a handful of labeled examples per
class. One approach to few-shot learning follows a form of meta-learning * 1 (Thrun, 1998; Hochreiter
et al., 2001), which performs transfer learning from a pool of various classification problems

generated from large quantities of available labeled data, to new classification problems from classes
unseen at training time. Meta-learning may take the form of learning a shared metric (Vinyals et al.,
2016; Snell et al., 2017), a common initialization for few-shot classifiers (Ravi & Larochelle, 2017;
Finn et al., 2017) or a generic inference network (Santoro et al., 2016; Mishra et al., 2017).
These various meta-Iearning formulations have
led to significant progress recently in few-shot
classification. However, this progress has been
limited in the setup of each few-shot learning
episode, which differs from how humans learn
new concepts in many dimensions. In this
paper we aim to generalize the setup in two
ways. First, we consider a scenario where
the new classes are learned in the presence of
additional unlabeled data. While there have
been many successful applications of semi-
supervised learning to the regular setting of
a single classification task (Chapelle et al.,
2010) where classes at training and test time
are the same, such work has not addressed the
challenge of performing transfer to new classes
never seen at training time, which we consider
here. Second, we consider the situation where
the new classes to be learned are not viewed in
isolation. Instead, many of the unlabeled exam-
ples are from different classes; the presence of
such distractor classes introduces an additional
and more realistic level of difficulty to the few-
shot problem.
Figure 1: Consider a setup where the aim is to learn a
classifier to distinguish between two previously unseen
classes, goldfish and shark, given not only labeled
examples of these two classes, but also a larger pool
of unlabeled examples, some of which may belong to
one of these two classes of interest. In this work we
aim to move a step closer to this more natural learning
framework by incorporating in our learning episodes
unlabeled data from the classes we aim to learn repre-
sentations for (shown with dashed red borders) as well
as from distractor classes .
This work is a first study of this challenging semi-supervised form of few-shot learning. First, we
define the problem and propose benchmarks for evaluation that are adapted from the Omniglot and
miniImageNet benchmarks used in ordinary few-shot learning. We perform an extensive empirical
investigation of the two settings mentioned above, with and without distractor classes. Second, we
propose and study three novel extensions of Prototypical Networks (Snell et al., 2017), a state-of-
the-art approach to few-shot learning, to the semi-supervised setting. Finally, we demonstrate in our
experiments that our semi-supervised variants successfully learn to leverage unlabeled examples and
outperform purely supervised Prototypical Networks.
2	Background
We start by defining precisely the current paradigm for few-shot learning and the Prototypical
Network approach to this problem.
2.1	Few-shot learning
Recent progress on few-shot learning has been made possible by following an episodic paradigm.
Consider a situation where we have a large labeled dataset for a set of classes Ctrain . However,
after training on examples from Ctrain, our ultimate goal is to produce classifiers for a disjoint set
of new classes Ctest , for which only a few labeled examples will be available. The idea behind the
episodic paradigm is to simulate the types of few-shot problems that will be encountered at test,
taking advantage of the large quantities of available labeled data for classes Ctrain .
Specifically, models are trained on K-shot, N -way episodes constructed by first sampling a
small subset of N classes from Ctrain and then generating: 1) a training (support) set S =
{(x1, y1), (x2, y2), . . . , (xN×K, yN×K)} containing K examples from each of the N classes and
2) a test (query) set Q = {(x；,y；), (x2,y2),..., (XT, yT)} of different examples from the same
N classes. Each xi ∈ RD is an input vector of dimension D and yi ∈ {1, 2, . . . , N} is a class
label (similarly for x* and y*). Training on such episodes is done by feeding the support set S to
2

the model and updating its parameters to minimize the loss of its predictions for the examples in the
query set Q.
One way to think of this approach is that our model effectively trains to be a good learning algorithm.
Indeed, much like a learning algorithm, the model must take in a set of labeled examples and produce
a predictor that can be applied to new examples. Moreover, training directly encourages the classifier
produced by the model to have good generalization on the new examples of the query set. Due to
this analogy, training under this paradigm is often referred to as learning to learn or meta-learning.
On the other hand, referring to the content of episodes as training and test sets and to the process of
learning on these episodes as meta-learning or meta-training (as is sometimes done in the literature)
can be confusing. So for the sake of clarity, we will refer to the content of episodes as support and
query sets, and to the process of iterating over the training episodes simply as training.
2.2	Prototypical Networks
Prototypical Network (Snell et al., 2017) is a few-shot learning model that has the virtue of being
simple and yet obtaining state-of-the-art performance. At a high-level, it uses the support set S to
extract a prototype vector from each class, and classifies the inputs in the query set based on their
distance to the prototype of each class.
More precisely, Prototypical Networks learn an embedding function h(x), parameterized as a neural
network, that maps examples into a space where examples from the same class are close and those
from different classes are far. All parameters of Prototypical Networks lie in the embedding function.
To compute the prototype pc of each class c, a per-class average of the embedded examples is
performed:
pc
£PXlZzie, where " = 1尿=c].
(1)
These prototypes define a predictor for the class of any new (query) example x*, which assigns a
probability over any class C based on the distances between x* and each prototype, as follows:
p(c∣x*, {pc})
exp(-∣∣h(x*) -p〈||2)
P eχp(Th(X，-pc||2)
(2)
The loss function used to update Prototypical Networks for a given training episode is then simply
the average negative log-probability of the correct class assignments, for all query examples:
-τ1 Xlogp(y*|x*NPj).	⑶
Training proceeds by minimizing the average loss, iterating over training episodes and performing a
gradient descent update for each.
Generalization performance is measured on test set episodes, which contain images from classes
in Ctest instead of Ctrain . For each test episode, we use the predictor produced by the Prototypical
Network for the provided support set S to classify each of query input x* into the most likely class
y = argmaXcp(c∣x*, {Pc}).
3	Semi-Supervised Few-Shot Learning
We now define the semi-supervised setting considered in this work for few-shot learning.
The training set is denoted as a tuple of labeled and unlabeled examples: (S, R). The labeled portion
is the usual support set S of the few-shot learning literature, containing a list of tuples of inputs and
targets. In addition to classic few-shot learning, we introduce an unlabeled set R containing only
inputs: R = {Xι, X2,..., XM}. As in the purely supervised setting, our models are trained to
perform well when predicting the labels for the examples in the episode’s query set Q. Figure 2
shows a visualization of training and test episodes.

Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2018
Figure 2: Example of the semi-supervised few-shot learning setup. Training involves iterating through training
episodes, consisting of a support set S, an unlabeled set R, and a query set Q. The goal is to use the labeled
items (shown with their numeric class label) in S and the unlabeled items in R within each episode to generalize
to good performance on the corresponding query set. The unlabeled items in R may either be pertinent to the
classes we are considering (shown above with green plus signs) or they may be distractor items which belong
to a class that is not relevant to the current episode (shown with red minus signs). However note that the model
does not actually have ground truth information as to whether each unlabeled example is a distractor or not; the
plus/minus signs are shown only for illustrative purposes. At test time, we are given new episodes consisting
of novel classes not seen during training that we use to evaluate the meta-learning method.
3.1	Semi-Supervised Prototypical Networks
In their original formulation, Prototypical Networks do not specify a way to leverage the unlabeled
set R. In what follows, we now propose various extensions that start from the basic definition
of prototypes Pc and provide a procedure for producing refined prototypes Pc using the unlabeled
examples in R.
After the refined prototypes are
obtained, each of these models
is trained with the same loss
function for ordinary Prototypi-
cal Networks of Equation 3, but
replacing Pc with pc. That is,
each query example is classi-
fied into one of the N classes
based on the proximity of its
embedded position with the cor-
responding refined prototypes,
and the average negative log-
probability of the correct classi-
fication is used for training.
Figure 3: Left: The prototypes are initialized based on the mean
location of the examples of the corresponding class, as in ordinary
Prototypical Networks. Support, unlabeled, and query examples have
solid, dashed, and white colored borders respectively. Right: The refined
prototypes obtained by incorporating the unlabeled examples, which
classifies all query examples correctly.
After Refinement
3.1.1	Prototypical Networks with Soft k-Means
We first consider a simple way of leveraging unlabeled examples for refining prototypes, by
taking inspiration from semi-supervised clustering. Viewing each prototype as a cluster center,
the refinement process could attempt to adjust the cluster locations to better fit the examples in both
the support and unlabeled sets. Under this view, cluster assignments of the labeled examples in the
support set are considered known and fixed to each example’s label. The refinement process must
instead estimate the cluster assignments of the unlabeled examples and adjust the cluster locations
(the prototypes) accordingly.
4
Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2018
One natural choice would be to borrow from the inference performed by soft k-means. We prefer
this version of k-means over hard assignments since hard assignments would make the inference
non-differentiable. We start with the regular Prototypical Network’s prototypes pc (as specified in
Equation 1) as the cluster locations. Then, the unlabeled examples get a partial assignment (Zj,c) to
each cluster based on their Euclidean distance to the cluster locations. Finally, refined prototypes
are obtained by incorporating these unlabeled examples.
This process can be summarized as follows:
~	Pih(Xi)Zi,c + Pj h(Xj)zj,c	~	exp (-∣∣h(Xj) -Pc∣∣2)	...
PC =--------------, v√ 〜--------,where Zj,c =	------/	、-----∏2τ	(4)
∑izi,c + Ej zj,c	ECO eχp(Th(Xj) -Pc01|2)
Predictions of each query input’s class is then modeled as in Equation 2, but using the refined
prototypes p)c.
We could perform several iterations of refinement, as is usual in k-means. However, we have
experimented with various number of iterations and found results to not improve beyond a single
refinement step.
3.1.2	PROTOTYPICAL NETWORKS WITH SOFT k-MEANS WITH A DISTRACTOR CLUSTER
The soft k-means approach described above implicitly assumes that each unlabeled example belongs
to either one of the N classes in the episode. However, it would be much more general to not make
that assumption and have a model robust to the existence of examples from other classes, which we
refer to as distractor classes. For example, such a situation would arise if we wanted to distinguish
between pictures of unicycles and scooters, and decided to add an unlabeled set by downloading
images from the web. It then would not be realistic to assume that all these images are of unicycles
or scooters. Even with a focused search, some may be from similar classes, such as bicycle.
Since soft k-means distributes its soft assignments across all classes, distractor items could be
harmful and interfere with the refinement process, as prototypes would be adjusted to also partially
account for these distractors. A simple way to address this is to add an additional cluster whose
purpose is to capture the distractors, thus preventing them from polluting the clusters of the classes
of interest:
{Pi h(Xi)zi,c
i zi,c
0
for c = 1...N
for c = N + 1
(5)
Here we take the simplifying assumption that the distractor cluster has a prototype centered at the
origin. We also consider introducing length-scales rc to represent variations in the within-cluster
distances, specifically for the distractor cluster:
eχp (-r⅛||xj -Pc||2 - ACrC))	ι
Zj,c = ------s-ʌ-------------------^~wh，where A(r) = ʒ log(2∏) + log(r)	(6)
Pco eχp (-r⅛||Xj -Pc0||2 - A(rc0))	2
For simplicity, we set r1...N to 1 in our experiments, and only learn the length-scale of the distractor
cluster rN+1.
3.1.3	PROTOTYPICAL NETWORKS WITH SOFT k-MEANS AND MASKING
Modeling distractor unlabeled examples with a single cluster is likely too simplistic. Indeed, it
is inconsistent with our assumption that each cluster corresponds to one class, since distractor
examples may very well cover more than a single natural object category. Continuing with our
unicycles and bicycles example, our web search for unlabeled images could accidentally include
not only bicycles, but other related objects such as tricycles or cars. This was also reflected in our
experiments, where we constructed the episode generating process so that it would sample distractor
examples from multiple classes.
To address this problem, we propose an improved variant: instead of capturing distractors with a
high-variance catch-all cluster, we model distractors as examples that are not within some area of
any of the legitimate class prototypes. This is done by incorporating a soft-masking mechanism on
5
Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2018
the contribution of unlabeled examples. At a high level, we want unlabeled examples that are closer
to a prototype to be masked less than those that are farther.
More specifically, we modify the soft k-means refinement as follows. We start by computing
normalized distances dj,c between examples Xj and prototypes pc：
dj,c = 1 vj"	, Where dj,c = ||h(Xj) - Pc||2
M jdj dj,c
(7)
Then, soft thresholds βc and slopes γc are predicted for each prototype, by feeding to a small neural
network various statistics of the normalized distances for the prototype:
[βc, γc] = MLP
〜〜〜 〜〜
min(dj c), max(dj c),var(djc), skeW(dj c), kurt(djc)
jjjj	j
(8)
This allows each threshold to use information on the amount of intra-cluster variation to determine
how aggressively it should cut out unlabeled examples.
Then, soft masks mj,c for the contribution of each example to each prototype are computed, by
comparing to the threshold the normalized distances, as follows:
pc
Ei h(Xi)Zi,c + Ej h(Xj)Zj,cmj,c
Σi zi,c + ∑j zj,cmj,c
, Where mj,c = σ
(9)
where σ(∙) is the sigmoid function.
When training with this refinement process, the model can now use its MLP in Equation 8 to learn
to include or ignore entirely certain unlabeled examples. The use of soft masks makes this process
entirely differentiable2. Finally, much like for regular soft k-means (with or without a distractor
cluster), while we could recursively repeat the refinement for multiple steps, we found a single step
to perform well enough.
4	Related Work
We summarize here the most relevant work from the literature on few-shot learning, semi-supervised
learning and clustering.
The best performing methods for few-shot learning use the episodic training framework prescribed
by meta-learning. The approach within which our work falls is that of metric learning methods.
Previous work in metric-learning for few-shot-classification includes Deep Siamese Networks (Koch
et al., 2015), Matching Networks (Vinyals et al., 2016), and Prototypical Networks (Snell et al.,
2017), which is the model we extend to the semi-supervised setting in our work. The general idea
here is to learn an embedding function that embeds examples belonging to the same class close
together while keeping embeddings from separate classes far apart. Distances between embeddings
of items from the support set and query set are then used as a notion of similarity to do classification.
Lastly, closely related to our work with regard to extending the few-shot learning setting, Bachman
et al. (2017) employ Matching Networks in an active learning framework where the model has a
choice of which unlabeled item to add to the support set over a certain number of time steps before
classifying the query set. Unlike our setting, their meta-learning agent can acquire ground-truth
labels from the unlabeled set, and they do not use distractor examples.
Other meta-learning approaches to few-shot learning include learning how to use the support set
to update a learner model so as to generalize to the query set. Recent work has involved learning
either the weight initialization and/or update step that is used by a learner neural network (Ravi
& Larochelle, 2017; Finn et al., 2017). Another approach is to train a generic neural architecture
such as a memory-augmented recurrent network (Santoro et al., 2016) or a temporal convolutional
network (Mishra et al., 2017) to sequentially process the support set and perform accurate
predictions of the labels of the query set examples. These other methods are also competitive for
few-shot learning, but we chose to extend Prototypical Networks in this work for its simplicity and
efficiency.
2We stop gradients from passing through the computation of the statistics in Equation 8, to avoid potential
numerical instabilities.

Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2018
As for the literature on semi-supervised learning, while it is quite vast (Zhu, 2005; Chapelle et al.,
2010), the most relevant category to our work is related to self-training (Yarowsky, 1995; Rosenberg
et al., 2005). Here, a classifier is first trained on the initial training set. The classifier is then used
to classify unlabeled items, and the most confidently predicted unlabeled items are added to the
training set with the prediction of the classifier as the assumed label. This is similar to our soft
k-Means extension to Prototypical Networks. Indeed, since the soft assignments (Equation 4) match
the regular Prototypical Network’s classifier output for new inputs (Equation 2), then the refinement
can be thought of re-feeding to a Prototypical Network a new support set augmented with (soft)
self-labels from the unlabeled set.
Our algorithm is also related to transductive learning (Vapnik, 1998; Joachims, 1999; Fu et al., 2015),
where the base classifier gets refined by seeing the unlabeled examples. In practice, one could use
our method in a transductive setting where the unlabeled set is the same as the query set; however,
here to avoid our model memorizing labels of the unlabeled set during the meta-learning procedure,
we split out a separate unlabeled set that is different from the query set.
In addition to the original k-Means method (Lloyd, 1982), the most related work to our setup
involving clustering algorithms considers applying k-Means in the presence of outliers (HaUtamaki
et al., 2005; Chawla & Gionis, 2013; Gupta et al., 2017). The goal here is to correctly discover and
ignore the outliers so that they do not wrongly shift the cluster locations to form a bad partition of
the true data. This objective is also important in our setup as not ignoring outliers (or distractors)
will wrongly shift the prototypes and negatively influence classification performance.
Our contribution to the semi-supervised learning and clustering literature is to go beyond the
classical setting of training and evaluating within a single dataset, and consider the setting where
we must learn to transfer from a set of training classes Ctrain to a new set of test classes Ctest.
5	Experiments
5.1	Datasets
We evaluate the performance of our model on three datasets: two benchmark few-shot classification
datasets and a novel large-scale dataset that we hope will be useful for future few-shot learning work.
Omniglot (Lake et al., 2011) is a dataset of 1,623 handwritten characters from 50 alphabets. Each
character was drawn by 20 human subjects. We follow the few-shot setting proposed by Vinyals
et al. (2016), in which the images are resized to 28 X 28 pixels and rotations in multiples of 90° are
applied, yielding 6,492 classes in total. These are split into 4,112 training classes, 688 validation
classes, and 1,692 testing classes.
miniImageNet (Vinyals et al., 2016) is a modified version of the ILSVRC-12 dataset (Russakovsky
et al., 2015), in which 600 images for each of 100 classes were randomly chosen to be part of the
dataset. We rely on the class split used by Ravi & Larochelle (2017). These splits use 64 classes for
training, 16 for validation, and 20 for test. All images are of size 84 × 84 pixels.
tieredImageNet is our proposed dataset for few-shot classification. Like miniImagenet, it is a
subset of ILSVRC-12. However, tieredImageNet represents a larger subset of ILSVRC-12 (608
classes rather than 100 for miniImageNet). Analogous to Omniglot, in which characters are grouped
into alphabets, tieredImageNet groups classes into broader categories corresponding to higher-level
nodes in the ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009) hierarchy. There are 34 categories in total, with each
category containing between 10 and 30 classes. These are split into 20 training, 6 validation and 8
testing categories (details of the dataset can be found in the supplementary material). This ensures
that all of the training classes are sufficiently distinct from the testing classes, unlike miniImageNet
and other alternatives such as randImageNet proposed by Vinyals et al. (2016). For example, “pipe
organ” is a training class and “electric guitar” is a test class in the Ravi & Larochelle (2017) split
of miniImagenet, even though they are both musical instruments. This scenario would not occur in
tieredImageNet since “musical instrument” is a high-level category and as such is not split between
training and test classes. This represents a more realistic few-shot learning scenario since in general
we cannot assume that test classes will be similar to those seen in training. Additionally, the tiered
structure of tieredImageNet may be useful for few-shot learning approaches that can take advantage
of hierarchical relationships between classes. We leave such interesting extensions for future work.

5.2	Adapting the Datasets for Semi-Supervised Learning
For each dataset, we first create an additional split to separate the images of each class into disjoint
labeled and unlabeled sets. For Omniglot and tieredImageNet we sample 10% of the images of
each class to form the labeled split. The remaining 90% can only be used in the unlabeled portion
of episodes. For miniImageNet we use 40% of the data for the labeled split and the remaining
60% for the unlabeled, since we noticed that 10% was too small to achieve reasonable performance
and avoid overfitting. We report the average classification scores over 10 random splits of labeled
and unlabeled portions of the training set, with uncertainty computed in standard error (standard
deviation divided by the square root of the total number of splits).
We would like to emphasize that due to this labeled/unlabeled split, we are using strictly less label
information than in the previously-published work on these datasets. Because of this, we do not
expect our results to match the published numbers, which should instead be interpreted as an upper-
bound for the performance of the semi-supervised models defined in this work.
Episode construction then is performed as follows. For a given dataset, we create a training episode
by first sampling N classes uniformly at random from the set of training classes Ctrain . We then
sample K images from the labeled split of each of these classes to form the support set, and M
images from the unlabeled split of each of these classes to form the unlabeled set. Optionally,
when including distractors, we additionally sample H other classes from the set of training classes
and M images from the unlabeled split of each to act as the distractors. These distractor images
are added to the unlabeled set along with the unlabeled images of the N classes of interest (for a
total of MN + MH unlabeled images). The query portion of the episode is comprised of a fixed
number of images from the labeled split of each of the N chosen classes. Test episodes are created
analogously, but with the N classes (and optionally the H distractor classes) sampled from Ctest .
In the experiments reported here we used H = N = 5, i.e. 5 classes for both the labeled classes
and the distractor classes. We used M = 5 for training and M = 20 for testing in most cases,
thus measuring the ability of the models to generalize to a larger unlabeled set size. Details of the
dataset splits, including the specific classes assigned to train/validation/test sets, can be found in
Appendices A and B.
In each dataset we compare our three semi-supervised models with two baselines. The first baseline,
referred to as “Supervised” in our tables, is an ordinary Prototypical Network that is trained in a
purely supervised way on the labeled split of each dataset. The second baseline, referred to as
“Semi-Supervised Inference”, uses the embedding function learned by this supervised Prototypical
Network, but performs semi-supervised refinement of the prototypes at test time using a step of Soft
k-Means refinement. This is to be contrasted with our semi-supervised models that perform this
refinement both at training time and at test time, therefore learning a different embedding function.
We evaluate each model in two settings: one where all unlabeled examples belong to the classes of
interest, and a more challenging one that includes distractors. Details of the model hyperparameters
can be found in Appendix D and our online repository.3

different values for M (number of items in the unlabeled set per class). Additional results comparing
the ProtoNet model to various baselines on these datasets, and analysis of the performance of the
Masked Soft k-Means model can be found in Appendix C.
Across all three benchmarks, at least one of our proposed models outperforms the baselines,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our semi-supervised meta-learning procedure. In the non-
distractor settings, all three proposed models outperform the baselines in almost all the experiments,
without a clear winner between the three models across the datasets and shot numbers. In the
scenario where training and testing includes distractors, Masked Soft k-Means shows the most
robust performance across all three datasets, attaining the best results in each case but one. In
fact this model reaches performance that is close to the upper bound based on the results without
distractors.
From Figure 4, we observe clear improvements in test accuracy when the number of items in the
unlabeled set per class grows from 0 to 25. These models were trained with M = 5 and thus are
showing an ability to extrapolate in generalization. This confirms that, through meta-training, the
models learn to acquire a better representation that is improved by semi-supervised refinement.
6	Conclusion
In this work, we propose a novel semi-supervised few-shot learning paradigm, where an unlabeled
set is added to each episode. We also extend the setup to more realistic situations where the unlabeled
set has novel classes distinct from the labeled classes. To address the problem that current few-
shot classification datasets are too small for a labeled vs. unlabeled split and also lack hierarchical
levels of labels, we introduce a new dataset, tieredImageNet. We propose several novel extensions
of Prototypical Networks, and they show consistent improvements under semi-supervised settings
compared to our baselines. As future work, we are working on incorporating fast weights (Ba
et al., 2016; Finn et al., 2017) into our framework so that examples can have different embedding
representations given the contents in the episode.

B tieredIMAGENET DATASET DETAILS
Each high-level category in tieredImageNet contains between 10 and 30 ILSVRC-12 classes (17.8
on average). In the ImageNet hierarchy, some classes have multiple parent nodes. Therefore, classes
belonging to more than one category were removed from the dataset to ensure separation between
training and test categories. Test categories were chosen to reflect various levels of separation
between training and test classes. Some test categories (such as “working dog”) are fairly similar to
training categories, whereas others (such as “geological formation”) are quite different. The list of
categories is shown below and statistics of the dataset can be found in Table 4. A visualization of
the categories according to the ImageNet hierarchy is shown in Figure 5. The full list of classes per
category will also be made public, however for the sake of brevity we do not include it here.

from the pixel space or use a CNN to extract features. “rnd” denotes using a randomly initialized CNN, and
“pre” denotes using a CNN that is pretrained for supervised classification for all training classes.
C Extra Experimental Results
C.1 Few-shot classification baselines
We provide baseline results on few-shot classification using 1-nearest neighbor and logistic
regression with either pixel inputs or CNN features. Compared with the baselines, Regular ProtoNet
performs significantly better on all three few-shot classification datasets.
C.2 Number of unlabeled items
Figure 6 shows test accuracy values with different number of unlabeled items during test time.
Figure 7 shows our mask output value distribution of the Masked Soft k-Means model on Omniglot.
The mask values have a bi-modal distribution, corresponding to distractor and non-distractor items.
D Hyperparameter Details
For Omniglot, we adopted the best hyperparameter settings found for ordinary Prototypical
Networks in Snell et al. (2017). In these settings, the learning rate was set to 1e-3, and cut in half
every 2K updates starting at update 2K. We trained for a total of 20K updates. For miniImagenet and
tieredImageNet, we trained with a starting learning rate of 1e-3, which we also decayed. We started
the decay after 25K updates, and every 25K updates thereafter we cut it in half. We trained for a
total of 200K updates. We used ADAM (Kingma & Ba, 2014) for the optimization of our models.
For the MLP used in the Masked Soft k-Means model, we use a single hidden layer with 20 hidden
units with a tanh non-linearity for all 3 datasets. We did not tune the hyparameters of this MLP so
better performance may be attained with a more rigorous hyperparameter search.
