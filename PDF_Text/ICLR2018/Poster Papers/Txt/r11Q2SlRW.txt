We present a real-time method for synthesizing highly complex human motions
using a novel training regime we call the auto-conditioned Recurrent Neural Net-
work (acRNN). Recently, researchers have attempted to synthesize new motion
by using autoregressive techniques, but existing methods tend to freeze or diverge
after a couple of seconds due to an accumulation of errors that are fed back into
the network. Furthermore, such methods have only been shown to be reliable for
relatively simple human motions, such as walking or running. In contrast, our
approach can synthesize arbitrary motions with highly complex styles, including
dances or martial arts in addition to locomotion. The acRNN is able to accomplish
this by explicitly accommodating for autoregressive noise accumulation during
training. Our work is the first to our knowledge that demonstrates the ability to
generate over 18,000 continuous frames (300 seconds) of new complex human
motion w.r.t. different styles.
1	Introduction
The synthesis of realistic human motion has recently seen increased interest (Holden et al., 2016;
2017; Fragkiadaki et al., 2015; Jain et al., 2016; Butepage et al., 2017; Martinez et al., 2017) with
applications beyond animation and video games. The simulation of human looking virtual agents
is likely to become mainstream with the dramatic advancement of Artificial Intelligence and the
democratization of Virtual Reality. A challenge for human motion synthesis is to automatically
generate new variations of motions while preserving a certain style, e.g., generating large numbers of
different Bollywood dances for hundreds of characters in an animated scene of an Indian party. Aided
by the availability of large human-motion capture databases, many database-driven frameworks have
been employed to this end, including motion graphs (Kovar et al., 2002; Safonova & Hodgins, 2007;
Min & Chai, 2012), as well as linear (Safonova et al., 2004; Chai & Hodgins, 2005; Tautges et al.,
2011) and kernel methods (Mukai, 2011; Park et al., 2002; Levine et al., 2012; Grochow et al., 2004;
Moeslund et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2008), which blend key-frame motions from a database. It is hard
for these methods, however, to add new variations to existing motions in the database while keeping
the style consistent. This is especially true for motions with a complex style such as dancing and
martial arts. More recently, with the rapid development in deep learning, people have started to use
neural networks to accomplish this task (Holden et al., 2017; 2016; 2015). These works have shown
promising results, demonstrating the ability of using high-level parameters (such as a walking-path)
to synthesize locomotion tasks such as jumping, running, walking, balancing, etc. These networks do
not generate new variations of complex motion, however, being instead limited to specific use cases.

In contrast, our paper provides a robust framework that can synthesize highly complex human motion
variations of arbitrary styles, such as dancing and martial arts, without querying a database. We
achieve this by using a novel deep auto-conditioned RNN (acRNN) network architecture.
Recurrent neural networks are autoregressive deep learning frameworks which seek to predict
sequences of data similar to a training distribution. Such a framework is intuitive to apply to human
motion, which can be naturally modeled as a time series of skeletal joint positions. We are not the
first to leverage RNNs for this task (Fragkiadaki et al., 2015; Jain et al., 2016; Butepage et al., 2017;
Martinez et al., 2017), and these works produce reasonably realistic output at a number of tasks such
as sitting, talking, smoking, etc. However, these existing methods also have a critical drawback: the
motion becomes unrealistic within a couple of seconds and is unable to recover.
This issue is commonly attributed to error accumulation due to feeding network output back into
itself (Holden et al., 2017). This is reasonable, as the network during training is given ground-truth
input sequences to condition its subsequent guess, but at run time, must condition this guess on its
own output. As the output distribution of the network will not be identical to that of the ground-truth,
it is in effect encountering a new situation at test-time. The acRNN structure compensates for this
by linking the network’s own predicted output into its future input streams during training, a similar
approach to the technique proposed in (Bengio et al., 2015). Our method is light-weight and can
be used in conjunction with any other RNN based learning scheme. Though straightforward, this
technique fixes the issue of error accumulation, and allows the network to output incredibly long
sequences without failure, on the order of hundreds of seconds (see Figure 5). Though we are yet
as unable to prove the permanent stability of this structure, it seems empirically that motion can be
generated without end. In summary, we present a new RNN training method capable for the first time
of synthesizing potentially indefinitely long sequences of realistic and complex human motions with
respect to different styles.
2	Related Work
Many approaches have developed over the years in order to generate realistic human motion. In this
section, we first review the literature that has dealt with motion synthesis using simulation methods
and database-driven methods, then review the more recent deep learning approaches.
Simulation-based Methods. Simulation-based techniques are able to produce physically plausible
animations (Geijtenbeek & Pronost, 2012; Levine & Popovic, 2012; Clegg et al., 2015; Hamalainen
et al., 2015; Ha et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2016), including realistic balancing, motion on terrain of
various heights, and recovery from falling. Many of these methods consider physical constraints on
the human skeleton while optimizing an motion objective. For example, in the work of Levine et
al. (Levine & Popovic, 2012), one task they employ is moving the skeleton in a certain direction
without falling over. Similarly, in Ha et al. (Ha et al., 2012), given initial fall conditions, they seek to
minimize joint stress due to landing impact while ensuring a desired landing pose. Though the output
is plausible, they require specific objectives and constraints for each individual task; it is infeasible to
apply such explicit priors to highly stylized and varied motion such as dancing or martial arts. There
are also some recent works (Peng et al., 2017; Merel et al., 2017) which attempt to use less rigid
objectives, instead employing adversarial and reinforcement learning. However, these motions often
look uncanny and not human-like.
Database-driven Methods. Motion graphs (Kovar et al., 2002; Safonova & Hodgins, 2007; Min &
Chai, 2012), which stitch transitions into segments queried from a database, can generate locomotion
along arbitrary paths, but are in essence limited to producing memorized sequences. Frameworks
based on linear (Safonova et al., 2004; Chai & Hodgins, 2005; Tautges et al., 2011) and kernal
methods (Mukai, 2011; Park et al., 2002; Levine et al., 2012; Grochow et al., 2004; Moeslund et al.,
2006; Wang et al., 2008) have also shown reasonable success. Taylor et al. (Taylor & Hinton, 2009)
use conditional restricted boltzmann machines to model motion styles. Grochow et al. (Grochow
et al., 2004) and Wang et al. (Wang et al., 2005) both use Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models
(GPLVM) to control motion. Levine et al. (Levine et al., 2012) apply reinforcement learning in
a reduced space to compute optimal motions for a variety of motion tasks, including movement,
punching, and kicking. Kee et al. (Lee et al., 2010) use a representation of motion data called
motion-fields which allows users to interactively control movement of a character. The work of Xia
2
Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2018
et al. (Xia et al., 2015) is able to achieve real-time style transfers of unlabeled motion. Taylor et
al. (Taylor et al., 2007) use binary latent variables which are connected between different time steps
while Liu et al. (Liu et al., 2005) estimate physical parameters from motion capture data. Database
methods have limitations in synthesizing new variations of motion, in addition to the high memory
costs for storing complex motions.
Deep Learning Approaches. The use of recurrent networks is a natural approach to dealing with
the problem of human motion. RNNs are trained to generate output sequentially, each output condi-
tioned on the previous elements in the sequence. These networks have shown much success in Natural
Language Processing for generating text (Sutskever et al., 2011), hand written characters (Graves,
2013; Gregor et al., 2015), and even captioning images (Vinyals et al., 2014). For the purpose of
motion prediction and generation, Fragkiadaki et al. (Fragkiadaki et al., 2015) propose to use encoder-
recurrent-decoder (ERD), jointly learning a skeleton embedding along with sequential information,
in order to make body positions more realistic. In Jain et al. (Jain et al., 2016), the authors employ
RNNs to learn spatio-temporal graphs of interaction, a structure which naturally applies to the human
skeleton over time-joint positions are related over consecutive frames, andjoints also interact with
each other spatially (arms and legs interact with each other, the spine interacts with all other joints).
Butepage et al. (Butepage et al., 2017) attempt to learn dance sequentially, but they are unable to
produce varied and realistic output. More recently, Martinez et al. (Martinez et al., 2017) propose
using a sequence-to-sequence architecture along with sampling-based loss. A main problem with
these approaches, even in the case of the ERD, is that motion generation tends to converge to a
mean position over time. Using our proposed training method, motion neither halts nor becomes
unrecognizable for any period of time.
Holden et al. (Holden et al., 2015) demonstrate that a manifold of human motion can be learned
using an autoencoder trained on the CMU dataset. They (Holden et al., 2016) extend this work by
using this deep convolutional auto-encoder, in addition to a disambiguation network, in order to
produce realistic walking motion along a user-defined path. They are also able to use the embedding
space of the encoder to perform style transfer across different walks. Using the same autoencoder
and a different disambiguation network, they can also perform other user defined tasks such as
punching and kicking. Their method does not use an RNN structure and so it can only generate fixed
length sequences based on the architecture of the disambiguation network. More recently, Holden et
al. (Holden et al., 2017) use a Phase-Functioned Neural Network which takes the geometry of the
scene into account to produce motion along a user-defined path. This method makes use of humans’
periodic change of gait to synthesize realistic walking motion but has not demonstrated the ability to
generate motions that have more complex step movements.

Auto-Conditioned RNN. Recurrent neural networks are well documented in the literature. A
good survey and introduction can be found at (Karpathy, 2015; Olah, 2015). In short, a recurrent
network can be represented as a function with a hidden memory unit, xt+1 = f (xt , mt), where mt
is the "memory" of the network, and is updated during every forward pass, and initialized at 0. The
motivation is that the memory stores important information about a sequence up until that point,
which can help with the prediction of the next element. In the experiments that follow, we use a
3

special type of RNN called an "LSTM", or a "long short term memory" network. We refer to the
network trained with our method as "acLSTM".
As mentioned in the introduction, the major drawback of using LSTM/RNN deep learning methods
for motion prediction is the problem of error accumulation. Following the conventional way to train
an RNN, the network is recursively given a sequence of ground truth motion data, G1,k = [g1, ..., gk],
and asked to produce the output G2,k+1 [g2, ..., gk+1]. Specifically, at training time, the recursive
module at time step t, Mt, is conditioned on the input [g1, ..., gt-1], and the error is measured between
its output and gt. Because of this, the backpropogation algorithm (Williams & Zipser, 1995) used for
updating the parameters will always optimize w.r.t. the input ground-truth sequences [g1, ..., gt-1].
The parameters are accustomed to ground truth input — something it does not have access to at
test-time. It is easy to see why problems will emerge: even if initial input is similar to ground truth,
those slight differences will accumulate as the output is fed back in, producing output that become
progressively worse until the sequence diverges or freezes. Effectively, the network is encountering
a completely novel situation during test time as compared to training time, and so cannot perform
well. The issue is so prevalent, in fact, that previous methods fail to produce realistic output after just
several seconds (Fragkiadaki et al., 2015; Jain et al., 2016; Martinez et al., 2017).
Holden et al. (Holden et al., 2015) show that an autoencoder framework can to some degree "fix"
such broken input, and some researchers have tried jointly learning such an encoder-decoder network
alongside RNNs to better condition subsequent input (Gregor et al., 2015; Fragkiadaki et al., 2015).
However, in the case of this framework being applied to motion as in ERD (Fragkiadaki et al., 2015),
it does not generalize to indefinitely long sequences, as shown in (Jain et al., 2016). It seems as
though the autoencoder might mitigate error accumulation, but does not eliminate it.
The acRNN, on the other hand, deals with poor network output explicitly by using it during training.
Instead of only feeding in ground-truth instances, we use subsequences of the network’s own outputs
at periodic intervals. For instance, sticking with the example above, instead of conditioning the
network on Gι,k = [gι,...,gk],weuse Gι,k = [gι, ...,gu,pu+ι, ...,Pu+v,gu+v+ι..,gk] to predict
G2,k+1 = [g2, ..., gk+1]. The variable pu+1 is the network output conditioned on [g1, ..., gu], and
pu+2 is conditioned on [g1, ..., gu,pu+1]. In this example, we refer to v as the "condition length" andu
as the "ground-truth length". As the network is conditioned on its own output during training, it is able
to deal with such input during synthesis. Figure 1 details an unrolled Auto-Conditioned RNN with
condition length u = v = 4, and Figure 10 shows a more detailed view or our network. The method
of (Bengio et al., 2015) also proposes using network output during training, but does so stochastically,
without fixing condition lengths. However, we found that changing the condition/ground-truth length
while keeping the proportion of ground-truth input fixed affects both the accuracy and variation of
the output. See Figure 9 in the appendix.
Auto-conditioning also has the interpretation of training the network to produce longer sequences
without further input. Whereas with standard training the network error is measured only against
pu+1 when conditioned with [g1, ..., gu], under auto-conditioning the error is computed on the entire
sequence pu+1, ..., pu+v w.r.t. the same input. This effectively forces the network to produce v
frames of output simultaneously as opposed to only one. Martinez et al. (Martinez et al., 2017) also
use contiguous sequences of network output during training, but unlike us they do not alternate these
with ground-truth input at regular intervals.
Data Representation. We use the publicly available CMU motion-capture dataset for our exper-
iments. The dataset is given as sequences of 57 skeleton joint positions in 3D-space. First, we
define a root joint, whose position at time t is given by rt = (r1,t, r2,t, r3,t). In order to better
capture relative motion, we instead use the displacement of the root from the previous frame for input
—A, = (rι,t - r1,t-1 ,r2,t - r2,t-1,r3,t - r3,t-1). For every other joint at time t, with position
jt = (j1,t, j2,t, j3,t), we represent it as as the relative distance in the world-coordinate system to
the root joint, jt = (jι,t - rι,t, j2,t - r2,t, j3,t - r3,t). All distances are stored in meters. We use a
skeleton with height 1.54 meters in neutral pose for all experiments.
We found this representation to be desirable for several reasons. Primarily, if there is periodic motion
in the dataset, we would like frames at the same point in the repeated activity to have small Euclidean
distance. If we instead used absolute positions, even if it were only for the hip, this would certainly
not be the case. We note that there are alternative representations which achieve the same property.
(Fragkiadaki et al., 2015) express joint positions as rotations relative to a parent joint, and (Holden
4
Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2018
et al., 2016) define them in the body’s relative coordinate system along with a relative rotation of the
body w.r.t. the previous frame.
Training. We train the acLSTM with three fully connected layers with a memory size of 1024,
similar to (Fragkiadaki et al., 2015; Jain et al., 2016; Butepage et al., 2017). The main difference
is that for every u ground-truth inputs of the time series, we connect v instances of the network’s
own output into its subsequent input streams (see section 2.1). In the main body of the paper, we set
u = v = 5. We carry out further experiments with varying u and v in the appendix. We train with a
sequence length of 100 for 500000 iterations using the ADAM backpropogation algorithm (Kingma
& Ba, 2014) on an NVIDIA 1080 GPU for each dataset we experiment on. We use Euclidean loss for
our objective function. The initial learning rate is is set to 0.0001. We implement the training using
the python caffe framework (Jia et al., 2014). We sample sequences at multiple frame-rates as well as
rotate the sequence randomly in order to increase the training size.
In detail, if at time t we input the network H with ground truth, then the loss is given by:
L(xt) = ||H(xt, mt) - xt+1||22	(1)
where xt and xt+1 are the ground truth motions for time steps t and t + 1.
If at time t the network is input with its own previous output, the loss is given by:
L(Xt) = UH(Xtk,mt) - xt+1∣∣2	(2)
where Xtk = H(H(…H(xt-k, mt-k), mt-ι), mt). k indicates how many times the network has fed
itself is its own input since the last injection of ground-truth. It is bounded by the condition length
(see previous section).
4	Experimental Results
We evaluate our synthesized motion results on different networks trained on each of four distinct
subsets from the CMU motion capture database: martial arts, Indian dance, Indian/salsa hybrid, and
walking. An anonymous video of the results can be found here: https://youtu.be/FunMxjmDIQM.
Quantitative Results. Table 1 shows the prediction error as Euclidean distance from the ground
truth for different motion styles at various time frames.
We compare with a 3-layer LSTM (LSTM-3LR), ERD (Fragkiadaki et al., 2015), the seq2seq
framework of (Martinez et al., 2017) as well as scheduled sampling (Bengio et al., 2015). Though our
goal is long-term stable synthesis and not prediction, it can be seen in Table 1 that acLSTM performs
reasonably well in this regard, even achieving the best performance at most time-scales for the Indian
dance category. The method of (Martinez et al., 2017) performs the best in the short term, but has the
worst error by far past the half-second mark. As noted in (Fragkiadaki et al., 2015), the stochasticity
of human motion makes longer-term prediction infeasible. Table 2 in the appendix shows this error
difference between versions of the Indian dance network trained with different condition lengths.
Figure 2 shows the average change between subsequent frames for different frame times for the
acLSTM and the basic scheme. For the more complex motions of Martial Arts and Indian Dance, it
is clear from the graph that acLSTM continues producing motion in the long-term while the basic
training scheme (LSTM-3LR) without auto-conditioning results in stagnated motion, as the network
freezes into a converged mean position. Likewise, Figure 9 in the appendix shows this average change
for the Indian dance network trained with different condition lengths. We note that while the methods
of (Fragkiadaki et al., 2015; Martinez et al., 2017) do not simply freeze completely, as with the basic
scheme, their motion becomes unrealistic at around the same time (Figure 7). This is consistent with
the observations of the original authors.
Qualitative Results. Figure 4 shows several example frames taken from 50 second synthesized
outputs, representing both the extended long term complexity and plausibility of the output. In
comparison, our implementations of ERD, and seq2seq are only able to generate motion for a couple

are generated with 10 frames (approximately 170 ms) of seed motion from test set. Results are averaged over 20
random seed motions. Low value in motion change indicates the freezing of motion. Note that acLSTM and
vanilla have exactly the same architecture - differences are due solely to training. Results averaged over 20 seed

of seconds before they become unrealistic (Figure 7). Scheduled sampling (Bengio et al., 2015)
performs better than ERD and seq2seq, but also freezes eventually, perhaps because it does not force
the network to generate consistently longer sequences during training as our method does. We also
demonstrate the possibility of creating hybrid motions by mixing training sets in third row of Figure
4.
It should be noted that the motion in our framework, while never permanently failing, also does
not remain perfectly realistic, and short-term freezing does sometimes occur. This, however, does
not occur for the network trained just on walking. It is perhaps that the movement of the feet in
conjunction with the absolute movement of the root joint is not as easy to discern when the feet leave
the ground aperiodically, or there are jumping motions.

Figure 4: Motion sequences generated by acLSTM, sampled at various frames. Motion style from top to bottom:
martial arts, Indian dancing, Indian/salsa hybrid and walking. All the motions are generated at 60 fps, and are
initialized with 10 frames of ground truth data randomly picked up from the database. The number at the bottom
of each image is the frame index. The images are rendered with BVHViewer 1.1 (van Basten, 2017)
When motion does stagnate, it recovers relatively quickly, and the motion never diverges or freezes
completely (see Figure 6). The short-term freezing could possibly be explained by "dead-times" in the
training sequence, where the actor is beginning or ending a sequence which involves a rest position.
Note that when training with two different datasets, as in the case of the Indian/Salsa combined
network, motion borrows from both dance styles. We also demonstrate in Figure 5 that our method
does not freeze even after 20,000 frames of synthesis, which is approximately 333 seconds of output.

One can see a qualitative comparison of acLSTM with a basic LSTM-3LR in Figure 3, both trained
on the Indian dance dataset. We find the performance of the vanilla network to be consistent with the
results reported in (Fragkiadaki et al., 2015; Jain et al., 2016; BUtePage et al., 2017; MartineZ et al.,
2017), freezing at around 1000 ms. It never recovers from the motion. Our network, on the other
hand, continues producing varied motion for the same time frame.
5	Discussion and Future Work
We have shown the effectiveness of the acLSTM architecture to produce extended sequences of
complex human motion. We believe our work demonstrates qualitative state-of-the-art results in
motion generation, as all previous work has focused on synthesiZing relatively simple human motion
for extremely short time periods. These works demonstrate motion generation up to a couple of
seconds at most while acLSTM does not fail even after over 300 seconds. Though we are as of yet
unable to prove indefinite stability, it seems empirically that acLSTM can generate arbitrarily long
sequences. Current problems that exist include choppy motion at times, self-collision of the skeleton,
and unrealistic sliding of the feet. Further developement of GAN methods, such as (Lamb et al.,
2016), could result in increased realism, though these models are notoriously hard to train as they
often result in mode collapse. Combining our technique with physically based simulation to ensure
realism after synthesis is also a potential next step. Finally, it is important to study the effects of using
various condition lengths during training. We begin the exploration of this topic in the appendix, but
further analysis is needed.

C-Iength=W ----------------- c-length=2
Figure 9: Motion change between subsequent frames using different condition lengths, given as Euclidean
distance in prediction results, at different frames. Predictions are initialized with 10 frames (approximately 170
ms) of seed motion from test set. Results are averaged over 20 random seed motions. All networks are trained
on the Indian dance dataset.

B Prediction Error
It seems that Table 2 and Figure 9 might imply some sort of trade off between motion change over
time and short-term motion prediction error when training with different condition lengths. However,
it is also possible that limiting motion magnitude on this particular dataset might correspond to lower
error. Further experiments of various condition lengths on several motion styles need to be conducted
to say anything meaningful about the effect.
