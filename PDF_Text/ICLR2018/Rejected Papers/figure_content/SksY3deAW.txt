Figure 1: The architecture ofa residual network (ResNet).
Figure 2: Comparison of BoostResNet (ours, blue) and e2eBP (baseline, red) on multilayer percep-tron residual network on MNIST dataset.
Figure 3: Convergence performance comparison between e2eBP and BoostResNet on the SVHNand CIFAR-10 dataset. The vertical dotted line shows when BoostResNet training stopped, and Webegan refining the network with standard e2eBP training.
Figure 4: Visualization of required larger than 0 edge Yt and edge for each residual block Î³t. Thex-axis represents depth, and the y-axis represents Yt or Yt values. The plots are for a convolutionalnetwork composed of 50 residual blocks and trained on the SVHN dataset.
Figure 5: Convergence of e2eBP (baseline) on multilayer perceptron residual network (of variousdepths) on MNIST dataset.
