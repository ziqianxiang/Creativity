Figure 1: Training pipeline. Given an input image x, we extract a segmentation candidate y andintermediate feature maps h by applying a pre-trained segmentation network. We add some noiseto y and train a DAE that takes as input both y and h by minimizing Eq. 3. Training scenario1 (a) yields the best results and uses the corrupted prediction as input to the DAE during training.
Figure 2: Test pipeline. Given an input image x, we extract a segmentation candidate y and inter-mediate feature maps h by applying a pre-trained segmentation network. We then feed x and h tothe trained DAE and iteratively refine y by applying Eq. 4. The final prediction is the last value ofy computed in this way.

Figure 4: Results at inference time. X-axis denotes number of iteration and Y-axis is the Intersectionover Union (IoU). The plots were obtained on Camvidâ€™s validation set.
