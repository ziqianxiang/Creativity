Figure 1: Scheme of DS-AAE Each distribution is mapped into a reproducing kernel Hilbert spacevia an expectation operation. The generator strategy is to adjust the parameter of encoder θ to decreasethe distance between the blue and red dot while adversary’s is to adjust α to increase the distance.

The key difference between ζ(.) and ξ(.) is that ζ(.) could falloutside of the RKHS but ξ(.) is always in RKHS. This is due to the term φw (.) not being in RKHS.
