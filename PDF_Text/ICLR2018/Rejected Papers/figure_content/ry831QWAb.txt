Figure 1: The training and testing objective curves on MNIST dataset with multi layer perceptron.
Figure 2: The training and testing curves on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets with Resnet-110.
Figure 3: The training and testing objective curves on Penn Tree Bank dataset with LSTM recurrentneural networks. The first row is the training objective while the second is the testing. From left toright, the training sequence (BPTT) length are respectively 40, 400 and 1000. Dropout with 0.5 isimposed.
