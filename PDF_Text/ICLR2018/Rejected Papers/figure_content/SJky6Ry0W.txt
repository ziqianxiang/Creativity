Figure 1: We show how a transformedexample, here a noisy digit, is processedby a competition of experts. Only Expert3 is specializing on denoising, it wins theexample and gets trained on it, whereasthe others perform translations and arenot updated.
Figure 3: The proportion of data won by each expert for each transformation on the digits from thetest set.
Figure 4: Accuracy on thetransformed test digits DQof a pretrained CNN MNISTclassifier, on the same digitsafter going through our model,and on the original digits be-fore transformation DP (hereDP corresponds to the groundtruth images in DQ for the trueapplied mechanisms).
Figure 5: Each column shows how each expert transforms the input presented on top. We arrange thetasks such that on the diagonal there is the highest scoring expert for the input given at the top of thecolumn. It is evident that the experts have learned the mechanisms, as they consistently apply them todigits outside of their training domain.
Figure 6: Each line style is associated to the score that an expert obtains on the discriminator whenbeing fed transformed digits using one of the mechanisms. Each expert learns to specialize on adifferent mechanism. Each curve is smoothed with an average of the last 50 iterations for ease ofvisualization.
Figure 7: The proportion of data won by each expert for each transformation on the digits from thetest set, for the case of 10 mechanisms and more experts (16 on left) or too few (6 on the right).
