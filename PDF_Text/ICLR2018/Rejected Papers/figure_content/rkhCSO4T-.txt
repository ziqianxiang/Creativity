Figure 1: The distributed non-parametric deep and wide network framework: Each pillar rep-resents either a single ultra-deep neural network or other feature tensors that can be learnt automati-cally from the input data. For action recognition, we factorize the static (RGB), and dynamic (opticflow) features using a ResNet and an Inception Network. Using the features of the last layer, we trainseven Gaussian Processes for each of the network, which is combined under a Product-of-Experts(PoE) formalism. This hierarchy is then fused again to give us a prediction of action types.
