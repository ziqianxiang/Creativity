Figure 1: Simplified architecture of the model. Rectangles denote fully connected layers (1 Ã— 1convolutions) or MLPs, trapezes denote convolutional neural networks, circles denote recurrentneural networks.
Figure 2: Plots show unit counts of the specified type per map cell (darker dots correspond to highercounts). Top row of each plot shows model inputs (i.e. observed units), middle row shows modelpredicted unit distributions and bottom row shows real unit distributions. In the left two plots, weobserve that our model sees only a few opponent units, and tries to predict the location of their armyunder the for of war, in places it had not seen units before. In the right two plots, we observe ourmodel remembering the locations of the opponent base and army.
