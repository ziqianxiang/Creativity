Figure 1: Model ArchitectureSFO NYC 枷r11∣→∣ Jun19	Price <S6∞2.1	Training with Supervised DataWhen dialogue utterance U is present, we can train a supervised model for both the service agentand the customer agent. These models will be trained along with their hidden information, namelyuser restrictions R, database K along with the optimal action state A.

To limit the amount ofdatabase data to be generated for each sample, we only generate 30 candidate flights for each dia-logue. Both user restrictions and database are generated according to a preset prior. For example,
