Figure 1: GraphGAN is able to generate a sibling graph to the CITESEER network. (a) and (b)visualize a subset of nodes selected from the complete graphs. The graphs show similar structurebut are not identical. (c) shows that the degree distributions of the input graph as well as the graphsgenerated by GraphGAN and the degree-corrected stochastic blockmodel are very similar.

Figure 5: (a) Node classification performance on CORA-ML, and (b) t-SNE visualization of Wup,where the color indicates the ground truth communities.
Figure 6: Properties of the random walks as well as the graphs sampled from the 20 × 20 bins. 6aand 6b show properties of the random walks, 6c and 6d show properties of the generated graphs.
Figure 7: Community distributions (see appendix for definition) when sampling random walks onsubsets of the latent space z. (a) shows complete community histograms on a 10 × 10 grid. (b) and(c) show exemplary trajectories in latent space. (Ω) is the community distribution when samplingfrom the entire latent space, and (*) is the community distribution of the Cora-ML network.
