Figure 6:	Verification on the distribution of decrease of objective valuematrix method and diagonal method respectively. The Figure 7b demonstrates different trainingloss per epoch for two different methods. From the figures we can see that the trend of batch sizechange for two methods are almost the same, therefore they perform equally well on the trainingloss descent. This indicates estimating the covariance matrix by its diagonal matrix will not causedegradation to the performance of BA-Momentum.
