Figure 1: Our 3-step approach represents graphs as “images” suitable to be passed to vanilla 2D CNNs. Steps1 & 2: graph node embeddings and compression with PCA Step 3: computation and stacking of the 2Dhistograms.
Figure 2: Node embeddings and image representation of graph ID #10001 (577 nodes, 1320 edges) from theREDDIT-12K dataset.
Figure 3: 2D CNN architecture used in our experiments. The number within parentheses refer to the outputdimensions of the tensors.
