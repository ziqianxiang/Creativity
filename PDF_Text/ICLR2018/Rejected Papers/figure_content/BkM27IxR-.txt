Figure 1: Comparison of the various hand-engineered and learned algorithms on training neural netswith 48 input and hidden units on (a) TFD, (b) CIFAR-10 and (c) CIFAR-100 with mini-batches ofsize 64. The vertical axis is the true objective value and the horizontal axis represents the iteration.
Figure 2: Comparison of the various hand-engineered and learned algorithms on training neural netswith 100 input units and 200 hidden units on (a) TFD, (b) CIFAR-10 and (c) CIFAR-100 with mini-batches of size 64. The vertical axis is the true objective value and the horizontal axis represents theiteration. Best viewed in colour.
