Figure 1: Climate and traffic time se-ries per location. The time-series ex-hibits long-term temporal correlations,and can be viewed as a realization ofhighly nonlinear dynamics.
Figure 2: Tensor-train recurrent cells within a seq2seq model.
Figure 3: Tensor-train cellwith factorized hidden statesusing tensor-train model.
Figure 4: Data visualizations: (a) Genz dynamics, (b) traffic data, (c) climate data.
Figure 5: Forecasting RMSE for Genz dynamics and real world traffic, climate time series for vary-ing forecasting horizon for LSTM, MLSTM, and TLSTM.
Figure 6: Model prediction for three realizations with different intiial conditions for Genz dynamics“product peak”. Top (blue): ground truth. Bottom: model predictions for LSTM (green) and TL-STM (red). TLSTM perfectly captures the Genz oscillations, whereas the LSTM fails to do so (left)or only approaches the ground truth towards the end (middle and right).
Figure 7: Top: 18 hour ahead predictions for hourly traffic time series given 5 hour as input forLSTM, MLSTM and TLSTM. Bottom: 300 days ahead predictions for daily climate time seriesgiven 2 month observations as input for LSTM, MLSTM and TLSTM.
Figure 8: Training speed evaluation: valida-tion loss versus steps for the models with thebest long-term forecasting accuracy.
Figure 9: a Lorenz attraction with dynamics (blue) and sampled data (red). b, c, d ,e TLSTM long-term predictions for different forecasting horizons T versus the ground truth (blue). TLSTM showsconsistent predictions over increasing horizons T .
