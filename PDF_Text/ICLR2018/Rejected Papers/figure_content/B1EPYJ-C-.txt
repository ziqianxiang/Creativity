Figure 1: Structured updates with the CIFAR data for size reduction various modes. Low rankupdates in top row, random mask updates in bottom row.
Figure 2: Comparison of structured random mask updates and sketched updates without quantizationon the CIFAR data.
Figure 3: Comparison of sketched updates, combining preprocessing the updates with rotations,quantization and subsampling on the CIFAR data.
Figure 4: Comparison of sketched updates, training a recurrent model on the Reddit data, randomlysampling 50 clients per round.
Figure 5: Effect of the number of clients used in training per round.
