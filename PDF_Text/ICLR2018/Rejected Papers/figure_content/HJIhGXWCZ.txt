Figure 2: Best loss for different models over varying numbers of different samples.
Figure 3: Generations on Breakout. Left 4 frames are given, right 4 frames are generated. Note thatthe paddle changes location for the different generations. Best viewed with zoom.
Figure 4: Generations on Flappy Bird. Left 4 frames are given, right 4 frames are generated. Notethat the pipe on the right changes height for different generations. Best viewed with zoom.
Figure 5: EEN generations on Robot Task. Left frame is given, right frame is generated.
