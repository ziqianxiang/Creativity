Figure 1: (Color online) The left figure (a) shows the configuration of TTN. The squares at thebottom represent the vectors obtained from the pixels of one image through the feature map. Thesphere at the top represents the label. The right figures are (b) the illustrations of the environmenttensor, (c) the schematic diagram of fidelity and (d) entanglement entropy calculation.
Figure 2: (a) Binary classification accuracy on CIFAR-10 with number of training samples=200; (b)Binary classification accuracy on CIFAR-10 with number of training samples=600; (c) Training andtest accuracy as the function of the dimension of indexes on the MNIST dataset. The number oftraining samples is 1000 for each pair of classes.
Figure 3: Embedding of data instances of CIFAR-10 by t-SNE corresponding to each layer in theTTN: (a) original data distribution and (b) the 1st, (c) 2nd, (d) 3rd, (e) 4th, and (f) 5th layer.
Figure 4: (a) Fidelity Fp0p between each two handwritten digits, which ranges from -0.0032 to 1.
