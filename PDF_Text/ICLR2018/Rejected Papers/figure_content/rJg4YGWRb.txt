Figure 1: Relevance score in Eq. (8) from a neighbor node with column-class to a center nodein row-class. For example the average normalized attention to Agents from HCI is = -0.141 ,largest off-diagonal entry in CiteSeer. The average attention to Probabilistic Methods (PM) fromCase Based (CB) is 0.017, largest off-diagonal entry in Cora.
Figure 2: We show three selected target nodes in the test set that are mistaken by GCN but correctlyclassified by AGNN. We denote this target node by the node with a thick outline (node 8434 fromPubMed on the left, node 1580 from PubMed in the middle, and node 1512 from CiteSeer on theright). We show the strength of attention from a node in the 2-hop neighborhood to the target nodeby the size of the corresponding node. Colors represent the hidden true classes (nodes with the samecolor belong to the same topic). None of the nodes in the figure was in the training set, hence noneof the colors were revealed. Still, we observe that AGNN has managed to put more attention to thosenodes in the same (hidden) classes, allowing the trained model to find the correct labels.
