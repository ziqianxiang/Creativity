Figure 1: Dual pendulum experiments: simulation and hardware setup.
Figure 2: (a) Adversarial training to the same performance for A3C and AR-A3C in simulation,(b) A3C observes a significant drop in cumulative reward when applying adversarial attack whileAR-A3C is not significantly affected by the adversarial attack.
Figure 3: (a) A single actor-critic mechanism. The system is the environment. The protagonist andthe adversary apply their actions to the system and they will get the same state observation and thesame reward from the system, based on which they take the next move. (b) AR-A3C Architecture.
Figure 4: The protagonist and adversary motors in the hardware setup.
Figure 5: Evaluation of the robustness by varying the attached clog weights to the real pendulumhardware.
Figure 6: A clog is attached to the end of the pendulum to vary its weight and rotational inertia. Theelectronic scale shows the weight of the clog.
