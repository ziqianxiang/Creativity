Figure 1: Schematic diagrams of various tensor factorizations of linear layers. a) a general linearlayer, b) its tensor train factorization. The squares represent smaller tensors. Connections representcontractions as indicated in Eq.(1). c) Tree network factorization. d) MERA factorization.
Figure 2: A schematic of the MERA layers of the model. The small rectangles represent linearelements to factorize a general linear layer. White rectangles represent disentanglers. Red rectanglesrepresent tree elements. Solid black lines connecting nodes represent tensor contraction and dashedlines with arrow heads represent the nonlinearities being applied. Dashed lines ending in a circlerepresent fixed outputs.
