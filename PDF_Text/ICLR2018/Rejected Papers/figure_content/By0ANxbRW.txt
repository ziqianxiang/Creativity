Figure 1:	Compression of LeNet-5 using the proposed methodThe loss bound (section 2) controls the final model size, introducing a trade-off between accuracyand compression. We study this trade-off by incrementing the loss bound and optimizing the modelsize using Algorithm 1. In the analysis for each of the benchmark datasets we initialize 256 randomcentroids and depict the results in Figure 2. We can see that for small reductions in size, the accuracyremains generally the same. During this stage, most clusters are quickly eliminated due to beingempty. As the model size becomes small however, the error starts to increase quickly. We alsoobserve clusters being eliminated less often. These eliminations are a result of merging clusters.
