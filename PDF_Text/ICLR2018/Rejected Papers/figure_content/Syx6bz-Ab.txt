Figure 1:	Seq2SQL takes as input a question and the columns of a table. It generates the cor-responding SQL query, which, during training, is executed against a database. The result of theexecution is utilized as the reward to train the reinforcement learning algorithm.
Figure 2:	An example in WikiSQL. The inputs consist of a table and a question. The outputs consistof a ground truth SQl query and the corresponding result from execution.
Figure 3: The Seq2SQL model has three components,corresponding to the three parts of a SQL query (right).
