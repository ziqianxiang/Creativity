Figure 1: (a) Factorial HMM with 2 hidden state layers. (b) An MSHMM with two HMMs where(2)ht is the hidden state sequence of the slower moving HMM with transitions happening at timesteps ∆(2) = 2. The observations Xt are the sum of the emissions of the two HMMs, so Xt =Xt(1) + Xt(-2)1.
Figure 2: Model RMSE for MSHMM normalizedby the RMSE of the oracle. Thus 1 is the absoluteminimum.
