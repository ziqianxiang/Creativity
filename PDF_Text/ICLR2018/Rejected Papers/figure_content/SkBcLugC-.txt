Figure 1: Improvements by ensemble and probabilities of predictions in ILSVRC 2012 validationset. X-axis shows percentile of probability of first local predictions from high (left) to low (right).
Figure 2: Breakdown of samples into four categories based on 1) whether first local prediction iscorrect or incorrect and 2) whether first and second predictions are same or different. X-axis showspercentile of probability of first local predictions from high (left) to low (right). Two networks tendto make same (mis)predictions for samples predicted with a high probability (left).
Figure 3: Prediction accuracy and computation cost with static ensemble and our adaptive ensembleusing different termination conditions.Confidence-level-based condition achieved better accuracythan static-threshold-based conditions with same computation cost especially for CIFAR-10. Tuningof confidence level (CL) is less sensitive than that of static threshold.
