Figure 1: The auxiliary parametric representation of a GPN using virtual observation inducingpoints V? and targets U? .
Figure 2: A GPN feed-forward network prior distribution (a) for three layers and the approximationof its posterior obtained using variational inference and the central limit theorem on the activations(b). Each node corresponds to all samples and GPN units within a layer. Dotted circles representvariational parameters.
