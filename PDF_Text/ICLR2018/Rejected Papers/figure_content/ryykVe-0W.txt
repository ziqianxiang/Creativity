Figure 1: Schematic representation of the entire system for learning non-linear ICA. Specific func-tional shapes can be enforced by choosing a suitable decoder architecture.
Figure 2: The decoder architecture used for the PNL experiments. It can only learn transformationsin which a linear transformation is followed by the application of non-linear scalar functions to eachof the dimensions.
Figure 3: Source signals used in the experiments.
