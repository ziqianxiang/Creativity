Figure 1: (a) Lifetime distributions can have different shapes (thus, a nonparametric approach). Also,distributions can cross each other thus violating the proportional hazards assumption (drawback withLogrank test) (b) KL divergence does not account for the uncertainty in the distributions and can leadto highly imbalanced groups (c) L (= -L) is not a metric. Due to very few samples in group b, La,band Lb,c are very low compared to La,c such that La,c > La,b + Lb,c, hence violating triangleinequality.
Figure 2: (a) End-of-life probability defined by non-decreasing functions of the difference betweenthe time of last observed activity and the time of measurement. Figure depicts two such functions.
Figure 3: Empirical lifetime distributions (calculated using end-of-life signals) of clusters obtainedfrom the proposed neural network approach for different values of K . The figures clearly indicateonly two clusters in the Friendster social network : short-lived and long-lived users.
