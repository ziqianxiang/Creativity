Figure 1: Variation in score of Hopper and Walker2d with different values of M .
Figure 2: Standard deviation and reward with M = 10 for the Pendulum task during training.
Figure 3: Standard deviation and angle during one episode of the Pendulum environment. An angleof Â±180 is the target inverted pose. 0 is hanging downwards.
Figure 4: Performance curves for two environments with and without external exploration noise onDDPG and MAPG: original DDPG with OU process noise (green), DDPG without any explorationnoise (blue), MAPG (M=10) with OU process noise (red) and MAPG (M=10) without OU processnoise (orange).
