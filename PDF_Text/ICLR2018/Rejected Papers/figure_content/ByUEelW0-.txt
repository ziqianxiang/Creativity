Figure 1: RotLSTM diagram. x is the concatenation of ht-1 and xt in the diagram (green and bluelines). Note that this differs from a regular LSTM by the introduction of the network producingangles ut and the rotation module marked U. In the diagram input size is 4 and cell state size is 3.
Figure 2: Model architecture for the bAbI dataset. The RNN is either LSTM or RotLSTM.
Figure 3: Accuracy comparison on training, validation (val) and test sets over 40 epochs for LSTMand RotLSTM models. The models were trained 10 times and shown is the average accuracy and infaded colour is the standard deviation. Test set accuracy was computed every 10 epochs.
Figure 4: Accuracy on the test set for the LSTM and RotLSTM while varying the cell state size from6 to 50. The shown numbers are for the epochs with best validation set accuracy.
