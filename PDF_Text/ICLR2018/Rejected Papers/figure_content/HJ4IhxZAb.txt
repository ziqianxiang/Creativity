Figure 1: Policy and Meta Network architecture for deep reinforcement learning of a task-agnosticactive query policy. Policy net inputs data-points zi and outputs a probability of querying them∏(a∕s). The policy network is Paramaterised by weights We that dynamically determined by themeta network based on an embedding of the dataset and classifier st = {Lt , Ut , f}.
Figure 2: Further Analysissimultaneously. Meanwhile testing performance improves, demonstrating that the model learns togeneralise better to held out problems when forced to learn on a greater diversity of source datasets.
