Figure 1: Architecture of the proposed model. A single convolutional layer extracts local fea-tures from the input, which a strided maxpool layer reduces to a fixed-size vector. A fullyconnected layer with ReLU activation carries out further, nonlinear dimensionality reductionto yield the embedding. A softmax layer is added at training time.
Figure 2: Effect of fully connected layer size and degree of max pooling on model accuracyusing held-out datasets. Even small fully connected layers and large amounts of max pooling—up to half of the length of the time series in some cases—have little or no effect on accuracy.
