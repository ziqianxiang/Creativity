Figure 1: Eigenvalues of the unnormalized Laplacian h∆u of the 15-communities graph mapped onthe complex unit half-circle by means of Cayley transform with spectral zoom values (left-to-right)h = 0.1, 1, and 10. The first 15 frequencies carrying most of the information about the communitiesare marked in red. Larger values of h zoom (right) on the low frequency band.
Figure 2: Filters (spatial domain, top and spectral domain, bottom) learned by CayleyNet (left) andChebNet (center, right) on the MNIST dataset. Cayley filters are able to realize larger supports forthe same order r .
Figure 3: Left: synthetic 15-communities graph. Right: community detection accuracy of ChebNetand CayleyNet (top); normalized responses of four different filters learned by ChebNet (middle)and CayleyNet (bottom). Grey vertical lines represent the frequencies of the normalized Laplacian(λ = 2λ-1 λ - 1 for ChebNet and C(λ) = (hλ - i)/(hλ + i) unrolled to a real line for CayleyNet).
Figure 4: Left: community detection test accuracy as function of filter order r. Center and right:computational complexity (test times on batches of 100 samples) as function of filter order r andgraph size n. Shown are exact matrix inversion (dashed) and approximate Jacobi with differentnumber of iterations (colored). For reference, ChebNet is shown (dotted).
Figure 5: ChebNet (blue) and CayleyNet (orange) test accuracies obtained on the CORA datasetfor different polynomial orders. Polynomials with complex coefficients (top) and real coefficients(bottom) have been exploited with CayleyNet in the two analysis. Orders 1 to 6 have been used inboth comparisons. The best CayleyNet consistently outperform the best ChebNet requiring at thesame time less parameters (CayleyNet with order r and complex coefficients requires a number ofparameters equal to ChebNet with order 2r).
Figure 6: Test (above) and training (below) times with corresponding ratios as function of filter orderr and graph size n on our community detection dataset.
