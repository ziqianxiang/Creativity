Figure 1: (a) Interpretation of the three most influential units from a slice corresponding to aconvolutional layer (conv4_1), for the VGG16 (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014) network. (b)Explanation based on integrated gradients (Sundararajan et al., 2017), taken on the same network andimage. The interpretation in both cases was computed by scaling pixels in the original image usingthe results of either method.
Figure 2: (a) Comparative explanation of classes “sports car” and “convertible” taken from thetop-three most influential units at the conv4_1 layer (VGG16 (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014)).
Figure 3: Distributional influence measurements taken on DR model (Section 3.4) at bottom-mostfully connected layer. To compute the grid, the distribution of influence was conditioned on class 5 (a)and class 1 (b). Figure (a) depicts an instance from class 5 that was correctly classified as such, and(b) an instance from class 5 that was incorrectly classified as class 1. In (a) the influences depicted inthe grid align closely with the class-wide ordering of influences, whereas in (b) they are visibly morerandom. White space in the middle of the grid corresponds to units with no influence on the quantity.
Figure 4: Model compression recall and accuracy for five randomly selected ImageNet classes.
Figure 5: (a) Precision and (b) recall for model compression results on a randomly-selected classfrom ImageNet using the VGG16 network. The rows correspond to α, and columns to β . The resultsindicate that strong results can be obtained by selecting relatively few units for the compression maskMh. While selecting larger sets of units does lead to increased performance, returns diminish rapidly.
