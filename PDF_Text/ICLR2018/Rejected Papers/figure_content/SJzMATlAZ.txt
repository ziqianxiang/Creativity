Figure 1: Effect of joint dimensionality reduction and clustering on the embedding. (a) A randomlysampled subset of 10K points from the MNIST dataset, visualized using t-SNE. (b) An embedding ofthese points into Rd, performed by an SDAE that is optimized for dimensionality reduction. (c) Anembedding of the same points by the same network, optimized with the DCC objective. Whenoptimized for joint dimensionality reduction and clustering, the network produces an embedding withclearly separated clusters. Best viewed in color.
Figure 2: Robustness to dimensionality of the latent space. Clustering accuracy (AMI) as a functionof the dimensionality d. Best viewed in color.
Figure 3: Clustering accuracy (ACC) as a function of the dimensionality d of the latent space. This isthe ACC counterpart to Figure 2. Best viewed in color.
