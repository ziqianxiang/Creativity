Figure 1: Tree2Tree Structure. Encoder cell get information from input and child nodes. Decoderuses state of root node of encoder(I5) as the state of root node of decoder(lι). For nodes in decoder,We first decide the number of child cells by split units. For example lι and l3 have 3 and 2 childnodes, while other nodes have none. Then nodes split information for their children.
Figure 2: Units of Our Model3.2	Tree Memory Decoder(TMD)While tree-encoder is natural extention of sequence LSTM cell, there is a large difference betweentree-decoder and sequence LSTM decoder. Sequence LSTM encoder only only need to recovercontent information, but tree-decoder should also resolve structure information. That is to say, atree-decoder cell need to decide what to output, as well as the number child cells. So the structureof tree-decoder is much much complicated that sequence-LSTM cell. The structure of decoder isshown in Figure 2(b).
Figure 3: A example of tree reconstruction result. (a) is the reference tree. (b) and (c) denotethe reconstruction result of our Tree2Tree model and the baseline model (Socher et al., 2011a),respectively.
