Figure 1: Train versions of coupled ensemble networks (here with averaging at the level of the(Log)SoftMax layer).
Figure 2: Comparison of parameter usage and error rate among different methods, for CIFAR-10,100 and SVHN. “Ours”: coupled ensemble with DenseNet-BC “element block”. Single model up to25M parameters and ensembles of coupled ensembles beyond; SGDR-WRN: snapshot ensembles upto 110M parameters and ensembles of snapshot ensembles beyond; ”Other”: all other architecturesfrom tables 3, 4.
Figure 3: Versions of the element network. Top: test, bottom: train.
Figure 4: Test versions of coupled ensemble networks. Top: SM (classical) fusion, bottom: FCfusion. AVG: averaging layer.
Figure 5: Train versions of coupled ensemble networks. Top: LL fusion, middle: SM fusion, bottom:FC fusion.
