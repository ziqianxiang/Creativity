Figure 1:	Latent variable model where z represents invariant structure across domains. Dotted linesrepresent inference. With unaligned data, we only observe individual x’s and y’s and not pairs.
Figure 2:	Feature matching auto-encoders (FMAEs). Each alignment mapping (top and bottom) iswritten as a composition of feature maps with embedding layers Ex and Ey and a sequence of hiddenlayers h`. FMAEs minimize reconstruction error alongside an adversarial penalty which matches themarginal distributions over feature layers; in experiments, we only matched the embedding layers.
