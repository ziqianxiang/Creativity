Figure 1: Comparison of the experimental results among BC, GAIL, Ours\SSF, Ours\int, and ouralgorithm (Ours). The y-axis represents PRR and the x-axis represents the number of interactionswith environment during training in log scale. Each row represents different task (in order from top:Reacher-v1, HalfCheetah-v1, Hopper-v1, Walker2d-v1, Ant-v1, and Humanoid-v1). Each columnrepresents different number of the expertâ€™s trajectories given as dataset (ds denotes the number).
