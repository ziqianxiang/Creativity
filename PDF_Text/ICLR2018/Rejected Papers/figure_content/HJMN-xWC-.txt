Figure 1: Model structure of Backbone-SkiPPath Neural Network. The wide layers with sparseconnections (x - h1 , h1 - h2) form the Backbone path. The narrow fully-connected layers (x - h3,h1 - h3, h2 - h3) are the Skip-paths. The number of units at h3 is relatively smaller than that at x,h1 and h2.
Figure 2: Example: (a) The best model with one latent variable for five observed variables. (b) Thebest model with two latent variables for five observed variables.
Figure 3: The structure learning steps of PSA. Black circles represent observed variables whilewhite circles represent latent variables. (a) A set of observed variables. (b) Partitions the observedvariables into groups. (c) Introduces a latent variable for each group and link the latent variables upas a Chow-Liu tree. (d) Converts the latent variables at layer 1 into observed variables and repeatthe previous process on them. (e) Stacks the layer 2 latent variables on the top previous model.
Figure 4: Expanding the tree structure for the Backbone path: A three-layer structure is first learned(left). New connections are added to all the layers according to empirical conditional mutual infor-mation (middle). The connections between variables at the top layer are removed and the structureis finalized (right).
