Figure 1: Generative process of SSL.
Figure 2: Tracking a synthetic trajectory. Top row: true trajectory and noisy observations. Middlerow: training/testing performance of LSTM. Bottom row: training/testing performance of SSL.
Figure 3: Comparison of the new inference method based on SMC to the older one assuming factoredmodel. The top row represents perplexity on the held out set and the lower row represents the nonzero entries in the word-topic count matrix. Lower perplexity indicates a better fit to the data andlower NNZ results in a sparser model and usually having better generalization.
Figure 5: Particle paths of a document about a music album. Top row: at epoch 1. Bottom row: atepoch 100. After epoch 100 the document has converged to a sparse set of relevant topics.
