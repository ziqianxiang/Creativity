Figure 1: (a) Erdos-Renyi graph of size 10 considered in Figures (b) and (c), (b) vertex-wise principal com-ponent scores at each iteration, and (c) projection of the principal direction at each iteration on the principaldirection of iteration 10. The vertex color and the line color in Figures (a) and (b) are matched.
Figure 2: GRAPH2SEQ neural network architecture.
Figure 3: Minimum vertex cover in (a) random Erdos-Renyi graphs, (b) random regular graphs, (c) randombipartite graphs, (d) greedy example. The error bars show one standard deviation.
Figure 4: Example to illustrate k-LOCAL-GATHER algorithms are insufficient for computing certainfunctions. Corresponding vertices in the two trees above have similar local neighborhoods, but thetrees have minimum vertex cover of different sizes.
Figure 5: (a) Erdos-Renyi graph of size 10 considered in Figures (b) and (c), (b) vertex-wise princi-pal component scores at each layer, and (c) projection of the principal direction at each iteration onthe principal direction of iteration 10. These experiments are performed on our trained model.
Figure 6: (a) Approximation ratio of GRAPH2Seq with varying number of layers, (b) y (∙) vectorsof Graph2Seq in the intermediate layers seen using the Q-function, (c) x(∙) vectors of the fixed-depth model seen using the Q-function. Figure (b) and (c) are on planted vertex cover graph withoptimum cover of vertices {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}.
