Figure 1: An informal pictogram which visualises the fast and slow network of our architecture attime step t. e(xt) refers to the embedding of xt and biases, activation functions, layernorm, andouter-products are not displayed.
Figure 2: The left figure represents the accuracy of non-trivial targets and the right figure the respec-tive bits per character. These are the validation set results of the best models of the four examinedarchitectures due to our hyper parameter search. Green is the LSTM, dark blue is the fast weightsarchitecture as attention to the recent past, red is the hypernetwork, and cyan is our novel fast weightarchitecture.
