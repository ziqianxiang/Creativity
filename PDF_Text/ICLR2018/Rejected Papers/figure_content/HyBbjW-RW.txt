Figure 1: Comparison of the Sobol sequence (with uniform noise), samples a from k-DPP, anduniform random for three metrics of interest.
Figure 2: Average best-found model accuracy by iteration when training a convolutional neuralnetwork on three hyperparameter search spaces (defined in Section 5.1), averaged across 50 trials ofhyperparameter optimization, with k = 20.
Figure 3: Average best-foundmodel accuracy by iteration whentraining a convolutional neuralnetwork on the “Stable” searchspace (defined in Section 5.2), av-eraged across 50 trials of hyper-parameter optimization, with k =20. Discretizing the space reducesthe accuracy found for both uni-form sampling and k-DPP-RBF,but in both cases k-DPP-RBFfinds better optima than uniformsampling.
