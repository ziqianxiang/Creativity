Figure 1: Mini-batch sampling.
Figure 2: Median negative gradients of BPR and BPR-max w.r.t. the target score against the rank ofthe target item. Left: only minibatch samples are used (minibatch size: 32); Center: 2048 additionalnegative samples were added to the minibatch samples; Right: same setting as the center, focusingon ranks 0-200.
Figure 3: Results on the CLASS dataset. ”ALL” means no sampling of items.
Figure 4: The effect of the alpha parameter on recommendation accuracy at different sample sizeson the CLASS dataset. Left: cross-entropy loss; Middle: TOP1-max loss; Right: BPR-max loss.
