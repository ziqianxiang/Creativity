Figure 1: (left) Two adjacent unit cells of the D-Wave 2000Q chip. The intra-cell couplings provide a fullyconnected bipartite subgraph. However, there are only four inter-cell couplings. (right) The Chimera graphrepresenting the connectivity of the two unit cells of qubits.
Figure 2: (left) A TFIM consisting of 16 qubits arranged on a two-dimensional lattice with nearest-neighbourcouplings. (right) The corresponding effective classical Ising model with ten replicas arranged in a three-dimensional solid torus.
Figure 3: (left) A 3 X 5 grid-world problem instance with one reward, one wall, and one penalty. (right)An optimal policy for this problem instance can be represented as a selection of directional arrows indicatingmovement directions.
Figure 4: The learning curve of a fully connected deep Q-network with two hidden layers, each with eighthidden nodes, for the grid-world problem instance shown in Fig. 3.
Figure 5: Heatmap of average fidelity observed using various choices of virtual parameters β and Γ. TheΓ “ 0 row tests the performance of FERL with samples obtained from the quantum annealer treated as classicalconfigurations of a GBM. In all other rows, samples are interpreted as σ z -measurements of a QBM.
