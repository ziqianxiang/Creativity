Figure 1: Comparison of algorithms in normalized learning curve. The normalized learning curve iscalculated as follows: first, we normalize learning curves for all algorithms in the same game to theinterval [0, 1]; next, average the normalized learning curve from all games for each algorithm.
Figure 2: Comparison of UCB Exploration and Ensemble Voting against Double DQN and Boot-strapped DQN.
Figure 3: Comparison of all algorithms in normalized curve. The normalized learning curve iscalculated as follows: first, we normalize learning curves for all algorithms in the same game to theinterval [0, 1]; next, average the normalized learning curve from all games for each algorithm.
