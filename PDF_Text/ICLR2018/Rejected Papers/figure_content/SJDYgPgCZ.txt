Figure 1: A simple example of the activation regions for a dataset x1 = [-1, 1]T , x2 = [2, 1]T , x3 =[1, 3]T . In each region, activation values are the same. There are six nonempty regions. Theparameters on the boundaries hit the non-differentiable point of the rectified linear unit.
Figure 2: A simple example of a non-differentiable local minimum for a dataset x1 = -2, y1 =-3, x2 = +2, y2 = -1. In this example, a network is defined by f(x) = w2σ(w1x) and w1 is fixedto one. The non-differentiable local minima exist in a line w1 = 0 which is a boundary of the tworegions. Note that if wι = 0, then Vw2 Lf = 0.
Figure 3: The histograms of subglobal minima for a dataset x1 = [-1, 1]T , y1 = 1, x2 =[2, 1]T , y2 = 2, x3 = [1, 3]T , y3 = 3. The network has one hidden layer and no biases. Weincreased the number of hidden nodes from one to four.
