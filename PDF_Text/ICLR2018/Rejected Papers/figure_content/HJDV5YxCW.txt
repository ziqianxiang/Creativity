Figure 1: Residual error binarization with n = 3 bits. Computing each bit takes a step from theposition of the previous bit (see Equation 4).
Figure 2: Effectiveness of heterogeneous bit selection techniques (a) ability of different binarizationschemes to approximate a large tensor of normally distributed random values. A bit compositiondenoted as x/y/z indicates x% of values are binarized to 1-bit, y% to 2-bit, and z% to 3-bit. (b)accuracy of 1.4 bit heterogeneous binarized AlexNet-BN trained using each bit-selection technique.
Figure 3: Accuracy results of trained HBNN models. (a) Sweep of heterogenous bitwidths on adeliberately simplified four layer convolutional model for CIFAR-10. Bits are distributed randomlyat a kernel level. Trained accuracy tracks very linearly with bitwidth. (b) Accuracy of heterogeneousbitwidth AlexNet-BN models. Bits are distributed using the Middle-Out selection algorithm. Here,the performance is much better than linear, implying Middle-Out selection effectively chooses whichvalues need more bits and which do not.
