Figure 2: Example illustrating network of groups (NOG) which is the hypergraph (HG) (top left),the corresponding simplicial complex (SC) (top right) and the hasse diagram (HD) (bottom) corre-sponding to the simplicial complex, for a scenario where the actors {1,2,3,4,5} have collaberated inpast as groups: g1 = {1, 2}, g2 = {1, 2,3,4} and g3 = {3, 4, 5}.
Figure 3: For the given hypergraph between four nodes (A,B,C,D) we consider the complete hasselattice. For a given hyperedge {B,C} (square box) we then construct the sub-lattice made of hyper-edges with distance h = 2 from {B,C}. We perform random walk (with τ = 0.2) starting fromthe node corresponding to hyperedge {B,C} and sample p = 3 hyperedges (nodes visited by therandom walk; shown with a check-mark X). Finally, we train the autoencoder to reconstruct theoriginal hyperedge from these p noisy hyperedges.
