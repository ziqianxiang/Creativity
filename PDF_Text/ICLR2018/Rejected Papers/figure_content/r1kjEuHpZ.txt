Figure 1: (a) Under L1 regularization, the vectors are sparse, but their supports are overlapped; (b) Under LDDregularization, the vectors are orthogonal, but their supports are overlapped; (c) Under LDD-L1 regularization,the vectors are sparse and mutually orthogonal and their supports are not overlapped.
