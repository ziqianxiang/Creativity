Figure 1: The data flow in the frequency domain. The generation progress of Output (2,2) has beenomitted.
Figure 2: The data flow in the frequency domain. The convolution operation in the time domainis equivalent to the point-wise multiplication (filtering) in the frequency domain. The generationprogress of Output (2,2) has been omitted.
Figure 3: An example of the aliasing effect caused by the pooling layer. Note the change of therange on the frequency (y) axis of the spectrogram: higher frequencies of both the filter and thesignal are cut off according to the reduction of the sampling rate.
Figure 4: Comparison of the mean change rate of the convolutional filters (i.e., weights) of SoundNetand SimpleNet during training in an identical speaker emotion recognition test. Left: the meanchange rate of the first 6 convolutional layers of SoundNet. Right: the mean change rate of theconvolutional layer of SimpleNet. The mean change rate is defined as the mean absolute valueof the change rate of the value of each weight compared to the last iteration, which is defined as(valuei-valuei-1)/valuei-1 for the ith iteration. The changing rate reflects if the convolutional filtersare effectively trained. Filters of SimpleNet are trained more effectively.
Figure 5: Comparison of the various architectures discussed in this paper. The output dimension ofthe front-end layers (when the network input is a 6-second audio with the sampling rate of 16kHz)is shown between the dashed lines for each network.
Figure 6: Visualization of 4 selected convolutional filters of SimpleNet-CNN before and after train-ing in the speaker emotion recognition test.
