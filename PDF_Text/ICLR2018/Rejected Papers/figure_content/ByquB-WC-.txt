Figure 1: Relation Memory NetworkRelation Memory Network (RMN) is composed of four components - embedding, attention, updat-ing, and reasoning. It takes as the inputs a set of sentences x1, x2, ..., xn and its related question u,and outputs an answer a. Each of the xi, u, and a is made up of one-hot representation of words,for example, xi = {xi1,xi2,xi3, ..., xini} (xij ∈ RV ,j = (1, 2, ...,ni), V = vocabulary size, ni =number of words in sentence i).

Each task requires dif-ferent methods to infer the answer. The dataset includes a set of statements comprised of multiplesentences, a question and answer. A statement can be as short as two sentences and as long as 320sentences. To answer the question, it is necessary to find relevant one or more sentences to a givenquestion and derive answer from them. Answer is typically a single word but in a few tasks, answersare a set of words. Each task is regarded as success when the accuracy is greater than 95%. Thereare two versions of this dataset, one that has 1k training examples and the other with 10k examples.
