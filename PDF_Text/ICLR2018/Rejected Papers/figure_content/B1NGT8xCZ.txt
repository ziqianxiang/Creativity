Figure 1: Density estimator with additional transformations f and g. Input instances XS and XT arefrom source and target domains, respectively. f transforms both XS and XT to RD so that they areclose in RD; g transforms them back so that they have close density estimations in Rd.
Figure 2: Model architecture of DAUto and its computation flow during learning phase. DAUtocontains three components: the autoencoder (f and g), the domain classifier (h) and the labelpredictor (h). The autoencoder instantiates the marginal distribution p(x); the encoder f and the labelpredictor instantiates the conditional probability p(y | x). The domain classifier works as a regularizer.
Figure 3:	2 dimensional PCA embeddings of learned representations with and without DAutoadaptation. All the representations are extracted from the last hidden layer of the networks. Blue andgreen dots represent instances from the labeled training set and unlabeled target set, respectively.
Figure 4:	Test set performances of MLP, Ladder, mSDA, DANN and DAuto with increasing trainingset sizes: from 0.2 to 1.0. DAuto achieves the best accuracy on 12 out of 16 tasks.
