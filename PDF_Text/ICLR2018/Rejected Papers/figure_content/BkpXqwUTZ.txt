Figure 1: VBP vs FBA vs ITD are all visualized in a 2-layer deep neural network.
Figure 2: The experimental results on MNIST dataset: (top row) ITD, (middle row) FBA, (bottomrow) VBP.
Figure 3: The experimental results on MNIST dataset using ITD with different loss function: (toprow) LSE, (bottom row) MCE.
