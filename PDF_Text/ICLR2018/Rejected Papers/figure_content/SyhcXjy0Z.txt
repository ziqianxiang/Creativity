Figure 2: Network architecture and Parameters4	Model execution and results4.1	PerformanceThe performance of the model is evaluated on a test set which is disjoint from training set, simulatingthe real life situation. It reports a final accuracy of 90.535% after around 60 training cycles. Figure3 shows evolution of test accuracy over 60 training cycles and Figure 4 demonstrates accuracy forevery training step for first 5 training cycles.

The activations are generated for a disguised face which was correctly classified by the net-work. They reveal different structures that excite a given feature map, hence showing its invarianceto input deformations. The activations in each layer show the hierarchical nature of features learnedby the network. The first layer learns corner and border features, second layer points out moredeeper features and third layer adds up to learn blur and relatively targeted features for generaliza-tion of features. The activations from third convolutional layer are used by fully connected layersfor classification.
