Figure 1: (a) By ensuring near-optimal final anytime predictions, our ANN (red) achieves the same error rates2-5 times faster than a large existing one (purple). (b) ANN illustration. (c) EANN illustration.
Figure 2: (a,b) On CIFAR100 and ILSVRC, ResNets using SIEVE achieves the same accuracy as those oftwiCe the depths but using CONST, so that the small nets (blue) effeCtively speed up the large nets (orange).
