Figure 1: This figure describes the pipeline architecture of Autostacker. Autostacker pipelines con-sists of one or multiple layers and one or multiple nodes inside each layer. Each node represents amachine learning primitive model, such as SVM, MLP, etc. The number of layers and the numberof nodes per layer can be specified beforehand or they can be changeable as part of the hyperparam-eters. In the first layer, the raw dataset is used as input. Then in the following layers, the predictionresults from each node will be added to the raw dataset as synthetic features (new colors). The newdataset generated by each layer will be used as input to the next layer.
Figure 2: The overview process of Autostacker and its usage is shown here. First, we start tobuild the model pipelines by generating initial pipelines with dynamic configurations of architectureand hyperparameters, feeding into PHC algorithm, and looping the process to generate winningpipelines. Then the winning pipelines can be used as better baselines for data scientists, or we cananalyze the pattern in the winning pipeline sets for further meta-learning usage.
