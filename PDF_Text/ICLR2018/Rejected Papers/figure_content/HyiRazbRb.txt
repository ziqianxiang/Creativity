Figure 1: The auto-encoder in this example has 5 neurons in the hidden layer and the dictionaryhas two items; in this case, g(1) = g(3) = 1, g(5) = 2, and the other two neurons do not learn anyground-truth (neurons mapped to 0 are considered useless). Under unique firing condition, whichholds when the dictionary is sufficiently incoherent, the red dashed connection will not take place(each neuron is learning at most one dictionary item).
Figure 2: The unit circle lies in H . For with a fixed norm, the picture illustrates one of theconfigurations where the maximal angle (θ) between data point Xi (in red) and Wj? is achieved.
Figure 3: The unit circle lies in H. The picture illustrates one of the possible configurations wherethe minimal angle (θ) between ProjH(W?) and W(? is achieved.
