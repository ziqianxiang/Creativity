Ab stract
We introduce a new deep convolutional neural network, CrescendoNet, by stack-
ing simple building blocks without residual connections. Each Crescendo block
contains independent convolution paths with increased depths. The numbers
of convolution layers and parameters are only increased linearly in Crescendo
blocks. In experiments, CrescendoNet with only 15 layers outperforms almost
all networks without residual connections on benchmark datasets, CIFAR10,
CIFAR100, and SVHN. Given sufficient amount of data as in SVHN dataset,
CrescendoNet with 15 layers and 4.1M parameters can match the performance of
DenseNet-BC with 250 layers and 15.3M parameters. CrescendoNet provides a
new way to construct high performance deep convolutional neural networks with
simple network architecture. Moreover, through investigating the behavior and
performance of subnetworks in CrescendoNet, we note that the high performance
of CrescendoNet may come from its implicit ensemble behavior. Furthermore,
the independence between paths in CrescendoNet allows us to introduce a new
path-wise training procedure, which can reduce the memory needed for training.
1	Introduction
Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have significantly improved the performance of image
classification (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; He et al., 2016a; Szegedy et al., 2015). However, training
a CNN also becomes increasingly difficult with the network deepening. One of important research
efforts to overcome this difficulty is to develop new neural network architectures (Huang et al.,
2016a; Larsson et al., 2017).
Recently, residual network (He et al., 2016a) and its variants (Huang et al., 2017) have used residual
connections among layers to train very deep CNN. The residual connections promote the feature
reuse, help the gradient flow, and reduce the need for massive parameters. The ResNet (He et al.,
2016a) and DenseNet (Huang et al., 2017) achieved state-of-the-art accuracy on benchmark datasets.
Alternatively, FractalNet (Larsson et al., 2017) expanded the convolutional layers in a fractal form to
generate deep CNNs. Without residual connections (He et al., 2016a) and manual deep supervision
(Lee et al., 2014), FractalNet achieved high performance on image classification based on network
structural design only.
Many studies tried to understand reasons behind the representation view of deep CNNs. Veit et al.
(2016) showed that residual network can be seen as an ensemble of relatively shallow effective
paths. However, Greff et al. (2017) argued that ensembles of shallow networks cannot explain the
experimental results of lesioning, layer dropout, and layer reshuffling on ResNet. They proposed
that residual connections have led to unrolled iterative estimation in ResNet. Meanwhile, Larsson
et al. (2017) speculated that the high performance of FractalNet was due to the unrolled iterative
estimation of features of the longest path using features of shorter paths. Although unrolled iterative
estimation model can explain many experimental results, it is unclear how it helps improve the
classification performance of ResNet and FractalNet. On the other hand, the ensemble model can
explain the performance improvement easily.
In this work, we propose CrescendoNet, a new deep convolutional neural network with ensem-
ble behavior. Same as other deep CNNs, CrescendoNet is created by stacking simple building
blocks, called Crescendo blocks (Figure 1). Each Crescendo block comprises a set of independent
feed-forward paths with increased number of convolution and batch-norm layers (Ioffe & Szegedy,

Figure 1: CrescendoNet architecture used in experiments, where scale = 4 and interval = 1.
2015a). We only use the identical size, 3 × 3, for all convolutional filters in the entire network.
Despite its simplicity, CrescendoNet shows competitive performance on benchmark CIFAR10, CI-
FAR100, and SVHN datasets.
Similar to FractalNet, CrescendoNet does not include residual connections. The high performance
of CrescendoNet also comes completely from its network structural design. Unlike the FractalNet,
in which the numbers of convolutional layers and associated parameters are increased exponentially,
the numbers of convolutional layers and parameters in Crescendo blocks are increased linearly.
CrescendoNet shows clear ensemble behavior (Section 3.4). In CrescendoNet, although the longer
paths have better performances than those of shorter paths, the combination of different length paths
have even better performance. A set of paths generally outperform its subsets. This is different from
FractalNet, in which the longest path alone achieves the similar performance as the entire network
does, far better than other paths do.
Furthermore, the independence between paths in CrescendoNet allows us to introduce a new path-
wise training procedure, in which paths in each building block are trained independently and se-
quentially. The path-wise procedure can reduce the memory needed for training. Especially, we can
reduce the amortized memory used for training CrescendoNet to about one fourth.
We summarize our contribution as follows:
•	We propose the Crescendo block with linearly increased convolutional and batch-norm
layers. The CrescendoNet generated by stacking Crescendo blocks further demonstrates
that the high performance of deep CNNs can be achieved without explicit residual learning.
•	Through our analysis and experiments, we discovered an emergent behavior which is sig-
nificantly different from which of FractalNet. The entire CrescendoNet outperforms any
subset of it can provide an insight of improving the model performance by increasing the
number of paths by a pattern.
•	We introduce a path-wise training approach for CrescendoNet, which can lower the mem-
ory requirements without significant loss of accuracy given sufficient data.

2.1	Architecture Design
Crescendo Block The Crescendo block is built by two layers, the convolution layer with the activa-
tion function and the following batch normalization layer (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015b). The convolu-
tional layers have the identical size, 3 × 3. The Conv-Activation-BatchNorm unit f1, defined in the
Eq.1 is the base branch of the Crescendo block. We use ReLU as the activation function to avoid the
problem of vanishing gradients (Nair & Hinton, 2010).
f1(z) = batchnorm(activation(conv(z)))	(1)
The variable z denotes the input feature maps. We use two hyper-parameters, the scale S and the
interval I to define the structure of the Crescendo block HS. The interval I specifies the depth
difference between every two adjacent branches and the scale S sets the number of branches per
block. The structure of the nth branch is defined by the following equation:
fn (z) = f1nI (z)	(2)
where the superscript nI is the number of recursion time of the function f1. The structure of
Crescendo block HS can be obtained below:
HS (Z) = fι (Z)㊉ f2 (Z)㊉…fs (Z)	(3)
where ㊉ denotes an element-wise averaging operation. Note that the feature maps from each path
are averaged element-wise, leaving the width of the channel unchanged. A Crescendo block with
S = 4 and I = 1 is shown in Figure 1.
The structure of Crescendo block is designed for exploiting more feature expressiveness. The dif-
ferent depths of parallel paths lead to different receptive fields and therefore generate features in
different abstract levels. In addition, such an incremental and parallel form explicitly supports the
ensemble effects, which shows excellent characteristics for efficient training and anytime classifica-
tion. We will explain and demonstrate this in the following sections.
CrescendoNet Architecture The main body of CrescendoNet is composed of stacked Crescendo
blocks with max-pooling layers between adjacent blocks (Figure 1). Following the main body,
like most deep CNNs, we use two fully connected layers and a soft-max layer as the classifier. In all
experiments, the two fully connected layers have 384 hidden units and 192 hidden units respectively.
The overall structure of CrescendoNet is simple and we only need to tune the Crescendo block to
modify the entire network.
2.2	Path-wise training
To reduce the memory consumption during training CrescendoNet, we propose a path-wise train-
ing procedure, leveraging the independent multi-path structure of our model. We denote stacked
3
Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2018
Conv-BatchNorm layers in one Crescendo block as one path. We train each path individually, from
the shortest to the longest repetitively. When we are training one path, we freeze the parameters of
other paths. In other words, these frozen layers only provide learned features to support the train-
ing. Figure 2 illustrates the procedure of path-wise training within a CrescendoNet block containing
four paths. There are two advantages of path-wise training. First, path-wise training procedure sig-
nificantly reduces the memory requirements for convolutional layers, which constitutes the major
memory cost for training CNNs. For example, the higher bound of the memory required for com-
putation and storage of gradients using momentum stochastic gradient descent algorithms can be
reduced to about 40% for a Crescendo block with 4 paths where interval = 1. Second, path-wise
training works well with various optimizers and regularizations. Even dropout and drop-path can be
applied to the model during the training.
2.3	Regularization
Dropout (Hinton et al., 2012) and drop-connect (Wan et al., 2013), which randomly set a selected
subset of activations or weights to zero respectively, are effective regularization techniques for deep
neural networks. Their variant, drop-path (Larsson et al., 2017), shows further performance im-
provement by dropping paths when training FractalNet.
We use both dropout and drop-path for regularizing the Crescendo block. We drop the branches in
each block with a predefined probability. For example, given drop-path rate, p = 0.3, the expectation
of the number of dropped branches is 1.2 for a Crescendo block with four branches. For the fully
connected layers, we use L2 norm of their weights as an additional term to the loss.
3	Experiments
3.1	Datasets
We evaluate our models with three benchmark datasets: CIFAR10, CIFAR100 (Krizhevsky et al.,
2014), and Street View House Numbers (SVHN) (Netzer et al., 2011). CIFAR10 and CIFAR100
each have 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images, belonging to 10 and 100 classes respec-
tively. All the images are in RGB format with the size of 32 × 32-pixel. SVHN are color images,
with the same size of 32 × 32-pixel, containing 604,388 and 26,032 images for training and testing
respectively. Note that these digits are cropped from a series of numbers. Thus, there may be more
than one digit in an image, but only the one in the center is used as the label. For data augmentation,
we use a widely adopted scheme (Lin et al., 2013; Larsson et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2016a;b; Sri-
vastava et al., 2015b; Springenberg et al., 2014; He et al., 2016a). We first pad images with 4 zero
pixels on each side, then crop padded images to 32 × 32-pixel randomly and horizontally flipping
with a 50% probability. We preprocess each image in all three datasets by subtracting off the mean
and dividing the variance of the pixels.
3.2	Training
We use Mini-batch gradient descent to train all our models. We implement our models using Tensor-
Flow distributed computation framework (Abadi et al., 2016) and run them on NVidia P100 GPU.
We also optimize our models by adaptive momentum estimation (Adam) optimization (Kingma &
Ba, 2014) and Nesterov Momentum optimization (Nesterov, 1983) respectively. For Adam op-
timization, we set the learning rate hyper-parameter to 0.001 and let Adam adaptively tune the
learning rate during the training. We choose the momentum decay hyper-parameter β1 = 0.9 and
β2 = 0.999. And we set the smoothing term = 10-8. This configuration is the default setting
for the AdamOptimizer class in TensorFlow. For Nesterov Momentum optimization, we set the
hyper-parameter momentum = 0.9. We decay the learning rate from 0.1 to 0.01 after 512 epochs
for CIFAR and from 0.05 to 0.005, then to 0.0005, after 42 epochs and 63 epochs respectively for
SVHN. We use truncated normal distribution for parameter initialization. The standard deviation of
hyper-parameters is 0.05 for convolutional weights and 0.04 for fully connected layer weights. For
all datasets, we use the batch size of 128 on each training replica. For the whole net training, we run
700 epochs on CIFAR and 70 epochs on SVHN. For the path-wise training, we run 1400 epochs on
CIFAR and 100 epochs on SVHN.

Using a CrescendoNet model with three blocks each contains four branches as illustrated in Figure
1, we investigate the following preliminary aspects: the model performance under different block
widths, the ensemble effect, and the path-wise training performance. We study the Crescendo block
with three different width configurations: equal width globally, equal width within the block, and
increasing width. All the three configurations have the same fully connected layers. For the first
one, we set the number of feature maps to 128 for all the convolutional layers. For the second,
the numbers of feature maps are (128, 256, 512) for convolutional layers in each block. For the
last, we gradually increase the feature maps for each branch in three blocks to (128, 256, 512)
correspondingly. For example, the number of feature maps for the second and fourth branches in the
second block is (192, 256) and (160, 192, 224, 256). The exact number of maps for each layer is
defined by the following equation:
nmaps
noutmaps - ninmaps
ninmaps + ilayer
nlayers
(4)
where nmaps denotes the number of feature maps for a layer, ninmaps and noutmaps are number of
input and output maps respectively, nlayers is the number of layers in the block, and ilayer is the
index of the layer in the branch, starting from 1.
To inspect the ensemble behavior of CrescendoNet, we compare the performance of models with
and without drop-path technique and subnets composed by different combinations of branches in
each block. For the simplicity, we denote the branch combination as a set P containing the index of
the branch. For example, P = {1, 3} means the blocks in the subnet only contains the first and third
branches. The same notation is used in Table 2 and Figure 3.
3.3	Results of the whole net
Table 1 gives a comparison among CrescendoNet and other representative models on CIFAR and
SVHN benchmark datasets. For five datasets, CrescendoNet with only 15 layers outperforms al-
most all networks without residual connections, plus original ResNet and ResNet with Stochastic
Depth. For CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 without data augmentation, CrescendoNet also performs better
than all the given models except DenseNet with bottleneck layers and compression (DenseNet-BC)
with 250 layers. However, CrescendoNet’s error rate 1.76% matches the 1.74% error rate of given
DenseNet-BC, on SVHN dataset which has plentiful data for each class. Comparing with Fractal-
Net, another outstanding model without residual connection, CrescendoNet has a simpler structure,
fewer parameters, but higher accuracies.
The lower rows in Table 1 compare the performance of our model given different configuration. In
three different widths, the performance simultaneously grows with the number of feature maps. In
other words, there is no over-fitting when we increase the capacity of CrescendoNet in an appropriate
scope. Thus, CrescendoNet demonstrates a potential to further improve its performance by scaling
up. In addition, the drop-path technique shows its benefits to our models on all the datasets, just as
it does to FractalNet.
Another interesting result from Table 1 is the performance comparison between Adam and Nesterov
Momentum optimization methods. Comparing with Nesterov Momentum method, Adam performs
similarly on CIFAR10 and SVHN, but worse on CIFAR100. Note that there are roughly 60000,
5000, and 500 training images for each class in SVHN, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100 respectively.
This implies that Adam may be a better option for training CrescendoNet when the training data is
abundant, due to the convenience of its adaptive learning rate scheduling.
The last row of Table 1 gives the result from path-wise training. Training the model with less
memory requirement can be achieved at the cost of some performance degradation. However, Path-
wise trained CrescendoNet still outperform many of networks without residual connections on given
datasets.
3.4	Results of Subnets
Table 2 provides a performance comparison among different path combinations of CrescendoNet,
trained by Adam optimization, with block-wise width (128, 256, 512). The results show the en-
semble behavior of our model. Specifically, the more paths contained in the network, the better the

performance. And the whole net outperforms any single path network with a large margin. For
example, the whole net and the net based on the longest path show the inference error rate of 6.90%
and 10.69% respectively, for CIFAR10 without data augmentation. This implicit ensemble behavior

differentiates CrescendoNet from FractalNet, which shows a student-teacher effect. Specifically, the
longest path in FractalNet can achieve a similar or even lower error rate compared to the whole net.
To investigate the dynamic behavior of subnets, we test the error rate changes of subnets during the
training. We use Adam to train the CrescendoNet with the structure shown in Figure 1 on CIFAR10
for 450 epochs. Figure 3 illustrates the behavior of different path combinations during the training.
It shows that the inference accuracy of the whole net grows simultaneously with all the subnets,
which demonstrates the ensemble effect. Second, for any single path network, the performance
grows with the depth. This behavior of the anytime classifier is also shown by FractalNet. In other
words, we could use the short path network to give a rough but quick inference, then use more paths
to gradually increase the accuracy. This may be useful for time-critical applications, like integrated
recognition system for autonomous driving tasks.
4	Related Work
Conventional deep CNNs, such as AlexNet (Krizhevsky et al., 2012) and VGG-19 (Simonyan &
Zisserman, 2014), directly stacked the convolutional layers. However, the vanishing gradient prob-
lem makes it difficult to train and tune very deep CNN of conventional structures. Recently, stacking
small convolutional blocks has become an important method to build deep CNNs. Introducing new
building blocks becomes the key to improve the performance of deep CNN. Lin et al. (2013) first
introduced the NetworkInNetwork module which is a micro neural network using a multiple layer
perceptron (MLP) for local modeling. Then, they piled the micro neural networks into a deep macro
neural network.
Szegedy et al. (2015) introduced a new building block called Inception, based on which they built
GoogLeNet. Each Inception block has four branches of shallow CNNs, building by convolutional
kernels with size 1 × 1, 3 × 3, 5 × 5, and max-pooling with kernel size 3 × 3. Such a multiple-branch
scheme is used to extract diversified features while reducing the need for tuning the convolutional
sizes. The main body of GoogLeNet has 9 Inception blocks stacked each other. Stacking multiple-
branch blocks can create an exponential combination of feed-forward paths. Such a structure com-

bined with the dropout technique can show an implicit ensemble effect (Veit et al., 2016; Srivastava
et al., 2014). GoogLeNet was further improved with new blocks to more powerful models, such
as Xception (Chollet, 2016) and Inception-v4 (Szegedy et al., 2016). To improve the scalability of
GoogLeNet, Szegedy et al. (2016) used convolution factorization and label-smoothing regularization
in Inception-v4. In addition, Chollet (2016) explicitly defined a depth-wise separable convolution
module replacing Inception module.
Recently, Larsson et al. (2017) introduced FractalNet built by stacked Fractal blocks, which are the
combination of identical convolutional layers in a fractal expansion fashion. FractalNet showed that
it is possible to train very deep neural network through the network architecture design. FractalNet
implicitly also achieved deep supervision and student-teacher learning by the fractal architecture.
However, the fractal expansion form increases the number of convolution layers and associated pa-
rameters exponentially. For example, the original FractalNet model with 21 layers has 38.6 million
parameters, while a ResNet of depth 1001 with similar accuracy has only 10.2 million parameters
(Huang et al., 2016a). Thus, the exponential expansion reduced the scalability of FractalNet.
Another successful idea in network architecture design is the use of skip-connections (He et al.,
2016a;b; Huang et al., 2016a; Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2016; Xie et al., 2016). ResNet (He et al.,
2016a) used the identity mapping to short connect stacked convolutional layers, which allows the
data to pass from a layer to its subsequent layers. With the identity mapping, it is possible to train
a 1000-layer convolutional neural network. Huang et al. (2016a) recently proposed DenseNet with
extremely residual connections. They connected each layer in the Dense block to every subsequent
layer. DenseNet achieved the best performance on benchmark datasets so far. On the other hand,
Highway networks (Srivastava et al., 2015a) used skip-connections to adaptively infuse the input
and output of traditional stacked neural network layers. Highway networks have helped to achieve
high performance in language modeling and translation.
5	Discussion and Conclusion
CNN has shown excellent performance on image recognition tasks. However, it is still challenging
to tune, modify, and design an CNN. We propose CrescendoNet, which has a simple convolutional
neural network architecture without residual connections (He et al., 2016a). Crescendo block uses
convolutional layers with same size 3 × 3 and joins feature maps from each branch by the averaging
operation. The number of convolutional layers grows linearly in CrescendoNet while exponentially
in FractalNet (Larsson et al., 2017). This leads to a significant reduction of computational complex-
ity.
Even with much fewer layers and a simpler structure, CrescendoNet matches the performance of
the original and most of the variants of ResNet on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 classification tasks.
Like FractalNet (Larsson et al., 2017), we use dropout and drop-path as regularization mechanisms,
which can train CrescendoNet to be an anytime classifier, namely, CrescendoNet can perform infer-
ence with any combination of the branches according to the latency requirements. Our experiments
also demonstrated that CrescendoNet synergized well with Adam optimization, especially when the
training data is sufficient. In other words, we can avoid scheduling the learning rate which is usually
performed empirically for training existing CNN architectures.
CrescendoNet shows a different behavior from FractalNet in experiments on CIFAR10/100 and
SVHN. In FractalNet (Larsson et al., 2017), the longest path alone achieves the similar performance
as the entire network, far better than other paths, which shows the student-teacher effect. The whole
FractalNet except the longest path acts as a scaffold for the training and becomes dispensable later.
On the other hand, CrescendoNet shows that the whole network significantly outperforms any set of
it. This fact sheds the light on exploring the mechanism which can improve the performance of deep
CNNs by increasing the number of paths.
