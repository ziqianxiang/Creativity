Ab stract
In the past decade, many urban areas in China have suffered from serious air pol-
lution problems, making air quality forecast a hot spot. Conventional approaches
rely on numerical methods to estimate the pollutant concentration and require lots
of computing power. To solve this problem, we applied the widely used deep
learning methods. Deep learning requires large-scale datasets to train an effective
model. In this paper, we introduced a new dataset, entitled as AirNet1 , containing
the 0.25 degree resolution grid map of mainland China, with more than two years
of continued air quality measurement and meteorological data. We published this
dataset as an open resource for machine learning researches and set up a baseline
of a 5-day air pollution forecast. The results of experiments demonstrated that
this dataset could facilitate the development of new algorithms on the air quality
forecast.
1	Introduction
In recent years, along with economic development, air pollution in developing countries such as
China and India has become a severe problem threatening the public health(Pun et al. (2014),
Lv et al. (2016)). One of the most abundant air pollutants PM2.5 (fine particles with a diame-
ter 2.5 micrometers(μm) or less) could penetrate the deepest part of the lungs such as the bron-
chioles or alveoli and result in asthma, lung cancer, respiratory diseases, cardiovascular disease
etc.(contributors (2017)).
Air quality forecasting techniques are being rapidly upgraded as the demand for measuring pol-
lution increases. Models like HYSPLIT-4 and KF utilize atmospheric dynamic processes and at-
tempt to figure out the accumulation and dissipation mechanisms of air pollutants (Lv et al. (2015);
Djalalova et al. (2015)). Hidden Markov model are also used to predict pollutant concentrations
(Sun et al. (2013); Yetilmezsoy & Abdul-Wahab (2012)). However, due to the complexity of air
transport dynamics, conventional forecasting models intrinsically demand a great amount of com-
puting resources. In addition, conventional model’s accuracy depends on the model structure itself
and cannot improve regardless of the amount of training data.
On the other hand, the deep learning approach (LeCun et al.) has achieved exceptional results in
unstructured information processing, such as computer vision, speech recognition, and natural lan-
guage processing (Hinton et al. (2012); Zhang & LeCun (2015); Krizhevsky et al. (2012)).In those
tasks, deep learning method has outperformed conventional machine learning methods. Inspired
by this, people are trying to use deep learning models such as Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) and
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), to perform meteorological forecasting (Shangzan et al. (2017)).
Currently, its application includes estimation of precipitation probability and air pollution, etc..
Notably, to apply deep learning techniques effectively, a large-scale dataset is required to train a
model (Liu et al. (2017)). A good dataset could greatly incent the industry to develop the new
models and offer a unified assessment standard, as in the case of ImageNet (Deng et al. (2009))
in the computer vision field. However, to our knowledge, such dataset is absent in the air quality
forecast field so far. To facilitate research and data collection, we processed and published an air
quality dataset, AirNet, so as to fill this gap. Furthermore, we conducted experiments to validate the
capability of this dataset, and set up a baseline for air pollution prediction on the AirNet dataset.

1.1	Related Work
Shi et al. (2015) proposed RNN and convolutional LSTM to forecast the precipitation in future
two hours, which they formalized as a spatio-temporal issue. The air quality forecast is similar to
weather forecast, but two factors make air quality forecast more difficult and distinct from estimating
precipitation; 1) the time span of air quality forecast is longer than weather forecast, the former often
forecasts in four or five days, sometimes even goes beyond ten days. 2) additional influential factors
must be considered in air quality forecast, such as the dynamics of air pollutants and the interaction
with meteorological conditions. Modeling with AirNet dataset, the difference will be explicated in
Section 5 below.
Ong et al. (2016) applied RNN to predict PM2.5 with environmental sensor data, which improved
the results accuracy. Kurt & Oktay (2010)s research on forecasting air pollution with neural net-
works demonstrated the methods superiority and feasibility . Liang et al. (2015) released a dataset
containing the value of PM2.5 which is only measured in Beijing. After this, Liang et al. (2016)
published a larger dataset to analyze the pollutant factor in five cities of China. All datasets used
above are point-wise data, which do not allow us to model in a spatially explicit manner. In addi-
tion, as Table 3 shows, these datasets are too small to train a deep neural network. Thus it became
essential and urgent to set up a larger scale training dataset to enhance the accuracy of the forecast
results.
1.2	Contribution and Overview
In this paper, we delivered a dataset, AirNet, containing more than two years of 6 indices of air
quality data from 1498 stations, which is at least 40 times larger than most previous datasets. We set
up a baseline based the LSTM model with AirNet dataset. The results demonstrated the effectiveness
of the deep learning model for the air quality forecast.
2	Dataset Extraction
2.1	Dataset collection
At first, we collected the data from China National Environmental Monitoring Center (CNEMC)
which runs the 1498 monitor stations spreading across the whole country. Every station monitors
air quality in real-time and reports concentration of the different air pollutants every hour. Therefore
we wrote a spider to fetch the data from the Data-Publish platform2. Secondly, we gathered the
meteorological data from the Global Forecast System (GFS) which contains the 6 meteorological
condition features as in Table 1.
2.2	Alignment Data
For air quality data from CNEMC, in each city, there are several monitoring stations of the real-time
air pollutant concentration per hour.
The GFS data format is a 3-dimensional matrix, released by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA) every six hours. Every release contains the meteorological condition fea-

tures forecasting for 10 days in every 3 hours, and 16 days in every 12 hours. For each meteorologi-
cal condition features like TEMP, there are 1038240 values at one time point globally. We converted
this data to a matrix which equals the volume of (180 * 4 + 1) * (360 * 4), where 180 is the radial
latitude, 360 is the radial longitude, and 4 is the invert of the 0.25 resolution. Subsequently, we also
obtained the global forecasting models geospatial information.
These two kinds of data sources are distinct. GFS data is a 3 dimensional matrix while the air
quality data is a two dimensional matrix at a time point, where one dim is station ID, and the other
is air quality indices. Therefore we had to align these two datasets. For each GFS data time point,
we selected required air quality data for all stations in China and interpolated them into a matrix
covering the whole country.
Figure 1: Use radial basis function to interpolate Air data from point-wise to a matrix.
Radial Basis Function is used to interpolate Air data to a matrix as shown in Figure 1. After that,
we concatenated the gfs dataset with air quality dataset as in Figure 2 and thus produced a four-
dimensional dataset (latitude, longitude, timesteps, features). Longitude ranges from 75 degrees to
132 degrees and the north latitude range of is from 18 degrees to 51 degrees. The grid resolution
is 0.25 degree and the data was collected from April 1, 2015, to September 1, 2017. Every 3 hours
there is one frame; on every frame we have 6 GFS features, and 6 types of the air quality indices.
In total, we had a matrix with the dimension of (132, 228, 7072, 12). We took partial features of
2:00AM, January 23, 2017 as an example in Figure 2.
Some statistic features of the AirNet3 are displayed in Table 3.
2.3	The interpolated precision
The error of dataset comes from two aspects, one is the error in the data collection process, and the
other is the error of in the interpolation algorithm.
For air quality data from CNEMC, According HJ6, the measurement error is less than 10μg∕m3.
For meteorological data from NOAA, Quanzhi Ye validates the quality of Cloud data in Ye (2010),
for example, the probability of below 30% forecast error is 63% for Paranal.
To validate the precision of interpolated value, we take off a proportion (10%) of real value in this
dateset, then use these data to check the effect of interpolate algorithm. We choose the data from
December 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016, and demonstrate the relative error and pearson correlation
coefficientat different pollutant level, the result show as Table 2.

Air quality prediction is different from precipitation prediction because many factors will affect the
concentration and distribution of the air pollutants. It is also essential to take the future meteorolog-

ical conditions into consideration rather than just the history of pollutant concentration. Based on
this observations, we formalized the pollutant problem as follows:
P (Xt) = P (Xt ∣xt-i,xt-2 ...X0； bt, bt-1 ...bo)
P(xt-1,xt-2, . . . x0) P (bt, bt-1, bt-2, . . .b0)
(1)
Where the air pollutant concentration and meteorological condition at time step t are denoted as xt
and bt respectively. We convert pollutant prediction into a sequential prediction problem. Since
future meteorological conditions are as important as historical pollutant concentrations, the meteo-
rological factors were taken as b0 to bt-1 plus the predicted future meteorological condition bt . We
could produce future meteorological predictions through numerical methods, and feed the predicted
data into the model. As time t increments, the model described by formula 1 could be repeatly
applied, so we could forecast air pollutant concentration as far into the future as possible.
3.2	Metrics
In the development of machine learning models, we use Mean Square Error as a loss function. Since
the estimated pollutant value became more precise closer to the monitoring stations, we modified
the MSE using a new calculation method, as the Point-wise Mean Square Error (PMSE), which only
calculates loss in the nearby stations. The experiments results demonstrate that this improvement is
evident and beneficial.
PMSE = n X (bi - yi)
n i∈A
A := {P I P located in a monitor station place}
(2)
Additionally, we use the Probability of Detection (POD), the False Alarm Rate (FAR), and the
Critical Success Index (CSI)Shi et al. (2015) as the metrics for the assessment. These metrics are
intuitive for us to understand the performance of a system. We use PM2.5 value 80 ug/m3 as a
threshold to discriminate polluted / non-polluted time steps (Table 4) and define the three indicators
as:
POD
hits
hits + misses + f alsealarms
(3)
FAR
f alsealarms
hits + f alsealarms
CSI
hits
hits + misses

4	Baseline
For the pollutant prediction problem described in formula 1, we developed two baseline models. The
first is a ReducedLSTM that captures pollutant accumulation and dissipation across sequential time
steps at a given spatial location. The second is a convolutional model with learned location-specific
kernels called WipeNet that also takes into account the transfer effect between different locations.

4.1	REDUCEDLSTM
We modify the original LSTM model (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber (1997)) to fit in the air pollutant
change prediction in the field of air quality forecasting. The modification is demonstrated below.
The original LSTM model is:
ft = σg (Wf xt + Uf ht-1 + bf)
it = σg (Wixt + Uiht-1 + bi)
ot = σg (Woxt + Uoht-1 + bo)	(6)
ct = ft ◦ ct-1 + it ◦ σh (Wcxt + Ucht-1 + bc)
ht = ot ◦ σh (ct)
We modified this formula as follow:
ft = σg (Wf xt + Uf ht-1 + bf)
it = Wixt + Uiht-1 + bi
ct = ft ◦ Relu (ct-1 + it)
ht = ct - meant
(7)
The input and output gate were removed, as suggested in Jozefowicz et al. (2015). In the above
formulas, xt represents the meteorological conditions, i.e., temperature, humidity, etc.. We regard
it, as the accumulation of air pollutants induced by adverse weather conditions like higher temper-
ature and no wind speed, and add it to ct-1 to simulate the air pollutant accumulation. We use the
forget gate to simulate the pollutant dissipation effect caused by factors like wind, rainfall, and high
humidity.
At time step t, we stored the air pollutant concentration in ct and the subtract the moving average
value which was calculated in advance to render ht , ht and ct are then fed to the next time step.
4.2	WipeNet
In the above LSTM and ReducedLSTM method, we predict the future air pollutant concentration
without considering meteorological conditions from nearby places. In the real physical environ-
ment, however, meteorological conditions, especially the flow of wind field, would impact pollutant
concentration by transporting pollutant from one place to another.
In the WipeNet model, we consider the transport of pollutants as a redistribution process over spa-
tial locations and use a locally connected convolutional operation with location-specific weights to
model this process, as shown in Figure 3.
Sepcifically, after apply ReducedLSTM to an earlier geographical pollutant map as formula 7, we
obtain bc as pollutant change on each geographic point at time step t, for clearly, we denote Cb ∈
RDh×Dw as the whole map value not cbt at every point at this time step. Here, we define Dh as the
height of pollutant map and Dw as the weight.
We feed wind field W indt into a convolutional layer, to get a redistribution kernel component
KCt , consider two wind attribute like speed and direction, W indt ∈ RDh×Dw×2 and KCt ∈
RDh×Dw ×k2, here, k is height and width of location-specific redistribution kernel.
Then we apply softmax to the channel dimension of KCt and reshape KCt into RDh×Dw ×k×k,
thus obtaining a location-specific redistribution kernel.

Finally, we apply these redistribution kernels on C to simulate atmosphere transportation effect. The
update equations of WipeNet are given in Formula 8.
Ft = σhg (Wf * Xt + Uf * Ht-I + Bf)
It = Wi * Xt + Ui * Ht-1 + Bi
Cbt = Ft ◦ Relu (Ct-1 + It )
RDt = reshape(sof tmax(Wk * Windt))
Ct = RDt * Cbt
Ht = Ct — Movingjavgt

5	Experiments
In the previous study, Liang et al. (2015) demonstrated that pollutant concentration is significantly
affected by meteorological conditions, hence we feed the meteorological condition at every time
steps as the control information. Preliminarily, we found the LSTM outperformed the ReducedL-
STM and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). We chose PM2.5 as the forecasting object of the air pol-
lutant, and selected October 5, 2016, to January 3, 2017 data, as the training dataset, and January
3, 2017, to February 2, 2017,data as the validation dataset. As there is one data point every three
hours, and we predict air pollutant concentration for 5 days, we sliced each dataset into 40 time
steps length segment, allowing overlaying segments. In total, 680(90 * 8 - 40) matrix samples in the
training dataset, and 200(30 * 8 - 40) matrix samples in the validation dataset were obtained, respec-
tively. Because the methods of LSTM and ReducedLSTM did not use the spatial relationship, we
shuffle our data on the locational dimension. For better precision, we chose the data points logged at
monitor station in the HuaBei area and got 91120(for every matrix we got 134 stations) samples for
training and 26800 samples for validation. The test dataset was set from October 5, 2015, to January
3, 2016.

We implemented all code through Keras (Chollet et al. (2015)), and chose TheanoBergstra et al.
(2011) as backend. For simplification, we trained and predicted using subtracted PM2.5 data
between two consecutive time steps. We preprocessed the meteorological condition information
through two multiple perceptron (MLP), as each dimension of MLP is 20. We set the batch size
to 32 and the dropout rate to 0.2, we ran 30 epoch with the patience option of 10. After every 10
experiments, the average value was calculated and the results are displayed in Table 5.
The results demonstrated that, without taking the meteorological condition into consideration, the
accuracy of the prediction results dramatically deteriorated. Furthermore, ReducedLSTM is im-
proved than LSTM in certain case, we assumed this is because our equation considered air pollutant
dynamics. Furthermore, ReducedLSTM is better than LSTM in certain case, because we use more
prior knowledge (eg. air pollutant dynamics) to design model than LSTM while keeping LSTM’s
advantage.
Finally, we implemented the WipeNet, with kernel size of (5, 5), and initialize weight with the
Glorot Uniform Distribution, the dataset and the other settings were left unchanged.
We could see that the WipeNet achieved best accuracy on all of our three criterion. We attributed
the progress to the integration of more information to the model, taking the transportation factor
between different areas into consideration.
6	Conclusion
In this paper, we publicized a new dataset, AirNet, for researchers who want to use deep learning
method to analyze air quality. Compared to previous studies in the field, it contains 6 indices of air
quality from 1498 monitoring stations, which is at least 40 times larger than most previous datasets.
In addition, we set up a baseline method WipeNet, for 5-day air quality prediction using AirNet
dataset, and received a CSI score of 0.56, which achieved a 16% point improvement compared to
classic LSTM methods.
6.1	Future work
In the future, we plan to add more data types into AirNet, for example, we only used ground me-
teorological data in this paper, but data from multiple heights can reveal the change of inversion
temperature layer which is a crucial factor for air quality forecast.
We wish AirNet would not only be applied to air quality forecast but also be utilized to reveal the
critical factors in the causality of air pollution. For example, if we combine land-cover data with air
pollution change, we may find some interactions between them. Perhaps we could even find new
methods to reduce air pollution and give our children a brighter future.
