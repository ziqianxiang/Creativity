Table 1: Select results from the comparative study on classification performance of true data vs.
Table 2: Details of CelebA and LSUN subsets used for the studies in Section 3.3. Here, we use aclassifier trained on true data as an annotator that let’s us infer label distribution for the synthetic,GAN-generated data. N is the size of the training set and C is the number of classes in the true andsynthetic datasets. Annotator’s accuracy refers to the accuracy of the classifier on a test set of truedata. For CelebA, we use a combination of attribute-wise binary classifiers as annotators due theirhigher accuracy compared to a single classifier trained jointly on all the four classes.
Table 3: Detailed version of the comparative study of the classification performance of true dataand GANs on the CelebA and LSUN datasets shown in Table 1, based on experiments describedin Section 3.4. Label correctness measures the agreement between default labels for the syntheticdatasets, and those predicted by the annotator, a classifier trained on the true data. Shown alongsideare the equivalent inception scores computed using labels predicted by the annotator (instead of theInception Network). Training and test accuracies for a linear model classifier on the various true andsynthetic datasets are reported. Also presented are the corresponding accuracies for a linear modeltrained on down-sampled true data (]m) and oversampled synthetic data (↑l). Test accuracy forResNets trained on these datasets is also shown (training accuracy was always 100%), though it isnoticeable that deep networks suffer from issues when trained on synthetic datasets.
