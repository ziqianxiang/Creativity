Table 1: Results on the SQuAD development set as well as TriviaQA-Wikipedia and -Web testsets for n = 300-dimensional models. TriviaQA results are further divided by distant supervisionresults (left) and human verified results (right). The model using external knowledge is trained withthe top-20/50 retrieved ConceptNet assertions. The liq-feature (lemma-in-question) is only used forthe baseline. 1Hu et al. (2017), 2Wang et al. (2017), 3Pan et al. (2017).
Table 2: Results on the SNLI as well as MultiNLI-Matched and -Mismatched for n =300-dimensional models. The model using external knowledge is trained with the top-20 retrievedConceptNet assertions. 1Chen et al. (2017b), 2Gong et al. (2017). 3Chen et al. (2017a).
Table 3: Development set results when reducing training data and embedding dimsensionality withPCA. In parenthesis we report the relative differences to the respective result directly above.
Table 4: Three examples for the antonym - synonym swapping experiment on MultiNLL P-Premise,h-hypothesis, a-assertion, a-swapped assertion.
