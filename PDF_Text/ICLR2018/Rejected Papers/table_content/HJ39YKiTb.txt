The hidden layerdimension of the textual encoder was set to 512, the hidden layer dimension of the visual encoderto 512, the dimension of the fused context vector to 1024, and the hidden layer dimension of thedecoder to 1024, the dimensionality of word embedding to 512, the dimensionality of image featureto 512, and the batch size to 64. Adagrad was used for optimization (Duchi et al., 2011).
