As shown in Fig. 3(a),the majority of the error is due to mis-classifying BG-labeled pixels. This error is possibly due to thefact that the original ground truth masks were expert generated and thus some cells were excludedeven though they have strong signal due to either being out of focus or being cut off by the edge ofthe image frame, see Fig. 3(c). Error between N+ and N- pixels could be due to algorithm error orthe effect of the N- condition is not uniform within or across cells. Indeed, future analysis may usesimilar methods to determine effect localization rather than classification.
