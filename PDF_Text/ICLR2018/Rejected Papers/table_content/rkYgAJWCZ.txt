Table 1: Average log-probabilities of new word when: the word is the current target, the new wordis not the current target but does appear in the current sentence, and the word doesnâ€™t appear in thesentence or context. (Analysis computed with 10 training sentences, patterns are similar but lesssevere with fewer sentences, see Appendix C.)In order to dig more deeply into the effects of learning the new words embedding, we conducted moredetailed analyses of the models predictions of the probability of the new word in different contexts.
