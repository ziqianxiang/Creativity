Table 1: Test accuracy and cross-entropy loss performance on the copying task with sequencelengths of T = 100. Models that use TBPTT cannot solve this task while SAB and BPTTcan both achieve optimal performance.
Table 2: Test accuracy and cross-entropy loss performance on the copying task with sequencelengths of T = 200. Different configurations of SAB all reach near optimal performance.
Table 3: Test accuracy and cross-entropy loss performance on copying task with sequence lengthsof T = 300. On these long sequences SABâ€™s performance can still be very close to optimal.
Table 4: Performance on unseen sequences of the T = 200 adding task. We note that all methodshave configurations that allow them to perform near optimally.
Table 5: Performance on unseen sequences of the T = 400 adding task. BPTT slightly outperformssab which outperforms TBPTT.
Table 6: BPC evaluation on the validation set of the character-level PTB (lower is better).
Table 7: Bit-per-character (BPC) Results on the validation and test set for Text8 (lower is better).
Table 8: Test and validation accuracy for the sequential MNIST classification task. The performanceof all methods is similar on this task.
