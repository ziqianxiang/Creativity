Table 1: Testing accuracy achieved by SGD for eahc model.
Table 2: Time(sec) required to achieve desginated testing accuracy, MNIST:98% and CIFAR-10:73%4.2	SHG performs better under big batch settingIt has been observed that increasing the batch size will hurt the convergence speed of SGD (Goyalet al., 2017; ?; You et al., 2017). Therefore, it is interesting to see the performance of second-ordermethods as we increase batch size.
