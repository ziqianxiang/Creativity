Table 1: Average and standard deviation of the percentile rank of the ReLU threshold (0 value)across neurons of a layer. The percentile rank is based on the pre-activation distributions of eachneuron. We observe that in the last layers, the position of the ReLU threshold is nearly the samefor all neurons, suggesting convergence to a very precise position in the pre-activation distribution.
