Table 1: Overall result on the WikiSQL task. Acclf , Accqm, and Accex indicate the logical form,query-match and the execution accuracy respectively.
Table 2: Break down result on the WikiSQL dataset. Seq2SQL (C-order) indicates that afterSeq2SQL generates the WHERE clause, we convert both the prediction and the ground truth intoa canonical order when being compared. Seq2set indicates that the sequence-to-set technique isemployed. +CA indicates that column attention is used. +WE indicates that the word embedding isallowed to be trained. Accagg and Accsel indicate the accuracy on the aggregator and column pre-diction accuracy on the SELECT clause, and Accwhere indicates the accuracy to generate the WHEREclause.
Table 3: Evaluation results on disordered set versus non-disordered set. Accqm, and Accex indicatethe query-match and the execution accuracy respectively.
Table 4: Overall result on the WikiSQL variant dataset.
