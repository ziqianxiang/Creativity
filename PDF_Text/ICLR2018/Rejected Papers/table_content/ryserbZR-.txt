Table 1: Classification (AUC) results for the Camelyon-16 (left) and TCGA-Lung (right)datasets for CHOWDER, WELDON, and the baseline approach. For Camelyon-16, we presenttwo scores, one for the fixed competition test split of 130 WSIs, and one for a cross-validated averageover 3 folds (CV) on the 270 training WSIs. For TCGA-Lung, we present scores as a cross-validatedaverage over 5 folds.
