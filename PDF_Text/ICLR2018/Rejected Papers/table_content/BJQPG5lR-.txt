Table 1: Architecture of varying depth employed on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. Down-sampling occurs at the beginning of block 2, 3 and 4 with a stride of two.
Table 2: Comparison of VAN networks to results of other convolutional networks on CIFAR-10 andCIFAR-100. For VAN networks we report the best value as well as the mean and standard deviationover five independent training runs (in brackets). Results are ordered by performance on CIFAR-10.
