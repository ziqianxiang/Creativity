Table 1: Comparison among three sequence encoding layers with input sequence length n, networkwidth d, kernel size k, and network depth D. Recurrent units and self-attention become slow as ngrows. When the receptive field of a dilated convolution covers the longest possible sequence n, itsoverall computation is proportional to O(logn).
Table 2: BiDAF v.s. Conv BiDAF. For timing, we only reported the GPU time. EM stands for exactmatch score.
Table 3: Comparing variants with different number of layers. EM stands for exact match score. Thescores are multiplied by 100. DrQA uses a much larger pre-trained word embedding resulting inmore parameters.
Table 4: Ablation Test. EM stands for exact match score. The scores are multiplied by 100.
Table 5: TriviaQA Performance. The scores are multiplied by 100.
