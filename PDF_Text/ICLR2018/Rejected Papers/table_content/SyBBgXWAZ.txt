Table 1: Examples of interesting sample operations which need to be adapted if we want the distri-bution of the result y to match the prior distribution. If the prior is Gaussian, our proposed matchedoperation simplifies to a proper re-scaling factor (see third column) for additive operations.
Table 2: Inception scores on LLD-icon, LSUN, CIFAR-10 and CelebA for the midpoints of variousinterpolation operations. Scores are reported as mean Â± standard deviation (relative change in %).
