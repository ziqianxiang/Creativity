Table 1: Data set statistics for CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.
Table 2: Overall experiment results. The 95% confidence interval is reported after Â± symbol. Theimprovement is calculated by comparing with baseline methods. Compression rate is calculated byhow much the regularization reduces the number of non-zero-valued parameters while having anaccuracy similar to L1 baseline. Note that when no L1/L2 regularization is imposed, dropout is stillemployed.
Table 3: Experiment results on SVHN. The improvement is calculated by comparing with baselinemethods. Note that when no L1/L2 regularization is imposed, dropout is still employed.
