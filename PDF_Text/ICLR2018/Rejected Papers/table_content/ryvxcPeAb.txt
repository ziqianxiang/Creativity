Table 3: Top-5 success rates of ensemble-based approaches. The cell (S, T) indicates the attackperformances from the ensemble S (row) against the target model T (column). For each cell: theleft is the rate of normal method, in contrast the right is the one of the noise-reduced counterpart.
Table 4: Top-1 success rates of FGSM attacks with ε = 40. Each cell (S,T) indicates the percentageof adversarial examples generated for model S evaluated on model T .
