Table 1: Geometric parameters of the imaging modelPARAMETERS	VALUEViews per rotation	720Detector resolution	736 per layerDetector pixel size	1.2858 × 1 mm2Source-center distance	595 mmSource-detector distance	1086.5 mm3.2	Imaging modelTo simulate low-dose CT scans, the images were forward projected with multi-slice fan-beam geom-etry as shown in figure 2(b). The mean photon counts out of the X-ray source for each detector unitwas set to N0 = 1000, which corresponded to an ultra low-dose scan compared to commercial CTscanners. The detected photon counts Ni were assumed following Poisson distribution with meanvalueNi = No exp(- ∕xdl),(13)where i xdl is the line integral along the ray corresponding to the ith detector unit. The projectiondata on the ith detector unit isbi = max{- log(Ni/N0), bmax},	(14)where bmax = 10 is to prevent overflow of bi when the attenuation is large. The geometric parametersof the imaging model is summarized in table 1.

Correlations between the feature maps were calculated for each channel, and the mostcorrelated and uncorrelated feature maps were presented figure 11. As observed in figure 11, themost correlated components were the structures of the images, whereas the most deviated part washigh-frequency components such as edges. The tissues in lung had much better contrast in theend-to-end network compared to that in the two-step network, which indicated that the end-to-endtraining emphasized on the lung tissue preservation.
