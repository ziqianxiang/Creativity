Table 1: Test-set error rates: P is the number of parametersWe choose three publicly available benchmark datasets for this task:â€¢	The U.S Historical Climatology Network (USHCN)2 dataset contains daily climatologicaldata from 1,218 meteorology sensors over the years from 1915 to 2000. The sequencelength is 32,507. It includes five subsets, and each has a climate variable: (1) maximumtemperature, (2) minimum temperature, (3) precipitation, (4) snowfall and (5) snow depth.
