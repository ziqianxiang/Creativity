Table 1: Quadratic function: we see that longer rollouts lead to lower validation losses and moreaccurate values for the regularization parameter Î». Not only do clipping methods achieve betterresults, they are also more stable.
Table 2: Performance on MNIST with a 4-hidden layer network (lower is better). Clipping leads tothe best results, with or without early stopping. In that case, small unrolls are the most stable.
Table 3: Performances on PTB with an LSTM (lower is better).
