Table 1: Embedding results on Cars196 and Birds200. The test set is comprised of classes on whichthe network was not trained. Our approach is compared with state-of-the-art approaches; Semi-hard(Schroff et al., 2015), LiftStruct (Song et al., 2016a), N-pairs (Sohn, 2016), Triplet/Gbl (Kumar et al.,2016), Clustering (Song et al., 2016b) and SmartMine (Kumar et al., 2017).
