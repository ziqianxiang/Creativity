Table 1: Tree edit distance for the tree tasks of tree copying (Copy), subtree reordering (Reordering),node relabeling (Relabeling) and node and subtree deletion (Deletion). The models are sequence-to-sequence (Sutskever et al., 2014) (Seq2Seq), sequence-to-sequence with attention (Bahdanau et al.,2014) (Seq2Seq-Attn), and our neural tree transducer method (NTT).
