Table 1: Landmark failure rate results on the AFLW dataset using a pre-trained ResNet18 as un-derlying network. The presented values are averaged over the last five epochs, further averagedover three tries. The first column is the train / test ratio, and the subsequent ones are the networks:single-task ResNet18 (RN-S), multi-task ResNet18 (RN) and Cross-Stitch network (CS). In all casesexcept the first one, our approach obtains the best performance.
