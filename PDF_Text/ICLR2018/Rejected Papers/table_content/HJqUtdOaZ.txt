Therefore all possible condition (namely: dimensionreduction, dimension increase, only combination of features in same dimension, linear and non-linear mapping) are considered. For each data set, classification using cross-validation is applied tentimes. Classification parameters of GA are also considered similar for all data sets to present samecondition, as shown in Table (2).Coefficient Î± is 0.2for all non-linear feature combinations. Fig.7shows typical convergence curves of error recognition rate for studied data sets.
Table 2: consider parameters for Genetic Algorithm which is same in all tests.
