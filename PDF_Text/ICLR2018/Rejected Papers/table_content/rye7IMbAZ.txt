Table 1: Characteristics of the target databases: name and type, numbers of training and test imagesper class, and number of classes.
Table 2: Average classification accuracies of L2 , L2-SP and L2-SP-Fisher on 5 different runs. Thefirst line is the reference of selective joint fine-tuning (Ge & Yu 2017) that selects 200,000 imagesfrom the source database during transfer learning.
Table 3: Performance drops on the source tasks for the fine-tuned models, with fine-tuning based onL2, L2-SP and L2-SP-Fisher regularizers. The accuracies of the pre-trained models are 76.7% and54.7% on ImageNet and Places 365 respectively.
