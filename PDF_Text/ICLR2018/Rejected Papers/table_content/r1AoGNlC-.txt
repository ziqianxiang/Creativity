Table 1: The eight commands in the BF programming language (c.f. https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck).
Table 2: Number of successes (out of 25) of synthesis methods on tuning tasks when MaximumNumber of Programs Executed (NPE) is 5M.
Table 3: Number of successes (out of 25) of synthesis methods on all tasks when the maximumnumber of programs executed (max NPE) is 20M. In each cell we report two numbers separated by aforward slash. The number of successes on training test cases is first, and the number of successes onheld-out eval test cases is second. For many task-method combinations no program was found whichsatisfies the training cases, and We mark these cells WithjUst a dash.
Table 4: Synthesized BF programs for solved tasks. All programs were discovered by the agent as-is,and no code characters were removed or altered in anyway. Notice that some programs overfit theirtasks. For example, cascade is correct only for up to length 6 (provided test cases are no longer thanthis). We highlighted in red all the tasks with code solutions that overfit, which we determined bymanual inspection.
Table 5: List of coding tasks with descriptions. For any task, a BF program takes a single list as input,and outputs a list. Unless otherwise state base B = 256, and each value can be considered as anASCII character.
