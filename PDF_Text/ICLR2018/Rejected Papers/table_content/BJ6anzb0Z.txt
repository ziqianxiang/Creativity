(This may be due to the fact that the tag Amazed issometimes used ironically.) Further, our data-driven approach suggests that our methods could beused as an alternative to the word list-based approaches to sentiment analysis common in psychol-ogy. The most widely used tool, Linguistic Inquiry Word Count (LIWC), (Pennebaker et al., 2007),consists of dozens of English words which were compiled by hand into psychologically meaningfulcategories such as “Health/illness” or “Anxiety” and used in a large number of psychology studies(Tausczik & Pennebaker, 2010). Not only does our approach automatically give sensible word lists,it contains modern words, common in social media usage, like “woke” (first attested in its modernmeaning in 1962 according to the Oxford English Dictionary which defines it as “alert to racialor social discrimination and injustice”) and “phone.” Woke appears in the top 10 of “Scared” and“Amazed” and in the top 20 of “Calm” (Appendix B), an interesting finding in its own right. Bycontrast, both woke and phone appear in LIWC, but not in any of LIWC’s emotion word categories,only in a list of verbs and a list of social words, respectively.
Table 4: Correlation between OASIS arousal/valence and principal components	OASIS valence	OASIS arousalPC1	58%	-3%-PC2	-17%	22%-PC3	30%	-∏%-7 ConclusionWe developed a novel multimodal sentiment analysis method using deep learning methods. Ourgoal was to investigate a core area of psychology, the study of emotion, using a large and novelsocial media dataset. Our approach provides new tools for the joint study of images and text onsocial media. This is important as social science researchers have begun to uncover the importantrole that images play on social media. As our dataset consisted of text, images, and emotion wordtags, we considered it to be a form of “self-reported” data, which is the gold standard in emotion.
