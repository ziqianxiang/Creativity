Table 1: Whole net classification error (%) on CIFAR10/CIFAR100/SVHN. We highlight the topthree accuracies in each column with the bold font. The three numbers in the parentheses denote thenumber of output feature maps of each block. The plus sign (+) denotes the data augmentation. Thesign (-W) means that the feature maps of layers in each branch increase as explained in the modelconfiguration section. The compared models include: Network in Network (Srivastava et al., 2015b),ALL-CNN (Springenberg et al., 2014), Deeply Supervised Net (Lee et al., 2014), Highway Network(Srivastava et al., 2015b), FractalNet (Larsson et al., 2017), ResNet (He et al., 2016a), ResNetwith Stochastic Depth (Huang et al., 2016b), Wide ResNet (Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2016), andDenseNet (Huang et al., 2016a).
Table 2: Subnet classification error (%) on CIFAR10/CIFAR100/SVHN. The numbers in thecurly brackets denote the branches used in each block.
