Table 1: Number of incorrectly classified test examples for the semi-supervised setting on permuta-tion invariant MNIST. Results are averaged over 9 seeds. Here “nF” means the number of trainingfailure, i.e., instable training, occur during the training of Improved GAN.
Table 2: Test errors on semi-supervised CIFAR-10. Results are averaged over three splits of data.
