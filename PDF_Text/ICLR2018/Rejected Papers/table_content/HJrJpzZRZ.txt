Table 1: Quantitative Results. We show Image Assessment and Motion Accuracy metrics between our methodand prior methods. We achieve higher scores on automated metrics (PSNR, MSE, SSIM) with respect tobaseline methods, and similar scores with and without the adversary. When evaluated by real human judges(AMT Fooling), we see large improvements in realism. For motion accuracy, we see large improvements in oursystem relative to baseline methods, largely due to the architectural changes. Slight improvement in motion isobserved by training with an adversary as well.
