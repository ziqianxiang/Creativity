Table 1: Comparing MultiModel to state-of-the-art (Szegedy et al., 2016; Vaswani et al., 2017).
Table 2: Comparison of the MultiModel trained jointly on 8 tasks and separately on each task.
Table 3: Results on training parsing alone, with ImageNet, and with 8 other tasks. We reportlog-perplexity, per-token accuracy, and the percentage of fully correct parse trees.
Table 4: Ablating mixture-of-experts and attention from MultiModel training.
