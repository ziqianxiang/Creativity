Table 1: All of the networks used in our experiments were instances of this meta-architecture. Theparameters w, d and l are chosen so that the total depth of each network is the same and the totalnumber of parameters is comparable.
Table 2: The average test accuracy achieved with each tandem block in five repetitions of eachexperiment. In every case both standard residual blocks Bid(2, w) and Bid(1, w) were outperformedby at least one of the more general tandem blocks. In all but one case (FAshion-MNIST, 8 layers)both of the standard residual blocks were outperformed by at least two of the more general tandemnetworks.
