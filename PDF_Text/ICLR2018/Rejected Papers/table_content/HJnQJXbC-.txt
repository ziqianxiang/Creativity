Table 1: Time to convergence to target validation accuracy. The time to convergence can be brokendown into number of epochs and the throughput (instances/s). The target accuracy is shown insideparentheses next to each dataset. mak is a short-hand for max_active_keys defined in Sec. 3;mak = 1 corresponds to synchronous training for MNIST and minimal asynchrony arising from justone in-flight instance for other models with recursive structures.
