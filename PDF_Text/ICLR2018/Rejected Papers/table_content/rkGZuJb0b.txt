Table 1: The experimental results for the different models. FC1 was the fully-connected modeland FC2 was the fully-connected model with severely reduced number of parameters in the fully-connected layers. MERA-2 and MERA-3 were MERA models with the MERA layers of internalbond dimension 2 and 3 respectively. Finally TT-3, TT-5, TT-7 were tensor train models with theinternal dimension being 3, 5 and 7.
