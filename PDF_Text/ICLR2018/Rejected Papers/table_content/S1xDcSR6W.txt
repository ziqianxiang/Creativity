Table 1: Experimental datasets. ‘Largest class’gives the fraction of the dataset composed by thelargest class and thereby provides the benchmarkfor random prediction accuracy.
Table 2: Average F1 scores across experiments. HB is HyBed, P is Poincare and D indicates aDeepwalk embedding. ‘All’ gives a global average across the five experiments.
