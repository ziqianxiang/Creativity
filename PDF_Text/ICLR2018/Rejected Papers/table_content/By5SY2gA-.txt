Table 1: Performance of proposed approaches on word similarity and outlier detection: (a) In termsof Spearman correlation coefficients for the word similarity task on 7 benchmark datasets, (b) Interms of the Outlier Position Percentage (OPP) and accuracy scores for the outlier detection task on8-8-8 dataset, The baseline model refers to the corpus only approach, with λ = 0. λ is set to 2 forall other approaches: using Valence list(+V), Arousal(+A), Dominance(+D) and average score ofvalence, arousal and dominance (+VAD). (c) and (d) provides comparison with prior work.
Table 2:	Performance of proposed approaches on sentiment prediction task: (a) In terms of Fine andBinary classification accuracies, using the Deep Averaging Network (DAN) model on the StanfordSentiment Treebank, (b) Comparison with prior work. The baseline model refers to the corpus onlyapproach, with λ = 0. λ is set to 2 for all other approaches: using Valence list(+V), Arousal(+A),Dominance(+D) and average strength(+VAD).
Table 3:	Performance of proposed approaches on affect prediction task: (a) In terms of Mean SquareError (MSE) values for affect prediction on a labeled email corpus, (b) Comparison with prior work.
Table 4: Fine grained predictions for GloVe based models on instances from Stanford SentimentTreebank(SST) dataset. “baseline” refers to the corpus only approach, +Valence refers to our base-line+Valence affect lexicon model and Bollegala et al. (2016) uses WordNet synonyms along withthe corpus. Class labels are from +2(Very positive) to -2(Very Negative).
