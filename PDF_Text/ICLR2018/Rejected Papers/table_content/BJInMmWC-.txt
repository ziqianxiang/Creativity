Table 1: ShapeWorld Accuracy Results: Accuracy on the train/validation/test sets for the four ShapeWorldtasks. Baseline results are reported as in Kuhnle & Copestake (2017). We see that the GEN improves performancefor all tasks except spatial relations. Note that encoder component of the GEN model was trained only on datafrom the MultiShape task, yet the same representations result in improved performance on the OneShape and theQuantification task.
