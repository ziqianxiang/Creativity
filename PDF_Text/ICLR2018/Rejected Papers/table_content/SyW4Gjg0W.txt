Table 1: Classification accuracy of state-of-the-art graph kernels: shortest path (SP), graphlet (GR),and Weisfeiler-Lehman subtree (WL); and the single and multichannel variants of our approach(KCNN), on the synthetic dataset.
Table 2: Summary of the 10 real-world datasets used in our experiments.
Table 3: 10-fold CV average test set classification accuracy (Â± standard deviation) of state-of-the-art graph kernels: shortest path (SP), graphlet (GR), random walk (RW), and Weisfeiler-Lehmansubtree (WL); Deep Kernels (Yanardag & Vishwanathan, 2015a) (unless specified, with the bestperforming kernel); a state-of-the-art graph CNN (PSCN k=10) (Niepert et al., 2016); and the singleand multichannel variants of our approach (KCNN); on 10 bioinformatics (top) and social network(bottom) datasets. Best performance per dataset in bold, among the variants of our Kernel CNNmethod underlined.
