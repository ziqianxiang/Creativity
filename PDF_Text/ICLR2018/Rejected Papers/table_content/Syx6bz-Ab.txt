Table 1:	Comparison between WikiSQLand existing datasets. The datasets areGeoQuery880 (Tang & Mooney, 2001),ATIS (Price, 1990), Free917 (Cai & Yates,2013), Overnight (Wang et al., 2015), WebQues-tions (Berant et al., 2013), and WikiTableQues-tions (Pasupat & Liang, 2015). “Size” denotesthe number of examples in the dataset. “LF”indicates whether it has annotated logical forms.
Table 2: Performance on WikiSQL. Both metrics are defined in Section 3.1. For Seq2SQL (no RL),the WHERE clause is supervised via teacher forcing as opposed to reinforcement learning.
Table 3: Performance on the COUNT operator.
Table 4: Examples predictions by the models on the dev split. Q denotes the natural languagequestion and G denotes the corresponding ground truth query. P, S’, and S denote, respectively, thequeries produced by the Augmented Pointer Network, Seq2SQL without reinforcement learning,Seq2SQL. We omit the FROM table part of the query for succinctness.
