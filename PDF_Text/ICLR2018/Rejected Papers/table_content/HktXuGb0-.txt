Table 1: Table comparing the different enviornments4.1	ReacherWe consider a 2-DoF robot arm in the x-y plane that has to learn to reach with the end-effector apoint target. The first arm of the robot is a rigidly linked (0, 0) point, with the second arm linkedto its edge. It has two joint values θ = (θ1, θ2), θ1 ∈ (-∞, +∞), θ2 ∈ [-π, +π] and the lengthsof arms are 0.1 and 0.11 units, respectively. The robot arm was initialized by random joint valuesat the initial step for each episode. In the following experiments, we have two settings: fixed pointtarget, and a random target. The applied continuous action values at is used to control the jointangles, such that, θ = θt - θt-1 = 0.05 at. Each action value has been clipped the range [-1, 1].
