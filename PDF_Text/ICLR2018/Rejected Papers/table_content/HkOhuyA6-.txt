Table 1: Statistics of the social network datasets used in our experiments.
Table 2: Best resolution, number of channels, and (p, q) for each dataset.
Table 3: 10-fold CV average test set classification accuracy of our proposed method compared to state-of-the-art graph kernels and graph CNN. Â± is standard deviation. Best performance per column in bold. ?indicatesstat. sign. at thep < 0.05 level (our 2D CNN vs. WL) using the Mann-Whitney U test (https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy- 0.19.0/reference/generated/scipy.stats.mannwhitneyu.html).
Table 4: Runtimes in seconds, rounded to the nearest integer. For the graph kernel baselines, time necessary topopulate the Kernel matrix (8-thread 3.4GHz CPU). For our model, time per epoch (Titan Xp GPU).
