(2015) proposed RNN and convolutional LSTM to forecast the precipitation in futuretwo hours, which they formalized as a spatio-temporal issue. The air quality forecast is similar toweather forecast, but two factors make air quality forecast more difficult and distinct from estimatingprecipitation; 1) the time span of air quality forecast is longer than weather forecast, the former oftenforecasts in four or five days, sometimes even goes beyond ten days. 2) additional influential factorsmust be considered in air quality forecast, such as the dynamics of air pollutants and the interactionwith meteorological conditions. Modeling with AirNet dataset, the difference will be explicated inSection 5 below.
