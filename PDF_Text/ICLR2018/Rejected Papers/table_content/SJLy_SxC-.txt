Table 1: Performance of various connection patterns with O(L log L) total connections. Log-DenseNet V1(LD), NEAREST (N) and EVENLY-SPACED (E) have log i shortcut connections tolayer i, and have MBD of 1 + log L, IoLLL and IogL. LD clearly outperforms N and E thanks to itslow MBD. Log-DenseNet V2 (LD2) outperforms the others, since it has about nblock /2 times totalconnections as the others. LD2 has MBD 1 + log H L .
Table 2: Performance of connection patterns with O(L2) total connections. NEAREST (N),EVENLY-SPACED (E), and NearestHalfAndLog (N+LD) connect layer i to about i/2 previouslayers. DenseNet without block compression (D) connects i to all previous i - 1 layers, and isthus about twice as expensive as the other three options. We highlight that N+LD greatly improvesover N, because the few log L additional connections greatly reduced the MBD. The MBD of N, E,N+LD, and D are log L, 2, 2, and 1.
Table 3: Performance on the CamVid semantic segmentation data-set. The column GFLOPS reportsthe computation on a 224x224 image in 1e9 FLOPS. We compare against 1 (Badrinarayanan et al.,2015), 2 (Long et al., 2015), 3(Chen et al., 2016), 4 (KUndU et al., 2016), and 5 (JegoU et al., 2017).
