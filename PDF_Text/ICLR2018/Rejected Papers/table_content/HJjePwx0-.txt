Table 1: Testing accuracy in different stages. In Track 1 we run SGD(50)→TR(100)→SGD(50),in Track 2 we change the order to TR(100)→SGD(50)→TR(50), so both tracks run 200 epochs intotal. Testing accuracy are reported by the end of each stage. For both tracks we choose batch sizeB = 2048 and CIFAR-10 dataset. As a reference, we also run Adam algorithm on small batch(B = 64).
Table 2: Testing accuracy in different stages. In Track 1 we first run 50 epochs SGD then 100epochs TR followed by 50 epochs SGD; In Track 2 we change the order to first 100 epochs TR then50 epochs SGD and end by 50 epochs TR, so both tracks run 200 epochs in total. Testing accuracyare reported by the end of each stage. Here we choose batch size B = 2048.
Table 3: Testing accuracy in different stages. In Track 1 we first run 150 epochs SGD then 300epochs TR followed by 50 epochs SGD; In Track 2 we change the order to first 300 epochs TR then50 epochs SGD and end by 150 epochs TR, so both tracks run 500 epochs in total. Testing accuracyare reported by the end of each stage. Here we choose batch size B = 1024.
