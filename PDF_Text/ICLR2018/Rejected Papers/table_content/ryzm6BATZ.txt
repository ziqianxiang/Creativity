Table 1: Models and their corresponding model distance function parameters. The l1, GMSM, andChrom parameters are their respective Î²d values from Equation 8.
Table 2: Lists the models, their discriminator mean error scores, and their standard deviations for thel1 , GMSM, and chrominance distance functions over all training epochs. Bold values show the bestscores for similar models. Double lines separate sets of similar models. Values that are both bold anditalic indicate the best scores overall, excluding models that suffered from modal collapse. Theseresults suggest that model training should be customized to emphasize the relevant components.
