Table 1: Semantic segmentation results on the PASCAL 2012 segmentation dataset and MSCOCO2015 detection dataset. We compare the same base U-Net model and fine-tuned DeepLab-ResNetusing three different up-sampling methods in decoders; namely regular deconvolution layer (DCL),the proposed input pixel deconvolutional layer (iPixelDCL) and pixel deconvolutional layer (Pix-elDCL). The pixel accuracy and mean IOU are used as performance measures.
Table 2: Training and prediction time on semantic segmentation using the PASCAL 2012 segmen-tation dataset on a Tesla K40 GPU. We compare the training time of 10 epochs and prediction timeof 2109 images for the same base U-Net model using three different methods for up-sampling in thedecoders; namely DCL, iPixelDCL, and PixelDCL.
