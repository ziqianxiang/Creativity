Table 1: MNIST holdout experiment: comparison of different novelty detection methods on theMNIST dataset. In each of the ten tests, the model was trained with the standard MNIST training set,excluding one hold-out digit. The AUROC is computed from a balanced test-set in which the ninedigits are considered nominal data and the hold-out digit is novel.
Table 2: CIFAR10 vs CIFAR100 experiment: comparison of different novelty detection methods onthe 20 CIFAR100 coarse classes. The AUROC is computed from a balanced CIFAR10 test-set as anominal data and train and test data of the CIFAR100 Coarse dasses as a novel data.
