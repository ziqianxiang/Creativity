Table 1: Comparison of top-1 accuracy between DoReFa and PACT. Weights are quantized withDoReFa scheme, whereas activations are quantized with our scheme. Note that CNNs with 4bquantization based on our scheme achieves full-precision accuracy for all the CNNs we explored.
Table 2: Validation error (in %) of CIFAR10-ResNet20 when first and last layers are quantized withdifferent bit-precision. FL/M/FL means the first and last layers are quantized with Bit-FL bits, whilethe other layers are quantized with Bit-M bits. NQ represents no quantization is applied.
Table 3: Comparison of Top-1 accuracy (in %) for AlexNet. Bold entries indicate the lowest accu-racy degradation compared to single-precision reference from each work. Baseline (full-precision)accuracy for PACT is 55.1%.
Table 4: Comparison of Top-5 accuracy (in %) for AlexNet. Bold entries indicate the lowest accu-racy degradation compared to single-precision reference from each work. Baseline (full-precision)accuracy for PACT is 77.0%.
Table 5: Comparison of Top-1 accuracy (in %) for ResNet18. Bold entries indicate the lowest accu-racy degradation compared to single-precision reference from each work. Baseline (full-precision)accuracy for PACT is 70.4%.
Table 6: Comparison of Top-5 accuracy (in %) for ResNet18. Bold entries indicate the lowest accu-racy degradation compared to single-precision reference from each work. Baseline (full-precision)accuracy for PACT is 89.6%.
Table 7: Comparison of Top-1 accuracy (in %) for ResNet50. Bold entries indicate the lowest accu-racy degradation compared to single-precision reference from each work. Baseline (full-precision)accuracy for PACT is 76.9%.
Table 8: Comparison of Top-5 accuracy (in %) for ResNet50. Bold entries indicate the lowest accu-racy degradation compared to single-precision reference from each work. Baseline (full-precision)accuracy for PACT is 93.1%.
