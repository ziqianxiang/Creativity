Table 1: Summary of CelebA attributes classification from reconstructions for VAE, ALI and the two levels ofHALI. The data row is the summary for the VGG classifier and the other scores have been normalized by it.
Table 2: Summary of statistics for CelebA attributes mean per-class balanced accuracy given in percentagepoints. # best represents the count of when a model has the best score on a single attribute. Note that it does notsum to 40 as there were ties.
Table 3: Comparison on semi-supervised learning with state-of-the-art methods on MNIST with 100 labelsinstance per class. Only methods without data augmentation are included.
Table 4: Architecture detail for HALI(unsupervised) on the Imagenet 128 and CelebA 128 Datasets.
Table 5: CelebA attributes accuracies of reconstructions by different models. The data row displays the rawaverage of positive accuracies, predicting true 1, and negative accuracies, predicting a true 0 by our VGGclassifier. Other rows show the same average accuracies where each individual accuracy is normalized by itscorresponding data score. The numbers are all percentages.
Table 6: Mean per-class balanced accuracy in percentage points of each of the 40 face attributes on CelebA.
