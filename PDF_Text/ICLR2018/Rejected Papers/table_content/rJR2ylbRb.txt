Table 1: Structural role discovery results for different synthetic graphs. (Best seen in color.) Resultsaveraged over 20 synthetically generated graphs. Dashed lines denote perturbed versions of the basicshapes (obtained by randomly adding and removing edges), node colors indicate structural roles.
