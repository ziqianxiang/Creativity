Concordantly,they exhibited high variance across multiple runs so we present the best results across 30 runs foreach algorithm. Most of the baselines were able to achieve good predictive performance for thehealthy cell population across most runs, which is to be expected since it is overrepresented inthe data set, but average and erratic performance, for pathological cells. With the exception ofRclusterpp which achieved good overall performance in the second data set, all algorithms in bothdata sets exhibited a tendency to either be sensitive (high TPR) sacrificing healthy cell predictiveaccuracy or be specific (high TNR) and sacrifice pathological cell predictive accuracy.
