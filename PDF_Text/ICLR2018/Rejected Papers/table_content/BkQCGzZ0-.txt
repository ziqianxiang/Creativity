Table 1: Log-perplexities per word of sequence models with and without autoencoders, and theirautoencoding efficiency. Results for Gumbel-Softmax heavily depend on tuning; see text for details.
Table 2: Autoencoder-augmented language models with different noise deviations. All values fromno noise (0.0) upto a deviation of 1.5 yield DSAE between 40% and 50%.
