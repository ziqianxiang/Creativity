Table 1: Examples of frameworks with similar inverse transform definition.
Table 2: Accuracy on MNIST test set for 50 labeled examples in the training. The column NL = Xgives the accuracy of the same networks trained with a X labeled samples and the remaining of thetraining set as unlabeled examples.
Table 3: Accuracy on CIFAR10 test set for 4000 labeled examples in the training. Presented re-sults include the average and standard deviation over 5 runs with random sampling of the labeledexamples among the training set.
Table 4: Accuracy on SVHN test set for 500 labeled examples in the training. Presented results in-clude the average and standard deviation over 5 runs with random sampling of the labeled examplesamong the training set.
