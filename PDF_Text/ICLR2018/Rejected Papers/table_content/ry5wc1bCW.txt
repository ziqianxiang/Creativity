Table 1: AUPRC for the cause-effect experiments. For the dataset Tueb, the weighted accuracy(Mooij et al., 2016, c.f.) is shown in parenthesis.
Table 2: CGNN MMDs of all estimated structure (rows), versus true structures (columns). The scoreof the v-structure (bold) discriminates this configuration from the chain structure and the reversev-structure.
