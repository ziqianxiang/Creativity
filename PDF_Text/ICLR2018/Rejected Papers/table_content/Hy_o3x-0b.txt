Table 2: Negative log-likelihood performance on dynamically (left) and statically (right) binarizedMNIST in nats. For the dynamically binarized MNIST results show the results for the FAME NoConcatenation that has no dependency on the input image. The evidence lower-bound is computedwith 5000 importance weighted samples L5000 (θ, φ; x).
Table 1: The convolutional layer (Conv), filter size (F), depth (K), stride (S), dense layer (Dense) anddimensionality (D) used in defining FAME for gray-scaled and natural images. The architecture isdefined such that we ensure dimensionality reduction throughout the hierarchical stochastic layers.
Table 3: Negative log-likelihood performance on CIFAR10 in bits/dim. The evidence lower-boundis computed with 1000 importance weighted samples L1000 (θ, φ; x).
Table 4: Negative log-likelihood performance on ImageNet in bits/dim. The evidence lower-boundis computed with 1000 importance weighted samples L1000 (θ, φ; x).
