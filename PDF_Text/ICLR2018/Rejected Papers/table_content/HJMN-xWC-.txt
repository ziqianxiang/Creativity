Table 1: Statistics of all the datasets.
Table 2: Hyper-parameters for the structure of FNNs.
Table 3: Comparison between BSNNs and FNNs on Tox21 challenge dataset. The structures ofFNNs are chosen by using validation data. Each experiment is run for three times.
Table 4: Comparison between BSNNs and FNNs on 5 text classification datasets. The structures ofFNNs are chosen by using validation data. Each experiment is run for three times.
Table 5: Comparison between BSNNs and BSNNs with only the backbone path. Tox21 Averagecorresponds to the result averaged over the 12 tasks in Tox21 dataset. Each experiment is run forthree times.
Table 6: AUC scores of BSNNs, BSNN-FCs and Pruned FNNs on Tox21 dataset. For each task,better result between BSNNs and BSNN-FCs is underlined, while better result between BSNNs andPrUnedFNNs is bold.
