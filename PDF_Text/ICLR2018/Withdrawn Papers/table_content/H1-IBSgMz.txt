Table 1: Self-normalization and perplexity results of the self-normalizing NCE-LM against the non-self-normalizing standard softmax LM (SM-LM). d denotes the size of the compared models (units).
Table 2: Self-normalization and perplexity results of the self-normalizing DEV-LM for differentvalues of the normalization factor α. d denotes the size of the compared models (units).
Table 3: Self-normalization and perplexity results on test sets for ‘shifted’ models with d = 650.
Table 4: Pearson’s correlation between entropy and log(Z) on samples from the validation sets.
