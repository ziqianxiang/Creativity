Table 1: We compare compositional nearest neighbors (CompNN) to the baseline CNN and differ-ent global nearest neighbor approaches, obtained by matching feature maps from different layers(Global-Bottleneck and Global-Decode2). We report mean pixel accuracy and intersection-over-union, where predicted segmentation labels are compared to ground-truth labels. We specificallyuse the embedding learned by Isola et al. (2016) for Facades-to-Labels (Facades) and CityScape,and embedding learned by Badrinarayanan et al. (2017) for CamVid. On average, CompNN per-forms 5% worse than the baseline CNN, though in some cases (CityScapes) it performs equally.
