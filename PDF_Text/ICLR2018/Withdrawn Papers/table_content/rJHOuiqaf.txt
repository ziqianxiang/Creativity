Table 1: Comparison of MINE with other bi-directional adversarial models in terms of euclideanreconstruction error, reconstruction accuracy, and ms-ssim on MNIST dataset. We used MLP bothin the generator and discriminator identical to the setting described in Salimans et al. (2016) andMLP Statistics network for this task. MINE does a decent job compared to ALI in terms of recon-structions. Though the explicit reconstruction based baselines do better than MINE in terms of tasksrelated to reconstructions, they lag behind in MS-SSIM scores.
Table 2: Comparison of MINE with other bi-directional adversarial models in terms of euclidean re-construction error, reconstruction accuracy, and MS-SSIM on CelebA faces dataset. We can see thatthe trend remains same from MNIST results. MINE achieves a substantial decrease in reconstructionerrors without compromising on better MS-SSIM score.
