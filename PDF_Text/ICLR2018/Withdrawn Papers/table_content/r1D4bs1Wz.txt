Table 1: Comparison of segmentation performance between the U-Net and the proposed DTN onthe PASCAL 2012 segmentation data set. Three different performance measures are used here. Anarrow is attached to each measure so that â†‘ denotes higher values indicate better performance, and Jdenotes lower values indicate better performance.
Table 2: Training and prediction time on the two data sets using a Tesla K40 GPU. We comparethe training time of 10,000 iterations and prediction time of 2019 (PASCAL) and 40 (SNEMI3D)images for the base U-Net model and the DTN.
