Table 1: Average relative performance with respect to a softmax classifier for classes in the head(H column) and tail (T column); the relative performance is the ratio between the class accuraciesof a competing method and a softmax classifier. The proposed method increases the performanceon classes in the tail while maintaining a comparable performance to that of a softmax classifier forclasses in the head. Bold numbers indicate the highest performance per dataset in each row.
Table 2: Classification performance improvement by using the regularizer in the proposed approachon CIFAR 10. The proposed approach with regularizer achieves a higher classification accuracythan the approach without the regularizer.
