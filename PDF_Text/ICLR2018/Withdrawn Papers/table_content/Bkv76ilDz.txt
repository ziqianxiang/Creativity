Table 1: Example of a mismatch between continuous distance and discrete distance.
Table 2: Example of a large gap between discrete and continuous distances for a discrete samplewith 9 classes.
Table 3: Example of the sample distance d(xi, xj) when xi, and xj consists of two variables whereeach can takes value from {1, 2, 3}.
