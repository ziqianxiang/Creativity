Table 1: The geolocation classification mesh can be tuned by modifying the refinement level toadjust the maximum and minimum number of cells in each mesh cell. This table shows the meshingparameters used for the three meshes studied in this work. These meshes were selected to covera reasonable range of mesh structures, with fineP meant to replicate the mesh parameters utilizedby PlaNet. However, it should be noted that this isnâ€™t direcly comparable since the fineP mesh isgenerated with both a different methodology and a different dataset.
Table 2: M2: Time-Adjusting Geolocation Model. N is the length of Pj, which takes on two values:538 (coarse mesh) and 6565 (fine mesh). All layers except the last are dense layers with 50% drop-out and batch normalization.________________________________________Layer TyPe Number Neurons Activation1	Input	N+4	ReLU2	Hidden	542*3	Sigmoid3	Hidden	542*3	ReLU4	Hidden	542*3	Sigmoid5	Output	N	Softmax1 is only strong evidence for P (Zik = 1|ti) 6= P (Zik = 1), and it could still be the case thatP (Zij = 1|Xi) = P (Zij = 1|Xj, tj). Which is to say, conditioned on the content of an imagethere could be no dePendence on time, but it seems Prudent with the evidence in this figure toProceed under the assumPtion that there is time dePendence. The oPerational research hyPothesisfor this model (M2) is that there remains a time-dePendence after conditioning on image content.

Bold indicates the best of the models devel-oped in this work. The work of Weyand et al. (2016) used 125M images for model development(91M training/34M validation) and Vo et al. (2017) is an instance retrieval based method, utilizing aPlaNet-inspired mesh-based classifier for feature extraction which was trained on 9M Flickr images.
