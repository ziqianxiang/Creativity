Table 3: Predicting the Ratings in MovieLens100k-Plus. The model using Rating information islabeled R, movie-attribute as M, user-attribute as U, moviesâ€™ title as T, and poster encoding as P.
Table 4: Predicting the Relation Arguments in YAGO-10-Plus. The model using structuredinformation is labeled S, textual description of the entities as D, dates as numerical information as N,and images of the entities as I.

Although it achieves higher results than our models (which arebased on DistMult), it primarily differs from DistMult in how it scores the triples, and thus we canalso incorporate our approach into ConvE in future.
