Table 1: Test errors using 1000, 2000, 4000 and All labeled samplesModel	1000	2000	4000	AllImproved_GAN	4.38%	4.22%	4.07%	4.06%Reg-GAN (Architecture 1)	2.43%	2.40%	2.39%	2.36%Reg-GAN (Architecture 2)	3.81%	3.58%	2.23%	2.21%The results of the experiments are depicted in Table 1. From Table 1, we can note that our proposedarchitectures outperform the Improved-GAN approach in all scenarios significantly. Our method,Reg-GAN, gives the average improvement of 42.7% and 29.7% over the traditional improved-GANapproach for the architecture 1 and 2 respectively. An example of the generated samples fromdifferent techniques is shown in Fig. 4. These samples are derived after training the networks over1000 samples.
