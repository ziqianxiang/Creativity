Table 1: Model configurations and BLEU scores on WMT-14 English-French translation task. Wecompare the baseline model with two variants of our proposed model, each with different layers andparameters.
Table 2: Model configurations and BLEU scores on WMT-14 English-German translation task. Wecompare the baseline model with two variants of our proposed model, each with different layers andparameters.
Table 3: Model configurations and ROUGE scores on Gigaword text summarization task. We buildtwo baseline models and several our proposed dense models, each with different layers and param-eters. DC means dense connection and DA means dense attention. R-1, R-2 and R-3 stand forROUGE-1, ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-L score respectively.
