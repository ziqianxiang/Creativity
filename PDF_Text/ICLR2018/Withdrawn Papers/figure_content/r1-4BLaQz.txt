Figure 1: Pairwise losses are applied to intermediate layers of the network as they are calculatedthrough pairwise comparisons of the activations at those layers.
Figure 2: Different network architecture and losses. Network A is the baseline network. NetworkB applies the fine-grained intermediate loss to the penultimate layer as well. Network C extendsNetwork B by applying the coarse-grained intermediate loss at the second-to-last layer. NetworkD extends Network B by adding a branch around the second-to-last layer, and applying the coarse-grained intermediate loss there.
Figure 3: t-SNE Visualization of the outputs of LeNet on CIFAR10(b) Clustering5Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 20183.2	Intermediate LossThe previous experiment indicates that the representations learned from end-to-end clustering donot extend beyond simple datasets. We posit that this is a result of how the clustering loss is applied.
