Figure 1: OutlineThe dynamics of the S-rRBF is as follows. Suppose the S-rRBF is trained on a data set{(Xi, Y i)}(i = 1, 2, ..., m), in which Xi ∈ Rd and Yi ∈ {1, 2, ..., C}, and d is the dimensionof the input while C is the number of classes and thus the number of output neurons.

Figure 5: Fashion MNIST(c) t-SNE5c. These figures illustrate that some of the classes are distinctively represented by well separatedclusters but there are also many overlapping classes. The internal representation of the S-rRBF inFig. 5a shows that it did not form a clearly distinctive class representations as in the previous twoexamples.
