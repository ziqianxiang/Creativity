Figure 1: A pictorial representation of structural compression. A series of convolutional layers isapproximated by a single layer.
Figure 2: For each data set, experiments are given in terms of which layer was compressed. Thefive tested experimental regimes are shown along with the baseline achieved by the uncompressednetwork in yellow.
Figure 3: The average number of epochs for each tested method to converge to within 99% of thefinal maximal accuracy value of the network.
