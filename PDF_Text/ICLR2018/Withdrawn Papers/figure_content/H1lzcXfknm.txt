Figure 1: (a) A matched anchor box and the ground truth in object detection. (b) A matched anchorbox and the ground truth in visual tracking.
Figure 2: Confidence scores and matching strategies in the top layer feature maps of ZF type RPN.
Figure 3: Qualitative evaluation of matching strategies. (a) is an early frame of first matchingstrategy, and (b) shows bounding box will get larger with time elapse. (c) and (d) show that trackersdrift quickly to abrupt motion and deformation in fourth matching strategy.
Figure 4: Training flow of compressed ZF network. We remove P ool1 & P ool2 in the compressedZF network, and adjust the stride of Conv1 from 2 to 4. Other hyper-parameters remain invariant.
Figure 5: Overall architecture of our algorithm. A fine-tuned compressed ZF network is used forfast feature extraction. Four branches contain different types of tracking loss forming ensemble.
