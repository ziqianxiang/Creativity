Figure 1: Left panel: example tuples X3 , A2 , B2 ; Middle: Hamming outer products X3 L A2,X3 L A2 L B2; Right: Hamming convolutions X3 L* A2, X3 L* A2 L* B2 and correspondingepitomes. Indices ①,②… ❶,❷... denote subsets S (1), S (2) ...S (n) in which element indicessatisfying k + (L - l) = n and k + (L - l) + (M - m) = n.
Figure 2: The hamming convolution of two banks of epitomes. Remarks: a) for the inputs A, B thenumber of epitomes Ma must be the same as the number of channels Cb ; and for the output bankMd = Mb, Cd = Ca, Ld = (La + Lb - 1). b) the notation ㊉* refers to the hamming convolutionbetween two banks of epitomes (see Definition 5 for details). The convolution of two single-layeredepitomes is treated as a special case with all Ma, Ca, Mb, Cb = 1. c) the notation U refers to thesummation of multiple epitomes of the same length, which is defined in Definition 7. d) multiple(coloured) epitomes in D correspond to different (coloured) epitomes in B; and different (shaded)channels in D correspond to different (shaded) channels of inputs in A.

Figure 8: Top to bottom: deep epitomes for first 64 filters at layers 1,2, 3 and4 ofa GHN trained withCIFAR10 classification. Pseudo colour images correspond to three channels of merged epitomesfrom the first layer filters. Left column: iteration 100; Right column: iteration 180000.
Figure 9: Hierarchical features extracted at layers 1,2,3 and 4 for a GHN trained with CIFAR10 at180000 iterations. The top-left most image in each panel is the input image, and the rest are featuresextracted with different epitomes (only first 63 features are shown for layer 4). Pseudo colour imagescorrespond to three channels of features outputs for input RGB colour channels. Note that orientededgelets (layer 1,2), textons with associated colours (layer 2,3) and rough segmentations (layer 4)are extracted from different layers.
