Figure 1: Statistics of data set. Most of the sentences are of length 0 - 600.
Figure 2: Impact of number of parameters. As Figure 3: Impact of dropout. As the keep rate in-the number of parameters increases, the marginal creases, the capacity of the model gradually in-effect of the capacity of models decreases. creases.
Figure 4: Generalization of corrupted training set. Although the training set only has a small numberof samples with correct labels, the model can generalize very well.
Figure 5: Curves of loss. (a) shows that LSTM with 512-dimension and 256-dimension hidden sizecan fit the samples of random labels completely. (b) and (c) show the training and validation lossesof the training process with random labels and early stop.
