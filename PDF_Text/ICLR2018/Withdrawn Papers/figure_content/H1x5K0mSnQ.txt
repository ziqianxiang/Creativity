Figure 1: Visualization of simplices formed during a test episode in a k-way n-shot classificationtask, where k=5 and n=3. The points with the same color correspond to the same category and clus-ter together. Within each class, k vertices form a (k - 1)-simplex (a triangle in the 2-dimensionalplane). With the same embedding function, the test sample point t is also mapped to this space.
Figure 2: Isometric embedding preserves the geometric properties of a simplex.
