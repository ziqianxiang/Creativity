Figure 3: Samples of Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) micrograph on etched structures of 4-type semiconductor wafers with measuring scale displayed at the right bottom (from left to rightrepresent Type A, B, C, D respectively), downloaded from Internet.
Figure 4: Examples of SEM images of etched structure generated using GAN.
Figure 5: Etched structure of semiconductor wafers recorded with SEM. (a): Raw image segmen-tation with ground truth; (b): Segmentation results using U-Net; (c): Measurement parameters oncritical dimension and key points. The read line is the ground truth and the blue line is the predictedboundary.
