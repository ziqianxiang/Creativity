Figure 2: Overview of the architecture that we use for computing sentence representations RS andRT for input word sequences S and T .
Figure 3: Validation loss for JMT-sent-add model shows more stability and achieves a lower valuethan the one for Sent-add model in the low-resource scenario. At every training step, the validationset is created by randomly choosing 50 sentences from the development set.
