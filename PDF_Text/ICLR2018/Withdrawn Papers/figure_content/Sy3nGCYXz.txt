Figure 1: A two-dimensional manifold with a small region where data points concentrate, alongwith a tangent plane and associated tangent directions, forming a basis that specifies the directionsof small moves one can make to stay on the manifold.
Figure 2: How to compute the estimated dimension and concatenated dimension. bi denotes theindex of i-th randomly picked feature map. 1 ≤ i ≤ k . The matrix in the bottom consists of all theA(H×W),bi,n as submatrices.
Figure 3: Cropping, Gaussian noise, rotation on an original image. We exaggerate the methods toshow the change.
Figure 4: “Drops” for fully connected layers.
