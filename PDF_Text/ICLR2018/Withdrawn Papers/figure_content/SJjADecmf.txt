Figure 1: a) The format of TCP header. Every attribute occupies a segment at a fixed position. b)A simplified version of FSM for a sender during TCP’s transmission phase. In the typical situation,the sender shuttles between the Ready and Listen state. When there is some error occurred in thedirection that data goes, the system will retreat to a previous position and resend the datum; whenthe acknowledge packet loses in the coming direction, a timeout will be triggered, and the systemwill resend the last piece of data. In practice, these states are implicitly encoded in the headers, andthe computer program has to analyze them based on TCP protocol.
Figure 2: The layout of building blocks in our solution. The arrows denote for the information flowamong blocks, and they are connected as three forward paths in (a), representing real, simulatedand unlabeled information sources colored as orange, green, and blue. The noises driven the wholeprocess is assumed to be sampled from two independent sources, Z 〜 N(0, σ2) and C 〜Cat(π).
Figure 3: the convergence of loss during the training of G (left) and C (right). The dashed linesdenote the simulation data.
