Figure 1: Illustration of the differences between the proposed spatial VAEs via low-rank MVN dis-tributions and the original VAEs. At the top is the architecture of the original VAEs where the latentz is a vector sampled from a multivariate Gaussian distribution with a diagonal covariance matrix.
Figure 2: Sample face images generated by different VAEs when trained on the CelebA dataset.
Figure 3: Sample images generated by different VAEs when trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Fromtop to bottom, the five rows are training images and images generated by the original VAEs, naivespatial VAEs, spatial VAEs via MVN distributions, spatial VAEs via low-rank MVN distributions,respectively.
