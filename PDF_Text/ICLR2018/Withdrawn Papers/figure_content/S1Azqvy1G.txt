Figure 1: The basic framework of proposed pseudo sequence based deep neural networkcompressionbe performed in the PCA domain to achieve better performance. Finally, the uniformquantization and entropy coding will be used to encode the residue blocks. As far as we cansee, the main insight of this paper is that it is the first work to involve the video coding basedtechnologies such as motion estimation and motion compensation into the neural networkcompression framework. Also, quite high compression efficiency is achieved through theproposed algorithms.

All the blocks are converted into vectors to calculate the PCA. For example,for a 7 × 7 block, the vector size is 1 × 49 and will be derived a PCA with 49 × 49 dimensions.
Figure 4: The illustration of the block based motion estimationFor the other frames, besides the intra prediction mode, an inter prediction mode is alsoperformed by searching all the previously coded blocks in the previous frames as shown inFig. 4. Such a process is very similar to the block-based motion estimation in the videocoding standard. However, since the prediction is performed in the PCA domain, we willobtain the best matching block through the motion estimation process block by block insteadof the pixel. As can be obviously seen from Fig. 4, an index is needed to be transmitted tothe decoder to indicate which block will be used to as best match. For example, if the totalnumber of blocks in the previous frame is 16, 4 bits will be used to signal which block willbe used. It should be emphasized that the larger the block size, the less number of bits willbe spent on the number of bits to signal the block index while the prediction will be lessaccurate. The best performance can be obtained by achieving the optimal trade-off betweenthe residue bits and block index bits. In the final, the difference of the current block andits best match will be coded under the inter prediction mode.
