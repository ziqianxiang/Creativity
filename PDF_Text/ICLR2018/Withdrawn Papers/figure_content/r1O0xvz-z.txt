Figure 1: 2D CNN Features on MNIST.
Figure 2: 2D CNN Features on MNIST. These 2D features are directly learned from the neural network bysetting the feature dimension as 2. Feature dimension refers to the output dimension of the fully connectedlayer before the 10-class classifiers. These 2D features are true distributions from the neural network, ratherthan generated some visualization methods. Fig. 1 is also plotted using the same method.
Figure 4: Histogram of Euclidean Error after Projecting the Adversarial InputA Illustration of Why Projection WorksHere, we draw a simple two-dimension example in Figure 4 to show that with high probability,projection does reduce the Euclidean Error caused by adversarial attack. The generating process isas follows: Fist, we uniformly sample one million points over S1. Without loss of generality, wechoose (0, 0.05) as the adversarial perturbation. After adding this to the whole sample, we projectthese adversarial examples to S1. Then we calculate the Euclidean distance between the originalpoint and its projection point as its Euclidean Error. Next, we draw the histogram of the EuclideanError. As we can see, projection seldom increases the Euclidean Error. For one million points in twodimensions, the probability of projection preserving the Error equals 0.98. This implies the functionof projection.
