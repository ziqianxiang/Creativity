Figure 1: A toy example for ADQN with an enlarged action set {L, R, LL, LR, RL, RR}. For inputs0 , we have 2 gradients, one for action L and other for action LR.
Figure 2: Results and analysis of CartPole game. Left: ADQN vs DQN on CartPole-v0; Right: Theperformed action distributions at different training stages. We divide the total 5000 episodes into 5stages, and plot the distribution at each stage.
Figure 3: Comparison of three variants of A4C against GA3C. The baseline GA3C is shown inred, Dependent Updates(DU) in blue, Independent Updates(IU) in yellow and the Switching (Sw) ingreen. Time instant where switching begins is shown by the black arrow. Note that switching timediffers with each run and we show a rough indicative switching time.
